2/27/89 23:00|Eastern border (West of, on I-70)|UT|Unknown|10 minutes|An unknown shaped object about the size of a locomotive engine moving at very high speeds without lights.  It was "hugging" the highway|9/6/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11944.html|1|ndxe198902| An unknown shaped object about the size of a locomotive engine moving at very high speeds without lights.  It was &#34;hugging&#34; the highway and only approx 200 feet off the ground.  It was westbound on I-70 in Utah west of the eastern border with Colorado at about 2300 hrs.  The object then returned a few minutes later and was eastbound in the same manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if it was only one object passing us and then returning or two seperate objects.  When the object flew over our car and down the highway ahead of us, it was almost surreal.  I wasn&#39;t sure what I had seen.  I asked my wife &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  Her reply was she wasn&#39;t sure what she had seen.  A few minutes down the road (westbound) it came back at us (eastbound).  Only about 200 feet off the ground and without any lights.  That part of Utah is mountainous and not well lit.  There was a mild snow shower occurring which also impaired clear view.  The object made no noise and there wasn&#39;t any kind of wind blast or anything that should be associated with an object of it&#39;s size and so low to the ground moving at such a speed.  If I had to say what shape I believed the object to be, I would say triangular or at least multi-angular.  Not long after that, the F117 Stealth fighter became public and I remember thinking that the shape of the object we saw could be described as similar.  But I was in the Air Force, working on the SR-71 program.  I am very familiar with U.S. aircraft and even some of the &#34;black&#34; programs being that I was in aviaton and worked on a program of secrecy.  This was not an aircraft that I then or now have been familiarized with.  When the object made it&#39;s second pass, I said to my wife &#34;Now don&#39;t tell me you didn&#39;t see it that time...&#34;  Her reply was &#34;I don&#39;t know what that was and I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&#34;  You must understand that my wife was raised in a family that was and is still very devout Christians.  Her father was a Pastor of a church most of his life and now teaches at a Chrisitan college.  I too believe that Jesus Christ is the savior of mankind.  But in conflict with or maybe just not congruent with my beliefs is this experience.  I am not ready to jump up and say that this was some sort of alien craft, all that I do know is that it was something that I cannot explain and that even with the experiences I have had in dealing with aircraft and &#34;black&#34; progra! ms, this event is still beyond my understanding.<n>

It was February 1989.  I remember the month because I had just returned from California, where I’d been living.  I was staying at my sister’s house in rural Wisconsin.  She lived near the town of Shiocton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cold clear night.  I’d gone out for a walk.  My sister lived on top of a hill, so I had an expanded view of the horizon.  It was open farm country.  There were trees behind the house but the view to the south, east, and west was unobstructed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just left the house and was walking down the driveway to the road.  I was looking up at the sky when the object appeared directly above me.  It was traveling in a straight line, north to south.  It was larger than any star or planet, but not as bright or brilliant.  It had a steady glow to it, a soft yellow.  It was silent.  There were no flashing lights like an airplane would have.  The velocity was incredible.  From the moment it came into view directly above me until it vanished over the southern horizon the time elapsed was no more than a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brief look I had at it left me with the impression that it was not quite round.  It was near enough that I was left with a memory of shape, so it was probably not more than a few thousand feet above me.  What remains vivid in memory is the soft glow of it and the stunning velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was to in the front of the house just over the oak tree tops in an opening in the tree branches that made it visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was convinced that this thing was watching me.  It was about the size if a mini van.  It was the shape of a plump M&amp;M candy.  It was inky black in appearance and would have probably gone unnoticed by me save for the lights in it. There were three white lights on its underside. They were about the size of those saucer sleds that kids use. They were not airplane lights but big and round lights. The lights curiously did not illuminate the rest of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained absolutely silent and stationary for maybe ten minutes or so.  I was terrified the moment that I saw it.  I also stood motionless the entire time of ten minutes.  All I could do was hope that this was not going to turn out to be an abduction.  I was fearfully dreading seeing those little monsters with big black almond shaped eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing at all happened to me.  I decided to start shoveling again and pretend it wasn&#39;t there. The moment that I looked away the UFO left.  I just remember looking down for a second and then looking back up there and there was no sighn of it. Then I ran somewhat toward where the thing was in order to get to the gate and then run into my house.  I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. That was all that happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My personal interpretation of this was loooong thought over and pounded through in a lot of objective consideration.  In the end and after many changes in my life and a radical transformation which began in late 1996 I came to a sound and peace filled conclusion.  If I indeed saw something that night (meaning that this was not in my mind) it was unquestionably supernatural. The thoughts that I progressivly began to consider brought more and more confusion, meaninglessness and ultimately despair into my heart.  What would the existence of alien Intelligent life mean to me?  Why would they come here?  Why me?  What does this say about humanity&#39;s origen and its inextricably linked purpose for existence and its destiny?  Is the abduction phenomenon real?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read quite a number of books about all these things.  Many different explanations were offered. The acceptance of any one of them would impact my world view tremendously and therefor my life would be conducted based on my conclusions which I was desparate for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later after putting faith in the God of the Bible and His Son, Jesus, I saw things in a new and clear light.  Mankind is actually created by an entirely supernatural God.  We were created to be his children.  This means that we are in many ways like Him.  One thing is for sure:  He is the absolutely most superior person there is.  We are created as the most phenominal and superior life form, reflecting our creator (in the image of God).  Thus, there can not be any life that is more capable or &#34;intelligent&#34; in any way comparable to Mankind.  There are however both good and evil entities called angels (messengers of God. The &#34;evil&#34; ones wish to hide and distort the truth about God and thus bring death and destruction to humanity through sin.  God conversly works through His unique and eternal God-man Son, Jesus, to intervine and save people.  Hence, the reality that there is to the UFO/abduction phenomenon can be attribed to these categories:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. Natural or explainable phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. People who are crazy to one level or another, or on drugs, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. Secret military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. Evil spirits expressing themselves through UFOs and abductors as an effective means to mislead people into believing in lies about God and mankind.  Lies like &#34;you are your own god&#34; or Atheistic evolution theories, various magical, new age, and eastern mysticism worldviews.  The list never ends because there is no reliable measuring tool for interpreting the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a believer in Jesus however, I have made it a priority to either validate or repudiate the Bible as a true book from the one creator God.  A careful search into this will reveal to anyone that the book is fully relable. Jesus can save us and also bring the universe and life into its proper context. This is liberating. &#34;If you obey my words than you are really my disciples (followers); and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.&#34; Jesus, John 8:31-32.  Have you experience truth and freedom?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
2/11/89 22:00|Chicago|IL|Other|2 hours and 15 minutes|February 1989 Roger's Park Chicago Northside 10PM -12:15AM Very Bright Lights/Bell Shape Craft|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35148.html|5|ndxe198902| February 1989 Roger&#39;s Park Chicago Northside 10PM -12:15AM Very Bright Lights/Bell Shape Craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in Roger&#39;s Park at 1339 W. Estes  Avenue 1/2 block from Sheridan Road while living in a second floor apartment with my husband at the time. It is near 10 PM at night and I (administrative assistant) am drying and putting away dishes telling my husband (graphic artist/muscian) that I just have the feeling someone is going to stop by our place tonight. We are getting ready to watch the 10 o&#39;clock news and begin to unpeg the futon couch to  make it into a bed in front of our 27&#34; floor model TV.  He comes over to my side and says, &#34;Look out the window&#34; and he takes my hand and we walk over to see what the bright light flooding the courtyard is about.  We find it very strange and I ask him, &#34;What do you think it is?&#34; He says, &#34;Do you think they are filming a movie on top of our roof?&#34; I say, &#34;It is very bright like the Kleig movie set lights...that&#39;s so silly, it&#39;s the middle of February at 10 o&#39;clock at night and why on top of our roof?!&#34; He suggest we put our coats on and go outside to check it out.  I step outside the foyer door onto the sidewalk where I can see my shadow like daylight (not full moon light) and exclaim how bright it is that I see my shadow like in daylight! We look up toward the roof and it is just so brilliantly white bright and we can not see beyond the castle cut-out like roof edge. We decide to walk out of the courtyard where the sidewalk is to see if we see movie trucks parked on the street and we do not. We decide to walk around to the west side of our building and there is no bright light there and nothing we can see three stories up on the roof. He wonders if there is a helicopter on our roof then, though we hear nothing like a helicopter. As we are walking back toward the sidewalk and down the street toward our courtyard we both stop simultaneously noticing that something feels very different  and we bounce off of each other some strange feelings...how it&#39;s 10 o&#39;clock at night and there is absolutely no busy traffic, no traffic sounds, no traffic at ! all on S heridan Road and we observe the light changing from green to red...we notice there are no &#34;double parked cars&#34; or pizza delivery cars, no one out walking, etc. It also seems strange that no one is looking out their windows noticing the bright light in our courtyard alone. It seems like time and space are at a standstill and we are the only two people left in the world! We decide to go back to the courtyard and try and look up toward the top of the roof again. I pull out some sunglasses I have in my coat pocket and put them on to see if I can see any better with them on. Next we remember going back inside the apartment on the second floor. Once inside our apartment I say to my husband, &#34;Do you think we should call the police? Or will the lights be gone by the time the police arrive  here and they&#39;ll just think we are nuts?&#34; He suggests we talk to our neighbors in the morning to see if any of them saw anything and to just wait and &#34; time&#34;  to see how long the lights continue to stay on outside. We look at an electric wall clock in our dinning room/music room that reads 10:30 PM and I say we couldn&#39;t have been out there for more than 10 minutes, how can it be 10:30 already! We both look at the VCR on top of the TV and the clock reads 12:00 midnight. We both feel that something is wrong with the time. We notice the lights are gone by 12:15 AM according to the VCR clock and the clock in the other room is stopped and stuck at 10:30 PM...it never works again.  We feel very exhausted and confused and go to bed. By morning time, we notice the VCR clock is correct in correlation with the morning tv programs. Now we both realize we could not possibly have been outside for nearly two hours when it seemed less than 10 minutes! None of our neighbors had noticed any light in the courtyard night before at all. I am very alarmed and I call my mother (LPN nurse) in Indiana saying I have something strange to tell her and she says she has something very strange to tell me about how she woke up in the middle of the night wit! h three short dark beings by her bedside all 3 wearing large different hats. She finds herself paralyzed and in terror, she closes her eyes and opens them again and they are still there. She is unable to wake my father (retired pipefitter) up. She wants to move and run and can&#39;t, she wants to scream and can&#39;t. She is reciting all the bible verses she can recall to her mind hoping  this will make them go away because she thinks they are evil and they are still there...she says she was not dreaming and they were very real to her and eventually they did go away. She is a very skeptical/logical person and is unwilling to talk of or speak of this bizarre thing to anyone else. She was very frightened and terrorfied by the experience and wonders if I could possibly have anything to do with it? I tell her the story about the lights. Over the course of a year, my husband is contiunally physcially ill and I go to the doctor with him to explain he is being mis-diagnosed and they need to find out what is the matter with him with the same symptoms I have been noticing. Seems he could have what is known as &#34;yuppie flu&#34; as he is a 60 hour a week work-a-holic...chronic fatigue syndrome...it is very controversial in the late 1980tys and his doctor decides to become more specialized and find out as much as he can to help him. By the 1990tys my husband&#39;s insurance company wants to know which he has - chronic fatigue syndrome or epstein barr virus...there is &#34;tilt-table&#34; test at St. Joseph&#39;s Hospital in Chicago and it is determined he has both in high numbers which qualifies him for disability pay, later he develops hypo-thyroid condition and fibromyalgia. He gradually recalls feeling back to the experience that he may have been &#34;ruffed up by some men&#34;  It saddens me to see him ill and I decide because I am the healthier one that I will undergo some hypnotherapy sessions to try and recall that missing time. During the sessions it is like I am re-living the experience. When I put on my sunglasses to look up on the roof toward the br! ight lig ht to see better...under hypnosis recall I find myself suddenly level with the roof top in the air and I am looking at a round bell-shaped craft with windows and an open door with pale light inside...there is brilliant bright light outside and a blue flashing light outside...it is attractive and over-whelming feelings of fun-ride over here, like excitement at an amusement park and next it is urgent, like an emergency...hospital emergency room rush over here.!I have not made it past this part in my hypnosis experience, so it&#39;s suggested that my mind/unconscious is blocking me not allowing me to see it all because I could not handle it...also I have heard of some kind of hypnosis gift or technique called &#34;rapid induction&#34; where a few dozen hypnotherapists in the U.S. are able to take their clients under very deeply, fully, walk them thru whole traumatic experience without them coming out of sesssion and able to give counsel at the end of session (such as in kidnapping/rape cases). I have not met any hypnotherapists who do such. I have come out of my sesssions feeling post traumatic stress disorder, so I had decided to stop altogether. This experience in Chicago I would say has been very life altering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.  Date of event is approximate.

The day we saw the object we were returning from a little excursion to the mall.  We parked the car in the lot below campus and then  proceeded to walk back to our dorm room.  As we were walking up the hill, I noticed this glowing light coming off South Mountain.  At first we thought it was the moon since it had a glow much like that of the full moon.  But then we noticed that it was slowly moving towards us quietly just above the trees.  We stopped and watched as it gradually made its way directly over us.  We were petrified!  The object was probably over a hundred feet long, oval shaped and glowing.  It made no sound and seemed to stop the wind from blowing as it passed overhead.  I can remember feeling warmth radiating down upon us.  Moments later it shot off at an incredible speed into the evening sky.  As it was speeding away it looked like a bright star, gradually diminishing until it completed disappeared..<n>
2/4/89 23:30|Mahogany Hammock (Everglades  Park)|FL|Disk|12 min.|Orange/gold colored glowing metallic disk, 1/4 mile away, only 50-100 ft above ground, slow moving, no sound, no navigation lights.|11/4/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25879.html|7|ndxe198902| Orange/gold colored glowing metallic disk, 1/4 mile away, only 50-100 ft above ground, slow moving, no sound, no navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHERE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mahogany Hammock, Florida has a boardwalk trail popular with hikers and bird watchers. There is a large parking area which is also very popular with local astronomers during &#39;new moon&#39; weekends. The land is flat with groups of trees being the only things sticking up here and there. (see park map at www.nps.gov/ever/map.htm) WHO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 25 people where in the Mahogany Hammock parking area during this sighting although I am not sure if only a half dozen people actually saw it. The rectangular shaped parking area&#39;s longest sides run on about east/west orientation, my wife and I were set up on the north side near center with our 12.5&#34; and 8&#34; inch telescopes. Observing conditions were clear and steady, visibility unlimited, very dark, no moon, an excellent and cool nite. Everyone was busy observing or photographing Messier or NGC objects.  The usual lone observer, mingling small groups, and muted conversations were all evident. By the way, dark adapted eyes are needed for deep-sky &#39;visual&#39; observations such as nebulae, distant galaxy clusters, etc. and no white lights were allowed. Only very dim red flashlights were seen around the area.  I should mention that deep-sky observers avoid viewing the planets since their brightness will ruin &#39;dark adaptation&#39; for a long time. If by accident anyone opens a car door and white light is seen...angry screams always follow! Dark adaptation is guarded by all. Anyway, it was one of those perfect nights you rarely get...especially on the weekend...so everyone was head down into sky charts or squinting into eyepieces on their quests to log as many objects as possible on their personal observing &#34;hit lists&#34;! I came to believe this is one reason why only a few of us saw the craft or were even interested enough to look at it! I still can&#39;t believe only a few of us said anything about it. Thankfully, my wife was there. We both saw it, and this fact has made my homelife easier as I probably would never mention it if I would have been alone. I mean people think you are crazy or something, you know, because of all the official &#39;denial&#39; going on about these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, please excuse my ramble, but it does point out the irony that this happened to people who know the sky and know what is up there! WHAT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The details as I remember them. Sometime around midnite I heard a man&#39;s voice to the west of me say, &#34;There&#39;s something flying over there!&#34;  So I looked about due west and also saw this bright object hovering just over the trees about a 1/2 mile away. It may have actually came up out of the trees we don&#39;t know for sure. At first glance it was bright with orangish/goldish color. At second glance, a few seconds later, there were no navigation lights, no strobe lights, no sound! It was a glowing disk and it wasn&#39;t flying in the sense of &#39;aerodynamic&#39; flight. As a former private pilot I am aware of the factors of flight: when lift and thrust overcome weight and drag anything will fly. Also, the FAA regulations require red (left) and green (right) nav lights on the wingtips and white strobes and all aircraft. This disk was a &#39;craft&#39; but it was not flying. Floating along through our atmosphere in spite of gravity is a better description (than flying). As an amateur astronomer, I can tell you this was not Venus, not Jupiter, not the Moon and not swamp gas. It was a low level sighting of a craft that was moving about 10 mph. We observed it for about 12 minutes or so until the trees obscured it as it slowly disappeared to the south of us in the direction of Flamingo, FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should mention that it changed direction twice. I first saw it above the trees to our west. It was heading east, at us. Then it slowly headed ESE just missing us to the south of our position and only about 1/4 mile or less away. This was our best view as it remained just above the nearby treeline for the length of the parking lot. I quickly lowered my telescope enough to catch a glimpse, but the focuser didn&#39;t move enough to focus clearly at this short distance and the guide scope was a Telrad which has no magnification. However, we could easily see, with just our eyes, that the basic shape was a slightly domed disc looking about twice as wide as it was high. It had its own colorful luminosity yet it was metallic looking, sleek and strangely beautiful I thought. My guess at the time was 30 feet diameter craft and about 16 feet high with the domed part being on top.   We were on the north side of the parking area and so we had the best angle of view over the trees to the south. This may also explain why the people in the other parts of the parking area didn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t see it. As I am writing this, I am thinking this may be the biggest reason why not everyone saw it. Also, it is interesting that being among many astronomers that nobody, including myself, hollered out for everyone to &#39;check this thing out&#39;...fear of ridicule probably..or disbelief at what we were looking at... who knows why!  So, by the time it was passing close along the treeline in front of us, I knew this was no airplane, no blimp, no balloon. Oddly, at the same time, there was a small private plane flying (I flew Cessnas) a few miles away to our right and we could hear its engine and see the navigation lights and strobe but the disk shaped craft that was gliding by us was much closer and was not making a sound! Eventually, the disk turned south and went out of my sight. It somewhat paralleled the park road that leads past West Lake and then to Flamingo, FL. My last view of it was when I was standing on the bumper of my van and stre! tching t o see it go behind the distant treeline several miles away. It was at a very low level at that time also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TIME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feb 1989 PS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is funny but we never thought or talked about this sighting for many years. No special reason why. It&#39;s just that...you know...you have to get up the next day and go to work, and put the kids through college and all that. So it goes into the back of your mind for later recall if needed. Since then, but only recently, I have been reading up on the UFO topic. When I heard an interview with Travis Walton and Mike Rodgers, it hit me that the description of the craft they saw in 1975 sounds identical to what we saw in 1989 and I just wanted to put it in writing. I realize that this is an old sighting but I just wanted to add my two cents and say, &#34;I know they are out there!&#34;, period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, and keep up the good work.<n>

Off in the distance I saw an object moving in a very strange way. It was moving up then down very fast then it would move to the left then the right.I had never seen any of our aircrafts shaped like this or move like this. I watched it for about 5 minutes, it was still there when I proceeded to go on to my mothers.She lived about a mile away.She came out and got in the car, we proceeded to go to the store.I backed out and went to the stop sign by her house and there was the object up close now flying very slow over the buildings and trees.The object was very large about the size of a football field, it was mettallic in color, it made no sound, it had no windows or lights, it was between being oval shaped and mushroom shaped.This craft flew so slow it was almost hovering. Now the strangest thing about this! object is coming from the bottom center it had a black tube looking object coming from it about half the size of the craft.Now while I watched this craft I had the strange feeling that it was hunting for something. I watched it until it went out of sight, or as if it blended into the enviroment.I will always remember that day, it will always be very clear in my mind.And then the very next night I went over again to take my mother to the store, we go to the stop sign again, it is around 10;00 pm and there flying at an average speed was many bright white lights flying scattered all over the sky making no sound. When we got home we were watching the news and the castors were talking about the strange lights flying over Andrews Airforce base, and making jokes about them being ufos flying over the base. Now when I saw this craft it was around 11;00 am in the daytime on a gray cloudless day, there were no leaves on the trees,and I saw this craft up close, and I watched it for at! least 10;00minutes. I just want this on record somewhere what! I saw t hat day. I sure will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
