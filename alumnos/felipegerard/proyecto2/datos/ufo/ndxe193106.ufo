They did not tell anyone for 20 or more years because they did not want anyone to think they were crazy.  My grandparents were both college educated, my grandfather was a dentist and my grandmother was active in civic and church affairs.  Neither were prone to being &#34;fanciful&#34;...both children of homesteading parents who had worked their way to actually graduate from college.  My grandfather was active in Masons and church activities, and my grandmother was a founding member of the local Daughters of American Revolution and also in church activities (the local Methodist church).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were driving from Abilene to Salina and were on US 40 near the local pump station, known as Sand Springs (this building still exists today).  The only information that I was told my mother was that their car engine stopped, their watches stopped (they had to reset them when they arrived in Salina.)  The watches were approximately 30 minutes slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A silver-ish disc like object came down in front of their car and hovered there. They did not speak, too stunned by the event.  From their standpoint, it hovered for only a few moments and then zipped off into the sky.  However, they always wondered what had actually happened because of the time difference with their watches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is all the information that I know.  Anyone else they might have told is now deceased.  However, I was raised with the philosophy that we really can&#39;t discount the possibility of other beings in the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have requested more information about the event, although all the witnesses are no longer living.  PD))<n>
