It didnt move, no sound either. A light in each corner. I felt fear come over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing i know is that im 15-20 feet away near the fence, i climbed through and ran into the house. Locked the door. Went to bed.<n>

It was around 9:00pm and the sky was pretty clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the corner of my right eye up on the sky I spotted some lights. At first because the lights were so bright, I thought it was some kind of fireworks, but the lights never disolved. Instead the object moved silently from north to south. My building where I lived is 14 stories tall, and the object seemed it was about triple the height of the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large object had about 9 lights, 5 in the front almost in a octigon shape and the about 4 lights tailing it.  All the lights moved as if the object was one. I got the impression it was one object. I was amazed, something that large, that close didn&#39;t make any noise what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen blimps in the past, and you could hear them.  This was no blimp. Also, a few months later, I saw on TV a home video that someone took showing  the same craft I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and e-address deleted))  Bronx, NY<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of event is approximate.

Their coloration was silver and they moved silently across the sky. It was hard to determine height, but one could say about 20,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear blue skys and temperatures in the low 70s. Though this area is a valid flight path for airplanes going into Kennedy, La Guardia, Farmingdale and Islip airports; this sighting was certainly not airplanes, baloons or objects of that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The first evening Bob ******* &amp; me where sitting around the camp fire when he said &#34;whats that?&#34;, &amp; looking up in the night sky. I looked in the direction he was looking at &amp; in the sky was a bright light way up, so far up that it looked like a star. This light was amazing! The light would streak across the sky &amp; appear to go many miles(40-80 miles?) in a flash &amp; stop on a dime &amp; change at a 90 degree angle &amp; zoom another long distance,stop on a dime again, change direction again &amp; do the same thing again. Some times it would pause a few minutes before doing the zigging &amp; zagging. It went on so long that I stopped looking up to give my neck a rest. But Bob kept on watching till it finally left. We were looking towards the northwestern part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I wondered onto the field itself and was generally looking around when i noticed three lights in the sky heading roughly in my direction i thought it strange that they was not flashing strobe lights as you would find on all commercial aircraft,and to add to it their was no sound either, which did strike me as very strange, i kept watching this what looked triangle shape judging by the three lights, at each end,as it flew over my head approx: 300ft up. The three lights were colured red, blue, green.they stayed on without any flashing at all, i remember looking around the field area to see if anybody else was watching but they wasnt anybody around,I will always remember that it was totally silent, as it moved away, turned sharply then the three coloured lights just dissappered, i tried looking for them to reappear, but could see nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 1984 is approximate.

It was Monday evening, near 11pm, all but one other camp site had folded up and left for home. The night was clear with no moon. The object came from NW travelling SE at a very slow rate of speed (estimate 40 to 70 MPH). Too slow to remain airborn. The shape was triangular (at the time I was calling it Delta Wing Shape). It was approx. 1000 to 2500 ft above us. The triangular shape was decerned by the stars it block out. There were circular white lights emmitting from the bottom of the craft.The craft appeared to be HUGE, over 200 feet. It was eerily silent. The remarkable thing was how it made these occasional sporadic quick moves, as it darted left or right, like a kit being jerked by string. No human could have withstood the movements without being severe damage to body or brain. We watched the craft until it dissapeard over the mountain. It never changed altitude. We asked people in Grey Eagle the next day about it, thinking everyone would be talking about it. No one saw it. After packing up and coming home we thought about it for a day or two. Then thought someone should be notified. Called the USAF. They weren&#39;t interested, told us to file a report with the Sherrif if we wanted. Now, we were starting to feel foolish, but called the Plumas county Sherrif anyway. I was hoping he would tell me he had many reports. He didn&#39;t have any, but was kind enough to take the report without ridiculing me. I am now 56 years old, a loan officer at a major bank. Was in the military with a secret security clearanced. Worked with helicopters and spent two years at a missle site.<n>

I was studying physics for three years and a half and I know well the southern sky, where I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was my only sighting in my life and I never talked about it with anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to report this sighting, because I found your site seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the sky with my small telescope with a 100-fold increase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night they were visible to the west, Mars, Jupiter and the Moon (Half Moon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11 hours PM a little below the moon, a red object appeared, almost as bright as Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly pointed my telescope at the object and was amazed at what I saw. A huge hexagonal object with a jet red below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was black, but you could see your way, because it was illuminated by sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Your speed was relatively slow and I could perfectly accompany him using the levers of the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes following the object, it has exactly opposite the Moon, which gave me a reference to then calculate its size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Follow the object for about one hour, and from a certain point I no longer needed to move the telescope. At that point I was looking at the object underneath. That was approximately in the region of Formalhaut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jet of energy emitted by this object was very different from anything I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. It looked like a mix of &#34;flaring&#34; with laser light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the following Monday I called the astronomical observatory of Campinas, and did not give me much attention.  They asked me to describe the sighting eto in the end I say, &#34;What you saw was a weather balloon.&#34;  Honestly, I know a balloon.  Do not release balloons burst of energy, not hexagonal and not fly out of the atmosphere (so that the object was illuminated by sunlight).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then calculate the size of the object with the data I had on hand, I could calculate the minimum size of this object, and was surprised to reach the size of 17km (11 miles) from side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like you to get in touch with me and guide me on how best to publicize this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry for my english,<n>

It was very odd ...... we didnt see the spacecraft but we HEARD it CLEARLY ..... the mechanical noise whirring past us ....... it was really a different kind of experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were amazed and then curiosity got the best of us and we decided to follow it or go look for it.   We drove a little way down a country road and then decided we were IDIOTS .... for what would we do if we FOUND it?   We got scared and returned to his office where he worked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was rather a peculiar thing.

There were approx 150 people in the park and perhaps another 150 outside the park or on nearby beaches. It is a popular area. My friend and I observed a metalic object coming straight towards us from accross the bay. It appeared to be about 50 feet across, and it was disc shaped. We assumed from it&#39;s relative slow speed, size, and lack of sound, it was probably the Fuji ballon craft, or something like it. There was a very bright light on the bottom of the craft. It was just beginning to get dark in the area and this was the only moving object in the area. It hovered directly overhead, about 50 feet off the ground, and somehow we knew it was not a balloon craft. It was shaped wrong and it was too metallic. There were no jets or propellers. I joking told my room mate, it was probably &#34;swamp gas&#34;. He wasn&#39;t laughing. We were scared and the hair was sticking up on my neck. I looked around and it seemed like everyone was watching this thing. I saw no portholes, anteneas, or any protrusions at all. As it got darker, the light seemed brighter and stronger. It was like a floodlight, but it did not have a directed &#34;beam&#34; of light. It was just bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hovering 25 minutes or so, it began ascending and moving away from us in an upwards arc. It suddenly rapidly accellerated and was out of sight in seconds. I have seem anything that could accellerate that fast. It was like zero to 1000 MPH in about 2 seconds. It started moving north and curved around to accellerate to the south and almost straight up. The next day, we looked in the paper to see if anyone reported it, but it was not in the paper. In fact nobody wanted to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Richard Everett 608 Monterey Circle San Marcos, Ca. 92069<n>

My dad never wanted to be late so we left a little after 7pm to make sure we made it there in plenty of time.  Our house is on a small hill near the end of our block.  It was twilight to dark.  As we left the house and started walking down the front steps down to our car – we saw this black object floating just barely above the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was enormous and hardly moving.  It spanned from one end of our block to the other end.  I don’t know how long our block is but the object was more than the length of our block and there are 6 three story colonial houses between our house and the end of the block and the object was long enough to cover them all.  It was wide covering houses on both sides of the street.  The object was also tall or thick (maybe one story or more thick) and not aerodynamic at all.  There is no way that should be flying.  It was so large that we could never see the far side of it.  We really only could ever see 2 sides of it so it could be a rectangle or a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked down the steps and into the middle of our street and stood directly underneath it.  It was very close nearly touching the tree tops (large oak trees in our neighborhood).  It was a matte black and blocked out the sky from our view because it was so massive.  It had lights on the underside -some large, some small, but the lights were dull and not bright.  I can’t remember where the lights were but know some were different colors.  The side of the object had a window like opening which had dim lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With an object flying so close, it should have been loud but this object didn’t make a sound but you could sort of feel it in your chest.  Even blimps make sounds but this object just didn’t make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood directly underneath it for several minutes looking up and then it slowly drifted up the side street next to our house.  It went from moving straight ahead to moving at a 90 degree angle without turning.  We kept walking with it up the side street while it was directly overhead.  It was gliding so slowly that it was easy to keep walking with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could have kept walking with it but my dad said that he didn’t want to be late for the concert and we had to go.  In the end, we watched the object for about 15 minutes.  I didn’t want to go but we did.  When we got into the car, I asked my dad what it was and he said that he didn’t know and didn’t want us to talk about it ever again.  I tried to bring it up several times and he made it clear that we were to never discuss it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years went by without talking about it– when my dad was dying I asked him about it and he couldn’t remember it happened.  I thought maybe it was all in my mind so a few years after my dad died I asked my mom if she remembered and she did.  This made me both relieved and uneasy.  We’ve talked about it several times since then.  My father was a physician, my mother is a nurse.  I am a medical researcher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I wasn’t afraid while we were watching the object (it was oddly peaceful), those moments seeing it have haunted me almost every day since.  I’ve been uneasy sleeping at my house since that initial night and have had to sleep with a light on only when I’m there.  Every time I felt the slightest low hum, I rushed to my bedroom window to see if it is there. I’ve since moved away but my mom still lives there.
