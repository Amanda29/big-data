The Object rises beyond a neighboring house to the South. After hovering for five min&#39;s, the object moves Eastward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of Tuesday, January 28th, 1973, A double tiered &#34;Windowed&#34; Saucer shaped craft is observed from my bedroom window. It was first seen rising above the rooftop of the neighboring houses to the South. I dashed to the window for a better view, because I never saw anything like this before, and I never saw anything like it since. As the craft hovered over my back patio I took note of the windows  being a Bright yellow to an amber. Some were an &#34;Iced Tea&#34; color. The dome atop of the saucer, which was the first thing I noticed, was a dull pale white.  Two illuminated shafts of light accompanied the dome. The bottom side of the craft was completely dark with the exception of two lights (bluish-white in color) that went around in a circle. (Clockwise from my point of view.) Then after hovering for about five minutes, the craft begins to move towards the East, flying along at its low altitude of roughly a hundred feet give or take, then vanishes from view.<n>

The craft was at a very high altitude and no noise was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both laying on the ground on our backs in the snow.  I saw the object and did not say anything.  As the object moved off my friend than said to me &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  I said ya what was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both didn&#39;t know but concluded it was moving too fast to be an aircraft.  We were both aircraft entusiasts built alot of model airplanes and lived near the Wilkes Barre Scranton airport so we felt we had enough knowledge to make that conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved extremely fast, not totally unblievable speed but alot faster than any jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I grow older I think back on that night and with the increased knowledge I feel the object may have been the SR-71.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  It&#39;s unlikely that an SR-71 could be seen, but not heard.  They are very loud, particularly at the high power settings which are necessary for that aircraft to achieve high speed.  PD))<n>

Never Reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 15 years old at the time. My two younger brothers and I were viewing stars with a new telescope we had received as a Christmas gift a month before. My mother worked late at night ,as she was divorced, and was due to return home soon. We were up on the roof and decided to go back in the house so as not to be caught out so late at night. We packed up our equiptment and started heading down when we were startled by a very large &#34;cigar&#34; shaped metalic craft hovering about 100 yards away from us. (The craft appeared to be cigar-shaped but could have been a disc seen side-ways.) The craft looked like it was made of un-painted metal with no markings of any kind. It actually looked like a medium sized submarine hovering in the sky with no wings, fins or propellars. It had redish and blue-green lights that went on and off in rotating motion. What startled us most about it is that it was completely silent; made no noise except for a faint metalic clanging noise. My youngest brother began to cry. It moved along slowly at about 3-5 miles per hour for several minutes and then shot straight up into space and disappeared in a split second (Speed was definately more than 100 miles per hour!). I remembered looking at my watch and it was 2:30AM when we first sighted the object. The event seemed to last only 3-5 minutes, but when it was over, I looked at my watch again and it was 4:00AM. To this day I&#39;m not sure whether we experienced lost time or whether the object caused my watch to move ahead. Every night after that, we ventured back up on the roof of our house to try to see the object again. On the second night after that, (which would be the 12th), as we were climbing the house to the roof-top, we saw two V-formations of about 6 or 7 objects in each formation shoot from horizon to horizon in what can only be described as &#34;a blink of an eye&#34;. They were traveling at such a tremendous speed we could not make out their shape or exact number. We alll cried out, &#34;Woww!! Did you see that??!!&#34; These sightings were never! reported because we felt no one would believe a bunch of kids. I am 41 years old now, but have never seen another UFO since that time.<n>

I arrived home about 20 minutes later, and woke my parents and told them what I had seen. If my memory serves me, the sighting was reported by others and on the local news the next day. I did not report the sighting at the time.<n>
