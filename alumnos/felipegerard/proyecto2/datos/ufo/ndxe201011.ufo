A little faster then a normal plane, but then it slowed down very quickly and was moving so slow(almost as if not moving). I took out my phone to take a picture but then it pulsed and like made slight duplicate image overlapping. Then it just was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped the car and tried to figure out what object was. The object was stationary or headed straight towards me. it was in my best judgement either behind or above the southern end of Estrella mountain. torwards and slightly north the town of Maricopa. The object had no anti collision lights whereas i could see other aircraft in the sky flashing their anti collision lights. It eas immense and I tried to figure out if it was a blimp or maybe a hot air ballon that was actually closer than I though it was. I stopped the car and tried to take pictures with my Nikon S3000 however it was very difficult to get the settings right in the failing light.  I watched the object hover until I had to report to work (about 15 min).<n>
11/30/10 18:00|Menifee|CA|Triangle|12 minutes|Huge black Triangle shape, all lit up,bright white lights, flying very low,slow speed and constant low humming sound|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79115.html|3|ndxe201011| Huge black Triangle shape, all lit up,bright white lights, flying very low,slow speed and constant low humming sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning from the grocery store on Tuesday November 30, 2010 around 5:15 p.m. and saw what seemed to be a shooting star north by the mountains in front of me, however it was too low for that so I thought maybe it was a meteor shower. I drove home and unpacked and starting doing my homework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Menifee CA and yes there are a lot of military helicopters out here and they usually do there runs by our house a few times a week lately it has been a lot more. I heard the chopper outside and something compelled me to go out and look. I went outside in my backyard and at this time it is about 6:00 p.m. I looked up and to the right heard and saw the chopper and then turned around to my left ( south ) and out of nowhere comes this huge black triangle shaped object. All lit up on all sides with white bright lights actually looked like one solid light all around, but after viewing the pictures it is hundreds of lights. It was making a constant low humming sound and was real low and moving slow. It was about 3 to 4 times bigger than my house!  At first I thought it might be stealth but living in AZ for 12 years in the past I have seen and heard stealth’s and they are loud. So I thought maybe this thing is the Aurora, but then I thought why would the military bring this out at rush hour traffic and dinner time?  It went right over me and kept on moving north down to all my neighbors houses. The chopper was at first in front of it about a half a mile just watching it then moved sort of beside it. Then they went in a circular motion and I just couldn’t believe how big this thing was and all lit up! I ran in the house and grabbed my camera I was able to take 2 pictures of it from the back side. Then it just kept moving further away, again at a slow steady pace. I have never seen anything like this at this close range. I am still a little freaked out but I think something is going to happen and they are here to protect us or warn us, I think we are going to war again real soon. They just shot the missile off from the sea last week here and yes I saw that too! I was driving home and saw the missile bright light coming down. Anyway I didn’t want to call the TV stations or anything because I think it would get dismissed as a military weapon of some sort but I don’t think it was military at! all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My self and my cousin was standing by a three way moving spot light, at this time we looked up; we saw a double edged triangular air craft with multiple lights along the edges, the color of the lights looked regular color of a light, there was a few red lights on it but i cant remember their location on the craft.  The craft was about 100 ft over this business and it was at 12 am so it was a pitch black night, the air craft made no noise at all.  I tried to take a picture of it while it was there for the three or four minutes but was unsuccessful.<n>

Then when I laid down to go back to sleep I was staring at the night sky. I saw what really shocked me! A flying light ball going straight across my neighbors yard into mine very very low and very fast. I saw this very same thing last year but the ball was bigger and orange in color and had fire behind it and was too low to be a comet and changed direction as well. This time it was a very small white light ball and had a white jet stream following it. It was a tiny ball of light very very bright and it appeared out of no where right after an airplane took off on the north runway. I was facing South West towards LAX. The small light ball was flying north right across my yard just above the high line wires just like the one last year. TOO LOW FOR A FALLING STAR! The sky was very clear and the whole thing was only a few seconds maybe o! nly 2 or 3. Too fast to film. I am now very concerned because I woke up this morning and there were so many Chemtrails! On November 13th I also saw in the middle of the day a huge aircraft like an aircraft carrier with 6 silver disks flying in formation like a convoy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a picture of the plane but the disks did not show up. Something very strange is going on here over by LAX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve never seen a UFO but I&#39;ve read about the recent sightings. What I saw was not a plane, I was driving west towards wellington, it was just getting dark outside. The time was 6:00 p.m. I saw a plane go by since the airport is only 8 miles away from where I was currently at. Then I noticed what I thought was a plane at first, but it was too low to be a plane. I only saw it move once and it moved up a little higher and moved back down to its original spot and just stayed there, I drove a little closer and it was not a light from a tower. It glowed a very bright white color, looked like a star. It was so bright that after looking at it for awhile it looked liked it formed a star and would go back to a smaller size taking form of a circle. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this, I tried to take a pic its kind of fuzzy since I took it at a stop light. I was alone in my car so I dont know if the other cars witnessed! it. I am the type of person that pays attention to every little detail and I just happend to notice this light since it was so close to the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m the type of person that doesnt believe it till I see it, and I definately saw something that stumped me. I&#39;ve looked up videos and pictures of weather balloons too see if thats what it might be and this looked nothing like a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/28/10 23:30|Goodrich|MI|Unknown|5 minutes|Strobing Craft in Goodrich|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79197.html|9|ndxe201011| Strobing Craft in Goodrich<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a sister report for another one from Michigan. The other report is listed for this same date in the city of Troy, MI. Despite being the same date, this is an entirely different siting, occurring just a matter of hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before 11:30pm I was traveling southbound on M15 between the towns of Goodrich and Ortonville. This area is lightly populated with farms and wooded lots covering most of the land. There is not a lot of ambient light in the area, and the sky can often be seen quite clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was quite overcast at the time and a solid cloud ceiling was sitting relatively low in the atmosphere. I was traveling around 45mph and  crested a low hill. As I did so a small community (sub-division) of houses came up on the right. From the road one could see out to the west, over the tops of the houses to the tree line beyond them. This tree line was approximately 1/4 mile away from where I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the sub-division approached on my right, I glanced out to the west, over the afore-mentioned tree line. It was then that I noticed the second odd object of this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what then appeared to be a pair of small strobe lights, much like the type that one could purchase in a toy store for home use. These lights were flying very low above the tree line, in the same direction i was going. The &#34;craft&#34; was moving in a very swift and almost fluttering manner. These lights looked quite small, and seemed to be just inches apart. These strobe lights were pulsing very fast, as if the home type of strobe light were turned all of the way up. Instead of being white, these lights had a blue cast. At no point did i hear any noise from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately turned into the sub-division and sped to the back of the houses. I reached the back of the sub-division and grabbed my binoculars. I then jumped from my vehicle and ran to the back yard of a home. These actions took a matter of seconds. From this backyard a huge swamp-valley stretched away for miles, visibility was uninterrupted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise the light was now an incredible distance away, much further than any plane would be. It was still very low, below the clouds. I was able to ascertain that the object had actually stopped moving. It was stopped below the clouds, hovering in the glow of a distant city. From what I could tell, the craft was just sitting over the center of a far off small town. I later determined this city to be Clarkston, several miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked through my binoculars and focused on the object. Through the binoculars the light actually looked like a single thin, long light, like a bar of light. It was clearly quite blue and still strobing very quickly. I could not see any detail of the craft to which this light source was connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two minutes I saw the object move away, continuing on it&#39;s original southerly course. It vanished over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this evening I was witness to two somewhat dramatic sightings only hours apart. I cannot determine if they are related, though they were in relatively close proximity to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As stated in the other report, I am a student holding multiple degrees. Before this night I have not seen anything I could classify as a &#34;UFO&#34;. I am quite sane and not influenced by drugs or alcohol.<n>
11/28/10 22:59|Sacramento|CA|Oval|45 seconds|Oval Pattern of Lights Observed Traveling Low Over Sacramento, CA|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79076.html|10|ndxe201011| Oval Pattern of Lights Observed Traveling Low Over Sacramento, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> An aircraft was just observed over the City of Sacramento,California(in the dark)carrying at least eight steady lights of different colors configured in two equally spaced rows suggesting an oval shape elongated along the horizontal axis.  Other lights were seen to randomly blink within the pattern of the aforementioned  eight steady lights or to blink in an unobserved pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft made no noise,unlike the helicopters and fixed wing aircraft often seen over this city.  It was traveling in a strait line at similar speeds to local conventional aircraft noted at this relatively low altitude (approximately 500 feet) and was passing due west over 51st Street between J and M Streets toward the state capitol.<n>

It flew about 200 feet over the ground.  It was night time but because it was so close to the ground I had a great view of it.  The color appeared to be grey it had two airplane tails on the back. Just like a plane has one tail on the end of  it this had two.  It also had a 2 extreamelly bright lights on the front they appeared to be in a circle form.  I could see this object from several minutes away.  A bright light glared in my room i looked out the window and I thought i have not seen a plane this bright so i kept watching it and about 3 minutes later it came verry close flying right above my house.  It had an awkard sound almost like a plane but allitle different. My main question is, are there any planes with 2 verry bright headlights?<n>
11/28/10 22:00|Anaheim|CA|Triangle|20 seconds|Low flying, triangular shaped, series of dimly lit orange lights|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79079.html|12|ndxe201011| Low flying, triangular shaped, series of dimly lit orange lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Six (6) dimly lit, orange lights in the formation of a triangle made up the object. Three (3) lights making up the outer corners of the triangle were accompanied by three (3) more lights, making a smaller triangle in the middle of the first. (Refer to the corners of a &#34;triforce&#34; to better grasp this concept.) It appeared that all the lights were connected to the same craft, as opposed to the lights being their each individual entities, because as the object moved through the sky, the lights remained equidistant to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> he rest of the craft, aside from the lights, was a dense dark shade of black. The only way it was possible to make out the shape of the craft, was seeing how it blocked out the stars as it passed through the sky. Besides that, the craft was relatively invisible in contrast with the black sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew through the area quite low, such as if you were in the proximity of an airport with the planes flying over you to land. The biggest shock of all, when comparing this object to a low flying aircraft, was the absolute absence of any and all noise. No engine noise, no sonic boom. The craft moved in pure silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed through the sky heading heading Westbound. We first saw the object in the horizon of the Eastern sky, towards Yorba Linda.  We watched it come straight towards us, and just as it had nearly reached our location, it began to alter it&#39;s course. It bent to it&#39;s ride side and headed North-West towards Fullerton.  The time it took for it to get from the Eastern horizon, across the sky, and out of sight to the North-West was about 20 seconds.<n>

I guess is was able to see for 20 seconds.  After that it disappeared after a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had this shape:  . . .   . . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The down right side was the front. It flew like the arrows points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very strange way of flying I think.  Or it had to be a formation with 8 objects.  But then no one made a other move than the route they where flying. (In human formation you always have to correct your way of flying to stay at the group.  This wasn’t with this object.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The night was clear and I could see the stars. I was standing there and noticed a craft appear near Port Columbus International Airport. I thought it was a plane taking off from its location due to the low altitude of the craft. I thought nothing of it and just put it off. I then watched the craft make a complete circle around the perimeter of my location, and thought it was flying awfully low among the tree lines. As the craft approached my location I moved up the driveway to catch a better glimps. As the craft moves overhead I was directly underneith and could see the shape of a triangle with white lights at each point and a blinking red light in the middle of the craft. It not emit any type of sound or engine roar. The craft seemed &#39;&#39;wobbly&#39;&#39; and was headed in an Westbound direction. The craft was less then 1,000 feet. I could see a defined triangle shape of the craft. It was! completly silent. I had seen other aircraft near the vacinity and they did emit loud sound, they were obviously planes going to and fro the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/28/10 18:30|Troy|MI|Triangle|5 minutes|Unusual Triangular Craft|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79077.html|15|ndxe201011| Unusual Triangular Craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though I have read the reports on this website on many occasions, I have never (prior to this day) seen an unexplainable object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 28th at about 630pm I was driving in the left lane of i75 northbound between Troy and Bloomfield Hills, Mi. The sky was heavily overcast and dark. The heavy clouds were semi-illuminated by the plentiful sub-urban lighting in the area. The freeway was quite busy in both directions. I was approaching the &#34;Adams&#34; Rd. exit when I noticed an odd pair of white lights above the trees to the east of the freeway. At the moment these lights looked rather like car headlights, if these could be in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they might be lights atop a new communications tower or something. Over the next 45 seconds I closed in on the lights, and it became clear that they were certainly unusual. As I neared I realized that these lights were not from a tower, and i thought that a small plane might be flying quite low. However, it quickly became apparent that the object was hovering in the air without moving. Further, it lacked typical beacon or strobe lights found on aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly glanced around and noticed that I was somehow the only person that was noticing this object.. despite the fact that it was hovering in plain sight only slightly to the right of the freeway and about 50 feet above the near trees. It was extremely apparent. At this time I quickly moved to the slow lane and off onto the right shoulder, placing myself almost under the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up to it, I saw the shape clearly against the dim sky. It was an obtuse triangle with a somewhat bright white light at each point. The &#34;wide&#34; point of the triangle was pointed north, in the direction I was headed. The two other points of the triangle pointed east and west. The craft had a non-reflective black surface that demonstrated no surface details or reflections. The edges of the craft were clearly defined against the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I had no camera with me. I did have binoculars but in the moment I did not think to use them. I began to move out onto the freeway, continuing north. As i pulled out i looked out at the craft, it seemed to have turned as I could now only see two lights. It was still in the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked forward and accelerated. Just them a bright &#34;flash&#34; of light shone through the glass of my sunroof, moving east to west over me. I looked out my driver-side window in the apparent direction of the light and saw nothing moving. However, through the clouds to the near-west, I then saw a series of four quick &#34;flashes&#34; of light, like narrow pulses from above the cloud. These flashes were white in color. I quickly turned to look where the craft was and it was now gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued onward to my destination. I saw no more of this craft for the rest of my trip. However, I did see a second &#34;object&#34; later in the evening, while driving south on my return trip to Detroit. This object seemed quite different, and I will write a sister report for this one. It was seen in Goodrich, MI. and will be reported from that city, on the same date. It astonishes me, however, that while never seeing such a thing my entire life I now see two &#34;UFOs&#34; in the same evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, my sister has described to me two similar sightings in the past several weeks. These were seen in the same general region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am presently a student of psychology, working toward a PhD. I possess degrees in photography and liberal arts. I have excellent eyesight and was not using drugs or alcohol. I welcome contact on this if needed.<n>

We were driving at night and been sky-watching for sometime. My gf noticed a three lights in a triangle moving over us, it was at a constant speed, at the same altitude planes fly. At first I thought it was a plane due to it&#39;s constant speed, but it didn&#39;t have any colored lights a plane has, they were all orange/incandescent , in the shape of an equalateral triagnle of 1cmx1cm1xcm. It looked exactly like a triangle UFO light sightings we viewed on on the internet over the years. One light was blinking. It moved constantly and rotated as well, keeping it&#39;s shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must have been moving very fast,  and made no sound as it moved away it became one dot. I was awed and when it stopped I realized this is no aircraft we know of. It paused for at least a minute, then moved last, it must have been moving km&#39;s a second, and moved about 10cm&#39;s left in the skyline. It paused again, and then moved right about 20cm&#39;s, then disappeared towards townsville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other witnesses (well people who came out of their house nearby) and they were on heir phones looking at the same thing.<n>

The object caught my eye because it was too big to be a plane, the shape was different and the lighting was solid. The shape was blimp like, but the shape was almost like a domed serving platter. THe light was white like a star coloring, not overly bright though. The object first appeared to be hovering and then it was moving off towards the West (I think). I was trying to drive and keep the object in my view. I did stop and try to get a better look, but then the trees blocked my sight. It was also moving away from me and getting smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I lost site, I got back on Salem Road and turned onto Brown Bridge Road heading towards Mcdonough. I caught site of the object again but it was moving away and the trees were blocking my view. I tried to keep up with it and eventually lost it completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember feeling like I could not be the only one seeing this. I thought about it just being a blimp, but the time and the look did not make me believe it was anything short of abnormal. After arriving home, I searched the skies without any luck. I immediately searched the internet to see if anyone had reported seeing it. I know that I saw something other than an ordinary aircraft<n>

11/27/10 23:30|Ocean City|MD|Triangle|01min|UFO over Ocean City, Maryland|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79592.html|21|ndxe201011| UFO over Ocean City, Maryland<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I had just returned from the Clarion and were staying at the Carousel on 118th street in Ocean City, Md.  It was around an estimated 1130pm, November 27th, 2010 and we were out on the balcony.  Our room was on the 2nd level, oceanfront, so we were about 50yds from the coastline.  She was reclining on one of the balcony chairs and I stated, &#34;Hey baby, baby.  What is that?&#34;   When i noticed it, the object was directly perpendicular to me traveling in a southern direction 40-50yds above the coastline, probably 30 or 40yds from my deck.  I estimate the speed of the unidentified object to be around 25-30mph.  It was dark and very quiet that night and there was not a sound to be heard besides a very ominous silence.  Perhaps a humming or a feeling of something actually being there was what made me look to the sky.  What i saw was a silouette of a triangular craft with about 9 afterburners on the underside.  Four or five on the left definetly, four or five on! the right that were harder to make out because of the difficult angle which really gives a better visual as to how close this craft really was to my position, and 1 afterburner in the lead on this craft which was heading south along the coastline.  These lights were very odd in that they didn&#39;t glow bright like any typical vertical afterburner or exhaust nor did they burn like any conventional horizontal exhaust type aircraft.  These lights maintained a steady maroon/deep dull red glow that almost blended in with the nightscape.  I watched it travel at least 75 yds before it disappeared and during this event there was still no evidence of any type of lights.  I spent 4yrs on an aircraft carrier so I know personally that when an aircraft flys along a coast with no port or starboard lights, no running lights, and no sound whatsoever at such a low altitude, then it must be unidentified.  I challenge anyone to give a flight log of anyone flying the coast that night between the hours of 11pm and 1am that night.<n>

We watched as they flew from the South to the North.  One by one three of the four objects dimmed until we could only see one.  We lost sight of the fourth object the further North it moved, due to houses and trees blocking.  They seemed to be moving very rapidly...too fast to be a typical plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second sighting, last sighting, with same people was 9/19/10.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I see it much more visibly this time, since I was looking right at it.  Both times it was headed a North-Eastern direction.  It would light up, white-ish, with a white-ish shadow around it and immediately go out about 5 seconds later...It was travelling at a VERY fast speed and it made no sound what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each time it went by it seemed like the dogs were going crazy, no wind at all.<n>

I slowed down to watch it as it flew about, vanishing and reappearing before my eyes two or three times.  It was about a yard wide, and wasn’t very far from the ground, perhaps 30 or 40 feet.  On one side the lights were red and white, and on the other they were blue and purple. The UFO would flip over in a spinning motion, showing that it was flat when it did so, and revealing the colors on the other side.  It flipped consistently and very gracefully, moving unlike anything the two witnesses have ever seen on earth. It flew in circles above the street, flipping and spinning, until it darted too low to see, about 10 minutes after I had come upon it.  It was very pretty to watch, and seemed unlike anything on Earth.<n>
11/26/10 21:30|Tallulah|LA|Formation|12-15 seconds|Night time sighting.  Two reddish/brown discs passed directly overhead at amazingly low altitude.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109275.html|28|ndxe201011| Night time sighting.  Two reddish/brown discs passed directly overhead at amazingly low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The discs (2) were traveling from north to due south, one directly in-line behind the other.  Estimate distance between them to be approximately 30 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both were moving at approximately 80 to 90 knots (I was recently a pilot-in- training, and held a classified job in the DoN as a Government Contractor working high level security for the U.S. Navy/Marine Corps).  I estimate the disks to be at approximately 600 feet in elevation above ground level, and approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  Could clearly see lines in the skin of the discs.  Each was dark reddish-brown in color, possibly black. The lines appeared to be &#34;panels&#34; of some sort.  The bright orange halide lights from the Elementary School&#39;s parking lot (across the street) were clearly reflecting off the underside of the discs.  They produced no internal or external lighting.  Estimate craft to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  They were totally silent as they passed directly over me that evening.  The sky was clear, there was no discernable wind, and no moon was present at time of the sighting.  The whole siting lasted approximately 12 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note: this was about the same time as the Minden, Louisiana, UFO crash which occurred approximately 70 miles to the north-northeast of Tallulah, Louisiana).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was but one of many UFO/anomalous activities that I have come to witness over the past 10 years.

11/26/10 21:30|Tumacacori|AZ|Formation|15'|More Amber Lights and Lines of Amber Lights Seen In and Around Tumacacori & Rio Rico AZ|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79058.html|29|ndxe201011| More Amber Lights and Lines of Amber Lights Seen In and Around Tumacacori &amp; Rio Rico AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:30 pm, MST, on Nov. 26, 2010, I was outside with the dogs, about 3 miles due east of the Tumacacori Mission in Southern AZ, at elevation about 3650’.  Weather was clear, the wind was still, and the moon not yet up.  I noticed a very bright, stationary yellow-white light low over the Santa Rita Mountains, probably about twice as bright as Venus at its brightest, but a bit larger.  It was at 25 degrees (about NNE) from my position, and appeared to be a few miles north of Mount Hopkins (elevation 8900’), but clearly above the horizon defined by the jagged mountain range.  I would estimate the altitude of the light at about 8-10 thousand feet.   The light dimmed quickly within 20 seconds of my going outside, and disappeared.   About 10 minutes later, the light reappeared for about 30 seconds, then dimmed within a few seconds and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking around the sky after I initially saw the light over the Santa Ritas, I noted two separate fixed dots of bright amber light to the SW, very low to the ground (less than 300 feet above the terrain, which is rolling) if not nearly on the ground.  Each was of similar size and brightness as the light over the Santa Ritas.  There are no lights so bright, nor of that color, in that direction normally.   I could not readily discern a shape other than roundish.  They were less than 4 miles away, as they blocked out the lights from cars on I-19 from my view.  I estimate that the two amber lights must have been a quarter of a mile to a half mile from one another, using the light spread across a nearby residential area to judge the distance.   After a minute or so of watching these lights, I saw them slowly dim, over a minute or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second appearance of the light over the Santa Ritas, and its disappearance, I looked back to the SW, and saw a line of at least 5 bright amber lights, between here and Rio Rico Villas 14 (about 1.5 miles away to the SW), but just to the south of both.  The lights were not as bright nor as big as the two amber lights I witnessed just a few minutes before, but still startlingly bright for the area.  They were still extremely low to the ground. I could see them moving in a perfect, unwavering horizonal line, apparently heading northward, and without changing altitude despite going across rolling terrain.  The line of lights moved relatively slowly, probably under 50 mph (judging from how fast the freeway traffic in the far distance moved).  I heard no noise (I can hear the UPS truck or a noisy pickup truck a mile away, and large trucks on the freeway 3.5 miles away, as this is a quiet area, and in a valley).  I saw no other color lights, nor any sign of headlights.  I! watched them for about 10 seconds.  At this point I went inside (at about 9:45 pm MST).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are some enclaves/military reservations to the north of the Santa Rita Mountains, near Green Valley, that might explain the light that appeared (from my vantage point) over the Santa Ritas.  However, there are no military lands closeby to the West and Southwest  (between here and the freeway).  This latter area is a barely developed but platted and roaded rural residential area.  A mile or so past it in the same direction lies the Coronado National Forest and mountain ranges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no helicopter lights near the Santa Ritas tonight, and that is odd.  Usually, there are one or two stationary over that range and/or to the south of that range.  This is the borderlands, and I presume some Federal Agency (military, INS, or DEA) has the helicopters in place.  The presumptive helicopters appear small and dim, the size and brightness of a run of the mill star, but an occasional red flash gives them away, as well as their eventual movement out of position in a manner consistent with how a helicopter moves.  Have spotted the helicopters nightly for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of my cordless phones did not work/could not get a dialtone when I tried to call in my observation at the time of the sighting.  On average, I have trouble with my landline that is not attributable to a widespread outage on less than one day each year.  I called in on my cell phone which functioned normally.   When I tried my two cordless phones again about 15&#39; later, both worked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that on Sept. 23, 2010, I filed a report regarding a more extensive and lengthy sighting, in the same general region.   Until that night I had never seen anything unusual in the sky, despite spending at least 20 minutes outside on most nights.  Local TV stations received a flood of calls about the event in the Tucson Metro area on Sept. 23, especially from the South and West sides of town, but no one else filed a report.  On that night, there were very clear conditions as well, and no wind either.  Furthermore, on both nights (Sept. 23td and tonight) lights appeared at one location, followed by the appearance of lights at a second distinct location, and then again, as if some sort of back and forth signaling or communication is going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer is a retired research scientist.<n>
11/26/10 21:26|Bridgeton|MO|Light|a while|green circular light in the sky that was going around and around in circles|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79053.html|30|ndxe201011| My son went outside to take the dog out.  There was a green circular light in the sky that was going around and around in circles.  I have seen lights in the sky for promotional use during Halloween, but usually you can see the beam of light go from the ground into the sky.  All we could see was the circular shaped light with no beam as it went in circles.  This could very well be an advertisement since it is Black Friday or maybe someones Christmas decoration, but we just thought it was weird and wondered what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The objects were more than 1000 ft. high but lower than a passenger aircraft would fly at cruising altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were a deep red color. There were more than 12, and I counted at least 16.  They did not appear to be moving in a particular formation and some were slightly higher than others.  The objects did not flicker but did appear brighter on the leading edges of the objects.  They were not perfectly circular. There was no noise and no other aircraft observed in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I recall, the winds were calm and sky was clear.  The sun had set, but it was still twilight. The objects continued toward the NNE and disappeared out of sight after approximately 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen so-called Chinese lanterns before, but these were very unusual, as they appeared to be brighter on the &#39;leading&#39; edges.  I doubt these would have been flares since it was a holiday weekend and there are no nearby military bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take photos, and the quality isn&#39;t great, but one can discern the color and shape of the objects.  Several other family members also observed but we could not conclude what we had seen.<n>

I was alone and driving on highway 101 between Orick CA and Klamath CA.  Between Orick and Klamath on Highways 101 it turns into a freeway and you start to go up the mountain and once you get to the top you can see the mountins around you.  I noticed a very bright light towards my right side.  I stopped and tried to take a picture with my cell phone but it did not turn out very good.  The light was super bright and lit up the top of the mountain it was on.  I could tell you that it looked like a flood light that is used to light slides on roads.  There are logging roads which are locked off to go over in that direction.  I could not tell if there was a road over on the top of the mountain where the light came from but I did find it strange that there would be such a bright light on a Thanksgiving night on the top of a mountain in the middle of no where.  There were other cars on the road and I ! know they also would have seen it since it was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Most people take movies if they take anything at all. Some think it is the best way to keep from being a hoax…although those too have proved a lot of time to be fake. I have put my Nikon 300 camera with a 20-200 telephoto lens on a tripod and used a cable cord for shutter release. I’ve put the ASA on 1600 and cranked it even to 3500.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen stationary lights…flashing strobe lights,.. bright flashing or blinking lights, ..flickering lights…and three nights ago actually saw a craft for a split second. One light came on, ..then another next to it and continued like that in a zooming fashion from one end to the other and then stayed unlashing for split second and then simply disappeared. It was so fast I couldn’t count the number of lights but I would say 15-20! It looks like what I have many still shots of in my photos. The images in the photos were picked up by my camera and I did not see the images themselves until looking at what had been taken…They come out about the size of a pin head on the camera but I can crop in to ‘bring them up a bit on the camera. Sometimes they will enlarge to only the size of a small fingernail.. other times to the size of a thumb nail.. and then every once in a while it will fill the whole screen of the back of the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friends of mine in the area saw my shots and recently they were up at midnight and went outside to see all kinds of colored blinking lights. The shots they got with their point and shoot camera were very strange too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got four different sightings last year and at least ten this year…seven just in the past week. There might have been many more times but I freaked out and didn’t look so I wouldn’t see more. Then something happened in broad day light Oct.31 this year and I began watching again. I have photographed five tiny lights moving all over the sky and the some darting off one direction ,one another and one stayed …then 2- three came back.When I cropped them they looked like a gol darn kids amusement park! They had images of a ‘dolls shoe’ with antennas out the front …and other equally strange images…  I have gotten things that to me remind me of a Roman coin(why I think that I don’t know) and in the past week I’ve gotten a ‘lot’ of them. I saw a triangle in the sky and showed thee lights.. the other night I saw a triangle of lights but it had three lights on the sides and along the back, with a red one on the one corner. When I enlarged the photo after I got them made, the lights are round with a ?antenna/ or protrusion out front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE MOST RECENT ARE OF ACTUAL ‘AIRPLANE’ TYPE THINGS BUT ARE BARS WITH LIGHTS…One has a top and bottom bar with the lights in between. I was out there for an hour taking the ‘blinking’ lights and at first thought it was a four second exposure maybe catching the line of blinks. However I saw only a white flash and the bars of light have maybe a single white light then a red, then three white, and a red and maybe two white…the pattern doesn’t hold true. Then the other night I realized it wasn’t a four second delay to take the picture…it was ‘there was nothing to take in the dark night sky but the second it flashed the camera went off. That was discovered when I SAW the craft the one time for  split second and it matches some of my photos. There must have been 7-10 to12 objects those nights and they were different. I have pictures of them all. (Good pictures)Right now I still have some of the disc/coin ones on my camera…and a few round  dimensional balls)  I have contacted people but the local paper put in the first one last year and I don’t know if they are spooked to do any more or think I can’t be seeing this much and am a kook. People around this area have seen these for at least six years and don’t know what it is ,..try to explain it with logic ..think it’s our government stuff…or are too afraid to tell anyone. (I have an appointment with the local guy of investigation and home land security Monday to put to rest that our government doesn’t have stuff going on but with the images and so many going in different directions at the same time and the weird shapes etc…it’s NOT ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve been very frustrated because either no one will pay any attention as 3-   to it being real, or the government has ‘hushed them up’. I sent photos to the Bristle Tn. T.V. station and they replied back they had no idea what it is..and they would check…I’ve heard nothing!!! (Someone else I know said they had contacted the Johnson City t.v. station years ago about the lights in this same area and they did do a segment…The guy that did it got fired shortly afterward ..they don’t know if it was from covering that or not.)  Tonight I was laying in bed and the thought of looking up ‘UFO reporting’  on the computer came to my head. Last year I had a local Mufon guy out when the first sighting  hit the newspaper but if it’s not a ‘triangle’ or ‘little green men’. .they aren’t interest.  Guess UFO’s have to fit ‘their’ thinking rather than the fact that there are plenty others out there…‘I’ can attest to that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With what I’ve been picturing and seeing I know why Our planes who have chased ‘strange crafts’ can’t catch them. It’s NOT that the crafts are faster than ours as much as it is that they can disappear within a shield. I’ve seen it.I’ve also seen the ‘coins/crafts/discs ???? at different stages and know how they are formed. I know this is unbelievable but truth is stranger than fiction…besides,.. who would make up such far fetched stuff if it was a hoax they want someone to ‘believe’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO’S are ‘hidden in plain sight’…They have the people to thank for not being discovered. With people faking stuff, ..causing a hoax and non believers who try to rationalize it, the UFO’S are free to reign unbothered. ..but are they aliens from ‘outer space’ or another country with things invading us in our space ??? Either one, people put their heads in the sand and won’t get serious to find out…..if they don’t admit it it doesn’t exist! Some day it might be too late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally am ‘not’ into UFO’S. However I am into photography and when I see something strange that might need to be photographed and checked out as to it’s source, I will take it.<n>

I was pointing the camera towards the NE about 45 degrees up when I caught the two disk shape UFO moving very, very fast from West to East. The UFOS were near the San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park area about 2000 to 3000 feet high. Without knowing their size, it would be difficult to judge the actual altitude. My home is under the SF bay approach for jets landing at the SF International Airport. I heard no sound from the UFOs and that is strange because it looked like they were moving much faster than the speed of sound and there was no sonic boom.  There has been a lot of  different UFO shapes that I have seen this year over SF. I was lucky to catch a lot of videos also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I do not know the size or altitude of this UFO. If it did make a noise, I did not hear it because I think it was too far away. I also saw and videotaped 2 other different UFO shapes on this night.

Near around what I presume to be 8:00 p.m. on 11-24-10 driving home in a blizzard in the Chippewa National Forest I saw a flaming fireball in the sky.  At first it was distant and flickering.  And as it got closer it looked like a flame, not a sharp acute flame but more like a candle.  This had what seemed to be a spherical shell around it, like a translucent halo. It moved in a very slow almost ballon type way. I had to stop my vehicle on the side of the road and watch it.  It came down to what seemed to be very close, but there was no way of judging size, because it was night, and a blizzard making visabilty poor as well.  But I know what I saw was not a civilian aircraft, it had no directional lights of any kind, and the conditions were so poor the Emergency Helicopter base was shut down for the night.  When I shut the vehicle off and rolled down the windows, I heard no sound, it actually floated over toward me, (or what I pr! esume was toward me it was hard to tell), in this odd bobbing fashion.  It then gained altitude slowly and disapeared into the snow filled, North-Western night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/23/10 16:55|Albany (3 hrs W of; on I-90 near Exit 44)|NY|Other|30-45 seconds|Gun metal black crescent with 6 window-glowing lights.|4/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108146.html|50|ndxe201011| Gun metal black crescent with 6 window-glowing lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was two days before Thanksgiving and I was returning home for the holidays.  My mother was driving and I was sitting behind the passenger seat which was empty.  My little brother was sitting behind the driver&#39;s seat.  We were on the interstate 90 in New York state and we driving home, which was 3 hours away driving east towards Albany, NY.  Although it was around the fall, it was still day light outside.  The sun was lower in the sky but not near the horizon yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When sitting in my seat, I was looking out the rear passenger window.  Then I decided to turn around in my seat and look out the back window.  When I looked out the back window I saw what looked like to be a big fancy building.  At least that was my first perception.  But when I looked at the bottom of it, I noticed it was hovering right over this farm area on the I-90 in the air.  It was at the height of a tall building that you would see in New York City.  This object was about 3/4 of a football field away from me while I was in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a crescent-shaped object that was the width of about 20 airplanes.  When you see airplanes in the sky they look small.  Now imagine 20 airplanes flying wing tip to wing tip. It was that wide, so wide that I could look under it and count the other three lights that were on the other side of this craft.  It was gun metal black and six curved lights on it.  They lights almost looked like windows but there was a glow in the air surrounding these window-looking lights.  There was also a &#34;black rectangular shaped intricate engine-y object&#34; that connected to the middle of the inside of this black metal looking crescent.  The middle of this rectangle had a curved gate the bordered around the middle of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there and watched this from the back window and the back driver side window.  When I was watching this it just disappeared out of the blue.  It just blinked out the sky, it did not leave any trail, nothing. I did not see it appear, just seen it disappear.  It was too huge to just up and disappear like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember talking to a math professor at my school about my sighting and he said that maybe it could have been a mirage but that mirages were not common in that weather condition during Autumn in November.  That day it was cold, no rain, just a little windy Autumn day.  The sky was a little gloomy, not sunny at all but not dark outside either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I saw an object, I was freaked out and at first I didn&#39;t want to believe what I had seen.  When it disappeared, I just turned around in my seat and sat there silent for 5 minutes in shock.  When I turned back around to check to see if I could see it again, it was gone.    When I got home, I took notes in my iPod about what I had seen and came to realization about it.<n>

It was similar to a laser pointer being moved around. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be multiple &#34;stars&#34; and they maintained vertical distance and consistent speed. It was far too slow for a shooting star and far smaller than a typical aircraft light signature. They were not in a straight line. They were consistent in their movement and near the cloud line (at times appeared to be just below, than in the clouds than just slightly in the clouds). As a pilot, I would say they had the same altitude. They were not fast moving, but I can not really estimate how quickly they moved. I have no explanation, but contact AFRCC and they advised me to contact you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is my description of a series of events that began in 1997, ceased for over a decade, and resumed just a few months ago in Sept. 2010.  I&#39;ve hesitated to report these events previously but do so now in the hopes that others like me will find the courage to break their silence and to share their experiences.  A staggering number of individuals have reported the same phenomena elsewhere online, and many have posted incredible footage on Youtube of what I&#39;m about to describe.  Although I have not filmed the phenomena myself (yet), I can attest that the footage posted by users such as SeeingUFOsPA, Alienphotog, and Purvashadastar are true to what I&#39;ve witnessed myself.  I do not personally know these users, and I cite their videos only as further evidence of my witness testimony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s a synopsis of my experiences. I&#39;ve intentionally excluded certain details that I&#39;d be willing to discuss confidentially with MUFON investigators but do not wish to disclose in this forum or to third parties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are the basics:   It began on a late July evening in 1997 in Northumberland Co, PA, when I peered out my open window on an overcast night, as I often did, and looked skyward.  I recall the time was about 1:00 a.m. In a period of time that spanned no more than one second at most, I saw an anomalous light strobe three times at three different points in the sky and disappear.  I felt certain that it was one light that had moved to three different points in the sky and had strobed three times at each point, rather than three different lights that strobed in succession, probably because the points were somewhat close to each other instead of at opposite sides of the sky. I estimated the altitude of the light to be no more than that of a low-flying, small plane, although it could have been much closer than that. In any case, I was practicing a religion at the time, I did not believe in extraterrestrials, and I was also an avid sky-watcher who had never witnessed anything like this, so this anomalous event knocked me for a loop and scared me terribly!  Although it seems humorous in retrospect, I recall that I slept with the light on and with religious objects near my bed (and with my window closed) for several subsequent nights. I pushed the event to the farthest corners of my mind, although it never quite escaped my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirteen years passed, my belief systems changed greatly during that time, and I had opened myself to the likelihood of abundant, advanced intelligent life in this universe and countless other universes. Probably due to my 1997 experience, my interest was piqued when I read reviews of the recently released book by journalist Leslie Kean titled, &#34;UFOs.&#34; I bought the book and finished it in September 2010. It fascinated me, and I began to familiarize myself with the works and writings of various schools of thought on the subject, major researchers, groups, contactees, etc., trying to distinguish the real from the fake. I truly believe that this &#34;primed&#34; me for what happened next. That is, I think that the whole reason for my most recent sightings is that I had grown in awareness enough to be able to absorb and process the experiences. I&#39;m getting ahead of my story here, but suffice it to say that these events are purposeful and often interactive. Consciousness is key.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back to my account:  One evening in the last week of September 2010 in Northumberland Co., I was out for a walk/jog, which is routine for me in the warm months. At the time, sundown was somewhere between 7 and 7:30 p.m. I was walking/jogging toward the beautiful sunset, thinking about extraterrestrials, the books and literature I had just read, etc. Very few clouds were in the sky. All of a sudden, I noticed an incredibly bright light in sunset. Too bright to be a star, as it shone with such a magnitude that it was not obscured by the brilliant sun. Plus, it appeared to be emanating from within the Earth&#39;s atmosphere at about the altitude of a small plane. The light was a peach color, like the color of the sunset. It was stationary. I laughed at myself, because I was caught off-guard by this light after just finishing the UFO book and reading all about UFOs. I figured that my imagination was running away with me, and I chided myself, thinking that I had mistaken the reflection of the sun gleamin! g off a plane, or the headlight of an approaching plane, for an anomalous light. The fact was, though, that this light remained stationary for at least the 15 minutes that I walked/jogged in its direction, except for a few times when it moved slightly to the right or slightly to the left. It also faded in and out--faded to a pinprick, then it would suddenly reappear and pulse brightly, then fade out, disappear, reappear, etc. Again, there were no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite all this, I convinced myself that it was nothing that couldn&#39;t be explained, and I didn&#39;t think anything further of it . . . until my next walk/jog a few days later, when it appeared again at the exact same place in the sky while I was thinking about UFOs. Again, it faded in and out (not rhythmically--just randomly), moved here and there a bit, but just generally hovered. It was close enough to me that I would have seen a craft/shape if it were an ultralight, glider, plane, certainly a balloon, parachuter, kite, etc. On this second occasion, I paid closer attention and &#34;knew&#34; that . . . I was seeing exactly what I thought I was seeing. I didn&#39;t feel fear--only immense curiosity and a certain sense of hopefulness and excitement. I tried to mentally &#34;talk&#34; with the thing. On subsequent walks, I may have even received rudimentary, yet personalized, messages back (although this is difficult to &#34;prove,&#34; so I will exclude the details here.)  I should also mention that I reported seeing the anomalous light to my family members, who live next door and who do not believe even in the remotest possibility of extraterrestrials or sky phenomena originating from other beings. On the morning after I had a sighting of the amber light, my father reported that a &#34;helicopter&#34; had landed atop the mountain about half a mile from our homes, observed about 6:00 a.m. as he was heading to work. When I pressed for more details, he told me that he did not actually see a helicopter, but that the saw extremely bright lights that appeared to be landing atop the mountain. His interpretation was that someone lived up there and may have needed helicopter transportation to a hospital. I have not been able to confirm or refute this--I only mention it because he did not see a craft (only lights) and because of the next part of my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sightings of the bright, anomalous, peachy light during the last week of September and first week of October 2010, I stopped going for evening walks as it became too dark to do so. I also had a series of urgent matters to take care of, and I ceased to even think about UFOS for over a month. I began to think about them again during the past week or two, perhaps to take my mind off other things, and that&#39;s when the most incredible part of my story began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on or about November 17, 2010, when I was driving home from work (I commute 135 miles daily by car, mostly through rural areas). I was in Dauphin Co. at the time, skywatching while driving (unsafe, I know), when a weird light caught my eye. It seemed stationary, like a stationary plane light. I had to keep looking back at the road between my views of it. At one point, when I looked back at it, I saw that it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was somewhat disappointed and kept driving. When I reached a particular part of my commute (a small village in lower Northumberland Co.), I noticed an IMMENSELY BRIGHT light in the sky, hovering not far above tree-top level--perhaps a few hundred yards up, like the size of a small plane about to touch down in a few minutes, but lit up like a rocket!!! It was ridiculously bright, and the brightness completely obscured the rest of the craft. It was a long cigar (horizontally shaped, like an airplane lit up from wingtip to wingtip) of incredible brightness, just HOVERING, &#34;looking&#34; right at me!! The brightness did not increase, decrease, or move--it was definitely HOVERING, or else moving at such a slow speed that it would have dropped from the sky if it were a typical plane. By this time, I had slowed down to about 40 miles an hour. A car approached in the opposite lane, I took my eyes off the &#34;thing,&#34; and when I looked at it again, this time I saw just two incredibly bright &#34;headlights&#34; and two fainter lights on the wingtips of what appeared to be a plane. It had begun to move toward me, but at a ridiculously slow pace. It flew over me, from left to right. My thoughts during the event were initially &#34;What the H*** is THAT?&#34; Just baffled curiosity, ting! ed with breathless excitement, and then a bit of a sheepish, confused feeling after I saw the &#34;plane.&#34;  When I arrived home, I spoke with my father again and relayed what I had seen, because I felt like I needed to tell someone. I was astounded when he casually informed me that he, too, had seen a bright &#34;plane&#34; that seemed to hover or fly unusually slowly. He saw it in the EXACT SAME LOCATION as I did, and the object behaved exactly the same: it flew over him from left to right. He didn&#39;t tell me when the event occurred, but it must have been months ago, as he does not normally travel along that road. &#34;It was a plane,&#34; he said, with a tone of finality. I didn&#39;t try to convince him otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day or two later, I took an alternate route home from work due to an accident along my regular route, and I traveled through Dauphin and Schuylkill Counties. While I was waiting in a line of traffic to access I-81 N, I noticed the same &#34;hovering plane&#34; type of light in the sky among the other stars, airplanes, and jets. Its faintly peachy color gave it away. I stared at it for a long time, waiting in traffic. As I did, I noticed VERY FAINT strobe-like lights that seemed to emanate from it and travel around it. For whatever reason, I once again wrote it off as a star with extremely distant jets in close alignment with it. I continued to travel north. I looked at &#34;it&#34; once while driving on the interstate, and I thought I saw a contrail in the moonlight behind it, which befuddled (and disappointed) me yet again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear I saw the amber/peachy light again near a shopping center that I stopped at on my way home in Schuylkill Co. (At the time, I was just dismissing everything I saw, so it&#39;s hard to recall details now in retrospect.) Then, after I left the shopping center, I witnessed almost a repeat of the previous event in lower Northumberland Co.: a bright (but not nearly as bright as before) light seemed to hover, then &#34;morph&#34; into a plane-like object before proceeding to slowly fly over me from left to right! Because I was on a highway, I lost sight of the object after it flew over me and was behind me and behind trees surrounding the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most recent encounter(s) I had were on Nov. 22 or Nov. 23 after work. I left work at 5:00 p.m. in Dauphin Co. and proceeded to walk several blocks to my car. I saw a very, very strange looking &#34;helicopter,&#34; complete with helicopter sound, flying right past me over the parking lot. I couldn&#39;t see the shape of the helicopter very well, but it appeared to have a bright green light on top and a red light on the bottom. This one may have been a domestic or military craft--I&#39;m not saying it was unexplainable, just that I had never seen a light configuration like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to drive toward a shopping center in Cumberland Co. While waiting in traffic, I saw the amber/peachy orb-like thing again in the sunset, facing me. It looked at first like a plane approaching, but as I sat there in traffic for a good ten minutes or so, I realized that it was not increasing in size in the slightest, nor was it decreasing, fading, pulsing, or otherwise moving. It was, however, glimmering--dancing, even--in an odd way, more so than the typical glimmer of a star in the sky. It seemed to be multi-colored at times. Finally, as traffic cleared and I drove across a bridge toward the light, it began to approach, take the form of a plane, and turn to my right at a 90 degree angle. I took my eye off it to watch the road, looked back, and all of a sudden, this thing flew RIGHT-TO-LEFT, right over me! It had done a complete 180 in the second or two that I had taken my eyes off the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite all this, I was just left feeling bad because these objects were merely planes, and I was seemingly incapable of identifying them as such. I thought I was perhaps misidentifying things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some shopping in Cumberland and Dauphin Counties, I proceeded home. While in upper Dauphin Co., in the area where I had previously seen a hovering light, I noticed a very odd-looking &#34;plane.&#34; Instead of the typical white light &#34;strobe&#34; that domestic craft have, this plane&#39;s strobe light &#34;fluttered&#34; in a bizarre way. I&#39;m sorry that I cannot describe it better than that. Suffice it to say, it was an abnormal type of strobe that I had never seen before. Again, I&#39;m not completely convinced that this particular one wasn&#39;t just a regular plane with a broken light or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, when I had reached the part of my commute through lower Northumberland County, in the EXACT SAME PLACE that I had first seen the bright, cigar-shaped-light-turned-hovering-plane, and in the EXACT SAME PLACE that my father had seen something similar, I SAW IT AGAIN!!! It wasn&#39;t as bright this time, but it was bright, peachy-colored, and hovering on the opposite bank of the Susquehanna River. I mentally asked it to come closer, to show me what it really looked like. At this point, I was driving about 35 mph and looking for a place to pull over. I suspected that this was the &#34;real deal,&#34; and I wanted an opportunity for me to observe it without moving. I pulled over at the first opportunity and opened my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had lost view of the light behind some trees for a bit but soon saw it through the tree tops, slowly making its way toward me (it was flying about a few hundred yards up in the air from left to right again). Finally, it cleared the trees, and I stuck my head out the window and saw it: It was a small, low-flying jet/plane, complete with plane-like sound, much to my consternation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived home, I performed internet searches on &#34;hovering planes&#34; and &#34;UFOs that become planes.&#34; This led me to the videos of many Youtubers who have been observing and capturing these things for quite some time. The usernames I mentioned above are just a few who have posted videos of EXACTLY what I saw: peachy orbs/lights that morph into plane-like objects. Some of the videos even show daylight footage. I cannot emphasize enough that THESE ARE LEGIT, and I encourage anyone even remotely interested to take a look. I thought I was a really poor witness until I viewed these videos, at which point I almost wept when I realized that others have seen what I&#39;ve seen. The &#34;orange orb/fake-plane UFO&#34; thing is real, it&#39;s prevalent, and many of us are witnessing it, worldwide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my opinion about what these are and why they&#39;re here (for what it&#39;s worth): I believe they&#39;re extraterrestrial in origin. Not sure whether they&#39;re &#34;manned,&#34; as it were, or perhaps just probes or holograms. They don&#39;t appear to do anything except observe, and, occasionally, interact. They seem to appear when one thinks about them, almost exclusively on clear nights. I believe that they are simply trying observe and to spread awareness of their existence at a grass-roots-level. They are both bold and cautious--they&#39;re undaunted by urban areas, where they can blend in, but rural areas and daylight seem to be no big deals, either. I would love to know why there are so many of these, and why &#34;they&#34; seem to want to be noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for the opportunity to provide my personal account of this phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I had just closed the lid of the grill when I turned towards the horizon and lit a cigarette. After watching the sky, I noticed 4 objects hovering above the horizon, 3 being in the shape of an orb while the last object being in the shape of a saucer. They changed into multiple colors, such as red then blue then green and back to white. The shapes went from left to right in rapid movements and then after about 2 minutes shot directly vertical into the sky. They were no longer seen after that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It hovered for about an hour slowly moving away from where I was witnessing the craft. It appeared to move a short distance at a time then flash red then blue. After it left another one appeared. I also noticed what looked like a satellite dish scanning the skies on the hill.

Looking beyond them I noticed another object farther up and hovering at approx. 5-6000 ft. It looked to the size of a small airplane but with no wings and just sitting there. The birds had moved to the east by now and it was just this thing hanging up there , I looked away and looked back to make sure it was not something on my eyes . (floaters)  I called out to my son to bring a camera and as I was waiting for him said object shot to the west. The object moved from 0 mph to out of sight in less than one second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had blinked I would thought it had just vanished but, it moved so fast it actually left a trail of darkness behind it as if it were a tracer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything move that fast in the daylight.

Looking through my windshield I noticed a bright light in the sky in front but slightly to the left, I pointed it out to my 12 year old son who was sitting in the passenger seat, saying to him “look at that star” and that it seemed unusual to see a star in daylight, not knowing too much about astronomy , I added that it was perhaps Venus which is why we can see it because I couldn’t see any other stars as I looked around the rest of the sky. As we looked at what by now I was convinced was Venus, a small wispy cloud moved across but the light was not obscured by the cloud, the cloud passed and the bright light was again in a cloudless part of the sky, a few seconds later I remarked to my son that the br! ight light appeared to be moving a little more to the left and also appeared to growing slightly dimmer, then it became quite obvious it was moving as it picked up speed very quickly moving upwards at a roughly 45 degree angle, it completely disappeared within a few seconds over the south western sky. All in all we had watched this thing for about 5-6 minutes, I noted the time that it disappeared, it was 4.55 pm central time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second Sighting  My wife was also traveling in the truck but was in the sleeper listening to an audio book, I had considered disturbing her to look at the bright light when I first noticed it, but thinking I would be disturbing her for something as unremarkable as an ‘ early’ star or Venus I didn’t bother, it was only when my son and I realized that this thing was moving off at a high rate of speed that I finally called  her, just too late for her see anything, in fact when I told her what we had just seen, I thought  she might think we were imagining or exaggerating it.  For approximately the next 10 minutes my Son and I discussed what we had seen with my wife, telling her several times that I had wished I had disturbed her so she could have seen it too.  Then to my astonishment the light suddenly appeared again, this time all three of us watched it, but it only stayed stationary for about a minute, then started moving again, except this time it moved in the opposite direction ( south west to! south east) and in less than 10 seconds faded out of sight completely, it was almost as if someone turned out the light with a ‘dimmer’ switch! The only difference this time was that it didn’t look exactly the same kind of light a star at night has, this time it had a reddish hue to it, we think that this time because of the change in direction it may have been reflecting the sun, despite the sun being quite a way below the horizon by now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ought to add that I’m sure the object was very high in the sky, I don’t believe it was a plane because all the planes were leaving long contrails. Also, planes don’t really move that way. No flashing airplane lights either.<n>

It was a sunny, clear day and the temperature was approximately 50 degrees; winds were calm and humidity levels were average for the time of year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While shooting photos of the cat, my son noticed an object moving across the sky. The object was traveling in a northward direction, its altitude was approximately 300-400 feet, it moved at around 20-30mph and it was maintaining level flight. It was completely silent.  He managed to take six photos of the object before it passed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described it as having three lobes with a domed structure in its center.  Each lobe was a different color, or seemed to be and the object morphed into a &#34;y&#34; shape as it moved farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked him if he thought it might be a balloon, but he was absolutely certain that it was not.  The manner in which the object traveled and how it changed shape convinced him that it was a craft of some sort.  He told me he was actually frightened when he first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With photo analysis, the size of the object could be determined, but that’s not something my son and I have pursued. I am emailing his photos with this report.  I have, however, manipulated what I think to be the best picture in the group in an attempt to bring out better detail and increase sharpness.  I’m no expert in digital photo composition, but I used Adobe Photoshop to produce the final edited image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible cluster of balloons?  PD)<n>

I thought it was a helicopter but it wasn&#39;t making any sound. As the object was floating towards me going North I saw that it was a copper, rusty looking saucer flying at a low altitude. It floated right over my head above the condo and flipped on it&#39;s side as it flew over. It looked like an old rusty disk. I tried to call my boyfriend whom was at the store about 1/2 a mile away and his phone was fully charged and his cell phone just stopped working. His screen was white, and his cell phone was fully charged. His computer froze also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was on my computer at about 10pm when My house started shaking,  So I ran outside to see if by chance, maybe a plain was having trouble with flight. No I did not see a plane.  But I did see two blueish/greenish hoops in the sky.  They were flying very low and were very hard to see.  They flew very slowly towards the mountains/east.  I tried taking video, but nothing was showing on my camera, so I tried taking photos...again nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I was frustrated.  My mother had seen all of this too, so I know I,am not crazy.  But, about 5 minutes later. two more crafts were flying by each-other and again, shaking my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, am waiting to see them again.<n>

I stead fast on birght ones, and let the clouds pass just to see if I was mistaking if they were stars they should have been in the same location shouldn`t they? they weren`t they were moving. Well If anyone reads this and can find out what was going on, I`d really like to know what phenomenon I had experienced. ty Dave<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

On my patio, I first noticed how light is it outside and quite abnormal for this time of night. I glanced up and noticed many lights above the clouds moving fast in wide circles. At first I thought it might be a spotlight on the ground but soon realized there were too many of the lights to be one spotlight circling. They move fast and in a very wide circle but not a perfect circle and the heavy clouds would prevent me seeing any beams of light but only the lights themselves. No objects outside the beams of light were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and telephone number deleted))<n>

The object was about 100,000 feet above me as I traveled at a speed of 55 MPH.  The object moved eastbound approximately 6-8 miles, or approximately North Garland Rd and George Bush Tollway.  Then it moved a mile westward, or approximately Brand Rd. Then it moved back to North Garland Rd. Finally coming back over my vehicle and disappeared over Lake Ray Hubbard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident occured in approximately 1-2 seconds. So using simple math I calculated the craft roughly went 6-8 miles westbound,  Then 1 mile east bound, then another mile westbound, then back 6-8 miles at where it began. 14 miles at the slowest in 1 second.  Thats 50,000 MPH in different directions, without a sound or streak of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was standing in my drive way outside my house in Chandler, Arizona haveing a cigarette and watching the stars. I then noticed one &#34;star&#34; moving across the sky and I thought to myslef, &#34;Its just a satellite.&#34; but as it was moving I notice three more following behind the one I originally saw in a vertical column behind it, at the same speed. I then thought, &#34;  Just more satellites...&#34;; but then they stopped completely and looked just like stars again.  If you call the starting point from the first &#34;star&#34; started moving as 0 degrees, and directly behind me as 180 degrees, they moved aproximetly 35 degrees to the west over the course of about two minutes.  After that two minutes, they remained still for about another eight to ten minutes before I went inside. It is entirely possible that this can be explained with rationality, but I have never seen this before in my 23 years ! of existence, nor have I ever heared of this happening before. I should also mention that I am a college student that is a Science/Engineering major, and know that this doesn&#39;t normally happen.  Unfortunately, I did not have a camera or video camera that can effectively record light sources such as stars in the night sky.<n>

This was really bright and wasn’t moving, and it was at a lower height than what airplanes usually fly. So I drive past crossroads and I see this huge craft. It wasn’t as big as an airplane but it was still a good size. It was right across the highway from Muralt’s where they’re currently doing construction so I thought maybe some people were working late and it was just an extra bright light to help them see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know is that it wasn’t making any noise which is peculiar, and if it was a plane it would have made SOME movement since the first second I saw it.

I was looking NE(north east direction) my first impression was a plane with a bright front light on after take-off. but soon after a minute it changed direction(east to south)and narrowed in brightness then blacked out. A second later a quick flicker then nothing.....no sound lagging from behind the object. About 2 and half mins later a plane with its flickering lights at a lower altitude flying unknown to it almost parallel to the path of the object.

Also tonight I saw a stream of brilliant lights(through the binoculars) that were like a shorter rainbow shooting from the area that the these blinking lights were.  I have been seeing several recently every night. I have been researching the net as I am wondering what these are and noticed other people are reporting the same.  Could they be satellites?   I saw a few when I was in Omaha, NE about 3 weeks ago.  My son is here and he sees the same.

I quickly wrote down what she saw.  This happened less than 20 minutes ago.  No wind, temp 54 F., cloudy with patches of haze.  My wife saw an object that was an inverted teardrop shape, a dull brick red (possible dull glow), around 1/8th the size of the Moon, no noise, heading northwest in an ARC, at a slow pace, below the cloud cover.  It&#39;s her first UFO and she&#39;s sketching it, right now.  Sadly, I didn&#39;t see it. I sent a text message to George Norry&#39;s show, which is on live.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the night of November 18th, 2010 at approximately 8:20 P.M, 2 good friends and myself  saw something  about  100 feet away (behind an unoccupied house)and 150-200 feet above the ground hovering.  I was driving home from the store about 1 block south of my home in Millwood.  I did not notice the object first of us three, my eyes were on the road.  I noticed my friend in the passenger seat was looking at something very intently.  He was gazing through the driver side window and practically leaned over me to stare at it, when my friend in the rear driver side seat blurted out “dude what ((deleted)) is that in the sky?”  My first reaction was to instinctively look at the object, but at first only glimpsed it for a brief moment before returning my eyes to the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I certainly thought that someone in the area had inflated an advertisement blimp with lighting and let it float over their house attached to the ground via cable. After taking my eyes off of the object my observations had become clear to me, I had indeed seen something floating above the ground, unnaturally. I drove on about 50 feet and made a left hand turn onto my road and stopped after about another 20 feet to better observe the object as it was stationary when first sighted, and still on the left above the ground.  As soon as I stopped to observe it however, the object slowly turned 180 degrees and began moving in the direction that I had just came from slowly. I realized that the object had begun to move and shifted my car in reverse to pursuit. I reversed very quickly around the corner and started to chase the object with my car. As soon as I rounded the corner, however, the object was gone from sight passing behind trees in the neighborhood, and I sped ! down the street to see it again and reached 60 mph before I got the last glimpse of it (I was the only one to see it that last time) speeding across the road in a southwestern direction. I returned home and reviewed my observations with my friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was almost blimp shaped- metallic grayish in color- with what appeared to be 3 street lights (or lights with similar color) on its underside.  Rounded like a blimp on the top of it and concaved on the underside.  There was no sound observed by us.  Although we had the music volume turned up, it was reasoned by us 3 that if it were a helicopter or anything man-made than we should have heard it, especially in considering that the object was very close to us.  When the object began to move I noticed that the lights on the bottom side got significantly bright for a brief moment than begun rotating around the object, and at my last glimpse of it I only saw a circular ring of light speeding across the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he assures us that it was submitted as a serious-minded report.

Went from bright to dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were heading to the outlets to do some shopping.  Around 8:00 PM, we approached the shopping center.  We were slowing down to turn into the outlet and a yellowish-orange circle appeared over the ocean.  It was very bright considering how far away the object was.  I told my wife &#34;LOOK!&#34;  She looked up and said &#34;what in the world is that?&#34;  After the first object appeared, it went from a brightness of 10 to 0.  Next, to the left of where the first object was - another one appeared in the same fashion.  So, from right to left we saw this occurrence 5 times. Just before one object would fade, another one would appear.  At all times, you could see one object dimming and the other getting brighter.  There was considerable distance between the object locations.  We could not hear any sounds or anything of that nature.  This was extremely odd.  This was not an airplane with blinking lights or anything.  If you ever get the opportunity to see this, you ! will understand what I mean.  We were probably 2 or 3 miles from the ocean.  This object appeared to be a great distance from us.  The location of these objects were well over the tree horizon.  I would say if you were looking at the tree line, this would have been 30 degrees above that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly say that my wife no longer thinks I am crazy.  I reported an incident last year about the circles in the sky in another county.  This time, I had a witness.  There is nothing to explain what we saw other than the text above.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the time it looked like those lights that shimmer through the sky when there is an important event.  I thought maybe they were on the mountain. But these lights weren’t moving.  They were stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closer I drove I realized these lights were coming out of a massive cloud and and the V shape of lights looked like clouds themselves and with the moon in the middle of the V it seemed to make them glow. (It didn’t always appear to be a V with different turns in the road it was hard to tell when I drove closer.) It wasn’t long when I realized I was driving under the strobes of lights. Only maybe 15 minutes had lapsed since I first spotted it to the point they were in the air on each side of me. (If I was going 60 miles an hour they had to be at least 45 miles long.)  When I turned onto Hwy 277 the enormous cloud was up close and just to the left of the road. In the center of this cloud was a dark black hole where the lights of the perfectly shaped V came out. In the dark hole I could see at least 3 red stationary blinking lights. I also saw an additional red light, briefly, that moved around one of the light beams coming from the hole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was completely under the outer edge of the massive cloud (7:45 p.m.) just before turning on to 77 and losing eyesight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ironically, when I looked at a road map I realized the mysterious cloud was sitting in the middle of a triangular form where 3 roads intercepted. Between 3 cities: Heber, Snowflake and Holbrook. It was in the middle of this triangular form of roads. ( Hwys 277, 77, 377)  I never saw another soul driving on 277 but there were others on 260.

The objects appeared artificial and seemed to be flying above the atmosphere (it was a pretty clear night). One would assume they were satellites except GPS and telecom satellites do not move in either a west or northern direction.  Nor do I believe they blink.  They were also clearly not recognizable (Earth)aircraft, military or otherwise.  There were several commercial aircraft present in the vicinity making a landing and taking off from nearby Miami International and Tamiami Airports with which to compare at a glance. We were walking due-West on SW 68th Street approaching SW 75th Avenue.  There is moderate oak and fruit-bearing tree foliage and the homes in the area all have a minimum of a 1-acre ! lot.

The one large yellow light suddenly became 2 large yellow lights in the sky parralel to one another quite a distance from each other.  Suddenly, the 2 lights disappeared and just as suddenly, 1 large yellow light appeared further to the left on the same level as the other 2 were.  And just as soon, 2 large yellow lights appeared together on the same level in the area where I had seen the first one.  They were stacked one above the other.  There were now 3 lights visible.  Then the farthest left disappeared and immediately showed up somewhat closer to the other 2.  They all disappeared and a split second later, the 2 that were stacked, re-appeared.  They soon disappeared and I no longer saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the third such encounter that my wife and I have seen in this area in 2 years.

There were five or six yellow lights on the side of the object and and those would stop for around two or three seconds and then red lights that seemed to be on the bottom of the object would flash across.  Then the lights on the side again would go and then the bottom lights would go etc..  What made me know for a fact that this was a UFO was it was drastically lower than any aircraft would fly.  The side lights were also on just it&#39;s left side which made me positive.  I saw no shape, just lights. All three of us in the car were so stunned my grandmother almost stopped in the middle of the road.  All of our jaws were dropped and our eyes were big when we all had seen it.   Also, it seemed to be getting lower and lower and when we got around the turn in the road it was nowhere in sight.  There was trees around the corner and I could see through them, but the UFO had d! isappeared.<n>

There were three groups of windows all in a horisontal line.  Each group was separated by about 30 feet. The total lenght estinate is 100 to 150 feet.It was observed at about 500 feet altitude, there was no strobe or navigation lights.No sound or air blast was observed.  I was about a block from the object,and while each window was lit up nothing could be seen inside any of them ,they were tall rectangles with rounded corners. The craft was low over a house.suddenly all its lights went out and nothing more was seen of the craft, there was no movement noticed.<n>

My grandma was talking on the phone and we were yelling from the back seat and grandma then hung up the phone.  It seemed like it was getting lower and lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandma then saw it and said &#34;Oh my gosh!&#34; and she was shocked as well.<n>

I seen a huge fire ball fall from the sky at an angle. I can&#39;t explain about how far up in the sky it was, but it was definitely higher than airplanes would fly. The tail or tracer behind it was long with a bright yellowish-orange color. In no time I seen 3 military jets appear to fly toward this thing, one flying from the north, the other flying in from the west, and another flying in on the south. I&#39;d like to add that at a distance, the jets did appear slightly smaller than the fire ball. At 5:42pm I seen a second fire ball of fire fall which was positioned much higher than the first fire ball, and a good distance behind it. Because I was driving, I was unable to take pictures of this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not exactly like a helicopter, but it had a sort of pulsating light and it was long so that&#39;s what we were calling it because of the hovering.  It could&#39;ve been oval instead of triangular for all we know, close up. We stared at it trying to figure out what it was for about two minutes.  There are no houses or buildings or any other light source to explain what we were seeing.   It was just silently hovering and then as we were both watching it, it vanished.  POP!  We just looked at each other and didn&#39;t know what to think about it.  We have both heard about UFO stories, of course, but laughed and said that nobody would believe us. That&#39;s all there is to tell.<n>

I was outside work smoking when I thought I saw something very strange.  It went by so fast I didnt even have a chance to get my phone camera out.  My first impression was that it was a large bird though there was no wing movement, then I thought it must be a hang glider or an ultralight though I have never seen them around here.  We had low cloud cover this morning and it was below the clouds.  I was looking at the clouds when it just appeared in front of me about 2 o&#39;clock and moving to the south, pretty much following I65.  There was no noise or exhaust trail and it was moving extemely fast.  Within 3 or 4 seconds it was out of sight.  The item was brown and v shaped from what I could tell.  If I had to guesstimate a size, about 1 inch at arms length which seems so small but it was not a bird,, no bird I know of can move that fast.<n>

My initial thought was that I was observing a meteor, but it wasn’t displaying any characteristics of what I know from seeing meteors in the past.   This sphere traveled in a straight line over the horizon, and then all at once, it shot upwards then shot straight down over the tree line.  From my vantage point, it seemed to pass just south of Oceana Naval Air Station but this was too fast for any jet I’ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She then pointed it out to her sister who looked up and saw it too.  They said the objects were a little higher than the power lines and the just vanished right before their eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I came over and I had them tell me the story because they know I’m interested in UFO’s and they both had drew pictures of what they saw.  One was 15 my other niece who saw it was 16 at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that day around 4:30, I had them ride with me to go do some work at my storage space and one of them screams &#34;what is that?”&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I pull over and we all look out the window and see what appears to be a big orange light in the sky.  It appeared to be hovering at first but then we noticed that it was moving steadily but very slowly.  Then we noticed some ways away three jets were heading towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to drive up the road to see if I could get a better look at what we were seeing and we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I turned around and went back to same spot as before and the object was still there but there was no sign of the jets.  We didn’t see what happened but they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while we lost sight of the orange ball as it seemed to move off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to add, I’ve seen weather balloons and I’ve seen Venus and this wasn’t either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The girls I couldn’t believe what we had seen.  We went on to the storage space and continued to talk about what we saw.<n>

IT HAD BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT KEPT BEAMING THEN IT APPREARED LIKE IT WAS GONNA FLY AWAY BUT, IT JUST KEPT GOING SIDE TO SIDE.   THEN IT MOVED UP AND DOWN AND BEGIN TO FLY JUST A LITTLE BIT THEN IT STOPPED. AND STAYED THERE IN THE ONE AREA FOR AN HOUR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS DAYBREAK APPROACHED IT WENT FUTHER AWAY LIKE A DISTANCE WHICH WAS HARDER TO SEE.  THIS SIGHTING OF THE UFO WAS OVER THE SIDE OF THE DAN RIVER MILLS HERE IN DNVILLE VIRGINIA.  IT WAS AWSOME! I FEEL LIKE I MADE CONNECT WITH THIS SPACE CRAFT. BECAUSE IT WANTED ME TO SEE IT.  WHEN I LIVED IN NORTH CAROLINA ON THE MOUNTAIN WHERE I GREW UP WE SAW A FLYING SAUCER IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SEEN A UFO THEN.  IT WAS EARLY AND IT WAS VERY COLD THAT MORNING, IT WAS WINTER TIME, THE UFO FLEW ACROSS THE SKY UP ABOVE A PINE TREE IN THE YARD, IT LOOKED LIKE THE JETSON SPACE SHIP.  IT FLEW IN HALF OF A CIRCLE AND IT! WAS MOVING SO FAST BEYOND THE DETERMINATION OF SPEED. BUT IT LET US SEE IT.  I WAS VERY EXCITED WHEN I SAW THE UFO IT FLEW ON THE RIGHT SIDE THEN WENT AWAY.

The fact that it was cloudy and has been a rainy day, made it that much more clearer to see it.  It looked like it flashed a few times and then stopped and then another flash filled the sky above where I was driving and all of the power in my neighborhood went out...weird stuff...scary weird stuff<n>

I walked outside and noticed across the street, behind my neighbors house in the woods, was a disc shaped object surrounded by small red and yellow lights that were blinking consistently.  I thought maybe it was a tent when I saw it, but judging from the distance which was probably 100 meters or so, it was about 14 feet high from the ground.  At the base of it was a bright yellow light that stayed solid.  Above all there was this high pitched buzzing noise that I thought may have been discharge from a streetlight or something but this was the first time I had ever heard it outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 6 minutes, and went inside to grab a video recorder.  I came back outside and it was gone.  I wasn’t sure what to do so I waited there for about 5 more minutes, and it never reappeared, but I could still hear this high pitched buzzing noise. This is not fabricated, and I wasn’t hallucinating, I really did see this. I didn’t know what to ! do so I thought that I would report it on this database.  I was somewhat skeptical about UFO’s, but now I’m not so sure anymore on what to believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll keep my eyes and ears open thought and if something else occurs, I’ll be sure to report it.<n>

11/16/10 17:57|Rochester|MI|Triangle|3 minutes|Black triangle in Rochester, Michigan|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78964.html|132|ndxe201011| Black triangle in Rochester, Michigan<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a text dump from the MUFON report I filed. I will also add more detail at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving northbound on Rochester road at Hamlin (see attached map), I saw about a mile ahead of me two VERY bright, yellow-white lights close together.  The lights were very different from the street lights, car lights, and building lights in the area.  All those lights looked washed out compared to the floating lights.  The floating lights were also significantly brighter and larger in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were landing lights from a plane flying really low.  As I approached I realized the lights were stationary and then thought it must be lights on the end of a high pole - perhaps they&#39;re having a carnival in the parking lot of the mall again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came to a stop in the left-hand turn lane at Rochester and Avon, It was about 20 or 30 yards away (west and slightly north) and about 4 stories up... and still not moving.  I keep thinking to myself, &#34;I can&#39;t be the only one seeing this&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that stood out most was how I had traveled a mile with this thing in full view and it never appeared to move at all.  No wavering, nothing, even when I was right next to it. It was just hanging there steady in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I could make out a third light, and the three lights formed a triangle, but I could not see anything between the lights at all.  I pulled out my iphone and shot 3 pictures, but only 2 came out (not very well, either.  I have an iphone 3g so it&#39;s not HD).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds it started to move south.  It didn&#39;t accelerate, it just started moving at a slow, constant rate.  As it moved over the parking lot to my left (west), I could CLEARLY see its shape since the ground lights were illuminating it from below.  It was a triangle with equal lengths on all sides and appeared to have no markings at all; just a flat, &#34;grayish&#34; surface with lights on the each end.  I could not tell how thick it was.  As it moved, the lights faded to nothing over the span of about 6 seconds and then I couldn&#39;t see it at all even though it was fairly close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI, it was raining slightly and there was a slight &#34;haze&#34; in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may be unrelated, but when I crossed the road two miles back  I saw four police cars with lights and sirens blaring as they drove through the intersection of Rochester and Auburn roads.  Two continued west and two turned south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional notes:  The lights on the craft barely show up on the photo although, to my eye, they were really bright, glowing balls of a diameter larger than the parking lot lights.  Strange that they barely show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the lights were constant the whole time: no flickering, pulsing, etc. until they shut off one-by-one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t emphasize enough the strangeness of how this thing was just &#34;parked&#34; in mid air.  It was just hanging there completely still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friends have been asking whether it made any noise.  I didn&#39;t hear anything but since it is a busy intersection I&#39;m not surprised.  Although, you&#39;d think if it was a jet that I would have heard a loud, high pitched noise, but I didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the three lights were not underneath the object but appeared to be on the sides.  I couldn&#39;t tell how tall it was because the lights didn&#39;t reflect off the black surface. In retrospect, that&#39;s pretty strange too.  And I don&#39;t remember seeing the lights reflect off anything in the environment, but I probably didn&#39;t notice because I was watching this thing so closely.<n>

These two lines somewhat resembled contrails but they were much shorter and didn&#39;t get larger with time the way contrails do.  I pointed these two UFO&#39;s out to a couple of other people and they informed me that UFO&#39;s were a common sight in that area.  I walked up a little bit higher in elevation and looked in the direction where i had previously witnessed the two UFO&#39;s and they were still there looking exactly the same as before -- no movement was discernable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I came home and asked my son, 9 years old, to come outside and he witnessed.  A passenger plane passed by, then this object move up and to one side, later a jet (white/red) passed by this object very close, and this object disappeared.  it probably lasted more than 5 minutes.<n>

There is usually a logical explanation for things that happen but I can&#39;t find one for what happened this night!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object (fireball) was traveling south southwest. We were about a 1/4 mile west of Lake Erie and about the same distance east of South Rockwood Village Limit!  My mom and I were on our way home from the gas station, about 10:00 at night.  I was listening to my iPod with my headphones.  It was a clear night.  We were almost home when I felt my mom tap me. I pulled my headphones out n turned to her!  She was saying &#34;look!  Look up there!&#34; as she was pointing in the sky towards the lake.  I just kinda casually looked.  The trees were kinda in the way at first, but it really caught my attention as it came into clear view. I&#39;d never seen anything like that! I thought it was a plane on fire and asked my mom if it was!  She said it looked like it.  She was driving real slow.  She pointed out that she didn&#39;t see any wing tip! lights or plane in motion lights!  I didn&#39;t see any either!  We just figured the fire affected it&#39;s electrical system!  When we drove around the river bend she pulled over n stopped.  She said she was gonna call the Sheriffs.  We were watching this thing.  It looked like an airplane as far as its air speed and distance.  It crossed over the road ahead of us.  Its speed hadn&#39;t changed at all since it cleared the tree line and it wasn&#39;t flying any lower!  It just looked like a moving fireball in the sky.  Not quite round when it was moving.  No sparks or trails behind it!  It looked like it was over some farm fields when it just suddenly stopped!  It didn&#39;t slow down at all, it just stopped!  After it stopped it appeared to be more round!  It didn&#39;t fall or move in any other direction.  Its color n brightness didn&#39;t change at all.  It stayed in that position for a long time, maybe 30-60 seconds!  Then it just slowly fadded out till there was nothing!  Like a slow fizzle!  I didn&#39;t see anythi! ng come crashing down to the ground.  Even though it was dark  I was looking!  There were no falling sparks, nothing!  I&#39;ve seen probably hundreds of &#39;falling stars&#39;, my mom always points to the sky!  This was different! I also never heard any sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night about the same time we pulled into my grandpa&#39;s driveway, about a block away from where we stopped the night before.  My mom and I both seen a plane, but it was different than any I&#39;ve seen.  All the lights were red, wing tips and plane in motion!  It was moving fast and flew out towards the lake n was gone.  It came from the south, Fermi III area!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were driving east on a river road.  I always look to the skies, day n night. I play the name the plane game with her at times.  This night I spotted what appeared to be a fireball in the sky.  It was traveling south southwest. I quickly pointed it out to my daughter as it was clearing the tree lines and entering open visability! Before it cleared the tree lines it seemed to stop for about 15 seconds.  I assumed it had changed flight direction and just appeared to be standing still.  I was also traveling on a slightly twisty road but was on a straight shot at this point.  It did not change shape or size.  Then it started back into it&#39;s original path. It was moving at a speed common to planes that fly over.  When it reached clear sky, she asked if it was a plane on fire, which was my first thought.  I did not know who to contact in reguards to this. After I cleared the riverbend in the r! oad, I pulled over!  The vehicle behind me passed and was driving extremely slow! I was getting my phone to call the Sheriffs dept.  To report a possible plane on fire. I did not call!  My daughter n I watched this object fly over the road and seemed to suddenly stop in mid air as it was hovering.  It made no navigational moves what so ever. In the first seconds it stopped I was expecting it to fall to earth!  It did not!  It appeared to be over farm land and very close to us.  It stayed in that spot for at least 45 seconds, blazing bright as it was when I first spotted it! Then it slowly started to fizzle out over about 15-20 seconds.  Then it was gone!  Once it was gone, I thought I seen some dark spots, maybe smoke which seemed to disapate!   I was looking to see if I could see an object falling, I did not!  It was dark out, but a clear night.  When the object was traveling, it was roundish in shape but had the appearance of something on fire traveling.  When it was stationary, it kep! t the more round appearance! It did not change shapes (triangl! e, squar e etc...) nor were there any other objects around it.  I heard no sound coming from it but also had my vehicle running with the windows up. It is very common around here to see small objects falling to earth in the night sky.  Those objects keep the same path and fizzle out as they fall, continually moving!  They are also much smaller and different in color.  They are nothing like this fireball I just described. I&#39;m a logical person but can not place a logical explanation to this event.  The following night, I pulled into my dads driveway (which is a block away from where I pulled over)!  A plane in the night sky caught my attention.  It was traveling north then seemed to change course quickly to a northeast patern and appeared to go out over the lake.  It was traveling very fast at a low altitude! All of the lights on it were red, not caracteristic of our normal air traffic! My first and only impression of this craft was millatary!  My vehicle was running with the windows up,  I did not hear any sound.  My daughter also witnessed this.  I&#39;ve never seen that type of craft around here before nor have I since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was a week before the sighting that we saw.  He showed me the light, which I insisted is probably a satellite or the International Space Station. They insisted that it moved.  I did not see it move that night, but they continue to say that it moves. It is clearly visible from where we were at.

It was small, and looked very far away, but it was still very bright. I kept my eye fixed on the area, I assumed it was a plane and wanted to see which direction it was going, but this blinking light did not move.  It blinked seemingly every 10-15 seconds.  The light was white, no color. I called my roommate out to look and this blinking light baffled her too.  After watching this light blink every few seconds in the same spot for about ten minutes, I went back inside, I came back out another fifteen minutes later and it was gone.<n>

I thought it was a passenger plane heading to Bradley Airport but it seemed low to be this far away if coming in for a landing.  I turned left on to RT 4 keeping an eye out for the craft.  I saw it coming towards me, now to my right.  I pulled my truck off the road and rolled down my window sticking my head out.  It passed directly over me at a constant rather slow speed - it was now on the left side of the truck.  I listened hard for a sound of engines.  None detected.  I could make out a triangular shape, although the rear corners of the wings (or whatever) had a radius - not sharp angles.  Craft was the width of my fingers held 2 - 3 inches wide at arms length.  There were 3 rather large square white lights, or illuminations, down the bottom center of the craft.  This seemed unusual to me.  There were two white strobes flashing on each side of the craft - seemed so! rt of standard for aircraft.  This may have been a secret military craft.  It flew a constant, straight path towards the north.  I do not feel it was alien in nature.  It did nothing remarkable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noted one light, then the light became a series of lights strobing apparently around the object.  The lights were a red/orange color.  A jet coming into Lindburgh field flew beneath it.  The object was coming in from the south-west heading into an easterly direction.  It made a course correction to a northerly direction.  The last we saw of it, it appeared to be starting to go to the east once again.  It appeared to be getting lower in the sky and going faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I’m making this report because I have a real UFO picture (taken accidentally).  Let me briefly explain you the situation…<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle took a ride in a boat with his family (wife, son, daughter) on Nov. 15th of 2010.  They were having fun, enjoying and taking pictures as family, and then my uncle took this picture of the “isla” (or island in English) which is a place in the Tamesi River in Tampico, Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on the afternoon, his daughter downloaded the pictures from the camera, and she was amazed when she zoomed the picture of the “isla”, and then they discovered that they took a picture (accidentally) of a real UFO over the Tamesi River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He went to my parent’s house with his family, and showed the picture still in the camera with its original registration name (P1020036) and he had a copy in his usb and he shared it with me.  In the picture appears the water, sky, flora, etc. and a distant UFO with a flying saucer shape over the sky.  It was a great weather and the picture of the “isla” and the UFO was very nice and clear!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I would like to emphasize that Tampico has a legend. The people say that we have a UFO base, because when all natural disasters come directly to Tampico, for unknown reasons they vanish or change the direction of hurricanes, etc. and they say this due to the high frequency of UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I already sent the image to MUFON Staff, I hope they upload it with this body text.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The photo is interesting, but we are unable to certify that the object in the field of view is an authentic UFO.  We cannot absolutely rule out the possibility of a bird.  PD))<n>

Myself and 3 friends were along with me when we decided to go to the lake front (Lake Michigan).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4 of us were strolling casually along the coast that evening.  As we progressed further down a lake front pier we collectively noticed an unusually bright.  Since the lake front is closed after 10pm and it was now around 1am our first thought is it being some form of authority,  police, coast gaurd etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We soon realized that was not the case.  All of us agreed that this exceptional light was moving our direction(west) from the east.  East of us was Lake Michigan.  So our thought is still optimistic, that being, as if it were a boat or some other everyday regularity.  We all can not let this light go, we continue to stare in its direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about a minute, the light gained significant ground growing closer in distance to us.  At this time we were able to tell that this light was not on the water but, in the air.  It took a moment to take its airborne presence in. 1. because from this location on the lake we frequently seen air craft heading south toward Mitchell International airport and 2. because of the low level and quietness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another sign that allowed us to realize that this was airborne was in its approach toward us it passed over the rock walls which I believe is for a wave/wake break for sailors and ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At my estimate the rock walls are about 300 yards from shore and about 150 yards from our position on the pier. So, this quite airborne light is about 100 yards out from us and its light becomes much more intense.   With it becoming more clear that the light is attached to something greater behind it 2 of my friends become hysterical and begin to cry and emotions become rather powerful and overwhelming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have stood my ground thus far when the light begings to angle itself toward the ground/water.  It is at about a 45° angle(the light) and close enough for me to be able to reach it with a stone or tennis ball toss.  The brilliant light is seemingly piercing the filthy water in this area to a depth of about 6ft. and approaching the tips of my toes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light comes to about an inch before my toes and turns its &amp;quot;high beem&amp;quot; off.  Within a matter of 10 seconds the ship accelerated and was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While taking in all of what had just happened and calming down we begin to notice a set of lights following the same path coming towards us again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time,  I reach for my phone and begin to use my camara.  That craft is still well out above the water but I start to take pictures anyway to try to gather as much as I can. The flash may have caught the attention of the craft because as I clicked more pictures and more flashes it seemed to quicken its pace in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this craft got closer it became clear it was not the same one in which we had just seen because this one was easily 10x as large with a set of lights across the bottom(yellow/whiteish)  and 3 larger lights on top(red/green/red) that appeared to be incased in glass or another see-through material. I would guess its length to be around 200ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft slowly pan across our view at about 60ft out and 60ft up.  It was the most strange structure.  It looked as if it were made of old oil barrels and not in a slick uniform shape,  more jagged and off balance.  It had unique looking hieroglyphs written on the barrells.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hieroglyphic text did not show up in any of the photos.  All together I took around 110 photos which i shared with people.  I e-mailed a few photos to one of my co witnesses which I believe she still possess today.  Within 24 hours all 110 photos were erased/disappeard from my phone....not one of my other personal photos of friends and the such were missing from my phones photo gallery.  Olny the ones I took that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just 4 friends in our early 20s....no professional background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

They seemed to be at different altitudes and each at different distances away.  There was not a sound in the sky and it was very clear as numerous stars could seen.  Even with the motion detector lights on from the rear of the yard, the street lights and the lights of the City, it didn&#39;t seem to matter - these three objects were very clear.

11/14/10 19:00|Safety Harbor|FL|Light|1 hour|I went to the pier by my house and witnessed dozes of UFOs in the sky.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78910.html|158|ndxe201011| I went to the pier by my house and witnessed dozes of UFOs in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch the skies regularly for any UFO activity, and usually I am never let down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured that by going to the pier, with wide open skies, I would have even better luck for such viewings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I left my neighborhood, there were already two mini-golden balls of light hovering in the sky. This is pretty normal for me, so I continued on towards the pier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the pier, I was completely astonished. There were three of the golden balls of light, now. And each time I would look at them directly or held my camera lens up to them, they would move sideways, not blinking. After I began filming them, another light would appear next to the golden ball. This light began to flash and I watched through my camera as it went from golden light, to what looked like some sort of mock-aircraft. This was no aircraft. These balls of light hover for 15, sometimes 30 minutes, until they are &#34;found out&#34; and that is when they start moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not only that, but other types of UFOs were up in the atmosphere as well. All of them silent. No noise. There are two airports that you can see from the pier. Clearwater/St Pete airport and Tampa International .NONE of these crafts went to either. Most of them blinked irregularly while I filmed them, and I watched as they grew fainter, until I was unable to see them anymore. There are certain regulations when it comes to navigational lights on a plane. I have studied this and I barely saw any planes that night. Everything was silent save for the people on the dock fishing who were completely and utterly oblivious to the whole thing. These are not planes. I know planes have headlights and I know what they look like when they are close-- these were not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went back to my house to charge my camera(It died while filming. I only need a DV cable to upload the video.)  I saw another one hovering around the trees.  I went back to the pier an hour later and there was nothing in the sky.  NOTHING. I sat there for 15 minutes and nothing happened. They were all gone.<n>

The planes were spaced about 2 minutes apart and were clearly visible.  In the gap between planes I noticed a brightly lit object moving in the same northern direction. This did not appear to be a plane as it had no flashing marker lights and appeared to be flying faster than the airliners I had seen.  For about 8 seconds it continued its northerly direction when it suddenly slowed to an almost stopped position.  It then abruptly changed its course to the east and accelerated to an extremely fast speed.  Two seconds later a very well lit circle formed in front of the object and grew to a size larger than the object. The object entered this and vanished, and the lit circle shrank and then vanished itself.  Four seconds later I observed a similar object traveling in the same northerly direction, and that object increased speed and disappeared from view over the tree line.<n>

I happened to catch on camara on accicdent it appearred right as I was taking a photo of the sun.  In the photo it is a perfect circle that is brighter than the sun. It appears to have what looks like a very bright red gas cloud on both sides of it.  This object appearred to be around 2-4 feet wide.  The object appears to be sitting on the ground maybe 1000 feet from me.  The object was only visible for a couple of secs. And it took place on 11/14/10 at 3:34 pm off of 74 and 150 exit outside of Brimfield IL.<n>
11/14/10 15:30|Richmond|VA|Unknown|6 minutes|Slow moving craft with short bursts of vertical contrail....|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78914.html|162|ndxe201011| Slow moving craft with short bursts of vertical contrail....<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, November 14 at approximately 3:30 p.m. I noticed a slow moving object tracking in a Northern direction.  The object appeared as only a bright light and had a short contrail – but was not behind the craft but below it.  The contrail also appeared to be in bursts at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 who then transferred me to the tower at Richmond International Airport.  They said they had no “reports”.  I then went into the house to find a camera to take pictures – batteries were dead.  The craft then started on an Eastward path, stopped, and just hovered for at least three minutes since I contacted the tower once again and the answer was the same.  When I informed him that an aircraft was going in that same general area but lower and if they looked up at 11:00 I’m sure they would see it..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 5 minutes later, three (3) fighter jets were scrambled to the same area and I also witnessed an AWAC (hopefully right) radar plane but not on the same course of the jets, but also going to that general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time in the West area aircraft were spotted with regular contrails that were a great deal longer than the contrail coming from this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft could not be seen to assess the shape – it was basically a light or just very shiny and the sun was just reflecting off of it.  It appeared as almost a “star” kind of twinkling..<n>

11/14/10 00:30|Loudon|TN|Light|approximately 15 mins|Large Mass of UFO's (lights) fly over Loudon, Tn.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78896.html|164|ndxe201011| Large Mass of UFO&#39;s (lights) fly over Loudon, Tn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 12:30 AM Nov. 14, 2010 I was called outside by a friend who was screaming for me to come look.  As I looked up to the sky, I seen tons, of orange/yellow individual lights flying in sync.  They were traveling at what looked like a very slow speed, yet definitely moving.  They kept coming out of the southeast heading in a northwest direction.  They would come in packs/groups at times, and at other times they flew individually in line with one another.  The level they were flying was low, but it was hard to tell how low; maybe like a helicopter average level, I&#39;d imagine.  I am about 2 miles east of Interstate-75 (exit 72) and I almost had the impression they were flying in line with I-75 north headed towards Knoxville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately got online and went straight to the news, but couldn&#39;t find anything on it. I then ran across this sighting over the Pennsylvania/Delaware area reported in October 2010.  I watched the video and it was EXACTLY the same thing I seemed to be viewing.  It was definitely an eerie feeling watching them move across the sky and not have a clue what you were seeing.  I wish someone could explain this to me because I&#39;m actually worried about it.  Not knowing is an awful feeling.<n>

We watched in amazment, discounting that It could be a Plane or Helichopter and we could even just notice the mountain ranges in the skyline and these lights were far to high to be a tower etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we realised that this was out of the ordinary, I  ran for my digital camera which was over my saddle horn as I had been videoing the event at the showground right before this.  This would have been 50m there and back.  I turned my camera on and went on to record what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These strange lights had moved around since we had first noticed them there was around 6 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was dissapointed as I thought the camera was not picking any of this up as I looked through at the sky, so after recording for 36sec, which seemed like forever I gave up and turned it off and just watched with amazment.  Still they seemed to be only moving slowly now back and forth but a couple or so always seemed to be closer, bigger or brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were differant colours, some starlike coloured, some more orange etc.  The stars where not near these lights and the lights were larger also, it was clear in  the south where the lights were but about an hour or so before it had been lightly clouded with slight sprinkling of rain in the north.  I am assuming the moon would have been to the north at this time I dont remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a presantation to attend and so we had to walk away and that was that.  We diddnt tell anyone there except my son&#39;s friend who also watched, we were camped pretty much away from the others and as we diddnt think we had captured footage diddn&#39;t think much more till we got home and I loaded images and videos off my camera to my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked that I had actually captured some on camera, I was very excited about this and on pausing the video at differant times we were completly amazed at the detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the original still on my digital camera I diddnt want to delete it untill I speak with someone,  But I managed to work out how to capture photos from the video and was even more convinced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On leaving that town early the next day I saw no tower or anything else it may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would realy like to speak to someone and have the footage analized and anything that may be explainable ruled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for you time and I will awate your reply as soon as possible as I will have to delete the footage off my camera soon.  I will send these images via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report is to be congratulated for having captured footage, and we are grateful for her having forwarded them to NUFORC.

I really thought it was an amber from a burning house or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when i didnt see any more following it, thats when I decided to keep my eyes on it until it disapeared. Which took as long as it would for a plane to disapear from site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh yeah, as we all know.....usually when something is on fire in the wind, sparks will fly off the burning object.  There were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

A noise occurred above our house.  The house sits above most of the local treeline atop the highest hill in the area.   From the Southwest to the Northeast the sound emanated, shaking the house slightly.  The best description I can give is it sounded like a firehouse being sprayed against aluminum siding.  Our house is on a flight path for helicopters, planes and even military flights but this sounded completely different.  It also traveled opposite to the normal flight path.  We have experienced sonic booms and again different from that noise.  Due to the cloud cover and light rainfall we were unable to glimpse any object but the clouds were disturbed in a pattern as if something had skimmed them, similar to if you pulled an edge of paper through paint.  Objects were unknown, only one for certain.  Did not see any associated lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It flew much faster than an airplane. It was a bright glowing orange circle. And behind it was a trail of flames or something.  I don’t know if maybe because it was going so fast it left a trail of light.  It lasted a total of about five seconds.<n>

Even though there is a high drop-out rate in this area, it has nothing to do with intelligence.  A person could have hologramed it or whatever.  Like I said, I&#39;m a skeptic.  I just want to know if anyone else saw it.  I looked at websites and I&#39;ve not seen another discription quite like it.

I was driving and noticed it from my left looking out the window.  I saw three or four red lights, seemingly intact, flying and or hovering heading ahead of me NE toward Rt 35 in Harrison.  The craft did not have ANY noise, at all. In fact, when the craft hovered over the line of pine trees, no wind or movement disrupted the trees, no windy swaying at all. The lights we bright red, but not bright by our means. It was a bright red like shining a light through opaque red jello.  They were chevron shaped, I was that close to it.  It only illuminated what was directly underneath the lights.  I was awe struck and then felt immediate petrifying fear when the craft descended into the pines and the lights went out.  I assume it landed when the light went out and then I floored it, and sped home doing 70 plus down Rt.35 to my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m having difficultly dealing with this.

It was still clear day light outside yet it had a bright row of lights in front of it. I was about 50 yards from it when it was about to fly over the highway, but it all of a sudden did a kite like dive 180 and it drifted away at very high speeds.  Its row of 3 to 4 lights attached to its front managed to blind me for a second as it turned.  It did not leave behind a trail of smoke and it never made a single noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There should be many more witnesses to this event.  The highway was quite busy.

11/12/10 15:30|Maple Grove|MN|Sphere|10 minutes|Daytime Sighting in Maple Grove|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78943.html|189|ndxe201011| Daytime Sighting in Maple Grove<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, I am writing in about an incident that my wife and I witnessed today while driving home to Maple Grove from downtown Minneapolis this afternoon.  We are wondering if anyone else reported this. We were traveling on West 694 about 2 miles out from the 94 interchange when we spotted a large round object over Maple Grove.  It looked to be the area of Rush Creek golf course.  At first I thought it to be a Hot Air Balloon but the closer we got the farther west it moved at incredible speed. (This when things got bizarre)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned onto the 94 exit and then instantly turned off onto the Weaver Lake Rd Exit and came up to a red light. While waiting along with a number of other vehicles we could see the large round object (with no distinct features) had turned and traveled back east about 5 to 10 miles in less than a minute and was hovering over Boston Scientific complex, about a ¼ mile to a ½ mile WNW clearly in view. We were watching this in amazement when out of nowhere (right in fron! t of us) a large Black unmarked Military style helicopter shows up and approaches the object. Right as this is happening we got the green and turned left onto Weaver Lake Rd. We made the left turn and noticed the Helicopter had veered off to the right of the object. Thinking as soon as we get to the top of the hill (not even a ¼ of a mile) the object is going to be right there in front of us. The object had completely vanished. We traveled about a ¼ of a mile down the road and could see it had traveled west about 5 miles in less than a minute. My next thought was it seemed to be over Rush Creek Elementary. I drove up to the school and had a great view for a long ways west. We saw the object but it had traveled as far west as we could see about another 5-10 miles. I proceeded to drive north on 101 until I got to County Rd 30 and took a left. And it just may be coincidence, but right after we made the turn there was a trooper sitting off the side of the road. We did see the o! bject again, but it was so far away there was no way we were g! oing to get close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few facts here; No Hot air Balloon is going to travel 5-10 miles west and turn around and return east the same distance if not more in the matter of a minute or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a lot of people that saw this. Anyone traveling on west 694 at this time of day saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hot air balloons can’t travel distances this thing did. This thing could travel 5 to 10 miles in less than a minute. I called the police department at 7:30 to see if anyone reported anything on this but the dispatcher said she just started working at 5:00 and had not heard anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was also filed with MUFON on the day it happened. We are meeting with an MUFON investigator on Saturday morning to try and recreate everything we saw.<n>

I watched it for about 10 to 15 seconds. I almost fell off of my front steps to turn my friend around so they could see it too. He did not get as long of look at it as I did, but he too agreed with the shape and speed of the craft.  It was triangular in shape, and almost looked like you could see through the middle of it, like it was transparent, yet I could still see very defined edges of the shape.  There were no lights coming from it, and no sound, yet on the edges of the craft it looked as though there were shapes on it on the outer edge that were square and rectangular shapes that I could make out that didn&#39;t look to be in any particular pattern.  The object in a whole had a sheen to it like a &#34;metal, yet glass look&#34; to it.

I live in Chester County, PA.  I was just walking my 6-month old Doberman puppy in the backyard on a very dark morning.  Being a would-be astronomer, I was studying the sky and amaze to see two extremely bright, circular objects.  The magnitude of the brightness exceeding that of Venus by a factor of 100.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two objects just lingering there.  I thought one could have been a supernova, but definitely not two.  After 5 minutes of staring at these amazingly conspicuous objects, they both started to move away at exceptional speed until they visually diminished in size to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve thought about this incident, and I am convinced that it was not two aircraft, helicopters, or anything that I have ever witnessed in the evening sky.<n>

Object was moving very slowly to the south east.  After a couple minutes the object started flickering or flashing a bright white light off to its right.  Once I saw it flashing I assumed it was a plane, until I watched the video on my big screen tv a few weeks later.  Also filmed an airplane that past no more than a few thousand feet in front of object which is also included in video.

There were 2 medium sized bright white lights sitting in low points in the sky, multiple (at least 4) very small red flashing lights that would fly around those points (one shooting straight up into the sky very fast, one circled around one of those points, one shot to the right and we could not see it anymore, and the other one randomly flying beside the points)  There was one considerably bigger bright light that would flash from white to red to blue. That one was in the shape of a V, the others were too small to tell but if I had to guess I would say they were circular. The V shaped object would orbit and would sit in this one point in the sky while randomly moving either side to side or up and down. It would be still, then move side to side, then be still, then move again, and so on and so forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and watched this for a little over an hour until going inside. There were stars out, however those were definitely not stars considering they moved. We are unsure if perhaps they are some sort of low flying government sattelites or possibly UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Definitely going to check again tonight and will report again if we see anything, we also took a 3 minute video of it. The weird part is that in the video it seems farther than it was when we were looking at it and the colors seem more apparent. I doubt a plane would sit still for that long.....The V shaped object is the only one you can see in the video also.<n>

At first we assumed it was a jet aircraft, but did not notice any other white or red lights flashing as would on a normal aircraft. There was also no sound following the object, so we then assumed it was possibly a stealth jet. But we then realized that the object was moving entirely too slow to be any type of jet aircraft we are aware of. The lights seemed to be moving east/southeast until it took a turn more south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point of turning, more lights appeard above and around the original pair of lights. These flashing lights were primarliy red/orange. The lights were now far in the distance, but we were able to track its movement for at least 5 minutes from when we first noticed it until a house got in our way. It seemed as though it had originated from behind our location from watching its directional movement, meaning it could have flown directly overhead, or we would have had a much closer look had we noticed it sooner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing in the neighborhood of Nellie Gail, where there are many large homes. This home was towards the top of a hill, so we were able to get a good sight from the street where we were standing. We moved out of the street light once we&#39;d noticed the object and with that light out of our eyes, we were able to see how slow the object was really moving.<n>

It was a set of 5 lights in a triangle formation that moved from west to east.  They were a dirty red/brown color. We have 2 airports by us, so we hear plans everyday, but this didn&#39;t make a sound. It seemed to go, not directly over us, but almost. It could have been birds, but the lights never broke formation.  It moved at a constant speed (fast).  My fiance saw the object, or objects, first for about 5 seconds and then by the time her brain processed and she told me to look it was about 3 seconds, so I only saw it for about 2 seconds, but that was enough.  It was at a pretty high altitude, but then it disappeared over the trees out of sight moving toward Kings hwy. and the beach.<n>

Last night at approximately midnight, two flashing lights were spotted parallel to each other.  They were flashing red, blue, and white, and were slowly moving, individually of each other, in figure 8 patterns.  Tonight, at an earlier hour, the same friend and I witnessed these two lights again.  However, this time they were accompanied by two other lights only flashing red, on which moved up in a straight line, and one which moved horizontally.  The horizontal light changed directions after about five minutes of flight, and increased its speed to disappear into the southern periphery.  When we left the site, the two parallel flashing lights were still in the sky.<n>

At one point when I viewed the object it appeared to split into 2 objects and then fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continued traveling past rest stop when object was viewable again.  Lost object behind mountains and when I was up to the 387 exit, I was clearly able to see the objects again, now there were 2.  Clear and bright.  I wish the cellphone I had could take pictures of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects were very bright.  Mostly stationary.  I stopped for a few moments to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Proceeded to the Casa Grande Municipal airport to see if anyone would know what these objects were but the terminal was closed.  Formation of objects had changed, before being horizontal, now they were stacked vertically.  I tried to get the attention of a DPS vehicle to no avail.  Objects are very bright but I am unable to judge the distance.  Proceeded back home.  I want to ask if these objects have any correlation to the Gila Bend bombing range as I do not know.<n>

At around 7:00-7:15 p.m. I got out of my car and looked to the West of my location.  I was shocked to see a bluish spiral in the sky which appeared to look like a coil with one side being a very tight circle and slowly expanding to a very large circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This spiral appeared to be rotating and was only a few hundred feet above the tree line.  I then noticed that a small white orb was floating into the large circle side of this spiral and as soon as the orb entered the spiral, the entire thing seemed to close in on itself like an accordion and then it all vanished.  I found this amazing due to the fact that this location was less than a mile north of an old military base called McClennan Air Force base.  I had no idea what I saw but in the time after I feel my entire life shifted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire thing only lasted two minutes and nobody around me seemed to notice.  I wanted to get a picture, but I was frozen and could not take my eyes off of this event.  It was oddly mesmerizing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was annoyed by his speed and was wondering what the heck he was doing when I looked in the sky down the road and saw this object very low in the sky.  I was watching it ahead of me by a mile down the road until the car ahead and I were directly under it as it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was a bow tie shape and very low right above the trees and completely silent.  It was just holding still above our cars over the trees and road with teal lights on one side and white lights on the other.  It was a charcoal metal color.  The car ahead of me and i actually stopped in the middle of the road and were actually dumb founded.  It never moved for five minutes.  I am a thirty one year old mother and an active member of the community and never thought I would have ever seen anything like this in my life.  If I wasn&#39;t so scared, I would have ! taken a picture. As it began to move again, completely silent, I spead to my house less than a mile down the road and sreamed for my husband to come outside to get me.  I ran hime up to the road to see what myslef and a fellow driver had just seen.  I would love to know if anyone saw this as well.<n>

We take White Rock to Old Placerville road every night.  Like every night I’m on the lookout for strange things in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night we came over the hill and I noticed a bright light with a flashing red light and it was moving slowly east coming right at us. It got over the top of us and it started moving north toward Folsom at a high rate of speed.  The top of the craft had a glowing red light as well as the bottom. The middle was lit up with three dull white lights and the middle of the craft was wider so it made it looked saucer shaped.  We headed down east Bidwell following it into Folsom.  It stopped over the housing project where I live and turned and headed east again. We tried to follow it but it eventually flew off and we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home at 1:00a.m., my wife was up waiting for me.  I asked her if she had herd a helicopter or any planes flying over in the last couple of minutes and she said no.  The craft was flying low enough where she would have herd something.<n>

Approximately 1500 feet based on hight of adjacent hills.  Moving very slow one ahead of the other.  I was outside with the dogs and knew it was very rare for any commercial flight to come from that direction as they travel high and typically from Southwest or Northeast.  The orange globes were a steady light, objects about a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided on a whim to blink my flash light at them, about once a second.  Now the part that is fact, and will make the skeptics laugh, but is a fact.  The lagging light stopped, the one ahead made a U turn and joined up with the other fairly close together, now look like bright orange car lights. Ok, now they have my attention. Then, they both start to dim, then go bright in unison at the same rate I am flashing my light. This went on for about a minute, then they slowly started to drift to the east and became obscured from my view behind trees. That sums it up. No sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a hill in Maine<n>

My friend and I were engaged in light conversation when he suddenly asked &#34;What kind of plane is that?&#34;. I looked through the front windshield of the vehicle and observed an object overhead with an orange light being emitted but could not identify it immediately.  The object was triangular with rounded edges and appeared to be traveling in a rough south-east to north-west direction moving over S.Bell St. toward I-27 and the Arden Rd.area. I rolled down the window and stuck my head out of the vehicle to get a better look at it and I observed the object to be flying low just over the power lines and moving rather leisurely and I at this point realized that the craft did not have wings or rotors or landing struts.  The object appeared to slow just long enough for me to study its underside and I observed tha! t the skin of the craft appeared beige in color and textured and the craft itself was about the size of a full moon if not slightly larger.  There was an individual non-blinking orange light illuminating the craft and the craft made no sound.  I noticed that the craft appeared to warble slightly as it followed its trajectory. I requested to my friend that we should follow it and he immediately turned right onto Ventura Dr and stopped. We both observed the back of the craft which was illuminated orange and observed it to move over I-27 and then slowly bank to the left behind a billboard and downward toward Arden Rd.  We lost sight of it at that point and continued on to our destination.  After we started our return home we briefly drove to where we thought the craft was trying to land and found nothing.  We placed a call, upon arriving back home to the local private airport, Tradewinds Airport, and inquired about light aircraft being in the area. We were told that they were ! unaware of any aircraft in the area in question.  They stated ! however that occasionally the Randall County Sheriffs Dept flies their helicopter with unusual lights equipped. The location of the sighting is on the southern edge of the city of Amarillo and there were street lights illuminating the road and a moderate amount of traffic on I-27 for that time in the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a spectacular view of the Appalachian Mountains facing Marion, NC from near Henredon Road in Spruce Pine.  While we were eating dinner, my friend asked his brother if he&#39;d seen the UFOs lately.  I laughed, because I thought UFOs were stupid.  But his brother said not to laugh, that he had seen then EVERY NIGHT for TWO YEARS.  Sometimes, he said, the lights were so bright that his living room lit up.  I thought the man was insane.  But when it got dark, we went out on his porch with a $2,000 telescope.  For the first hour, we didn&#39;t see anything.  I was about to give up, when I saw a red dot appear over the mountain far in the distance.  It was probably a few miles away.  I looked closer, and saw it was too stable to be a jet or plane.  But it moved too much to be a tower.  Soon, another appeared.  In a time span of about 15 minutes, a total of 7 appeared.  They hovered together, and I looked throug! h the telescope at them.  They looked like prisms, flashing red and yellow.  Even through the telescope, they still looked very small, but much closer than the stars.  They changed colors about every second, but it was a gradual change, not a bright flash.  They were primarily red and yellow.  Then the scariest thing happened.  They formed a circle, and started spinning together counter clockwise.  Soon after that, they vanished, one by one.  I think the most interesting thing is that these can be seen every night.  I&#39;ve since moved away, but I would love to know if these are a government project, an optical illusion, or real UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It looked like they were the same height. One of the lights (they did not seem connected physically in any way) seemed to be changing color between bright orange and white and it appeared as if it were &#34;flipping&#34; and constantly turning. All 4 lights were hovering. These were not flares, i have seen flares before. There was no noise emitting from them and they seemed to be over the Balmoral Racetrack. I considered possibly helicopters taping an event or something - but these did not act like helicopters.  By the time I got home and ran in the house to get my camera, all the lights had gone out.  I do see lights FREQUENTLY over the racetrack and wonder if something natural is happening or explainable.  One thing I&#39;d like t! o mention is that the lights went out one by one. I have seen it before ... its sort of a horshoe shape, like a gradual rainbow - not as harsh as a horseshoe. The lights lasted maybe 10-15 minutes, by the time that I had seen them they looked bright and I thought I&#39;d have time enough to catch them on camera and film it. I now am carrying my camera hoping to catch them for submission.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked myself what it could be and assumed it was a water tower or something of the like. I turned north bound on the small back road just past blackmans corner rd. when I saw the lights again. As I continued to drive I noticed the lights were coming towards me. I said to myself &#34;this is not normal&#34; and pulled off to the side of the road. I got out of my car and walked behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was Diamond shaped about 15 feet long by 15 feet across. It was approximately 25 feet  off the ground and only about 25- 30 feet right of me. It traveled roughly 25-30 mph across the length of the field parallel the road.  It made a light humming noise.  Though the lights on it were some what distorting my view of it I could see the shape perfectly.  I could tell it was made of a metal of some kind. It almost looked bronze underneath with the lights reflecting off it.  It had two white lights, one on either side and a red light at the front of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a logical person. I do not even like Star Track but I know what I saw was nothing that could be described as anything we commonly know. Three cars drove by me as I stood there looking at the object so I am sure someone else must have seen it.<n>

Watched it descend for about a minute. It turned a bit and caught the sun. When this happened the object turned a bright metallic.  Even at the distance it was very bright. I looked down for not even a second to put something in my pocket and when I looked up again the object was gone, and so were the con trails. It was as if nothing was ever there. The sky was blue, and clear.  No clouds in sight.  NOTE: about 30 minutes after this sighting when I returned home there was a ton of air traffic.  Jets and other types of planes were either doing a grid pattern or circling around the town I live in.  I saw at least 6 different ones. Some of them were low enough to hear. This lasted for about 20 minutes.  Normally you will see 2 planes an hour here.  Two weeks ago, my co-worker also reported seeing an orange orb at the same place I saw my object that went straight up, banked left and took off at a high rate of speed.<n>

I was driving west on RT 66 coming out of Prince William County.  After you get out of prince william\Haymarket it is pretty much country open fields on either sides of RT 66. it was a bright sunny day.  Hardly any clouds in the  skys.  Then I saw a silver disk in front of me. it seem to be hoovering up in hte air. It would seem to disappear and then come back all in the same area. Then I saw a 2nd disk or what could have been a jet. It seem to chase the disk but the disk just dispeared.  The Jet seemed to go out to the North West. then about 10 minutes later it appeared to go the opposite directions. the other disk appear again.  It was like it was playing hiding in seek. then I saw this white shape object in the sky. it kindof looked like an airplane but didnt and then another one appeared. I dont knwo for somereason it was like I felt in a daze.  For some odd reason I went off Rt 66 and at Dalphlane\Paris Exit and took RT 55. I felt t! hat it was leading me off RT y66. Ifelt really weird but somehow it was like it knew I was in danger or something.  Then when traveling down RT 55 you can look over and see RT 66.  There were several cars pulled over on the West bound lanes on RT 66. they had their emergency signal on.  I say it was about 5 or 6 cars.  One guy got out of the car and looked around the car like he was kind of puzzled about what happend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the freaky think was in two of these pulled over cars, it was like the person in the car was looking over at RT 55 and looking right at me. It freaked me out.  Although I believe in UFO I never had seen one before but it seems like in the last couple of months I have seen simialr objects hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> then there has been two incidents where at last minute I decide to go another directions and within a minute I had this white van speed across the intersection not stopping at the stop sign and kind of just dispears.  At the time I thought what an ((profanity deleted)) whole but now it is kind of spoking me out.<n>

I was lying in the grass adjacent to the Queen Ka&#39;ahumanu shopping center  parking lot, which also serves as the bus station hub, awaiting the first buses arrival.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just admiring the stars. I had seen two shooting stars earlier in the evening so when this event took place my first thought was, &#34; how odd to see THREE shooting stars at once and all heading in the same direction, parallel to one another.&#34; I quickly realized that was not what I was seeing however when the three reddish/orange lights veered from my view to the right at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second thought was perhaps they were  three birds, as I could not easily discern the size and distance of the objects against the starry black sky. I thought this because they were completely silent as they flew. I readily dismissed this theory however as the had no wing &#34;flapping&#34; movement that I would easily have detected were they birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects moved swiftly across the sky and were lost to my sight as the flew to the right of where I was lying on the ground and I lost track of them as they flew toward the well lit city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not appear that these objects were lights from a single object as I remember detecting the night sky between them as they quickly passed directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never before seen Unidentified Flying Objects and seeing this really got my skin tingling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw...but whatever it or they were, was out of the ordinary. Perhaps they have something to do with the military/observatory being built atop Haleakala Crater. I would be very interested in knowing if any others saw this phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Fade In and Out of Sight<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 9, 2010 between the time of 9:20pm and 9:34pm I was driving East down Highway 98 between Gulf Breeze, Florida and Navarre, Florida. Initially, I saw one orange light about 10-15miles ahead of me. The light was dim and in about 2 seconds it became brighter and larger. It looked like a ball of light or a flame but I mistook it for a low flying plane or cell phone tower light at first. However, about 2 minutes later the orange light appeared again, dim at first then becoming brighter. The light was larger than any of the stars in the sky and was slightly higher than 45 degrees from the position of my car. As I travelled east the orange light moved from the line of sight in front of my vehicle to the left side as if it was staying in one central location as I continued to move. I saw the same light fade in and out three times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:31pm I called my boyfriend to tell him about the lights I was witnessing and was instructed to pull over to video tape the light. As I pulled off the road about a mile from the Navarre Beach Bridge I saw the light fade in and out again but this time I witnessed three other orange lights in the sky in a zigzag pattern downwards. At 9:34pm I waited with my digital camera to catch the orange lights again but after fifteen minutes of waiting nothing appeared in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the west-southwest was a very bright light in the sky, about 20 degrees off the horizon.  It was bright like a mirror shining in the sunlight, the entire thing was bright.  It was shaped like a skewed rectangle, about a third tall as it was long, which was about an inch long at arms length.  It appeared to be heading on a northerly course, which took it further down toward the horizon.  It went from a west-south west position to a westerly position in about twenty-twentyfive seconds.  My position changed about a hundred yards south during this time (in a moving vehicle, going south on the open drive).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very bright, but appeared a solid rectangle shape, no small lights - the entire thing was lit up. It didn&#39;t flare up like a meteorite might, and it appeared to retain it&#39;s symmetrical shape the entire time.  I lost sight of it at the end of the drive as I came upon some trees.  No sound, and I was probably too far away anyway.<n>

We noticed the light was moving from one position to another between flashes or sometimes staying stationary for 5 or 6 Flashes and then moving in a non repetitive manner 5 to 15 degrees of arc east and west or NE, E , W, But never in the same spot after it moved and not in a regular direction. The light pulses were quite bright when observed in the original position and when it moved to the east and then back close to the original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then moved to the east and the light was less bright and appeared to be pointing in another direction to the east and on several pulses appeared almost as a ray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then moved back west again close to the original position and then disappeared.  We could not gauge the height other than much higher than any of the aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to guess I would say something in excess of 100,000 ft.  We also tried viewing it through a pair of 10 power binoculars but it did not give any more detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the moves covered about 20 degrees in about 5 seconds or less. It was very rapid.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I said to my friend, “Hey, check that out.  What is that?”  We walked to the field by my house to get a sight free of trees and we stood looking at this deep red triangular craft.  The craft had one bright red light located off-center of the rear, but very close to centered.  The situation that shocked us the most was that we could clearly see how red the craft was.  We watched as it moved north slowly.  About a minute or two later we noticed another identical craft coming from the south on the same flight path.  We watched this one follow suit exactly as the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, call us hicks or liars, but this is what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for having a reporting system like this, and thank you for your time.<n>

Then they just vanished!  I left the parking lot in my vehicle and started driving home to the West.

The horizon was just getting orange/pink, but the majority of the sky was still blue. So I&#39;m driving and I happen to look up and see a large white/gray object in the sky. It looked like a blimp at first, but those are almost never around here and this was also an area close to an airport. What stood out was it looked like it was tilted on an angle, which didn&#39;t seem right. So I tried to keep watching as I was driving, passing by trees and buildings that would temporally block it from view, but it would always come back into view. When I looked away for a few seconds and looked back it was gone. This was a straight street too, driving right beside it. How could it fly/move away that fast when I was just looking there a few seconds ago? So I shrug it off and keep driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 10-15 seconds later I look back at the same spot in the sky and see this small, but very bright white light with this weird, very short smoke/cloud stream behind it. It was just a light too, not a plane or anything and the sky was still very bright at this time. It looked like an extremely bright little star, but in a blue sky. So I&#39;m still driving trying to watch it and come to a stop light and sit there. I look back at it and now the stream is completely gone, but it seems to be moving very slow in the sky, same with the blimp-like thing. It didn&#39;t fade away, it was like it was never there and now the light has gotten very dim, almost blinking out, then it does, but comes back a little brighter, then brighter then it blinks out and is gone all together and not a thing is in the sky there. Now I&#39;m getting weirded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that it&#39;s gone I keep looking in the same direction trying to find something, but what I see now is the weirdest of the three. I see this large, flat, saucer/disk like shape in the sky. It was colored like a cloud, a very faint white, almost transparent color like it was trying to blend into the sky. This thing is very low in the sky, right above the treetops. I come to another stop light and watch it. It slowly moves from the right to the left behind some trees in the distance, then comes back to the right. Then I notice a second, then a third. All the same size and color, but the were in a wide triangle formation now. I&#39;m almost to the store now, but trees and buildings are blocking my view so I hurry to the parking lot and park. It was a perfect view now. I sat there for about five minutes watching them move in the same area of the sky. Going back and forth, They seemed to fade away, then reappear. At times I would see only one or two or all three. They just seemed to! vanish on the spot and I couldn&#39;t see them any more and I went on with my business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The objects would constantly &#34;twinkle&#34; like a star and then suddenly emit green strobes for several seconds before switching off. This cycle would then repeat with red strobing lights. After about 45 minutes the objects completely disappeared one by one. The light that these objects emitted were  different from aircraft strobes as they were seemingly had random time intervals and were very bright when compared to other aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were being observed or chased by what appeared to be delta wing aircraft which turned their landing lights on when approaching the objects.

At first glace, I assumed a police officer had pulled someone over because the light that I was seeing was hazy, almost like police lights shinning through fog. As I began to drive home I was beginning to notice that the lights were too bright to be police lights. I decided that I wanted to investigate further, so I began driving as close to the source as I could. When I reached the source of the light, I was astonished to find that it definitely was not coming from a police car, but rather in the woods, off the road about 300 yards was a bright white light sitting on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat in my car on the road looking through the woods, the light appeared to be about the size of a SUV or large van, but it was a solid oval looking bright white light. The mysterious thing was that the lights coming off from the object was a light blueish color, but the object itself was bright white. The woods that it was sitting in was not very thick, and during the day time you can vaguely see through to the other side, so I was thinking that the object was close to the center of the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat in my vehicle in shock for about fifteen minutes, staring at the object trying to decipher what it could possibly be. Finally, around 11:45 pm the object completely blinked off. At this point, I began watching the tops of the treeline because it was a very clear night, so if something was to rise up out of the woods, it would have blocked the stars behind it. However, after about five minutes I did not see the object light up again, or leave the woods, and I was too afraid to stay any longer, and I drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about what I saw. I&#39;ve always been interested in paranormal phenomenon and UFO sightings, but I&#39;ve always tried to debunk any evidence before considering it to be unexplainable. With this object, I could not think of any explanation. I knew I had to investigate this sighting further, or else the unknown aspect of it would plague me for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily, I had the following day off of work. Right after I woke up on Tuesday morning, I immediately began figuring out how I would investigate what I saw further. I called my Dad who lived in California at the time, and told him my story. I asked what he would do if he were in my position, and he said you have to go back to the woods and try to find anything earthly to explain what you saw. I completely agreed, and immediately returned to the location of my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I parked my car in the exact same spot that I had been the night before, I stared at the woods remembering what had transpired about twelve hours ago. I began going to the houses close to the woods to try and find who owned them. When i spoke to one of the neighbors, he informed me of where I could find the owners, but after hearing my story he said, &#34;Wow that is strange! Well I can tell you this much, there isn&#39;t normally, and shouldn&#39;t be anything like that going on in the woods at that time.&#34; With my new information, I headed to the owner of the woods house. Unfortunately, no one was home, so I left a note I had written on the door with my contact information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been almost two months since the night of my sighting, and I have yet to receive any calls from the owner of the woods. I can&#39;t pass by those woods at night and think of the sighting I had on the night of November the 8th, 2010. I still do not know what it could have been in the woods that night, and apparently, I never will.<n>

As soon as I got outside, I heard jet engines and saw an odd sight. We are ten miles from Whiteman AFB, and jets, including the B-2, often fly over at all times of day. What I saw didn’t resemble anything seen before. The first thing I noticed was three small jets with two blinking white strobes (one on each wing). In front of two of the jets and next to the other, I saw multiple solid lights, like stars, moving along with the jets. As I focused on this object, I noticed that it made a square or rectangle shape, and it was a solid object, blocking out the stars as it passed in front of them. All four craft moved from west to east, directly towards Whiteman AFB. It appeared that the jets were escorting this object, and may have been for quite some time. As all the objects got within about six miles of Whiteman AFB, the fighter jets in the back broke away and flew south, slowly, but sti! ll monitoring the object. The third jet turned off the strobes and looked as if it merged with the object. It started out to the left, but went above it, then came back down right on top of it.  After that, the third jet was never seen again. It looked like it landed on the object as if it was a flying aircraft carrier or something.  As the object continued to pass closer to Whiteman AFB, it got a little lower and began to stretch out from a square shape, to more of a rectangle shape. The object then went behind the trees and was no longer seen.  The other witnesses I was speaking to on the phone said that it continued to Whiteman AFB, where it disappeared. The other two fighter jets continued to circle the area, and more showed up. At one point, there were at least ten fighter jets in the air between Whiteman AFB, and Warrensburg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the fighter jets circle a 15 mile radius around Whiteman AFB, I noticed a solid yellow light towards the east, moving north to south at a pretty high rate of speed.  The light instantly vanished and at that time I saw what I thought was a shooting star go right to where the yellow light vanished.  As I thought about it more, it seemed strange because the “shooting star” that I saw was more of a green beam of light, which didn’t resemble the typical shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked with the other witnesses to the event, and they saw a similar event happen with the “shooting star,” but at the north end of Whiteman, instead of the south. Later on I went outside and noticed another beam of green light go through the sky at the same angle as the previous one.<n>

Michigan Street and Porto Alegre<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a college student in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was around 6:26 P.M. on 11/7/2010 when I was standing on the sidewalk of W. Michigan Street that lead back to campus apartment housing at IUPUI (my college).  We usually have a lot of airplanes and helicopters around here, and at first I thought it was an airplane until I realized that it was flying way too low, but then I realized that it must have been a helicopter. I couldn’t have been more wrong I realized, as I looked up and saw a circular object flying right up above me, moving straight in the direction I was facing. It was huge, and if a full moon were out, I would have to say that from my perspective, I would have to say that maybe 15-17 full moons would be equal to the size of it. I’d like to give a better comparison, but I was in a state of shock. I did spend what felt like a long time gazing at it, although in actuality, only about 2 minutes had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, but being in the city, it appears as pitch black because of the city lights. It was either flying really low, or it was extremely huge.  I feel stupid for not thinking about getting a picture, but I was in total shock, as I don’t really believe in UFOs, or at least didn’t until now, and even now I’m still skeptical. I did, however, try my best to draw a picture afterwards, even though I’m not good at drawing. The UFO had red lights on it. If I remember correctly, I’d say about 3 of 4 of them, and I believe that red light was coming from the center as well. Since I was looking up at it, all I could see was what it looked like directly underneath. It looked like the stereotypical UFO, or flying saucer, in most aspects. Besides being a perfect circle, it looked like what a mushroom looks like from underneath, whereas you can see the edges of what might be a domed top from below, and striations leading towards the center. Most of the red lights were towards th! e exterior, with the exception of the center (where the stem of a mushroom would be). Here was where more red light emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two things struck me as odd that distinguished this when compared to the stereotypical portrayal. For one thing, the front of the ship had a silver section, which reminded me of a bird shape since the shape had three corners. Secondly, I think that there may have been a protrusion at the base of it, which logically made me think that maybe somebody was playing a prank and it was actually some type of blimp because of how it glided forward, but it seemed much too big to logically call it this. There was no logical explanation for what happened. I went back to the apartment building and called my grandpa to tell him what I saw because I felt like I needed to tell someone that wouldn’t make fun of me. I made this call at 6:34P.M., and stepped through the back door of the apartment complex. I was partway into the conversation when I saw the object again flying over the apartment building, even though I thought it had already passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point a passerby was walking down the sidewalk and saw me looking in shock up at the sky. He then saw the object too and said that it “sure is a wide airplane”. (He didn’t see it until it was going off into the distance.) I said that “was definitely no airplane.” This second encounter lasted until 6:37P.M., so it was three minutes long. This second encounter took place on Porto Alegre Street, and again the object continued moving in the same direction until it got past the river, where it ascended up and disappeared into the sky. A girl walking a ways behind me during the first incident didn’t bother looking up because she thought it was a helicopter and was busy texting, and was shocked when I told her what I saw. I was kind of angry that she hadn’t looked up and I was the only one that saw this the first time, but I extremely glad that someone else saw it the second time to prove that I wasn’t the only person that saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, the IUPUI campus apartments are near the Ronald McDonald House, which is not far from the hospital. This area is extremely easy to find on Google Maps, however, for some reason it doesn’t show Porto Alegre, but the street that the UFO went across to get to the river is White River Pkwy E.

There has been a time change here so it gets a little darker than usual, (no stars were visible only the moon) as it was still light out and I could see a crescent moon was shining.  I spotted what I thought to be an airplane and followed it I thought it was a little odd as it kept the same shape like a plane, I saw a red bright light flash once for 3 seconds (I thought it might be the sun reflecting off the structure) as it proceeded to pass from right to left on a similar path with the car and it was in appeared to be in-front of the car.  It took about 4 minutes for this to occur. It was directly in front of the car by 500-600 feet at about 300 feet high.  You could make out a plane shape, but it seemed a little odd as the front of the plane looked like an arrow head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The was no smoke trails or anything and the object seemed to be high up but for the size of the plane shape it seemed odd that it looked so large.  I am familiar with aerial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I notice is an object at a 45 degree angle from us.  The original plane object is gone.  The new object was right of the moon and appeared to be hovering or hardly moving. (to the right of the car about 200 feet out and 300 feet up hovering)  It was not a plane shape but an X shape object.  By all account I would think it was a plane until It lite up along the bottom like a burner on a stove, It looked like a giant fire donut the same size as the object underneath ;and about half as thick as the object itself.  It looked to be like an X shape.  It was not some reflection from the sun as it was too bright, like a bright pinkish/red glow of a torch. It hurt your eyes to look at the flame part.  My daughter was in the back seat looking at it as I pointed it out that something strange was in the sky.  We watched it ( 3-4 seconds) as it powered up with a clean burning flame on the bottom then a tree blocked our view and 2 secs later it was gone.  (The bottom lit up! , 4 trees blocked our view and looked and it was gone. )  No planes could be seen in the sky or surrounding area I had a view of 50 degrees or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sounds odd, but I got the feeling what I was looking at was not there.  The image of the x shape craft looked dark and shimmery but the fire burner shape flame underneath was the clear part of the craft.   I know what flares look like in the sky, I know what helicopters look like and I know what jets and planes look like.  This was something that could hover and shoot a clean flame underneath.  It seemed to be like powered up.  It was like seeing a florescent sign ,  It was really bright.  I dont&#39; see how anyone could of missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to disprove or explain what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 miles in the same direction as the object we later saw a tower (in Newberry) with a red light flashing it was about 75 feet tall.  This could not be seen from our vantage point of what we were seeing.  About 8 minutes later when we parked at &#34;BackYard BBQ&#34; (where we were eating) we noticed a high flying jet arrived in the area, really high up that left 2 trails.  It was flying south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the ufo was higher in the sky I might of been able to write it off as a satellite or something but it was only like 300 feet off the ground and not far from our car.  My daughter saw this thing as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe we have aircraft that has a giant circular engine along the bottom  It was like the same length as the object itself no lights could be seen on the object, just the clean flame along the bottom.  Then 2 seconds later it is gone from the entire sky view. no clouds nothing but the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along the road, after you pass a Rock Plant, there is no businesses or lights and the road follows along the side of rail road tracks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this in the event someone else sees the same thing in the area.  I tried to give as much detail as I could.<n>

The route I drive is by a heavly traveled fly zone.  It is not uncommon to see up to 7 jet contrails at one time.   On November 8, 2010, at about 4:00pm I noticed a reflective object in the sky.  The sun reflected off of this object.  The object was traveling east at about the same speed a prop driven airplane would be moving.  I did not see the shape of this object, just the silvery reflection.  I was about ready to stop watching it.  The object changed directions by going 90 degrees north of it&#39;s original direction. The object did so very rapidly and then speed off from my sight. It&#39;s height in the sky was about that of a normal prop driven airplane.  I could not determine the size of it either. This object did not leave any contrails or noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This happened about 5 or 6 times until the flashes got dimmer quite quickly as if moving away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area of stars I was looking at would have been about &#39;Orion&#39; at the time, maybe slightly to the west of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in a very rural area with a lot of trees.  I thought nothing of this since there are a lot of small private airports near my house and I always see small planes in this area but not usually right over the trees or near the high tension lines.  As I approached the clearing where the high tension towers are I saw a giant craft approaching.  At first I thought it was a military cargo plane that was on the wrong flight path and way too low.  It was at least fifty feet wide and had five bright lights across the front but no strobes.  As it got closer I could see that it was no plane.  I stopped my van and got my cellphone and frantically tried to get it into camera mode as it approached to no avail.  It passed directly over my head at approximately 100 feet from ground level.  This was easy to measure since it was up twice as high as the high tension towers.  It made a very low rumbling sound but not at all like a military cargo plane.  I know what they look and sound like as they pass overhead as I have done work at the FAA in A.C. and at McGuire Air force base.  I could clearly see an aqua/blue colored light in the very center underneath the craft.  It was pulsing slowly but again, no strobes.  And I could also clearly see that it was in the shape of a triangle not a plane.  It glided slowly away following the high tension lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was see by another person who was driving on route 55.  They reported it to Mufon.<n>

The object came into  the Atmosphere moving to the West with the speed of a Shooting Star but this object was much larger and as it entered it slowed somewhat,  It was bright with a orange tint at first. As I turned and said “look at that” the Object moved to the Southwest then Back to the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object moved with Great Precision.  It looked like a Laser Bouncing off Mirrors it was so precise.  The Object moved to the West and a Very Fast Speed, Much faster than a Plane, This I know because Memphis has a lot of Air Traffic, this Object was moving at double the Speed of any Plane, But as it headed to the west about 40 or 50 seconds, it moved again back to the North W! est what looked like into its Original Flight Path, The Object flew to the West getting smaller and smaller till it looked like it became stationary then it faded away. The reason I know this was something not normal is the way it moved to the left and right and the light was visible while moving away from us.   I’m not sure what it was, but we both saw it and confirmed how it moved and come into the Sky.<n>

It was early November 2010, I was driving to my mother&#39;s house for her birthday.  I was traveling West on Route 2 from Gardner to South Hadley MA.  It was some time in the afternoon and the sky was sort of pinkish and had soft clouds, very pretty, which is why I was paying attention to the sky.  I looked up and to the right at one point and froze, because I saw what looked like a silvery, sheer orb sort of sitting in the low clouds.  It was reflecting the colors of the sky and clouds around it so at times it would be pinkish, almost like a bubble where, you mostly see the edges but they are iridescent.  I started to say, &#34;Is that...?&#34; when my boyfriend spotted it too and started tracking it.  As I was driving, I couldn&#39;t stare at it constantly, but for a few minutes as we drove along, I could see it, a perfect shiny bubble, then it would fade out and disappear, only to reappear on the other side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was beginning to wonder what it was that I was looking at or was I just seeing things, when at least a half dozen, possibly more, jets began to chase this thing. I could see 3-4 on either side of the highway and it looked like they were trying to corral this thing.  They would send forward jets in a step like-pattern (jets at several altitudes and coming in from both sides)and get fairly close to this thing before it would disappear and reappear away from the main pack of jets.  At one point both my boyfriend and I laughed about it a little because it seemed clear that this thing was playing with the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe 10mins or less of chasing this silvery ball, it disappeared and never came back and eventually the jets left as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I quickly got in my car and on my way home the object was still in the same position (on my right) once I got to a stop light I noticed far ahead to me, 3 amber lights in the shape of a triangle, I thought it was street lights but then I realized it was too up in the sky to be street lights.  Then when I entered the Haledon/Prospect Park area I saw that the blueish green orb had moved to that triangle object and stayed with it like they were communicating.  Once I got into the Haledon area it was hard for me to see the sky and where those objects were.  But from what I think I think they might of been hovering the North Haledon reservoir or Wanaque.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say I was extremely terrified even more terrified to pull out my phone and snap a picture or video...I couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I formerly was enlisted in the United States Navy and was attached to an Intruder squadron.  I have seen almost all types of military and civilian aircraft and am familiar with flight mechanics.  Also I was not under any influence of any drugs or alcohol.  I am normal and healthy with no history of mental illness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> November, 7th 2010/6:50am  I was returning home from work traveling East on Hwy 14 near Eagle Lake, MN.  Upon clearing a crest in the hill I noticed a bright blinding light to the East about 300 to 400 feet in the air.  Having experience in the aviation field my first thought was that it had to be landing lights of an airplane since there was a local airport only a couple miles away.  The object was at the time was between 1 and 1.5 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After traveling 30-40 seconds the light neither moved in altitude or distance.  It appeared to be stationary. I started approaching the object driving about 55 MPH.  As I got closer I was able to start to distinguish the shape of the object.  Initially it looked just like a ball of light.  As I could start to make out features it looked like a shiny metallic surface with intense light shining from the underside of the object.  At this point I was able to eliminate airplanes, jets, and helicopters as possible objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not being able to Identify it as any aircraft I know.  I attempted to turn to a second line of reasoning. The object looked similar to a giant Mylar foil balloon.  Based on the size of the tree&#39;s below the object it was about the size of a normal 3 bedroom home.  My thought at the time was perhaps they were trying out a new type of weather balloon or I also heard that the military was trying out new dirigibles to patrol the boarders between the United States and Canada.  Perhaps it could have been one of those.  As I approached, the object started moving west the same direction I was heading.  ((sic.  Witness was going east.  Please see below.  PD))  I was traveling at the posted rate of speed 55 yet the object was pulling away quickly.  Having no cars in front of me and knowing the road was straight I accelerated to about 85mph in an effort to get closer. *never will I condone breaking the law but something was obviously not right.  At this point the object swiftly pulled away veered North and shot across the sky at an extreme rate of speed.  After about 8 to 12 seconds it was out of my visual range. Total elapsed time from first sighting, until loss of visual was about 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was in my car driving at highway speeds I was unable to hear any type of engine noise.  There were no vapor trails.  To reference how fast this object was moving..  I have seen F-14&#39;s flying at full speed.  This object was moving at least twice that speed.  And I also know that any soft surface of a dirigible would not be able to hold up at those speeds therefore the surface had to be solid.  I cannot tell you what this was.  I can tell you what it was not.  I told my now ex-wife about it and she seemed quite skeptical..  The only other person I have told about this is my sister.  And It sounds crazy..  If I heard someone telling it I would think they sounded crazy..  But I cannot forget about it.  And the least I can do is report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just noticed I switched my east and west up in the second to last paragraph.. I was heading east.  I was never heading west. I always took Hwy 14 west in to work, and Hwy 14 east from work.  I was returning home.  A misprint on my part spell check did not catch it.<n>

I asked my husband to look out the window as I saw a strange object moving in a very strange pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He got up and looked at it as well.  We watched this object for close to an hour before we decided to go to sleep.  We used binoculars and our video camera to observe the object in more detail.  My husband is an amateur astronomer and quickly ruled out a star, planet, comet or satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was blinking red, blue and green lights but could not have been a  commercial jet because it would have passed over our house or moved out of sight within a few minutes.  While the object stayed in the same area of the sky it was not stationary.  It changed position in reference to the stars by slowly gaining or losing altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was impossible to judge the distance from our location but seemed distant relative to our vantage point.  Looking throu! gh our binoculars it was clear that there was a constant undulation of lights with white light being the most prominent, and red and blue being very clear and green only occasionally visible.<n>

As I made the crest of a hill, I suddenly saw white lights that looked like the size of a light bulb cross the road going from west to east at what looked to be no higher than 5-10 feet off of the ground.  Now, they were probably about ½ mile away, so they may have been more the size of a basketball. They were going in a perfect straight line, one right after the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I was seeing a reflection of something, so I removed my glasses, and I could still see them. They just kept coming one right after the other, and I kept anticipating for this to stop, but it never did for what seemed like a long amount of time, but was realistically only 10-15 seconds. They moved very swiftly and in a perfect rhythmic pattern or tempo. Like I said,  one right after the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They went into the trees or what you might call a forest area off to the east, and I didn’t see them anymore.  It happened so fast and they just came out of nowhere, so unexpectedly, that I have no idea as to what these were. I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I hope I never do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove on down to where they crossed and there were some horses in a field not far away,  that were all huddled together, like they were spooked.  This was in the broad daylight with the sun out, a real nice day. I can’t explain it, and I even called the Sheriffs department later that evening to ask if anyone had reported seeing anything strange around the old reservoir, but no one had.  I didn’t give my name, as I thought they may think I was crazy!  I can’t get this out of my head, and I replay it every day in my mind. If you can tell me what I saw, that would be great..<n>

Correction of date from 11/2 to 11/6/2010<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the passenger seat of our SUV, my wife observed an object in the sky, she called my attention to it, as I drove at about 20-25 mph through city streets near our home. What we saw was a very shiny, reflective, silver, metallic, mostly spherical object, with a somewhat smaller, delta shaped lower section at its base.  It appeared in plain sight, its skin and contours sleek.  The object was to our east, alternately moving through the sky from north to south and hovering.  We remarked to each other that this was nothing like the planes we often see in our neighborhood, which is on the local international airport flightpath. It also did not look like a weather balloon or anything like a balloon.  The weather was clear and there were few if any clouds and no obstructions to our field of view.  The object was moving at less than 1000 feet over the horizon, and its widest, its size was probably about 10-15 feet. I happened to have a camera in my vehicle, I reached ! to grab it so I could take pictures, we both turned away for a moment, but the object had disappeared as we turned to look at it again. The object&#39;s altitude was high enough that if it had been a conventional plane, we would have still seen it moving, either descending or ascending over the horizon, as any other plane that flew to or away from the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later, looking out to the sky in the southwest, still in our general vicinity, we observed what appeared to be a delta shaped, bottom side of a flying aircraft, maybe a military fighter jet. The color of the bottom side of the craft was dark or perhaps black and the craft was moving fast at about the same altitude, moving from east to west and appeared to be banking sharply away to the south, in the direction of the international airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

From the back deck, I have a view of a set of low hills to the north of the town where I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a bluish-white light travelling westward along the line of the hills.  Initially, I thought that there must be a road along the ridge and I was seeing a car travelling along it.  After several seconds, however, the light moved downward from my vantage point on another hill (meaning that the object appeared superimposed on the ridge line but was in fact between my location and the hills behind it) and moved back toward the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving about 5 degrees eastward, the light moved upward, passing above the top of the hills from my vantage point, and then moved back westward.  The object did not rise to a high altitude because there are two radio towers visible to the north of my position, and the object did not appear to move higher than the top of either tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object make numerous loops over a period of about ten minutes.  I estimate that the angular distance covered by the object from one side of the loop to the other was about five degrees.  The time required to cross this distance was five seconds-I timed it.  I later did a &#34;back of the envelope&#34; calculation to determine the object’s speed.  Assuming that the hills are three miles from my position, and that the end points of the object’s loop were equidistant from me (not true, but close enough to get an estimate), then we solve the triangle that results given that we know two sides and the included angle.  The distance from one side of the loop to the other is roughly one-quarter of a mile, and the object crossed this distance in five seconds.  The necessary speed works out to roughly 180 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This speed is consistent with a small aircraft, but I could see no indication of lights other than the object itself, which appeared as a bluish-white light.  I’ve seen small biplane aircraft do aerobatic maneuvers at low altitude before, but only out in the country, and never over an area as densely settled as eastern Massachusetts.  And again, if it was an aircraft, where were the other lights?  The object appeared to me to be a light.  I did not see any suggestion of size or shape: what I saw was visible only as a point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were low-lying clouds that morning. There was sufficient light to see by, but the sun had not yet come up; frankly, the ambient light is not really relevant here anyway, because there is so much light pollution in eastern Massachusetts that I can see the outline of the hills even in the middle of the night because there are towns on the other side of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally left off watching the object because I had to finish getting ready for work, but it was still making its loops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college instructor of history, with more than 20 years worth of experience in amateur astronomy.

I had never seen a red light like this before or on top of this hill.  I began to drive around the other side of the hill to see what was going on and by the time I got there the object flashed away.  I drove back to the other side just to make sure someone wasn&#39;t up on the hill and trying to mess with me. I  believe this was the same ufo from the night before or same type.<n>

It was an oval shaped object with 5 Orange-red lights. They were arranged so that there was one large red light on each side of the object, with a small red light below each large light but closer towards the center of the craft.  The fifth was in the center of the craft. It blocked stars, so we could see that it had an ovular shape.  It was static, and did not move. Then it abruptly disappeared, instantaneously. It never had a sound.<n>

As I approached the backside of my deck  I saw an oval shaped bright light which appeared to be only a few hundred feet above the tallest trees in the distant woodline.  I did notice an airplane thousands of feet higher and to the east of the light I could barely remove my eyes from.  This light moved slowly east to west and I follwed it until it went out, like a light, or it just vanished.  I am really unsure although I did choose to not enter my residence for my camera due to deciding to relish the moment and stare in amazement.  I am convinced that this was no aircraft due to my 2 small children and their desire to find airplanes in the night sky with mommy and daddy while out on the deck in the warmer months.  I also briefly compared this &#34;light&#34; to the airplane that I ob! served seconds after witnessing what I saw tonight.  Oddly, I have a close colleague at work whom also witnessed something similar to what I saw tonight although it has been close to 2 months now and he reported red and orange colored lights opposed to the solid orangish light glow I saw tonight.  I have recently in the past year began to educate myself on UFO&#39;s, Nephilim, and Spiritual Warfare.  I have a foreboding sense that tonight may be linked to my studies or I may just be paranoid.....I will report more if anything else is witnessed.<n>

At first, I thought it was fireworks display and then a missile  500 Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> While facing North (slightly to the West) towards Ventura, I witnessed the following:  In the distant sky, anywhere from 10 miles or further) a bright while light with various coloration changes appeared.  At first it appeared to be slowly rising on the horizion and then a long red and bluish flame shot out for about 20 seconds from behind and the white light turned slight and shot off toward a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything about the event appeared to be conventional except two things. First the way the object initially appeared in the sky did not appear to be conventional and secondly I cannot understand why the missile or craft would glow with a bright white.  After the flames were gone you could still see what looked to now be a bright white light disappearing into the night.  We see many planes and helicopters in our area at night and although the lights on the planes and copper are visible, the fuselage/body of the planes are very hard to see.  There were no notable navigational lights on the object either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if anyone in Ventura count saw this craft.  At first, I thought it was going to be some type of fireworks display and then when the flames kicked on it looked like a missile and for the record acted just like a missile.  But I am not aware of missiles that have glowing fuselages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am unsure of the exact time, but it was between 8pm and 10pm.<n>

We were walking out of our complex when I saw to the North West an object coming towards us high in the sky and proceeded down the ocean (southeast) which I thought to be a Large rocket because it was Glowing Fire and was Orange Racing Across the Sky but it was very high up and going up at a slant.  It continued to do this for about a minute on fire and then the fire went out and the object was white and glowing….. Totally white and like a dot,  kind of how a plane would appear in the sky from a long distance away.  The glow flew over the sky about the speed of a plane but a tad faster and leveled off out over the ocean where it started to arch down towards the ocean.  We watched it as it grew smaller and smaller and went out then it came on again for just a second and then went out completely.  At this time it was almost directly out in front of us out over the! ocean and the Port Hueneme Pier but pretty far out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that we were blown away and I wanted to get back in the house to Google it or see if I could find out what happened.  As we were walking back to the Condo A Huge Jumbo jet, flew over us from the north fairly low (This never happens right over the condos) and then another came about 5 seconds after that both going out over the ocean to the same area the object disappeared and then towards the east like towards Point Mugu.<n>

I stepped out on the front porch, which faces south, and happened to glance to the west.  There is a power line that goes across the street.  Flanking the power line were two disc shaped objects that glowed with a brilliant yellowish-white hue.  I watched them for a few minutes and noticed that these objects were moving, not with the scattered cloud cover, but diagonally towards the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved a little bit to try to get a better look and then noticed 4 - 5 jets flying high altitude with vapor trails. 1 of the jet&#39;s went by near the objects. 2 went by closer to my location.  And another went by further behind the objects. The one that went behind the objects was extremely noticeable as it literally went behind the object.  Finally, as I finished my cigarette and decided to come into report - I saw yet a third disc shaped object.  I came in and told my partner&#39;s dad.  We both went out and looked and the three objects and the jets were all gone. I&#39;m baffled.<n>

I let my dog loose to run around. It was just about 8:15 pm. I had noted earlier that it was a particularly clear night, and paused in the park to observe the sky. I was looking at a bright light in the southern sky, trying to determine what planet it was. Suddenly, five points of light in a v-formation appeared to my left, which was to the south-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was surprised because I had been observing the area for some time, and there was no incremental appearance of these lights.  Suddenly, they were just there. There was one light leading, with two on either side, making a &#34;v&#34;.  As it passed over the stars, I could interpolate certain features. Like I said, it was v-shaped, with the wings angled so that the inside length of the &#34;v&#34; were slightly longer than the outside.  The lights were quite dim, which was unusual.  Planes usual advertise their presence. The running lights, if that’s what they were, looked dim, but quite distinct.  The entire time I was watching this object, I tried to find some sort of reason for it, but nothing quite fit. As it passed over, there was no noise whatsoever.  I waited for the sounds of a jet-wake, but there was none. There was also a &#34;smoothness&#34; and certainty to the motion that I had never seen before.  It passed from the southeast to the northwest, going from over my position to the trees and hori! zon in a matter of about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I judged the craft to be a little larger than a fighter jet, cruising at about 1,000-2000 ft.  At that height, the craft had to be moving very swiftly.  If it was larger and higher, it was moving at incredible speeds.  There were no alterations in altitude.  My first thought was that it was a glider with unusual lighting, but its shape, rapidity, and lack of deviation, made me dismiss that theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  At the trajectory that I saw this object, it should have flown slightly to the southwest of the Air Control center in Longmont.<n>

Its very dark out where I was soo you can see anything. I went to start my car and when doing so it didn&#39;t turn over at all I gave it a minute to get all the electricity running threw it and then tried it again and it worked.  I thought nothing of it until all this happened.  As I then began to leave I started noticing what I thought was a very BRIGHT star.  When slowing down my vehicle I noticed that it wasn&#39;t a star and it was deffinetly moving. I quickly did a U turn and as I did it had either flashed or moved very quickly to the other side of a hill.  I began chasing this bright white object up to the next hill.  The object began speeding up and moved accross the county heading west toward a radio tower.  I ended up on top of the hill where it was.  The object began to change colors to a deep red and/or a orange(it went back and forth) and then headed back to where it was , where I was at in my vehicle.  The object stopped in mid air for several minutes doing nothing and began heading back out west and a rapid pace. When looking for a reason why I noticed a airplane heading in its direction.  It was a military aircraft not sure which kind to call it just know because of the use of night lights.  I left once I saw it heading in the same direction as myself.  Approximately 15 mins later when I was closer to where i needed to be at that moment I did see a UAV overhead.  Yeah you can see UAV&#39;s at night.

While driving I tried counting the lights on the crafts, in which neither formation appeared to be moving, starting with the further away craft. I believe it had 5 or 6 lights, but while counting, the craft closer to me began tilting.  Both where horizontal to the ground but this one turned completely vertical.  I was heading south and they where seen through the front windshield on the passanger side.  As it got all the way vertical, it waited for a second before turning westward. I could see hundreds of little dimmer lights along the bottom. It took off rather quickly, almost looking like a plane with no body, just wings.  I tried to see the other craft but it was miles away, then I noticed the closer craft was miles away too.  In less than a mile of driving both crafts went from close by and horizontal to the ground to tilting and moving across! town, in just seconds.<n>

I was headed out this evening with my binoculars to look into the park.  I noticed what first appeared to be a campfire or a large bonfire at the highest peak of the Chisos.  When I looked through my binoculars, I saw stars around it and realized it was in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband from the house and he looked at it through the binoculars for several seconds as I atched the object slowly move across the sky in a west-southwesterly direction.

A a semi-rural part of Washington County. I noticed two bright white lights a few hundred feet in the air over a cornfield. At first I thought the lights were headlights on a low flying airplane. They were spaced 50 feet or so apart. I also noticed a smaller red blinking light in between the two white lights that appeared to blink in different places, moving left and right. After watching it for a minute it never appeared to move. I then thought maybe it was lights on a tower but I drive by this field often and I never noticed a tower or lights. I drove by it very slow. It was approximately 300 yards from me. The road wraps around the field so I saw the lights from several angles. They never moved with the exception of the blinking red light. I got to the end of the road and the light weren&#39;t visible any more from where I was at. I decided to circle around and have another look. It! took me 5 or 6 minutes to get back around to where I saw the lights and I couldn&#39;t find them. After a minute of searching I saw them further away and faint in the distance. Probably 1000 yards or more away. I called my girlfriend and told her that I was chasing lights. I came to the end of Natural Well Road and I turned left onto Falling Waters Road. I drove for 20 seconds or so when I saw two bright lights just above the trees. shining through the tree limbs like headlights in the sky just in front of me. I was still on the phone explaining to my girlfriend what I was seeing. I was driving slow as the road curved around a country church to my left. I noticed two men standing outside of the church but they seemed to be oblivious to the lights above. Just above and behind the church I could see the two white light. I followed the road around. Behind the church was a line of trees that opened up into a small field- actually a large yard to a house nearby. Just beside the lin! e of trees is where I had a close encounter with something. To! the lef t of my car approximately 30 feet and at the top of the trees approximately 40 feet in the air I saw what appeared to be something hovering. Attached were 4 lights. One on each point of the object. There was also a red blinking light somewhere on the object. The object made no sound but it was floating and it actually tilted forward toward me allowing me to see it&#39;s diamond shape. It was dark so it was difficult to tell if there were four points or three, it may have been triangle shape but it had four white lights and a red blinking light. At one point I thought I saw a small purple light and a green light. The object seemed to tilt forward and then all the way on it&#39;s side. It moved like a feather floating on the wind. I was still on the phone with my girlfriend. When I realized what I was actually seeing I told her &#34;Oh my God. It&#39;s a triangle...it has four lights..it&#39;s a UFO babe!&#34; I told her that I was certain that I was witnessing a space craft. At that point I lost cel! l phone service with her.I was terrified! I continued to drive away very slowly while trying to redial her number. I got a busy signal so I tried again. I got her voicemail, then I tried again. Finally I reconnected the whole time I was too frightened to look out the window to see where the craft was. I drove for a minute or two longer and the road came to a dead end. I turned the car around fearing that I had to drive back from where I spotted the object. Slowly I drove back scanning the sky for lights. I drove right to where I had the encounter and there was nothing there. The lights were gone. I was shaking and still scared but I looked around for a few second and could find nothing of what I just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark and dry with overcast skies.  As I was making my way I saw four very bright white lights symmetrically placed on a craft that I thought was an aircraft. Those lights were pointed south parallel to 75.  Each outboard light was approximately 100 feet from the centerline of the craft and each inboard light was approximately 40 ft from the centerline of the craft. The white lights were brighter and more white than white lights I have seen on aircraft.  However, the brightness of these lights did not bother my eyes.  As I watched this craft I kept on saying to myself  “this is a big aircraft.”   As I got closer to 675 I realized this craft  did not seem to be moving.  Then I said to myself, “ this must be the lights at the Dayton Mall.”   Then I started into my turn onto 675. I rolled down my driver’s window as I was now moving in front of whatever this was.   As I looked at this thing I realized it was not part of the Dayton Mall lighting because it was sitting over a very dark and empty field.  This object whatever it was, was not illuminating the space below its lights, but its lights were pointed dead ahead and whatever this object was it sat about three hundred feet above the ground.  I said to myself “ what is that?”  Then all of a sudden the object started moving ahead and to its left. Wow what is that?  Then I realized it was heading towards 675.  Then I realized it was going to cross 675.  Then I realized it was going to cross 675 right in front of me. Now I watched this craft through my side window and then through my front window.  It was going about 60 mph at about 300 feet above the ground.  As it crossed in front of me I said “Oh my God it is a ring.”   But the rear of this craft was bathed in soft red light and I saw a three-disk type solid structure.  The larger disk was on the bo! ttom.  The middle disk was a smaller diameter than the bottom d! isk and the top disk was an even smaller diameter than the middle disk.   But I could not see where the soft red light was coming from. However, as I watched it fly by I saw a very strange pattern of light on the rear right-side rings of this craft.  This pattern of light covered only a relatively small area.  The pattern of light was a series of black pulses of light or something blanking out the red illumination of this craft.  It was very strange.  There were about 6 black pulses in a row.  Each pulse was about 2 feet square.  They were not constant in time. There seemed to be a fast repetition rate.  I then lost sight of the craft out of my passenger side window. This was a rush hour.  So I could not safely pursue this craft.  And I could not safely pull off of 675 without causing an accident Now what was this craft?   I have no idea. It was not an airliner.  There were no wings.  It made no noise. No it was not a blimp.  The craft was very thin.  There were many cars on 675 and 75.  When this craft crossed 675 (west-bound first and then east bound next) it had to have been seen by many people.  It was so big and slow and right above the heavy traffic.  But I have not seen any reports on the sighting of this craft at all.  Now I must say I could not see any structure of this craft when I was in front of it or when it was flying towards me other than its bright lights.  However, only when it was passing in front of me did I see its 3-disk type structure.  From the side view, this craft was big.  The front-view of this craft was very wide because of the distances of the bright white lights from the centerline of this craft.  However, I saw no fuselage as I looked at it from the front. This craft made no noise.<n>

I saw a very small dot that flashed. It was so high it could not be a plane.  We both saw it flash a couple more times then disappeared.  It was hard to see being so very high.  The flashing seemed to be it catching the the sunlight and reflecting it.  It moved slowly across the sky.<n>

It was a bright sunny day, about 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and about 12:20 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside of my SUV and was getting ready to use my cell phone, when something shiny or flashing caught my eye up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up, I saw what looked like something metallic reflecting the light of the sun – or so I initially thought – so I assumed it must be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited a few seconds to see the shape of the airplane come though as moved across the sky, but that didn’t happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at it, it appeared to just be a metallic, spherical shape, but what I thought was the reflection of the sun shinning off it’s surface, turned out to be a constant flashing light emanating from what appeared to be the center area of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling in an eastward to westward direction, relatively in a parallel path along the San Bernardino Mountains, but a couple of miles away from them. It also appeared to be at a somewhat lower altitude than what I’ve seen commercial passenger airliners fly at, and probably more likely at an altitude similar to what I’ve seen the smaller Cessna type airplanes at.  It was above the background view of the mountains, which means it was silhouetted against a clear cloudless blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also guess it was traveling at a speed similar to what I’ve seen airplanes fly at, so I would guess 200-400 mph, but it would be hard for me to guess more accurately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So as I realized that it did not look like an airplane, or that the shape didn’t “change” as it flew from the east to the west to reveal any other part of the vehicle, I started to think that perhaps it actually was an Unidentified flying object – at least I couldn’t say what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the entire duration of the sighing, which maybe lasted 30 seconds as it flew out of distance in the west, the shape visible to me was only a bright silvery metallic spherical one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the most outstanding feature of it was – upon later reflection – the bright flashing light that emanated seemingly from the center of the craft. It was very bright, as to be seen very brightly, even in the middle of this clear sunny day at noon. It flashed maybe one to one and a half times a second approximately, and it was completely constant, as you would expect to see from the lights on an airplane for instance. In this case though, the flashing light was big and bright enough, that from my perspective, when it flashed, you could not see any of the craft through or behind the flashing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to guess, I’d say the object was maybe a mile away, and about 30-50 feet diameter, but it’s very hard to say, and I could be off by quite a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I heard no noise coming from the object, but I was not close enough to hear anything unless it had been very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was disappearing in the distance, maybe 5 miles away to the west over perhaps the neighboring town of Clairmont or perhaps already La Verne, I could still see the flashing very bright, even though the object itself was hardly even visible any more. As it disappeared completely, the flashing was still visible, though just faintly now, and then that too disappeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time the vehicle did not seem to slow down or accelerate, or deviate off of a perfectly straight course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really put it in perspective, as to the fact that the object was in fact about that size, altitude, and shape, is that as it was disappearing out of sight, a passenger airliner was going from a south to north direction, presumably taking off from the neighboring Ontario International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airliner was a little higher up, but the shape was unmistakable as that of an airplane, even though it was farther and higher than the sphere had been when it had been closer to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And there were no visible lights flashing from the airliner, even though I believe they keep their wing lights on, but in any case, no lights were visible in the bright sunny day, and no reflections at all were seen bouncing off of the airplane or anything like that. The shape was unmistakable as that of an airplane, from the time it first came into view, until it went out of sight in a northward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 minutes or 3, after both the spherical object, and the airliner went out of view, another airplane crossed over to the west, going from a more or less southeast direction to a northwest one. This airplane was traveling at what I assume is standard commercial jetliner elevation, since it seemed pretty high up, but again, the shape of it as being of an airplane, was unmistakable, and no light or reflections coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only as I put all of those things together, that afterwards I was pretty convinced that I had seen something very unique and quite possibly a UFO.  And I mean “UFO” in the truest sense, because it was truly unidentifiable to me, and it was flying.  It could be some military craft, or yes, I guess what people typically call a “UFO” – a craft from other than our time / space / or dimension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it was absolutely not a conventional airplane, or helicopter, or whether balloon, or cloud, or falling satellite.<n>

UFO= Un-identified Flying Object<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard about you guys on Coast to Coast AM, so I have decided to share my story.  My story differs from most on Coast to Coast in one way: lights.  I live about 40 miles north of Vandenburg Air Force base.  They are the western United States site for launching satelites.  I dont exactly remeber the dates when this experience occured so the day might be a little off.  Vandenburg was supposed to launch a missle at 9:30 PM on the night in question.  I enjoy watching the missles launch so I always try to observe them.  The night was clear and there was no wind or moon shining.  A perfect night for a missle launch.  I was sitting on my back porch, which looks south, waiting to watch the event.  10:15 rolls around and still no launch.  They usually run late.  So, being stubborn and having wonderful weather, I stick around and start going through constellations in the night sky.  At this point I had been looking at the night sky for a while.  From the north an obj! ect, cloaked, flies by at an alarming rate headed south.  The only reason the object caught my eye is that it blacked out the stars behind it.  There were no lights.  It came into my view and was gone in less than five seconds.  My story tells of a UFO with no lights.  Im sure a rare sighting.  If I had to guess the shape, I would say a diamond shape or that of the Batman Logo.  It flew incredibly quick and directly toward VAFB.  There were no sounds related to the object and the speed itself should have created some sound.  I could not estimate at the size since it was hard to see it but would guess the speed being somewhere near 600 MPH. It was there and gone.  I would estimate the size to be about the size of a twin engine airplane, maybe 50 feet across.  The thing that makes me wonder is that Vandenberg did not launch the missle that night due to &amp;quot;weather delays.&amp;quot;  It was delayed for two days after and launched early morning.  You want a background?  I am a wa! rehouse specialist for a local company.  I have a diploma with! some co llege, mostly geology and history.  I have passed psyche exams for jobs with law enforcement but havent passed backgrounds.  I dont exactly believe in extra-terrestrials, but know that God made a giant universe with endless possibilities.  Are we over-run with them, or are we just being &amp;quot;visited?&amp;quot;  I dont know and could really careless as long as my paycheck is cashed.  I feel that if ET&#39;s were going to visit us, they would treat it like a military operation.  Lights out!  Which is why I am sharing this with you guys.  I could not identify this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was still dark, and I could see many stars (facing south), including one that was very bright.  Then I realized it wasn&#39;t a star at all because it was moving, and as I watched, I could see three bright white lights clustered together, it was still moving from south to north and upward into the sky. I could no longer see three lights but one again, and it was wobbling or warbling on its path.  My husband came outside at this time, and i asked him if he could see it, he said yes and that it was not blinking like a plane should blink. We watched it until it got smaller and smaller and we could no longer see it.  Then to the east in the sky, we saw and heard a plane and a helicopter traveling on the same path as the white light, as if the plane and copter were pursuing the source of the light.<n>

On November 4th at approximately 0030 hours, I was sent to investigate an unknown object in the southeast skies over Clark County, NV after numerous people reported the sighting.  The object was described as circular in shape having red, green, and blue flashing lights in the center, and yellow/white glowing lights around the object.  I observed the object and confirmed that the description as accurate. A Co-worker also observed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance the object seemed to be a planet or a satellite, or possibly a helicopter in the distance.  After viewing it for a few minutes, the object appeared to move in an unorthodox fashion(up/down, side to side), and every few minutes a light would be emitted from the center of the object as if it were shining some type of spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The military would not confirm or deny any aircraft in the air, nor would they release any information, and there were no aircraft in that area according to information obtained from local airports.  Shortly after reporting what I saw, jets (of probable military origin) could be heard and seen heading in that direction.  The object disappeared sometime around 0145-0200, and later reappeared on the west side of sky.  The second sighting lasted approximately five minutes from the time I first observed it, and disappeared after I stopped viewing if for approximately one minute  Later in the morning, a convoy of military vehicles and aircraft were seen traveling towards the area of the first sighting sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??

My self, my mom, dad, and girlfriend all witnessed over 30 seperate sightings within a 1 hour period.  First I saw 3 orange light to the north when I got out of the hot tub at 7:15.  Took me by surprise, they were about 5-10 miles north.  My girlfriend also witnessed the  3 orange globes fade out and 2 more appear about 1 mile to the left.  I have seen numerous sightings up here, but nothing like what continued to happen.  I had time to go get my dad, and mom and we all stood out side.  At first i thought it was all over, but then over the Warner Mountain Range it started.  Sometimes 1, sometimes 4 in a horizontal row.  Often times it appear that one would pop out of another, always horizontally.  We saw no less than 30 fireballs appear up and down Surprise Valley on top of the Warner Mountain Range.  On of the sightings was with a car driving towards us down our drive way, with his head lights shining! , and we could still see the bright orange balls or orbs appearing.  My mom said it also looked light spotlights were coming off the bottem of them.  It was like a 4th of July show.  We will never forget it.  Bright Orange, Yellow, Faded in and Out, Sometimes a slow fade, sometimes fast.  Slow movement horizontally.  Often times one would appear, then several close beside, and at different altitudes.  Many times as one would fade another would appear 50 plus miles up valley.  My father had mentioned he and a guest watched 2 of the same orbs the last week, and thought they were flares maybe.  I questioned him last week that no one would be using flares in the Modoc Wilderness with out going to prison.  My dad does not think they are flares after last night. We are 5 miles from the Nevada border, and 15 miles from the Oregon border, in the top right corner of California.  As I answer the qustions below, my dad kept asking about an aircraft that was relatively high, but I thin! k it was commercial air traffic.  Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked closer, they looked &#34;funny&#34; somehow.  They appeared to be tumbling as a group and I realized they were moving fast, too fast.  There was no breeze or wind on the ground.  Later I realized they would have been traveling against the wind since they were headed directly for the Pacific ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my camera (a Canon T2i with a Tamron 300mm lens), ran outside and looked over the roof of my house where I estimated the object would have have reached by then, but I could not see it anywhere.  I was shocked by this.  I could not believe something so clearly visible could have simply disappeared in a cloudless clear blue sky.  I carefully searched the entire sky area but had to conclude it was gone!!  I then looked back to the East where I had first seen the object from inside my house--– closer to the horizon.  There it was again, apparently in the same position and traveling at the same speed and slowly tumbling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got 2 clear pictures of the object as it crossed the sky in about 3 minutes.  My first view had been at an angle of about a 45 degrees.  I finally lost sight of it when it became too small a point to see in the West.   Looking at a map later I saw that it would have traveled slightly to the north of Los Angeles International Airport and then continued out over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using Photoshop I zoomed the images of the object out to 300% and then cut and pasted them into one image next to each other for comparison.  You can see that the object is rotating.  One picture shows the appearance in the sky and the other is a closeup.   You can notice the interesting colors on the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The objects look to us to be mylar, helium-filled, balloons.  We have encouraged the source of the report to check with the local FAA Flight Service Stateion, to see what direction the wind was moving, at the time the photos were taken.  PD))<n>

Rainier appearing &amp; disappearing silverish object/ jet activity<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:00 AM on November 3, 2010 I was sitting on my deck enjoying my morning  cigarette.  It was sunny with no clouds.  I was facing Mount Rainier and my home is north of it. I noticed a silvery white object to the east of Mount Rainier.  As it was sunny, with no clouds, I noticed that it was the only thing in the sky.  As I looked at it I noticed that it had a shape somewhat rectangular, though I could not see a clear outline.  It’s possible that it was oval. It was too far away to discern the outline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, it disappeared for 5 or so seconds and then reappeared a little lower in the sky.  I thought it might be some sort of flat mylar balloon that could not be seen from my vantage point if it turned with the wind. I saw it for another 5 or so seconds before it disappeared a second time.  I watched for another 15 seconds or so and did not see it again, however, I noted a plume from a jet which was traveling west to east at high speed  above and slightly south of Mt. Rainier on a path that looked as though it was headed toward the area of the object I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting this in hopes that it might verify any reports that others might make concerning the object.  I was too far away to see it clearly or provide any detailed descriptions. I don’t think I would have noticed it if there had been a single other cloud in the sky, but cloudless days are unusual in this area and it made it noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired, female, grandmother.  The only other time I have seen anything strange in the skies was when I was around 7 years old  (1958) when I saw a low cigar shaped object!<n>

At an elevation angle of perhaps 15 or 20 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved rather slowly, taking 8 or 10 seconds to travel from left to right across my range of vision.  It left no streak or trail behind. So it didn&#39;t seem like a meteor, traveling too slowly and too horizontally; also, I could discern a diameter to its circular shape -- about the width of a matchstick held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound, so I&#39;m sure it was no airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location was in southeast Portland, Clackamas County, immediately west of I-205 on S.E.

The event happened at around 21:30 when my daughter and her boyfriend came running in the living room and asked us to go ouside.  My wife, my daughter, her boyfriend and me looked right above us and saw a fleet of spherical objects moving.  Each object moved independently but never hitting others, some traveled longer distances but within the group.  At one point they all stopped somewhere above west Los Angeles and started moving upward and eventually could not see them.  These objects were not stars as we cold clearly differentiate them from the stationary stars in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an iPhone with a camera but it is not able to capture images at night time,except for the moon, because of the intense light pollution of Downtown.

She wasnt convinced until they began moving at the same rate of speed over a swampy area about two telephone pole lengths above the tree tops and about an eight mile from us, they had window braces or some sort of seperation about 3 feet apart with a soft green glow inside like from an instrument panel.  They didnt move untill we watched them hover for about 10 seconds, they headed s.e. towards the Aitkin, Garrison area at the same rate of speed about 50 yards apart and at the same elevation, there was no white or red light on them. to guess their size or if they were connected together would be hard because of the darkness,  maybe about the size of those gondolas beneath a blimp. this was in a very rural area but near a farm.<n>

We were excited to see this and when we didn&#39;t observe anything else we went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At home we took out the garbage and once again looked at the stars hoping to see something.

It cruised by silently in about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw it I grabbed my daughter and yelled, &#34;Look! Do you see it! Do you see it!&#34;  She saw it and was speechless until it was gone from sight.  We watched as it headed out toward the ocean,  We still can&#39;t believe it!  I can&#39;t believe it was so close and seemed very nonthreatening to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter feels that the flash we originally saw was the black triangle that it &#39;felt&#39; our excitment and came to see us?

Headed southeast, I saw a triangular configuration of red lights on the horizon.  The triangle formed by the lights was equilateral, and its apex pointed east.  The red lights did not flash, and although it was difficult to discern from my altitude, were hovering stationary above the west side of Berkeley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were about twice the size of Venus, a prominent star this time of year, which was located to the east of the lights.  Nearby commercial planes moved above and below the configuration, and were roughly the same size as the red lights, but were white, as planes usually appear.  Using my fingers to measure, I estimated the sides of the triangle to be about 1 to 1 ½ inches in length between each red light.  The triangular configuration remained stationary for about three minutes, and then started moving east towards the Berkeley Hills.   I cannot estimate their speed, but I was driving on Euclid St. at 25 – 30 mph through a residential area, and the configuration was moving in and out of my purview rather quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued further south, the red triangular configuration moved directly east across the horizon, losing altitude and then dropping behind the trees of the Berkeley Hills, near campus.  I stopped at Euclid and Hearst St. in an attempt to see where they had gone, but they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is (perhaps) worth mentioning my cell phone spontaneously turned off and then turned on a few minutes before the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

A motion in the sky caught my attention.  I looked up and I saw this craft. It was between 150 to 250 feet long.  There were small white lights on it from front to back. My guess is that there were between 10 and 15 lights. They appeared to be moving although I didn&#39;t observe the craft long enough to give a description as to how they moved.  From my angle of view this object appeared to be cigar in shape. The craft was traveling east to west in a straight line at an altitude of around 500 feet.  The speed of this craft was incredible.  The only way I can describe it is supersonic. It went from horizon to horizon in 5 to 10 seconds.  Trailing behind this craft was a strange vapor trail. It glowed with a sickly white-green color. It reminded me of the Aurora Borealis, the way it seemed to shimmer and move. The intensity of the vapor was very asymmetrical, the most concentration was closest to! the back of the craft and then quickly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most unnerving aspect about this whole sighting for me was that this craft made no noise what so ever. I live near Westover Air Force Base, and you can hear the planes WAY before you see them.<n>

Aircraft was very dimly, even faintly lit around its rounded edges with no typical aircraft lights or strobe.  Observed by two adult men (professionals ages 50 and 57) for approximately 5 or 6 seconds.  Though the craft seemed no higher than 1000 - 1500 feet, there was no observable sound.  Due to the craft’s speed, it traveled quickly out of sight within a few seconds.  Given the high use airspace and proximity to SFO, other commercial aircraft were observed much higher on this clear night with the typical faint jet engine drone.  Our thinking is that this craft could possibly be some sort of stealth military aircraft that may have been flying this evening with no lights.<n>

The approaching aircraft was still showing red. It was low and very slow.  In another minute something didn&#39;t seem right, the night navigation lights were all wrong, completely wrong.  Normally when a plane approaches you, there is green light on the left and a red one on the right even with helicopters.  The craft in question was one big red light with what looked like an aircraft strobe light coming from the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The average guy on the street would look up, not understand and think they are seeing an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How I know it was real, the lady standing next to me was watching it too, but only because the guy standing next to her was watching it.

The object was moving at less than 1000 feet over the horizon, and its widest, its size was probably about 10-15 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to have a camera in my vehicle, I reached to grab it so I could take pictures, we both turned away for a moment, but the object had disappeared as we turned to look at it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s altitude was high enough that if it had been a conventional plane, we would have still seen it moving, either descending or ascending over the horizon, as any other plane that flew to or away from the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later, looking out to the sky in the southwest, still in our general vicinity, we observed what appeared to be a delta shaped, bottom side of a flying aircraft, maybe a military fighter jet.  The color of the bottom side of the craft was dark or perhaps black and the craft was moving fast at about the same altitude, moving from east to west and appeared to be banking sharply away to the south, in the direction of the international airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

First of all it was an odd shape, almost like a balloon shape, dark gray and metallic. I knew at first sight it was not normal, at first I was adjusting eye sight to make sure it wasn&#39;t one of those balloons they float above dealerships, no, it&#39;s much bigger. Hot air baloon was my next thought, no basket underneath and at least 2 times as big as that would be. Then I notice it is moving, and gone..... Didn&#39;t creep me out but I couldn&#39;t stop staring and swerved lanes quite a few times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I studied the light because the green color flashing alternating with red then white seemed odd to me.  The object did not move but appeared to stay suspended in the same location.  After 10 minutes of waiting for it to move in the sky or to better recognize this type of pulsing or flashing light as a celestial body, I got out my little Nikon 9 x 25 binoculars for a better look, and then the object became much more visible.  At this point I woke up my husband and he observed the following as well through the binoculars:  This object was flashing a brilliant blue, red, yellow, white sequence that changed or alternated  color about once per second, almost in time to my ticking mantel clock. I presumed the green I’d seen without binoculars was a blending of the yellow and blue in the atmosphere.  The brilliant colors of the flashing or pulsing light all originated from the center of the object, sometimes flashing brighter than other times.  The object seemed quite distant, as the atmospheric distortion between it and me on the ground made it difficult to focus at times.  But by holding as still as I could and resting my arms on the window, the object&#39;s shape and further details became apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be flat across the bottom, with “walls” that were roughly 1/4 the height of the overall width of the object. It seemed to rise higher in the middle from where the light pulsed.  On the &#34;walls&#34; of the object, there were 2 large round dark disks or circles on each side of the central disk through or over which flashed the pulsing lights.  In other words, there seemed to be 5 very large circular disks evenly spaced along the sides of the object, 2 on each side of the centrally located flashing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The details, for all the distortion and difficulty with keeping the object in focus, were actually quite sharp and surprisingly clear.  At approximately 1:55am I stopped watching the object which still was in approximately the same location and went to bed.  I did not take a photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m an attorney with a Masters in Urban Planning and my husband is an orthodontist.  Neither of us has seen anything like this before.  I grew up in the country in Ohio and am somewhat familiar with the night sky this time of year, and have seen Sirius as bright as this.  By using binoculars, the object appeared to be an object that was not part of the normal night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will confirm this &#34;sighting&#34; or debunk it tonight at 1:00 am Central time.  If the object was indeed Sirius, then it will reappear and have similar characteristics.<n>

I took Trekell Road to Interstate 8 towards Tucson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was on Interstate 8, just coming around Casa Grande Mountain I noticed this huge circular aircraft to my left. The aircraft seemed to be relatively close. I&#39;m not a very good judge of distance but I can tell you it wasn&#39;t much higher in the air than the top of the mountain that was to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my attention initially, were these square shaped whitish yellow lights in a row to my left... I rolled my window down and without window tint in the way I could see the silver circular craft sort of hovering to my left. The lights were sort of arranged the way you would see princess cut diamonds arranged on an anniversary band but not stuck together, spaces inbetween and the lights brightness allowed me to see the silver color on the craft only around the lights. I don&#39;t know if the underside or the top was the same honestly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started to rotate clockwise, sort of slowly as if it were on an axis just beginning to spin. As it started to rotate it appeared to pixelate and just disappear entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I say pixelate, it literally looked like your T.V. screen would look when your cable has a glitch and the picture moves in little squares. This is what this craft did, it appeared to disappear one little square at a time in a matter of maybe 1-2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately looked at my clock radio in my car and that is how I know this happened at 9:18pm. I called my husband immediately to tell him about it, as this is not the first UFO we have seen in our area... However the other one we saw were triangular with 3 orange lights. This was something entirely different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to guess on a size, I would say it was about the size of a small grocery store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound or vibration of any kind... It was very odd. It definitely gives a little more merit to the interdimensional theories of UFO&#39;s in my opinion.<n>

I looked up and saw a star shaped orb that was brighter than the stars in the sky.  It was probably several thousand feet above me, when it shot of in the direction of space and dissapered within a sec or two.  My friend was next to me at the time and I  informed him to look up because it was near the edge of my neighbors roof and just as he looked up it vanished before our eyes.  We both ran to the front of the house to confirm if it was really gone.  At this point my friend said to me &#34;Oh my god is that another one&#34;  I looked up and there was the same type of craft but this one was much nearer and directly above us and our view was not impeded.  I watched for a sec then ran into my home to call a family member and get my digital camera.  By the time I got back( I would say no more than 5 sec) it had vanished and my friend was white as a ghost and in disbelief.  I live in an area that i! s in the landing path of Pierson International airport and I have seen a variety of aircraft at a multitude of heights and I can honestly tell you this was no aircraft. I know the possibility of what I&#39;m actually contemplating but their is no other plausible explanation to this.<n>

After firing or flashing the red lights, the plane continued moving.  I never saw this, or anything like it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I left my apartment riding my bicycle directly eastward just after crossing the street to ride on the sidewalk.  In the eastern sky about 40 degrees up, I noticed a silver inverted pie-shaped craft gliding across the sky for about 15 seconds. Then I went under a tree which obscured my view for about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I emerged from my blocked sight, the craft was completely gone.  Disappeared.  The object was about the size of the moon in the sky.  I happened to notice this easily because I live in the flight path of Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix.  The craft was flying north to south, which I’ve never really seen before.  The planes usually fly east to west.  The craft might have been in Phoenix flying space going in the wrong direction<n>

Starting about a week and a half ago I started seeing these craft over our house.  They are extremely hard to see and seem to have the ability to make theirselves look like the background behind them.  Occasionaly I can see a faint small blue-green light on them.  I can see a vapor coming off of them and sonmetimes when they move I can see very faint white lights.  The military obviously knows they are up there, because they are constantly flying right through the area where they are.  If your organization has any connections with investigators they need to come out here and see this for themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband was driving when I noticed a flash in the sky, almost like the reflection off of a mirror.  I didnt think much of it, but I kept seeing this flash from the corner of my eye. When I focused on it, I noticed it was an object that was just hovering in the sky, almost like a star... it would flash, then kind of blend in with the sky momentarily to where it almost looked like it dissappeared but you could still faintly see the outline of it, then it would reappear again.  Several more appeared, we counted a total of 5.  They were just hovering, pretty high up.  At one point they changed formation into a triangle, then they got so close together I thought they had merged into one. They were changing formation but not really going anywhere. It looked like they were changing color, from light green to silver, and then transparent again. We watched it for about 5-10 minutes until we got too far! for our eyes to see them anymore. My sister and I both got some footage of it using our digital cameras on full zoom, not very good footage but if you watch it frame by frame on the video you can see the objects appear and move around.  My sister only took about 5 seconds of footage because she didnt think she caught them on video, but on her video, you can actually see what looks like a transparent object fly by, flanked by the smaller shiny objects that we saw... pretty cool<n>

I looked up to the sky and noticed something I at first thought to be a very bright star. But this &#39;star&#39; was brighter than any one I had ever seen in my life and it was moving ever so slowly and it made me curious. There was absolutley no sound that I heard from this and even if it made sound, it probably would have been too far away fro me to hear it. I ran inside to get my camera to try to zoom in on it to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside and I first took a still photograph of the object.  On this picture it just looked like a very large, very bright star. On the next picture I zoomed in on it as far as my camera would go and the object looked almost like the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then decided to get video of this thing.  I had the camera on normal at first and then I zoomed in on it. When I zoomed in on it I saw what looked like rings going all the way through this thing and the rings seemed to be flashing.I zoomed back out and then turned off the camera because I had to go into the bathroom and put on my slippers and coat as I did not expect to be so cold standing out there.  It was around 29 degrees.  I planned to come back out and finish recording it because I knew it would still be there because it was moving so slowly I knew it would not be out of sight anytime within the next 5 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did what I needed to and came back out with the camera running not quite a full 3 minutes later, and to my surprise the thing was gone. I walked around the side of the house to see if it was just beyond my view from the front and it was nowhere to be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In that second video, as I walked around the side of the house, I saw the almost crescent shaped moon and I put the camera on it and zoomed in on that as well just to see if that moon had any flashing/radiating rings on it like that &#39;thing&#39; did.  The moon did not.  That thing would have had to picked up a lot of speed very quickly to be completley out of my view within a 3 minute time frame. I know this was not quite 3 minutes because my camera has the time on it when the video is viewed from the TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reviewed these with my husband when he came home and neither of us can come to any conclusion as to what this can be.  We are clueless and have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am emailing the photos (which are not of good quality on the computer, but they are crystal on the camera and when I transfer it to TV) and the video to the email you provided because I do not know how to attach them on the program.<n>

It suddenly stopped and opened up into a diamond it was then moving forward over all the houses including mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to turn left on the street right before my block when I turned right on my street it moved slowly past the corner house to the next street of the corner house but still on my block.  It came to a slow stop and dangled there in the sky just dangling there over the house I came up to it still driving and rolled down my window to hear if it had some kind of sound it did not have any sound it was flat in the front and back I could see the back because it was very low and while it dangled it moved very slowly from left to right. If I climbed to the top of the house and got a full sized later and climbed to the top of it, I could touch the bottom of the diamond object. It moved as to scope the area out left to r! ight very slowly. I believe it noticed my truck so it kept in the same direction and I can&#39;t be sure but I think it flashed at me because I was starring so hard and I startled myself and shook my head and got really scared so I began to move up a little slower and the object began to move forward again now going west but as it moved over all the houses it began to go down even lower and lower behind the houses till I could not see it anymore feeling nervous I parked my truck into the driveway and sat and tried to make sense of what I saw. I immediatley got out ran inside and woke up my family and begged them to believe me and go with me to see if they could see it,as I explained that I think it landed behind the houses in the empty lot or the lot behind walmart it took me a minute to persuade them so one family member said they would go.  We hopped in my truck and took off but we were unsucessful in finding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a diamond in shape it had one big light at the top one big light at the bottom and one big light on both sides (the left a big light and the right a big light).In the middle of the diamond right in the center it looked like a hub cap would to cover the rim of a tire but it had holes (circles) and I could see light coming from the inside. It has been bothering me so I decided to contact your website. I did however report it to the marines here in my town but I never received a call back. Another one of my family member believe they saw the same thing but we can&#39;t be sure. If the base has some kind of probe scouting between the hours of 2:00am and 4:00 am they should let the community know so we may have some clarity on what we saw. It was moving very fast when I first noticed it, It was coming from southeast and just all of a sudden changed direction to west.I could not tell if I was moving or the object was moving until I came to the stop sign. It came to a sudden stop after moving terribly fast and just immediately opened up into the diamond shape. Thank You, Can you help?  In case your wondering I was coming home from graveyard shift when I saw this. I can get my schedule so I can verify the time.<n>

As i was driving approximately 70mph i noticed a bright light on my right hand side that appeared to be staying relatively the same distance from my car as i approached Rushville. It appeared to move around the sky as if following my car. The light stayed in view the entire time. App on entering Rushville i went right, up Baldwin hill rd. passing Marcus Whitman high school. at this point i thought it was the water tower light. However as i neared a stop sign i was facing the light and could see several other lights much smaller moving from left to right passing the light on there decent, they appeared to have a reddish blinking lights. I saw two distinct lights travel parallel to each other towards Canandaguia. passing the white light as the descended left to right, Very dim and with no distinct pattern of blinks.  As i watched The brilliant light it appeared motionless and stationa! ry in the sky i wanted to say it was a star but it was much to bright and large to be a star, especially scene all the stars around were a great deal smaller and duller. As i sat with my car engine off at the stop sign and my head lights on after several minutes of nothing but a stationary white light i witnessed the light slowly flicker out to nothing and be replace with the exact same red blinking light as seen before. It then made a 90 degree angle decent to my right. I exited my vehicle and listened. At first there was nothing then you could hear the silence replaced with the sound i can only describe as how a jet sounds flying over. Only it did not appear to blink in any pattern and the sound came only after the light had dimmed and turned to a moving red blinking object. I followed the craft towards canandaguia keeping it on my left hand side as i drove. i could distinctly see it out my drivers window. The light followed the same decent the two earlier lights that had! flown parallel to each other did. This entire event happened ! within a span of 7-10 minutes from when i saw the first brilliant light while driving out of Gorham, stopped and began following it again until the lights and objects were gone. I&#39;m not lieing and i wish i had a video camera. this event scared the hell out of me and made me very uneasy. the light was brighter then any air craft Ive ever seen and i can only describe it to the intensity of the full moon on a clear night. I can not write it off as merely a plane or helicopter because the blinks were not in a pattern and the object was not following a strait line, it was stationary then moved rapidly almost as if it just turned and took off. Plains do not do the things i saw this light do. and before it moved there wasn&#39;t a sound at all. I&#39;ve seen many strange lights and shooting stars but this was my first experience of this kind.<n>
