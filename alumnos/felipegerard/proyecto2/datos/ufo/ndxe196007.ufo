When I first noticed the objects had a row of white lights going from front to back plus there were orange and blue flames coming from the rear (like oxy acetalyn gun).  As I continued to look the white lights went out, then the flames disappeared.  The shapes were still visible behind the night sky, I continued to look; at which stage the shapes vanished into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were travelling south to north in the southern hemisphere.  I noticed that the objects travelled evenly spaced and exactly level.<n>
7/17/60 22:00|Bedford (Canada)|ON|Disk|20-30 seconds|Iridescent blue light passes over farmer at tree top level on a summer night in the early 60s|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63838.html|3|ndxe196007| Iridescent blue light passes over farmer at tree top level on a summer night in the early 60s<n> <n><n> <n><n> Listening to your aged guests this evening (Jeff Rense show 06/10/08), I was drawn to recall a UFO sighting told to me by former mayor in these parts - Bedford, Ontario Canada - a few years back. The gentleman passed a year or so after he shared his story with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To many in this area the gentleman was known as a war hero. He&#39;d been awarded the Croix de Guerre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the old gent&#39;s home to listen ti his youthful recollections. It was after one such story telling event I asked, &#34;Hey, have you ever seen anything strange in the skies in these parts?&#34; His jovial demeanor gave way to a serious look. His face contorted, scrunched - if you will - then a work-swollen hand covered and rubbed his entire face. He took a deep breath and paused. He looked over his right shoulder out the window toward the north field of his farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Out there,&#34; he nodded, &#34;I saw something once.&#34; His hands rested on his cane, his eyes squinted seeming to draw the event into closer focus. &#34;Why would you ask me that?&#34; His gaze shifted to my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I don&#39;t know. I guess I&#39;ve always held an interest in strange things . . . just wanted to know if you&#39;ve ever seen anything.&#34;  As his story unfolded he told me it was a few years after he&#39;d gotten the farm - he purchased it in 1957 with help from the DVA. As I recall, he told me some of his cows had failed to return to the barn this evening. He was concerned because some of them were with calf and he felt that perhaps a calf had been injured and the cow (s) would not leave it. He decided to walk into the field and search his 400+ acres - all of it if need be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He recalled walking north into the moon-lit night. He&#39;d walked for about 15 minutes barking &#34;Co-Boss!&#34; He&#39;d stop from time to time to listen, said he&#39;d wipe his forehead with a hanky because it was a warm, humid night. He&#39;d continue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he&#39;d walked for 15 minutes or so in the manner described above, and had paused to listen and look around. He said while looking around he noticed a bright light coming out of the north east. He said it was flying in a line that would cross in front of him, it was low just over tree-top level. He listened for the sound of an engine. As he listened and the object closed he noticed the light was bluish in color. When I asked him what type of blue he said it was the type of blue one sees when looking at an arc-welder&#39;s flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He stood there listening intently for an engine, but there was no sound. He said the object passed almost over him, but remained slightly to his front with, again, not a sound to be heard. His curiosity kept his eyes fixed on the object until it became obscured by the tree line to the south west. After he lost sight of it his curiosity shifted to fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked him what he did then. He said, &#34;I wasn&#39;t long getting back to the house!&#34; He said he watched the thing for a good 20/30 seconds. He said he had no idea what it was. I asked him why he was scared. He said because it hadn&#39;t made a sound and he&#39;d never seen anything like it. He said it had what looked like a fuzzy glow around it - blue. I suspect the fuzzy look may have been enhanced by the humidity of that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, he said he was paid a visit by a couple &#34;G-men&#34; (his word, not mine) a week or two afterward. They said they were there to check out his property for some minerals. He let them onto his property then let them wander about. Upon their return he asked them if they&#39;d found anything. I interrupted, &#34;What did they find?&#34; He answered, &#34;I&#39;m not sure, but the one guy said it made his Geiger counter sing.&#34; I have done some research on the minerals in this area and there is indeed uranium here. I can&#39;t say the arrival of the G-men played any part of the old gent&#39;s sighting - he&#39;d not told anyone at that time about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I verily feel his account of this incident was exactly as he experienced it. He was dead serious and uneasy recalling it - something (the uneasiness) I&#39;d not seen him project in my 5 years of knowing him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

My brother was around 12 years old and the neighbor was a male around 40 at the time.  We lived within 5-8 miles of Seymore-Johnson Airforce Base and were used to B-52&#39;s and Tankers flying directly over just prior to landing.  On this day, 3 to 5 tankers were landing one behind the other with approximately 20-30 sec. between them.  When the first one flew over, (which is about 1/2 mile up), my brother and I and the neighbor saw a round object, no color, just black, hovering just outside of the flight path, but at the same altitude as the tankers.  It was approx. the size of the horizontal tail section of the tanker, not very large.  It kept it&#39;s position until the last tanker flew over and then the object instantaneously began flying along side the tanker at the same speed.  This means it went from zero speed to whatever speed the tankers were flying, I&#39;m guessing 200 mph.  The object followed the tanker until it went behind a row of trees.  The object did not seem to be making any sounds of it&#39;s own at least different from the tankers, but then the tankers were very loud and the object could have been making some kind of sound.  We told our parents who didn&#39;t seem too concerned and we never discussed it again.  We know it wasn&#39;t a bird or balloon, but it was an aircraft without wings, round or spherical and could go from zero to 200 mph. instantaneously.  We did not call the base either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Observed two circular spheres flying in formation from the San Gabriel Mountains in a southernly direction towards the area of San Dimas and La Verne CA.  Watched as the spheres stopped in mid air and hoovered at an elevation of about 25,000 feet.  Both spheres were yellowish orange.  No beams of light emitted off of them such as a search light or night running lights.  They were both brighter than the stars in the background and appeared closer then the commercial aircraft preparing for their final approach to LAX.  These spheres could not have been mistaken for airplanes, helicopters blimps or balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we gazed at this abnormal activity we talked back and forth describing our observations to one another.  We both noted that the distance between the two balls of light was approximated at 1/4 to 1/2 mile.  Geographically measuring their proximity I would estimate that one of the spheres was hoovering over the Metropolitan Water District Plant in La Verne and the other was over Puddingstone Reservoir in San Dimas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately 30 minutes, the most southernly sphere (San Dimas) flew away over the Ganesha Hills Mountains and then in a Northern direction closely following Garey Avenue in Pomona towards the San Gabriel Mountians near Mt. Baldy.  The one sphere over La Verne stayed longer and then proceeded straight back towards the mountains from which it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, the next morning we reported our observations to our parents and friends who half heartedly believed us as neither of us were &#34;story tellers.&#34;  That afternoon with the paper arrived, our creditability was boasted by several sightings being re-told in the local newspaper.  Pomona California, &#34;Progress Bulletin&#34; now known as the &#34;Daily Bulletin.&#34;  Eventhough its fifty years later, I remember that night as if it occurred yesterday.  I am now retired from a very successful career as a police officer.  As luck would have it, I&#39;ve lost contact with my childhood buddy who moved away from La Verne a couple of years later but if I could locate him, I&#39;ll bet his recollections of that night would be identical to mine.  I don&#39;t recall the exact night of this occurance, but to the best of my recollection, it was a summer vacation night in 1960 and other people in the vicinity of Pomona Ca observed it to and reported it to the local paper who wrote a story for the front page.  &#34;Progress Bulletin, Pomona CA&#34;<n>

One summer night a couple of friends and myself were attending a get together of local singers and guitar players in that old building. Suddenly, a couple of guys came in and said that there were some strange lights to the west. We all trooped outside and sure enough, there over Springdale was a huge formation of red lights forming a geometric pattern. These lights seemed to be going in and out of each other in triangular patterns. We jumped into my car and sped northwest toward Springdale to get a closer look. After traveling about a 1/4 mile down the road we noticed that the lights were now moving slowly south toward Fayetteville. I pulled over to turn my car around and got stuck in the ditch. So we watched as this strange procession slowly dissapeared in the haze of Fayetteville&#39;s lights.I was about 16 and this is one of two sightings I had in Arkansas. I will relate my other sighting over Marble Ar. in another box.<n>

The first one occurred on the evening of July 4th, 1960 at dusk while we were standing high on a hill in New Berlin, WI waiting for the fireworks to start. The sun had gone down. We could see spotlights searching the skies over Milwaukee about 15 miles away. There were some clouds in the sky, but not many. All of a sudden, I saw movement over my head. I looked straight up and a saw a white circular craft moving slowly from behind me from south toward the north. It moved very slowly. It was above the clouds. I double checked to see if there was a possibility of the searchlights from Milwaukee to be making a search way out here in New Berlin, but it wasn&#39;t. The white craft was above the clouds. It was about the size of a quarter held at arm&#39;s length. It moved slowly toward the north, never deviating from its course and never changing speed ... very slow. The strange thing was that before it got to the horizon, it blinked off like a light bulb. I called my sister on the telephone who had been about 25 miles away and she said that she had seen the same thing, so we reported it to the Hynek Institute in Chicago, giving a written report within the week. Hundreds of people have had to have seen that, but we never met any. The very next day, on July 5th, during the afternoon, there was another sighting by hundreds of people on the Lake shore of Lake Michigan. I just happened to be standing inside the house by the window facing north. Off to the east I saw a greenish white craft going downward towards the north quite aways off. It was about the same size as the one I had seen the night before. I found out the next day in the newspaper that hundreds of people had witnessed the UFO dive into Lake Michigan with an aircraft chasing it over the lake which had been scrambled by Billy Mitchell airfield. It was published in the two Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel newspapers the next day, but researchers have not been able to find it in the newpaper archives.<n>

It was the frist time my mother let me go anywhere without her there, but was ok because my brother and sister was there to watch me.  We were on the beach , on the point between Penetang and Midland. Right on the water.  We had a fire on that beach that was quit large. The boys all had to go to the washroom , so we walked away from the fire , along the beach to where it was dark and the girls could not see.  We were all doing our thing and one of the older boys said whats that and pointed to the sky.  There was a light coming across the sky from Penatang across over to Port Mcnickel.  My brother said I guess thats sputnic.  For thats the only thing up there. Well all the boys finished what thay were doing and went back to the girls, for thats were they wanted to be. I was 6 yrs. old and afraid of the dark but I did not care.  This light so cought me in a way I was fixaitted. I wondered if there was a neither one so I looked along the line were I t! hought it came from . I saw nothing.  I started to scan the skys. I saw the same light come down from outer space then turn to a lateral line. to follow the frist one.I could still see the frist one.  At this point I did not realize the inportance of this. Kids are cureyiss and I looked for anouther one.  Wow , there was anouther one and anouther one.  Four in total.  They were equely spaced apart, almost like they were atached but they were to far apart for that .<n> <n><n> <n><n> They got to a point were they  floated over snake island and at that point they were at the closeset point to me.  I could see clearly.  My vison was perfit, the night was without clouds, and they were kinda close. They looked disc shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this is when the last one slowed from the rest. Almost to a stop. I felt a , I want to say pressure, but could not smell or see anything. There was somthing hitting me .This lasted for about 5 seconds then stopped. I felt when it stopped. Then the craft cought up to the rest and went over the horison and out of sight. After I could not see them anymore I realized I was all alone in the dark and ran back to the fire and my family. My brother pulled his attention away from the girls enough to ask me how many light I saw, because he new were I was and what I was doing. I told him I saw 4 lights. I later in life figured out that they must have painted me with somthing so they could find me again. And they did. This was the frist event that I had. Did not know enough to make inportance of this . Being a little boy new to life I thought that this was normal and not much was said or asked of it  ever again . But I remembered every detail for the rest of my life. I was not ! afraid at all. In retrospect, I think that these beings look for anything different and investagate that. I just want to say that wile I was watching this it all gave me the inpression that thay felt that they were now home and could finly relaxe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother is now deceast along with his freinds. I swear by all that holy every word is the TRUTH!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were to young, or naive, at the time to be overly concerned.  We were excited at first, curious and playful as we watched it move.  But our &#34;child’s perception&#34; kicked in as we playfully skipped from streetlight to streetlight... and when dusk caused those streetlights to come on, we realized the object &#34;seemed&#34; to move with us (child’s perception).  We then began to get frightened and ran from street light to streetlight until we got back to my Aunt&#39;s house, at which point we immediately told my Aunt that we had seen something.  As we talked we all saw the object through the kitchen window.  We all watched it until my Aunt became nervous and closed the drapes (about 5-7 minutes -- I cannot recall which direction the kitchen window faced, but I believe it may have been S.W. as I remember my aunt&#39;s back yard always having sun in the afternoons).  She then got each of us a piece of paper and pencils/crayons, put us in different rooms, and told us (including herself) to draw what we had seen.  When she gathered us all back in the kitchen and compared our drawings... they were all exactly alike.  My memory of the object isn&#39;t that clear these days, but I do remember the object having a domed upper portion, flat bottom, numerous lights of multiple colors circling the lower edge, that dimmed and brightened, but never went completely out.  The object also emitted an odd humming sound.  I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;ve chosen this time to finally report this incident; perhaps it is the sudden rash of &#34;ufo&#34; programming that has cycled back on to all the TV networks and book store shelves that has prompted me to take the chance of reporting it.  I am also very curious to find out if there were ever any other reports of this same object on or near that date in the S.W. Ontario area.  I don&#39;t recall my cousin, my aunt and I ever talking about the incident again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
