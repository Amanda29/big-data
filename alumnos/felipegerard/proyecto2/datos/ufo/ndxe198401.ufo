1/26/84 19:30|Rolla|MO|Light|1-2 Minutes|Strange yellowish lights seen southeast of Rolla, Missouri|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56208.html|1|ndxe198401| Strange yellowish lights seen southeast of Rolla, Missouri<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish to confirm the sightings of lights seen by the woman in Salem Missouri.  I too saw three or four yellowish colored lights that night.  They appeared in the low sky I thought they were street lights until I realized they were too far away and too high in elevation from my vantage point to be street lights. I am familiar with most of the lights in the area around my house, and those seemed out of place.  They were almost to my souteast as I looked from my window on the south side of my house. They did not appear to be moving, but were stationary. I wish I&#39;d known about this website earlier, as I would have sent you a note. Nevertheless, that&#39;s what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an Army base close to here (Ft.LeonardWood), and they may have had some slow moving aircraft inbound. I didn&#39;t really think about it(except the non-moving appearance and the Military aircraft in the aerea didn&#39;t add up) alot until I saw the note from Salem describing something very similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/26/84 18:09|Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates)||Disk||Object captured by camera over Abu Dhabi|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55926.html|2|ndxe198401| Object captured by camera over Abu Dhabi<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a member of the United States Air Force stationed in southwest Asia for the past 2 months. While sight seeing downtown in Abu Dhabi, I took a photograph of a local building with interesting architecture. Upon review of the photo (to make sure it was all in focus) I noticed an odd saucer shaped object  hovering to the buildings immediate left, and when I looked up to see it in person, it was no where in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no airplanes flying within the immediate area that I could see, and the total time between taking and reviewing the photo to looking back at the skyline was no more than 15 to 30 seconds. Because the craft is in such poor focus (compared to the buildings in the photograph) I believe it was much larger than it appears and in motion at the time the photo was taken. This assumption is also based on the fact that I do not recall it being in the frame as the picture was being taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know there are a myriad of plausible and reasonable explanations for this photograph, but also believe that it stands to attest to the slight possibility that it was a genuine UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/24/84 00:00|Kirkland|IL|Circle|20 minutes|((HOAX??))  Dammed scared and we all went home. Noone believed us and we just didnt talk about it anymore|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62498.html|3|ndxe198401| Dammed scared and we all went home.  Noone believed us and we just didnt talk about it anymore<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were camping by a river about a mile away from town and a bright light all of a sudden showed up about 1000 yards above us.  It was just like daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we all stood up sevaral small lights swirled around us.  And passed in and out of us.  The largest light was maybe 50 yards across.  The light was very bright.  The smaller ones were basketball size and dimmer.  You could make out triangle forms inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brighter light shot up to the sky and went up about 3 or 4 miles.  Then slowly the small ones followed.  The circlced around the bigger then just joined with it. They all went up until they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was one of many contacts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a joke. It real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Object broke into 2 perfectly round objects, one disappeared and the other turned back into a cigar shaped object and slowly disappeared behind the mountains.  Event lasted approximately 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at a high-altitude jet aircraft, generating a contrail behind it, and reflecting the rising sun in the east.  Just a guess.  NUFORC receives many such reports.  PD))<n>
1/21/84 21:00|Valier|MT|Light|3 minutes|10-15 lights were seen in the sky south of Valier, MT|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14618.html|5|ndxe198401| 10-15 lights were seen in the sky south of Valier, MT<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 21:00 hrs on the night of October 18, 2000, about 10 to 15 multi-colored lights ranging from blue to yellow were seen in the sky south of where i live.  The lights seemed to all be centered in one place.  I thought they were only stars, that is until they broke from the group and went of north, west, and east.  In a mere matter of minutes they were out of sight.  The lights would blink very rapidly, but i was unable to time the gap between flashes.<n>
1/13/84 02:12|Idaho (I-90 interstate)|ID|Changing|30 Minutes|Amazing Sight and Long Encounter time  - Shape Change of Object|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14692.html|6|ndxe198401| Amazing Sight and Long Encounter time  - Shape Change of Object<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my sighting, After 17 years I figured I would tell someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving from Illionois to my new base where I was going to be stationend (mcchord afb, Wa) my self and wife at the time where driving along highway 90 towards seattle. at 2:13 am we came out of one of the tunnels on I90 going through the hills and at the side of the road where several cars. We assumed there was a wreck since the roads were snow covered and icy. We slowed down to see if we could assist and saw many people over by the guard rail looking across it. Across the embankment was a large Barrell Shaped Object approximately 30 feet tall. Along the outside were metal &#34;poles&#34; being familiar with electronics I would have classified them as antenna. Aircraft running lights at the tip each being 5-6 feet long with the light at the end blinking slowly like regular aircraft. Underneath the &#34;barrel&#34; (which was upright) where long 20-30 foot lengths dangeling from underneath the bottom of the barrel. The lengths, about 10-15 feet of varying lengths (lack of better description, although they reminded my or the beads commonly hung from doors to act as a divider is the best way to describe it) had a very bright light and appeared to be made of some type of glass or crystal. From the bottom of the barrel a mist was coming out. Much like steam, it made no sound what so ever and hovered free floating above the ground about 10-15 feet. I asked the others how long it been there and they stated it had been there for about 20 minutes just hovering. After another 10 minutes or so, you could hear an audible &#34;clunk&#34; at which point the mass underneath the barrel was pulled up into the device. After another few minutes the barrell changed shape from a barrell to a wedge, much like a heart shaped locket. It tilted sideways and shot, flew was not a good word as the speed was incredible, at the other side of the freeway it titled upright and after several minutes went from the ground level to out of sight into the sky within seconds.<n>
1/8/84 22:00|St. George|UT|Formation|1 minute|Eight lights all different colors traveling accross the sky  in a  uneven V formation with small vapor trails.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43641.html|7|ndxe198401| Eight lights all different colors traveling accross the sky  in a  uneven V formation with small vapor trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never really thought about reporting what we had seen, we were just kids. People don&#39;t believe adults, never mind kids.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were walking down the sidewalk looking for a place to eat. We were staying at a motel in a small town somewhere in southwestern Utah. As we were walking down walked we noticed something on the ground flopping around like a fish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got closer we noticed it was a bat fighting a bug.  As the bat flew away our eyes followed it toward the sky.  Upon looking up we observed about eight lights in the sky. They traveled from left to right.  Each was a different color and they were flying in a v formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One side of the formation was one light longer than the other side. I believe the right side was longer than the left. As they crossed the sky, they left a small vapor like trail behind them. They were far away it seemed and moved in the same direction across the sky for the duration of the sighting. They made no sound but again they were also far away. When all of a sudden they seemed to head in a more upward direction. Then in a split second they were gone and now left a longer trail behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each trail was they same color as each light that left it. They seemed to go up at an angle and did not cross the sky. The trails slowly dissipated and nothing more was seen of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard of another sighting like ours. I have told the story to a few close friends only, due to the fact people look at you like your crazy. I have no oppinion of what is was.  I only know I can&#39;t explain it and have seen nothing since that can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
1/3/84 13:00|Fayetteville|NC|Fireball|13:30|I stood there watching as the sun finally started to show its face throughthe sky, a light blinded me. Then.... it was gone.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13264.html|8|ndxe198401| I stood there watching as the sun finally started to show its face throughthe sky, a light blinded me. Then.... it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awakened by an eerie sound on the cold January night. I noticed a bright light coming from the back sliding glass window.... I made my way to the window and the I noticed the bright light was coming from the sky. I walked from the window to the front porch of double-wide trailer and I started to feel a light vibration throughout my mobile home. My daughter was awakened by the trembles of her bed.... she ran to me crying. I told her to go back to bed  and she did. I stayed up for atleast three more hours and I watched the light move closeer and then move further into the night sky. It was as if it was on fire.. maybe a burning airplane, I thought. But no it would have landed by now. It just floated there........... The longer I sat there , the more I became fascinated with it. Before I knew it I could see the sun rising in the distance. A light sent from the fireball shaoped ship blinded me and it was gone as the sun finally showed its face through the pink clouds. It was over and I did not know whether to tell someone or not, what would they think? Probably that i was a nut and had dreamed it all. But let me assure you, this was no dream...... it was so real.An experience that I will never forget.<n>
