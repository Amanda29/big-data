At first it was feared that the enemy was near but it has now been decided that the Canadian&#39;s contest candidates are adopting the modern methods.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Source:  Camrose &#34;Canadian; December 24, 1914, page 2<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END QUOTE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date of event in 1914 are approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM READER))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could you change the &#34;Meeting Lake, AB&#34; siting of 1914 to &#34;Meeting Lake, SK&#34;.  The news item was in an Alberta newspaper, but the incident actually took place in Saskatchewan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Province changed above.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I initially submitted this several years ago, but unfortunately for some inexplicable reason gave the location as Meeting Lake, AB - then some time later requested it to be changed to Meeting Lake, SK.  The correct location is in fact Meeting Creek, AB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The siting was initially mentioned in the Camrose Canadian for Dec. 24, 1914<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/newspapr/np_page2.asp?code=n68p1184.jpg<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is further mentioned in the following edition of Dec. 31, 1914<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/newspapr/np_page2.asp?code=n68p1192.jpg<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;One of our prominent merchants claims he saw an airship in the early hours the other morning.  Some of the boys wonder what he had to drink.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  Also, he indicates two dates for the event, September 15, and December 24.  We do not know what the correct date is, and we have no way of contacting the individual.  PD))<n>
