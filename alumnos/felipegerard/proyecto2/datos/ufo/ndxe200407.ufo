7/31/04 23:00|Dublin (Ireland)||Light|1 hour|Bright Lights over City|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45287.html|1|ndxe200407| Bright Lights over City<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a Saturday night in July and we were having a BBQ out our back garden, at around 11pm my dad not noticed something coming over the house, it looked to be as low as a helicopter would not high enough to be a plane which usually fly over our house towards Dublin Airport, but there was absolutly no noise from this light. It looked like a round ball of light, more yellowish then white, you might say it looked like a fireball but there was no light surrounding the object, no noise, no nothing it just fly over the house, we sat wondering what it could be... a meteor, helicoptor, low flying jet ???? But we all agreed it couldn&#39;t be any of the above, we forgot about it... then 20mins later my dad said &#34;Here&#39;s another one&#34; as it passed over the house it was followed by 3 more in a straight line, it came from the same direction as the 1st and flew in the same direction as the 1st and they all flew over (no noise) and went out of sight....all in one big line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this stage i was worried and i seemed to be the only one, the rest of the family said it had to be something normal but they did as i say all agree it was very strange, i asked my dad to get the camcorder out in case it happened again... an just like in the movies as he went in to get the camcorder, another set of 3 lights all the same distance apart from one and another came again from the same direction but this time it was different, The first one stopped dead in air(we screamed) the second one stopped then the second one took of at such a speed i couldn&#39;t even measure and flew on front of the first (we screamed) then the line continued it was watching a relay race... the guys who where trying to say it was a meteor agreed that no meteor or any object which doens&#39;t have some sort of control CAN NOT STOP DEAD IN AIR ......the all went out of sight again in the same direction...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rang Dublin Airport Air Traffic Control and told them our story... then said they couldn&#39;t see anything funny coming up on rader and to be honest i don&#39;t think they took us seriously... the next morning we rang a radio show, again they didn&#39;t seem interested. But as the days went on more and more people from the area told us they they saw it also..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still nearly a year i haven&#39;t heard anything about it...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be in a triangular formation bit did move slightly.  The objects hovered for a minute or so and then one seemed to burn out, or fly higher out of eyes sight.  The second and third followed.  10mins later I got another call and went outside again to see a bright orange fireball moving from north to south.  The object was moving very very fast and got to the same point as the previous objects, then stopped in more or less the same place.  Two more objects followed in exactly the same manor, hovered for a minute or so, then were gone.  Went through all the possible explanations as too what these objects were, but have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Judgine from the direction it travelled it would have come from the south I believe. The sky was clear with high thin whispies. Most stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Best guess is it traveled from the west to southeast almost right over Albuquerque airport, speed approximatly 400-500 MPH, elevation 25,000-30,000 feet, skattered clouds. I&#39;ve seen many objects in the sky but none like this bright white light. As it progressed across the sky it did pass under an airliner which was at about 40,000 feet heading southwest with visable colision lights, unlike the white light. After the light passed the eastern mountains of Albuquerque the light just dissappered. No pictures or video. I&#39;m in the USAF with lots of aircraft identification experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My 9 year old son had spotted some white spots in the sky.  When I first saw the spots, they were very small and I only saw two or three.  They looked to be at a very high altitude.  As I scanned the sky, I saw at least 50 of the spots overhead.  I ran in to get some binoculars and then observed them at a low magnification:  they appeared to have white mushrooms on the top and bottom, connected by a dark cylinder and the mushrooms were spinning.  They were not in a recognizable formation, but seemed to be equdistance from each other, randomly scattered. As they moved from east to west, they were obscured by some very high, wispy clouds.  After all were no longer visible, there was one larger (or lower altitude) device that seemed to move away, then it too disapeared from sight.  The local police had no reports of this and the local news station is investigating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 37 and an Engineering Technician with a consulting engineering firm designing electrical substations, with degrees in CADD and Management and am currently in an MBA program.  My mother is 73 and a licensed counselor.  My wife is a homemaker and is 36.  My daughter is a 14 year old 8th grade student, my sons 9 and 5 are entering 4th grade and kindergarten.  Other observers were a 10 year old girl and her mother and possibly others at the party.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then pointed it out to the rest of my family, who then all just gazed into the sky at this strange object, while I darted into the house to get my camcorder. Upon returning only to find the film had run out and had to run back in for another. I fed it into the camera and recorded about forty-three seconds of this object going into the distance, and can clearly see the shape and the glow of this object.<n>

We pulled over on our dark country road as we live in farm country where its very dark, turned off my truck and watched for an half hour the first time with ryan, last night by myself an hour. Now the first time after about 30 minutes of viewing the brite object it started moving towards us, we both looked at each other and were in total disbelief, we were questioning each other if we were seeing the same? I being afraid of nothing due to being in heavy combat at 18 in Vietnam got out of my truck, as did Ryan, but we both watched fixed on this now moving object. The object moved directly over us, it was like a triangle but huge, I mean very huge, there appeared to be a lite area where we saw figures, but could not identify origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, I reported to fairchild and you should of heard the phone ringing, he rushed me off. This craft made no noise, it stopped, we had a look like the guy who was beamed aboard in the woods of oregon while logging. This morning it was there again but I feel asleep watching it, we have many weird things going on here, better take statements. My Son is now in th USAF, the event changed his life. I am a retired Marine recon and a Law Enforcement captain, so you are not being fed bs, in fact my religous beliefs have taught against this stuff. I will be awake again tonight watching. This is big!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at Venus.  PD))<n>

When we reached his vehicle parked on the street, I noticed a VERY bright, orangish...white...and even redish at times, light hanging stationary over the NE foothills near the canyon below Lucky peak resevoir. Our friend left figuring it was a planet or something. The wife and I continued to watch the light curiosly knowing it wasn&#39;t a planet, or a fixed winged aircraft of any type. It hoverd silent and motionless except for the lights that were &#34;dancing&#34; on it. It almost sparkled. I went inside a grabbed some binoculars for a better look. Through the binoculars the light seemed to change shape, moving from one light and seperating into two, and back again. We were unable to notice this change with the naked eye. This took place over a period of about 30 minutes. Getting tired of sharing a pair of bi-nocs, I went inside to grab second pair. Upon my return my wife stated that the light had seperated in two,(this time visable with the naked eye), and slowly decended in tandom behind the mountains not to be seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at Venus.

It flew almost over us.  I&#39;m not sure how low, but it was much lower than the aircraft coming into the airport in Galveston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other weird thing is that it made no noise at all, and we could clearly hear the smaller single engine planes when they came in. This object had no lights but we could see because the night sky was clear and the moon was out. We wathced until it was out of sight.<n>

The night of July 30th/morning of July 31st, I was driving up by the Harris Ranch, and noticed what seemed to be a plane doing crop dusting just to the east of Harris Ranch, flying the same basic pattern as http://www.nuforc.org/S38270.jpg - the plane flew low to the ground, almost as if performing a touch-and-go maneuver (which I thought initially it was, with the landing strip by the restaurant) - I observed at least 2 1/2 loops while driving by, and saw the green identification light on the wing, along with the forward facing white light.  The plane was too far off the freeway to see exactly where it was dusting, though it did seem strange to be working the fields at midnight.  Then again, about 2 hours later I saw workers picking fields at 2am in San Benito.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One was on the left side and three on the right side, kind of in a lopsided form.  It moved fairly quickly and had no noise.  It was in the Western portion of the sky, but was more upward than closer down.  The lights were a orange-yellow that appeared blurry.  It vanished quickly as it headed south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .                        (It was moving in this direction &lt;-- .) . .<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This is the positon of the lights.)<n>

Check this out - NOSS Triad Satelite system - Naval Ocean Survailance System<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking for satellites, as I like to do and was lucky enough to see the Naval Array again.  This is 3 satelites that are strategically placed to remain in formation as they travel.  They are usually in the formation of an isosceles triangle.  They appear to have a light at each tip as each satelite reflects the sun, like all satelites do (Well, at least the normal ones the public knows about).  It moves slowly across the night sky and eventually passes out of view.  In my area it is usually moving from the NW to the SE.  We consider this a great thrill to see the Naval Array as it is something so different to see... 3 satelties moving in formation with no sound.  It is quite alarming to see for the first time because it really appears to be some kind of craft, BUT, you can still see the stars behind it as it passes by... so it seems as though the craft is invisible except for the lights (which are really the satelites themselves).  What appears to be a UFO is really 3 satelites traveling together in formation.  Very cool thing to see if you get the chance.  I have tried watching for it each night, to come up with some kind of schedule of when it passes over, but so far have not been able to document anything routine, it seems to be hit or miss.  Still a nice astronomical event to see and worth waiting for, and witness how our technology is advancing into the future.

As we approached a crew boat heading South, we noticed that they were sweeping the area in front of them with a high intensity light apparentally looking for or at something. With a full moon to our south , we did not need extra light to navigate. We also had our radar on and in the .5 mile mode so that we could navigate around bouys and avoid the rock jetty on each side of the Outlet.My son was navigating and I was piloting, when we observed three red lights (lazer in appearance) approch us from the north at a very high rate of speed.The lights were on the surface of an elongate gray object that was not decernable. It appeared to be on a collision course with us, but than passed within 150 feet from us at eye level. It was between us and the rock jetty 300 ft to the west of us. There was no sound and no wake. When it was south of us we lost visiual contact. It happened so fast that we did not have a chance to look at the rador for that object, however the crew boat was constantally on the screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was sitting perfectly still. After 4-5 minutes I ran inside to get binoculars. When I returned it was still there; overall it seemed to be very slowly drifting SSW. In binoculars it first looked like 2 points of white light right beside each other. Over the next 20 minutes or so it sometimes looked like one or 3 points clustered together, but usually  2. At about 20:40 i went in to reheat my supper which was getting cold. At 20:45 I went back out and it was gone.

Earlier today, I decided to take advantage of sunny conditions to go work outside, so I took my notebook computer out to the back patio and set it up. Although the day had started clear, thunderclouds started building up before noon. Much of the sky to the north was cloudy, but the sky to the south was clear. The stormclouds were well defined. There wasn&#39;t much overcast or haze, just stormcloud or clear blue sky. I need to take frequent breaks when working on the computer outside, because of glare on the display. So, at one point, I leaned back and looked straight up into the sky. I noticed that there was a very well defined thundercloud to the north, scattered cloud overhead and blue sky west and east. Directly overhead, there was what looked like a smoke ring, about the size of my thumbnail held at arm&#39;s length. It was perfectly circular and appeared to be swirling inward on itslelf. In the centre of the smoke ring was a grey dot or small circle. At first, the dot was almost as large as the area inside the smoke ring, about the size of a fingernail at arm&#39;s length. Over the next several seconds, the grey dot appeared to get smaller, then disappeared. The smoke ring remained, but gradually (over about a minute or so) dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then i saw two objects with green, blue, and red lights moving in almost the same direction.  I am inside right now, obviously, and i can hear planes when they fly over.  I was outside smoking a cigarette and could not hear any of the three crafts.  I&#39;ve never witnessed anything like this and believe none of these objects were of human creation.

I am very sceptical about such things but not any more.I am a level-headed lecturer and not prone to fantasies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both noticed a large red glowing fireball which was larger than a star or planet.  It went away.  Then in an area to the left we saw it again and it disappeared.  Then we saw it in another spot which was close to before and it vanished.  About 5 minutes or so later we saw something appear even further to the right and a much farther distance than before.  At first we assumed we were seeing the same object appearing in different locations.  Minutes later we went back inside the beach house.  Immediately, I told my brother-in-law that we just saw a UFO and expected a good laugh from him.  However, he informed us that he was at a store at the Pier and some guys came running in saying they had just seen a UFO.  Later, we realized we could&#39;ve been seeing different objects appearing at different times.  We still don&#39;t understand what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then about ten minutes later this orb appeared again, but this time was in southern position of sky.  Appearances of the bright glowing cirlce that seem to come on and then go off after two or more seconds, continued for the next hour changing positions from south to southwest in the sky every fifteen minutes or so.  One time it appeared, glowed, and then another appeared to the left of the first orb and then it looked like a third shot out of the right of the first orb, so that for a couple of seconds there were three lined up in a row.  The size of this orb appeared very large like holding a pea at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My son was taking pictures of the sunset he did not see a craft in the sky but he did capture what appears to be a craft on our digital camera. Attached you will find 3 pictures that were taken within a period of two minutes. The last image has a white self-illuminating triangular object in front of the setting sun. My son noticed this image a few minutes after taking the picture when viewing the pictures on LCD screen on the camera back. These pictures have not been retouched or affected in any way. I have had a professional photographer look at the image to see if he could explain away what was captured with the camera - light reflection, spot on lense, bird, etc. - he was not able to explain away what appears to be some sort of self-illuminated craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo, and we do not know what the object is.  However, our first guess is that the object may be some type of photographic anomaly.  The object does not appear to be a &#34;solid&#34; object, but rather just a white area in the film.  PD))<n>

Went to beach to eat ice cream and getting out of the car being especially aware of the sky saw multiple brighter than star lights hovering overhead, one in particular more bright and closer than any other.  After 10 mins or so heard a noise from behind and saw a boomerang shaped triangle shadowed by three circular lights.  Turning around we wittnessed a swarm of these objects very close to the ground too large to be flying as close together as they were to be planes. The swarm of these objects were what was in the farther distance 10 minutes prior to incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I approached, I noticed that it was positioned a couple hundred feet in the air over a shopping center (Middlesex Mall). The cone was small and featureless, no lights, etc, and I estimated that it would be too small to hold a human sized passenger. On the bottom of the cone was a small mass which tapered downward. It was absolutely still and made no sounds. I could see a small aircraft in the distance beyond the cone which was turning toward the cone in my line of sight. Whether or not it was trying to close in on the cone, I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t see it for long enough. I turned off the road and went around the block (no U-turns are possible). When I got back onto the road, the cone had disappeared entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The ufo seemed to be slowly falling. It was rounded at the bottom, and had contrails at the top. Almost straight sided. It took 5 minutes to decend and dissapear behind the horizon (the Sierra mntns., Yosemite National Park)We were reminded of the space shuttle disaster. Another theory was a falling satalite. But it was much to large. Later in the day a truck driver stopped by that had seen the same thing at the same time while heading east on hwy 140 from Merced, Ca. to Mariposa.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Third incident among my group of friends<n> <n><n> <n><n> me and two of my friends were out at lowville park and we were watching shooting stars. I was tying my shoes when my friend saw a shooting star which he described as being very big and very bright.He pointed in the direction at which the object disapeared behind the tree line. We then noticed a glowing starlike object peaking thru the tree line. This object then slowly hovered higher above the tree line(about 1 thumb length) and hovered there.it slowly began moving left to right , and up and down. the object was a solid glowing light and appeared to have no flashing lights that a helicopter or a plane would have.We also noticed, now that adreniline had our night vision at max, a vapour trail that my friend said was the path of the &#34;shooting star&#34; that he saw. This trail was in a spiral shape. I tried calling my friend to get him out there with his video camera because we were watching it for a half hour and at this point the obect was stationary and appeared to be going nowhere.my friend said he had no tape for his camera, so i called a girl in hamilton who i knew had a camara.she too had no film but told me she could seefrom here balcony and that it was so bright she could only stare for so long.she also told me that her cat was out on the balcony crying with itz tail between itz legs. After that we followed this object and it appeared to be slowly moving towards lake ontario, and we continued watching it as it went higher andf higher.....finally at about 7:30 am, its was broad daylight and this object could still be seen going higher and higher into the sky until it disapeared. I have friends who have seen these objects on 2 seperate ocassions but i never believed them. they too saw them at lowville park.one of them guessed what time this happened to us because he too said that his animal ran into his room crawling and crying with itz tail between itz legs at the time that it passed over the city towards the lake. we also noticed various birds flying north in v patterns away from this obeject. this has led me to believe that whatever propels these spacecraft, it must give off a high pitched sound that only animals can detect, much like a dog whistle. I also believe they can be seen thoughout the month more than once and that there is a connection to these lights and lowville park because of the numerous sightings<n>

I thought that it might just be a planet that had come close to earth&#39;s orbit, since it was so big and colored kind of red like mars, but it was flickering. I slowed down to get a good look at it, but then I realized the object was moving! I really slowed down and pulled off to the side of the road where I sat and watched the object slowly float over me. I sat there trying to figure out what the object was exactly, as it really looked like someone lit a campfire and sent it into the air. The strange thing was that I could see something flapping in the wind on top of the fire. I really though that it might be a home-made hot air balloon(not one that anyone could travel in, more like the type where you get a large sack and light a fire under it and attach the fire in some sort of way. As the heat rises beneath the sack from the fire, the object begins to float and rises away), but the object was getting higher and higher and not running out of fuel. The object was about 1000 feet into the air when I first saw it. I got back in my car and drove home (less than 2 minutes away), but kept an eye on the object the whole way home. I pulled into my driveway and watched it. By this time, the object could have been 1500-2500 feet up. Here is the rather peculiar thing about the object though-- when it was extremely high, it sort of changed shape from being a firey orb to being a sort of elongated ember looking thing. You could tell the fire was dieing down because it changed from a yellow fire to looking like red burning embers, but very bright, but then it started shooting off red sparks/glowing balls. 2 of the glowing balls shot off even more smaller balls, and all of these glowing balls flew around rapidly. I ran into my house and upstairs to watch the object. By the time I made it upstairs, I looked at the main object and it was pulsing on and off. I ran back outside to see it again, and the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it might be a flare since it was bright orange. However, there was no streaming light as a flare would make as it went up. Five minutes later I saw another orange light to the right of where I had seen the first. Then I saw three orange balls of light appear at the same time and they just disappeared. I then saw one single orange light appear and then disappear. They glowed bright orange and disappeared as if they just turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their was no fading, they just simply disappeared. I am very curious if any one else saw this. I am a 54 year old grandmother just enjoying a trip to the beach with my grandchildren. I was not under the influence of drink or drugs. I did not imagine seeing these lights. They were there!<n>
7/28/04 23:00|Lexington|MI|Other|10 minutes|orbs of light circling the moon.|4/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80581.html|37|ndxe200407| orbs of light circling the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first of four UFO sightings I have experienced happened in 2004.  I am not sure on any specific dates though I am sure about the month and that it was late July of my first sighting.  I was with two friends at the time. We were juniors in high school, thus for a long time I did not feel I was credible enough to come forth with the sightings, however, as I am now a college graduate, mind has not changed that what I saw were UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two sightings both consisted of nothing more than orbs of light in the sky, to far and too small to distinguish much more than it was a ball.  I did not think these relevant for a long time until I recently saw a computer simulation made by UFO specialists to try to recreate something someone had seen.  It looked a lot like what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lexington is a small resort town in Michigan.  There are lots of beaches, but we only night swim in the harbor as it is really sandy.  We face the east so see the sun and moon rise. On that particular night I was with two friends, all three of us were carelessly watching the sky for at least an hour or so, as it was an extremely bright night.  The beach is maybe a quarter of a mile from the road, with no nearby lights, so we were used to it being abnormally dark.  On that night, it was extremely bright, the moon was full and there were tons of stars shining.  The sky wasn’t even black, not even velvety, but a moonlit blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was because of the clear visibility that I believe there was more in the sky than what we specifically focused on.  The orbs looked very much like stars. When we first noticed one it seemed to be traveling towards the moon.  We’re not far from some airports and military bases, so we know what normal lights look like.  These were not normal.  They were just about the size of the stars, maybe just slightly bigger, and instead of having a golden hue on the edge like a star, they were white lights with blue hues on their edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched one travel towards the moon from the east, one of my friends spotted another coming from the northwest.  The one from the east was traveling much faster, and in a direction we could not attribute to any known flight path.  At that point we were still willing to dismiss the sighting as nothing more than planes but they were too high. The most intriguing part came when the orb from the east reached the moon. Instead of flying under it, as we expected the light to do, it began circling it, and not in a two-demential manner, but a three-demential one, where the orb actually disappeared behind the moon for a few minutes and returned to the side we could see only to go back around again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the orb from the northwest came right up to the moon it too began circling it too, but in the opposite direction.  As that was happening several more orbs of light started heading towards the moon.  As one of my friends began to panic, I was out numbered on the vote to remain and though I kept my eyes on it the entire time by the time we got to the car the offending orbs never came back around from the other side of the moon, all the orbs had stopped moving and the sky looked still again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was about it for that one. It lasted maybe ten minutes or so.  We were young, B+ and A students and though even writing it sounds strange I know what I saw.  When I later told another close friend about it, she too had seen the strange lights from her home in Croswell, Michigan, six miles away.  For the rest of the week we observed glimpses of these lights and more and more people came into the school talking about them.  The talk lasted a while, but everyone dismissed it as skeptical parents insisted we saw military jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure that is not what it was.  My father, who’s twin brother is a pilot, agreed that this sighting along with my other three are legitimately unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no photos of any of my sightings but will be sending a package of some maps and a few sketches with this story via mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A third set of four lights appeared a few minutes later, all in a horizontal line equidistant from each other (see the reported Myrtle Beach sighting dated 01/17/04...very similar description).

I awoke at 5:00 am on Wednesday, July 29, 2004.  I observed the large bright orb in the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains that I have been observing over the past several days.  It only appears sometime between 3:00 and 5:00 am.  (I get up frequently throughout the night and I always look to see if it is there and it never is in site before 3:00 am.)At this time I also observed 2 colored orbs that pulsated colors of green, red, and blue.  They were very visable through  my binoculars and they appeared to be circular or saucer shape.  I lowered my binoculars and watched the sky, from the bright light orb shot a colored orb.  I woke up my husband, who isn&#39;t as absorbed in these sitings as I am, after I saw the colored orb shoot from the bright object, he came and looked through the binoculars and saw the colored orbs as well.  I continued to watch the sky and as I did, 3 more orbs approached (smaller than the two already in sight) and lined up vertically between the two larger colored orbs.  As I watched, the large white orb slowly ascended higher into the sky as well as the colored orbs.  I know they are ascending slowly because the mountains are my scale, they appear initially just over the mountain and as the hour goes by, they slowly ascend upwards until they disappear into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think that what I am witnessing is very unusual and warrents further investigation from someone.  Will someone please get a hold of me?  The other part of this sighting is the bright light orb that appears in the western sky over the San Jacinto Mountains in the evening prior to the morning that it appears over the mountains in the eastern.  It always begins to appear around 8-8:30 pm and slowly desends over the mountain until it disappears behind the mountain range.  It takes about an hour for it to descend and dip below the range of my view. (The last report that I submitted I mentioned the Santa Rosa Mountains, my husband corrected me indicating that it is all the San Jacinto Mountain range that encompasses the valley where we live.)  My husband observes the bright object as well and agrees that it is very unusual and it does move slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the heck am I witnessing?????  I do not have the proper equipment to record my sightings, however, you are welcome to come and set up shop at my home so that you can record it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a blue-yellow color, but had a blue-ish dome on top. There were lights that looked like strings of icicle lights strung from the top of the dome to the outermost edges of the teardrop body. On the very bottom was a red light that flashed. On the top was a green light. The craft hovered at first, but then started to move, much faster than an airplane, to the north west, and got dimmeras it went. It did not appear to be spinning. it then fadded away above the treeline, which appeared to be between Woodinville and Redmond<n>

White in colour with very bright white patches which seemed to move across it&#39;s surface as if torch beams were being aimed onto it. Extremely frightening experience as i walked the perimeter of a field close to my house with the dog the object caught my eye, as i live right beside Glasgow airport here in Scotland my first thought was that this was just an aeroplane until i looked again, taking it in for about 1 minute until it flashed along the sky in a way that is hard to explain, it was there, then it was about 20 feet to the west, then another twenty and then it was gone. It wasn&#39;t a constant motion, it was like blinking. Im usually a rational person and have never believed in anything like alien life, nor am i religious in any way, but after thinking about this for a couple of hours i can&#39;t put any explanation to it. It was so close to me and so large. Tonight i&#39;m not going to sleep, too scared. My wife says she wants to believe me but she says she&#39;d have to see it for herself, but i know what i saw and this thing wasnt anything man made, the material it was made of looked like skin, its still vivid in my minds eye.

I even spoke to the rep. at NUFORC who seemed to not want to hear many details for whatever reason.  Therefore I am posting this again.  On the date and time specified I saw a black balloon floating high in the sky as I sat on my balcony at my apartment complex.  It was a hot July evening.  I noticed the &#34;balloon&#34; and stood up to look at it.  I thought of a contest we had in Sunday school as a child in which we were all given helium ballons to tie our names and phone numbers to so that if our balloon was found we would receive a call from whomever found it.  The one found from the farthest place was the winner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the balloon shifted into a horizontal shape and I could see what appeared to be heat waves like you see when you look down a road on a hot day. This balloon morphed back and forth from vertical balloon shape to horizontal oblong shape a few times as it moved lower in the sky and began to pass over my apartment.  I ran through my apartment to the front door.  When I emerged from the apartment the balloon was just above my apartment. It passed over me at that height and then a slit opened and a red light flashed and the slit closed.  It continued along over the next hill and morphed a few more times.  It made no sound whatsoever.  I don&#39;t know what I saw.  If you know please tell me. I have since seen a video clip of a similar thing from Bristol Va. a few days later in August of that year.<n>

When I noticed the craft it was on the side of the brick wall where I was standing at.  When it came within five feet of me it started to slow down.  I thought it could maybe be someone playing with a flashlight on a bicycle, but when I looked over the brick wall, i saw only the light and nothing else that could be causing the strange glowing object.  Then it took off in a northern direction, as if it had entered into hyperspeed.  Shortly after, about fifteen to twenty minutes, I went into a hypnotic trance and my memory became impared for about 6 to 7 hours.  I awoke into consciousness about 10:30 a.m.  Tuesday, July 27, 2004.  This event happend in Mojave, California.  Which is about 80 miles north of L.A.

It was a warm and beautiful night and the sky was clear and bright with stars .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the van and started walking the trail hand in hand,it was about 5 mins into the walk i wanted to return to the van, My husband jokingly asked &#34; why are you scared a bear&#39;s gonna get us?&#34;  I said &#34;No, but , I really want to go to the van now okay&#34;{for some reason i was feeling uneasy, and not knowing why untill what was to come}<n> <n><n> <n><n> We headed back to the van, sat inside and lite a cigerette, just sitting and visting and looking at the stars,i bent down looking for my cell phone to check the time when my husband said &#34; oh my god what is that!&#34;  I said, oh knock it off your not funny.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking that he was tring to scare me. But why I looked up to the direction he was looking I felt my heart racing and i started shaking.In front of our van, was this big light, it seamed to be bright white with color coming from the top and bottom the color seamed to be changing red, blue ,then yellow. the shape is hard to decribe but i&#39;ll do my best..  it looked like a ball with the top and bottom cut off and the top and bottom had a jagged appearence that is where the color was coming from this thig was a huge it seemed to be coming closer i got scared telling my husband, &#34;I want to go now&#34; he agreed i nervously turned our van around and speed out of the trails parking lot .<n> <n><n> <n><n> my husband then said oh my god it&#39;s following us. I looked up and it was following us but it seemed to be a little ahead of us .Now when we first saw this thing it was facing northeast when we got home it stopped above our home and was facing south west. We ran into our home ,then after about 10 seconds we went out side and it was still there we starred at it and talking to each other about what the heck is it . Then it dawned on me i said &#34;honey our video camera&#34;. We taped it, we have it on tape 6 mins and 23 secs. long it changes shapes, turns transparent,and it turns into a full clear triangle before it disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> and our camera kept dying in the minute of taping i had to go in and charge the battery a few times we that that was odd as well on the sighting .<n> <n><n> <n><n> the next morning we woke up with unexplained cuts and bruises on our face and feet.We have our tape in a safe place no copies where ever made,We are just waiting for the right oppertunity to share it with the world. signed , still amazed.<n>

We both got out of our vehicle and approached the disk, when we go close enough we both touched the craft. It was very cold to the touch however it was glowing red to blue. I was able to see inside the craft through a small window and was able to see three small beings. All appeared to be sleeping or meditating, they did not respond to my voice. As my wife and I walked around this craft it began to levitate and eventually flew off without making any sound at all. My wife and I promised each other that we would not tell anyone about this encounter however I could not resist. If anyone else saw this craft please post something. It took place around 2:00am.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On Tuesday July 27th 1:30 am my husband  was traveling south on Interstate 25 in New Mexico. He is a truck driver. The night sky was pitch dark. No moon or cloud cover. Traveling at 63 mph he noticed a bright blue light about 1/2 mile ahead on the exit ramp (south bound side exit 138) it appeared to be like a blue laser similar to the light people put on the hoods of their cars. As he came nearer the ramp he saw two figures aproximately 3-4ft tall. each was either holding a blue light or the light was coming from their head area. He could&#39;nt tell for sure. As he continued the figures appeared to be looking north and south. They looked toward his truck as he went by.  The figures seemed to have on loose fitting bright silver suits, similar to Haz mat suits. He couldn&#39;t tell if they were wearing helmets.  The terrain was flat and he did not see any vehicles in the area. The ramp was an overpass so nothing could of been out of his view. He slowed to turn around and go back but the next exit was 30 miles down the road. My husband and I have been driving truck for 14 years, we have seen strange lights but nothing as strange as this. Please feel free to call if you would like a first hand account. Thank you<n>

The object was a V shape but came to points. The object had faint lights on the tips of the wings and on the front tip. The object moved in a zig-zag path but didnt appear to be making much distance. Soon a friend came and picked me up but I made him pull over so I could point the object out to him. I was able to direct him to the object in the nights sky and sure enough it was stil WAY up there slowly moving in this zig-zag formation making no noise at all. The object was not completly opaque, it had an extremely faint metallic green-blue tint. We were able to watch it for a very very long time so we diceded it wasnt going anywhere soon so we drove to find another place to view it but when we arrived about 10min later it was no longer in the sky. I do not know if this was a black triangle that was distorted by the dark of night or somthing like that. But since it was so high up I was just wondering if anybody else on the coast of california had seen this during the summer of 2004<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was about 15 miles north of  Sutherland when I noticed to the south-east of the stars were blinking out as if something was traveling along and blocking out the stars in the constellation Gemni.  The area where the blocked out stars was darker than the sky.  At this point I could see the lights glowing from Bailey Yard (Union Pacific, North Platte 20 some miles to the east from behind the hills.  I used this as a somewhat known distance to judge the blocked out area which appeared to be standing still and would have put  it between  Hershey and Sutherland.  I continued on to the south keeping an eye on the object until i reached the North Platte River bridge which dropped down to the river bank.  I attempted to see if it was still there but couldn&#39;t see for the trees until I was on the bridge itself.  I was about  half way across the bridge when I regained the darkened area.  The object was moving to the south very slowly and was shapped  with a needle nose spreading back into a triangle.  The rear of the triangle had a shaft extending out a ways elongating into a sideways oval.  The Oval had two lighter spots in it, not quite lights, maybe engines?  The skin of the object was coal black and appeared to be made up of angles something like the Stealth Fighter. (BUT NOT THE STEALTH FIGHTER OR BOMBER)  I would say the object was about  300 yards long and 100 wide at the triangular front end.  I continued to the south until I came onto the two mile road north of Sutherland and turned to the east.  I stopped and got out to get a better look.  I heard a low pitched hum which seemed to be coming from the object which was heading south towards I-80 and US 30.  It seemed to be moving about 3-5 miles per hour (Just creaping along) and about 1000 foot altitude or so.  It seemed to me it was about a mile or two away to the east.  I watched this object for several minutes until it  disappeared to the south and the lights of the rest area on I-80 interfeared.  I  came on home and reported what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was simpularly shapped to one I saw floating above the river  in the 80&#39;s and the same color and had a simular sound to an object seen over Sutherland in the 80&#39;s  Did I see something not of this world or did I see something the U.S. Government is experimenting with??<n>

Immediately noticed an orange ball of light in the southeast night sky.  Wondered out loud &#34;What&#39;s that&#34;.  Two of us watch for about 5 seconds and ask eachother &#34;Is it bouncing&#34;.  We both look away and blink.  We look back to determine the following: 1.Based on my estimation of height and distance (not sure what these measurements would be, but it&#39;s low and not very far away), the object looks to be about the size of a large SUV or van.  2.If there was a sound to be heard, the conditions were perfect; clear skies, no wind, very calm.  However, we heard nothing.  3.It&#39;s moving from east to west.  4.Strangest of all, it appears to be &#34;bouncing&#34;.  That is, moving up and down with short, quick movements while horizontal speed is slow to stop. Speed changes are eratic. Almost seems like we&#39;re watching a living creature.  After about 1 minute, I removed the window screen and climbed out onto the garage roof for the best possible view.  Watched object continue west (again, bouncing with variable rate of speed) for another 2 minutes until it became obscured by neighborhood trees.  I&#39;ll add here that I am an avid sky watcher and am quite familiar with aircraft types and air traffic patterns.  This one just didn&#39;t match up with anything I&#39;d seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were extremely high up, so much that I knew they could not be a US craft. The speed that they were going must have been very fast for the height they were at. At first, they were very close to each other, but then moved in different directions. My friend and I could tell that they were cylindrical in shape. We watched them for about five minutes before they were too far away to see. There wass absolutely zero possibility that they were airplanes, because they were so high up, almost to the point of being in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very orange/red this time again.  I went outside to see if I can see it last night after work.  It seems when ever we go out to look for it, wait 15 or 20 minutes, we see it.  My wife was inside this time.  I saw it, looked through my binoculars and saw it moving around right above me.  Very high.  Still a round sphere.  I called my wife to come out and see again.  I kept my eyes on it the whole time.  You can see it with your bare eyes okay, but better with binoculars.  This is the 5th one I have seen in about a week, or the same one 5 times.  Good thing I see so many other people here seeing this.  It moves back and forth, sometimes smoothly in one direction.  This time just before my wife got out, it moved West extremely fast out of sight.  Like almost a blur.  As high as it is, it must have really gone fast.  I make it a habit now of going outside after work with binoculars and I usually see it now.  It is really making me wonder what the heck this is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were leaving St. Louis, East on HWY 270, which was to a crawl going over the bridge from Missouri to Illinois because of road construction. We were at slow pace for at least 15 minutes (Approximately 12:44 pm CDT) , and maybe went five miles during this time. My husband noticed an object in the sky in the distance. The object appeared to be hovering in the same location. It was obviously not a plane because it appeared to be in the same position the whole time. It was too large to be a helicopter from our viewing distance. It was oblong in shape. It is possible it could have been a blimp given the large size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures and submitted via email. I am not sure how long the object remained as traffic finally broke free and we continued to out of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I expected it to be a plane however and watched for its lights to trail off. No lights appeared until about 30 seconds later. A second blue flash appeared slighty east in the sky from the orgin. This dispelled my guess of it being a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Summary: 2 quick flashes of light distant from eachother appeared in the sky over the Santa Cruz mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night was very clear. I went to lock the back patio door when i noticed a red light over a tree line behind my house.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it when i first saw the object but became curious when i noticed that there were flashing lights on the object.  Although i realize there are lights on such things as aircrafts it caught my attention because the object was stationary or &#34;just floating&#34; like a wieghtless object. The lights were a bright red.  They would also fade in and out and a bright white light would be present. The object was a little  distance away so i could not observe it&#39;s exact shape.  From the different angles which i saw the lights from it seemed to be a fair size.  After observing the object for some time a few strange things started to happen.  As i stared at the object it seemed as there were flashes of light on the treetops.  This may be a result of me starring at these lights for some time.  Another strange thing that occured after about 15 minutes of observation was that all the silouhettes from houses andtrees seemed to dissappear and all that could be focused on was the lights.  it was almost as if i was being hypnotized.  the only way i could see the houses or the treetops were if i closed my eyes or looked away for a few seconds but they would dissappear shortly after.  This may not have been due to the object but i observed a very faint flashing white light.  There was no solid light (one that was on for any duration of time) but it would appear and dissapear every few seconds.  The object was statonary for about 15 minutes and then the most amazing thing happened.  It started moving in very eratic patterns without a sound. It would be siting there and all of a sudden it would move up and down then stop.  It would move diagonally and turn so sharply that it amazed me. I was scrambling around looking for binoculars or a camamra all of which my parents took with them on vacation.  All i remember feeling was a little frieghtened but also amazed.  Although i am strong believer in UFO&#39;s this is my first encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After seeing the second one irratic movements, swiftly moving short distances in the sky very quickly, stayed in southwestern sky.After about twenty minutes of the movement the red and blue lights came, extremely bright, the red light was bright when it hit my eyes, at this point they came closer so they were the brightest lights in the sky tried to make contact at this point by shinning our flashlight at the moving lights, they seemed to ignore us,about another twenty minutes later the two lights just stopped we starred for about another ten minutes and a bright light, about the size of a dime or a penny in the sky flashed twice, one blue, the other red. The two lights wich stopped were now moving again for about ten minutes they stayed in the same area of they sky, then they went to more of a red and blue for five minutes, the lights suddenly went out.Contact me, i have pictures in devolpment ((e-address deleted)) is my addy.<n>

We live high up so we can see the lights of vancouver, and then I see a light sort of looked like a star really far to the north-east of Vancouver, and I see this light and I figured it was a plane, but it didint seem to be moving. When you look at a plane you see a blinking light, but this didint have any blinking lights. I knew it was facing me by the way the lights were but suddenly it goes through clouds that are directly behind it. A plane would have had to circle around so within one second I can see it again after it came out of the cloud and it was going faster then any plane ive ever seen it was hard to say what shape it was but if I had to guess I would say Teardrop. It was dark colored<n>
7/25/04 22:07|Lacey|WA|Light|5 minutes|Yellow/Red Slow Moving Craft and Two Flashing Starlike Objects Over Lacey, WA|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38322.html|66|ndxe200407| Yellow/Red Slow Moving Craft and Two Flashing Starlike Objects Over Lacey, WA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling, by car, north on Ruddell Rd SE, starting at the junction of Ruddell and Yelm Hwy, I noticed a bright yellow light about 40 degrees above the horizon. The light appeared to be traveling slowly south-southwest. I initially thought it was a planet, but it was clearly moving. I then assumed it was an aircraft. However, I could see no other lights and no flashing on the craft. As I turned east onto Mullen Rd I noticed that the light had turned red and appeared elongated. This change prompted me to pull into a parking lot to get a better look. At the same moment I noticed two smaller starlike objects in the same area of the sky. They flashed like strobe lights, and appeared to jump up and down as they continued on their trajectories. There was also an easily identified airplane flying east of the objects, apparently at the same altitude. The objects eventually went behind some tall trees and I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusions: the red object may have been a blimp or some kind of personal craft. I suspect the craft had a yellow headlight or spotlight, which ceased to be visible as I traveled north and as the craft passed me moving south. The starlike objects could have been very high altitude jets passing over the region coincidentally. Because of the flashing of the starlike objects, it was hard to tell their flight paths. One or both of them may have changed direction, but I am not certain of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main reason I&#39;m reporting this incident is that others in the region may have seen it and may be able to provide more information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer background: I am a hospital manager with an MBA and more than a passing interest in astronomy and the UFO phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched and took pictures for approximately 45 seconds then in the last photo I caught what looks like the plume of the craft as it zipped away at high speed.  I know this wasn&#39;t a jet liner or helicoptor because of the way it moved.  I was using a Cannon Powershot S50 for the pictures and had the zoom at approximately 9.  I was outside originally taking pictures of the sunset when this caught my eye.  I have 4 pictures in total.  My guess as to distance in picture 1 is approximately 3-4 miles.  It neared to as close as 1 mile then sped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had to have been larger then a football field. It was white on top and light gray on the bottom. It was rectangular shaped but the top was kind of rounded. Not like anything I have ever seen before. It was pretty far away but it was huge. Probably 5 times bigger then any plane I have seen in the sky. It was also completely motionless. We turned back around to look again because some trees got in the way but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If the North star is 0/360 degrees, the event occured at approximately 265 degrees, at approximately the same hight as the North star.  It was very small and appeared to be very far away.  I could make out no shape, as it appeared simply as a speck of light.  The object then proceeded to move North across sky at what appeared to be a very impressive rate.  The object then stoped in the sky.  At this point I watched the object for a period of 5 minutes, in which it did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/25/04 04:15|Casa Grande/Phoenix (between)|AZ|Unknown|Approx 3 Minutes|Small light moving fast, suddenly changed shape to expose more lights, shape of craft, and a source of the lights.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38358.html|74|ndxe200407| Small light moving fast, suddenly changed shape to expose more lights, shape of craft, and a source of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were headed back to Phoenix from Tucson after a concert, on the I-10 headed west somewhere between Casa Grande and Phoenix.  At about 4:10 or 4:15 in the morning, I see to the left of the car (which would be the south side of the interstate) a small light travelling in the same direction as my car.  I would say it was about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away from us, and at first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, but the way it moved was like nothing I had ever seen before.  It was able to change directions so quickly there was no possible way it could have been a helicopter or an airplane.  It was about this time that my friend Josh said &#34;WHOA, UFO!&#34; and pointed out in the direction of the light I was observing.  It seemed like it was on cue, but as soon as Josh spotted the same fast moving light that I was looking at, the object either appeared to change shape, or some lights were turned on that emitted about 8 or 10 beams that completely lit up the desert below the craft.  The source of the lights were clearly visible and they almost had an orange or purple tint to them.  There was a row of lights on the bottom part of the craft, shining down on to the desert floor and I could also see slighly dimmer lights around the edge of the craft, above the spot lights.  It continued to move the same direction as the car for about 10 or 15 seconds, then change directions, approx South and either landed or was moving extremely fast and went over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The one object has red blinking lights over the bright white one,and in the center of them is one that appears more rounded and blinks on and off with some red and green and white lights. The others appear the same but one is west and the other N.east front of the bright one. Today is Jully 26th and they are back again! We saw them last night also hovering and seemed as if they were peering at the electrical towers on the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After 3 minutes the cloud wasn&#39;t there either!  What in the world was that????<n>
7/24/04 23:07|Sanikiluaq (Canada)|NT|Light|45 minutes|Unidentified flying lights|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39961.html|77|ndxe200407| Unidentified flying lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been on a fishing trip for the afternoon on a Saturday.  It was a nice clear day and you could see the stars as dusk was slowly taking its course.  We decided to head back home on our &#34;atv&#34; - [all terrain vehicle], as we were on the trail which is about 20 kilometres from the community, I was a passenger on the &#34;atv&#34;, as we were riding hard I then had to go to the &#34;little boy&#39;s room&#34;, to take a leak, as I was doing my business, I was looking over the horizon - something caught the corner of my eye and it was a light, a big hovering light and it wasn&#39;t twinkling like the stars do on a clear night.  As I watched the light hovering, there was another movement right underneath the bright light and these were of different colours - 2 RED lights rotating in a clockwise direction, and they seemed to be rotating at an equal distance from each other with unexplainable speed, while this was happening another 3 lights appeared or seemed to come out of the bright light at a phenomal speed and they were smaller than the &#34;mother ship&#34; but they were the same size as the 2 red ones that were rotating.  As we were watching the lights and marvelling at the rate of speed they were showing, 3 &#34;atv&#34;&#39;s appeared on the trail going home on a fishing/hunting trip.   As we were looking on, the lights then stopped on what they were doing, as they seemed to notice the atv&#39;s.  The lights then headed towards the oncoming atv&#39;s and proceeded to go towards them, then when they came upon the atv&#39;s they started to hover above them and followed there every move.  As we were watching them, I jokingly said &#34;Oh no, they&#39;re going to be abducted by the lights!&#34;  As we were watching the atv&#39;s go on, the lights were moving on as they seemed to lose interest atv&#39;s.  Back to the original spot where we had just watched them.  I then said to my friend that we should wait for the atv&#39;s to see if they noticed anything up in the sky.   We decided to wait for them, the first 2 atv&#39;s just passed us and didn&#39;t stop, seeing this, I decided to flag down the 3rd atv - he stopped.  My first question was &#34;Did you see the lights?&#34;  The driver seemed to be perplexed as I asked the question,  &#34;What lights?&#34;, he said.  I then went on to tell him that they were being followed by the lights for about a minute, and the lights moved on, he looked at me as if I was a madman and he drove off.  As the other 3 atv&#39;s were on the trail we were behind them and they had stopped for a cigarette, meanwhile, I kept looking behind us, above us, and all around, I then noticed the lights going in a northerly direction while these other guys were stopped, I tried to show the other 2 drivers but they weren&#39;t the least bit interested and didn&#39;t see what I was trying to show them, until I went over to the 3rd driver who proceeded to ask me where I was seeing the lights, I then pointed towards the lights and he saw them.  I was happy or relieved that one of them saw the lights.  To this day I can only say that I have seen something not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were watching these lights when we saw a bunch of quads(four trax atvs) there were two lights that were following them and hovering over them until they came quite close to where we were watching the lights, we asked if the people on the quads saw the lights too but the first two quads did not see them but the third fellow saw what we were looking at and panicked, he went to get his family from their camp site and took them home fearing that they would be abducted by the lights!

Once we were on interstate 68E. the object was above and to the left of our car then was above and in front of us and came down closer. Remember white, red and blue lights.  Then another object with the same kind of lights was in the sky to the right side of our vehicle and headed right toward the first object.  They went so close to each other, i thought they were gonna crash into each other right in front of us.  Then the second object shot backwards from us, headed west and was so fast it was out of sight in seconds.  The first object continued heading east toward cumberland.  I got a call from my oldest daughter who just got off work in Lavale, Md. She was freaking out like something happened to her.  Her car stalled in the middle of a main intersection in LaVale. We were seeing this strange object while i was on the phone with her and i was telling her that we just seen 2 ufo&#39;s.  As we got off our exit for LaVale to go get her the first object continued toward Cumberland. We seen this from Frostburg to LaVale.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/24/04 00:00|Palm Springs|CA|Circle|15-30 seconds|I saw a flashing colored orb in the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38307.html|85|ndxe200407| I saw a flashing colored orb in the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I have been witnessing began on July 19, 2004 at approximately 2:30 am.  I live in a canyon of Palm Springs, CA that is surrounded by the San Jacinto and the Santa Rosa Mountains.  Our home has many large windows that open up to view the mountains.  I awoke to use the restroom around 2:30 am and was taken aback by a large white &#34;light&#34; that was literally illuminating my bathroom.  The light was too big to be a star and was very close to the mountain top (it was in the eastern sky).  It had some dimision to it but I can&#39;t really say what shape it was, it was just the brightest light I had ever seen.  I woke my husband because I didn&#39;t want to be the only one to see it, he looked at it and agreed that he appeared to be too large and bright to be a star.  The following evening at around 9:30 pm I looked over the mountains to see if I could see this light and it wasn&#39;t there, however, there was an orb that was flashing blue, green and red lights, I observed it closer with a pair of binoculars and it appeared to be pulsating.  My husband saw it also.  We went to bed and I woke up around midnight and again at 2:30 am, the orb was still there flashing but the bright light was not there.  I went back to bed to awake again at 4:30 am and the bright light was there again, in the same spot, there were more colored flashing orbs around the sky but not as close as the one observed earlier in the evening.  I have been watching the sky every night since.  On Thursday, July 23, 2004 I was driving down Highway 111 in Palm Springs around 8:30 am, it was dusk and I saw this bright light in the western sky over the Santa Rosa Mountain range, it appeared to be moving slowly downward towards the mountain.  I got home and got my husband to come out and look, he saw it also, the light continued to drift downward until it disappeared behind the mountain range.  I looked around the sky and with my binoculars, I could see several flashing orbs, all with green, red and blue lights. Every evening since July 19th I have awoken at different times during the night to see if the light is in the eastern sky, it has never appeared before 12:30 am and is always still visable until the sun rises.  As I watch the light it slowly drifts upward.  Interestingly enough, the light in the western sky that drifts in and down appears to be the same light that settles over the mountain in the eastern sky to only drift back up until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My siting last evening is what has compelled me to report these sightings.  I awoke at 12:38 am and looked out towards the eastern sky over the San Jacinto Mountains and I saw a circular shaped orb that had red, green, and blue lights on it and it was hovering in a stationary position over the mountain.  It was the same orb that I have seen in the sky higher up only this time it was low almost sitting on the mountain.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and then it just disappeared, I stood there with my mouth to the floor breaking out into a cold sweat.  As I kept my eyes glued to the sky, the orb reappeared, flashing and hovering and then dipped below the mountain range. The bright light was not in the sky.  I awoke at 4:30 am again to find the bright white light hovering in the same position that I saw the circular orb.  I am pretty freaked out at this point and I am starting to think I&#39;m crazy.  Has anyone else in the Palm Springs area reported such a siteing?  I know that I will see the light again tonight, It seems to be getting closer to the mountains every evening.  The orbs continue to flash about the sky around this area.  Any clues as to what this could be???????  I am sorry that I have not photographed my siteing, however, I plan on trying to this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He Did and they took him to a hanger on one of the airbases in FL. His uncle told him that there were 3saucer like craft there. He was asked to drill into one of them and he tried. He said he drilled in one spot for about 15 mins. There was no sign of any marks where the drill had been placed, No heat or color change no nothing. I never saw the airman again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Check my first report<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was similar to my encounter a few days ago, only that each craft moved in completely different directions. The first one was a star-like looking object with a 1 second interval flash very similar to the fourth craft I saw a few days ago. It moved fairly slow from South to North. The second one was identical without a flash and moved from West to East. The third, identical appearance, except it moved freely wherever it wanted. It started from the South and strayed towards the Northwest zigzagging a few times. This time my girlfriend was with me as opposed to my last encounter. She witnessed 2 of the 3 craft. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s still continuing because I saw three within 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
7/23/04 21:45|San Joaquin Valley|CA|Light|30 minutes|Several lights spotted along I-5, maybe helicopters but they flew low over crops, changed their light set ups, and flew real radical.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38419.html|90|ndxe200407| Several lights spotted along I-5, maybe helicopters but they flew low over crops, changed their light set ups, and flew real radical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding with a friend Friday night, driving from San Diego, California, to the San Jose area up near San Francisco. We were driving through the San Joanquin Valley area when I started to spot some lights in the sky off to the East side of the highway. What caught my attention was that I saw 4 white lights rise up, almost in a straight line, then angle off, turn, and seem to dim. Then the aircraft apparently turned to face the highway again and I saw the four lights level off and look real bright. It looked like a plane coming into land at an airport. I watched it land, but right after it came in close to the ground, it turned, and rose straight up off the ground again vertically. That&#39;s what made me think it was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was strange and mentioned it to my friend. I looked back over my shoulder to watch it some more and it continued making odd ariel manuevers. We kept driving, however. I thought that would be it, but we kept driving, and further up, I spotted it again. This time I was able to point it out to my friend. Just like before, these lights made the same odd pattern. They rose up in a straight line, banks, and flew around over more crops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how many their were, but I spotted three at one time, so, I know it wasn&#39;t the same aircraft, and I saw at least one land. This luckily happened closer to the highway than the other lights and I could make out more. There was a flashing light at the top of the aircraft, which, everything about it seemed to say helicopter to me, but I couldn&#39;t see it&#39;s shape, just lights. When this helicopter landed, it was facing a vehicle that was parked in a field at the edge of some tall crop. The vehicle had lights on, maybe a door open with interior lights on as well, but I couldn&#39;t see anyone. The helicopter sat there on the ground for a bit, then lifted back up, circled, and then turned on a spotlight. It actually flashed across the highway for a moment as he began flying over the crops again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this occurred between Kettleman City and Los Banos along the I-5. I saw more of this  towards Kettleman City than Los Banos. The number of lights and their frequency tapered off as we drove further north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I know that these aren&#39;t exactly black triangles I&#39;m reporting and I&#39;m not native to that area, but this just seemed really odd to me. Is this normal for the San Joanquin Valley? It&#39;s just crops out there, no really large townsthat I could see. I find it hard to believe that each farmer out there has his own private helicopter to crop his fields with at night, and I doubt I watched a half dozen police helicopter look for someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did I see? Is there some explanation for this? Maybe someone who lives in the area can help me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Pictures taken...|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42157.html|91|ndxe200407| Two craft near Houston witnessed by 8 people....AMAZING!!!  Pictures taken...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I crested a highway hill on a trip b/w Austin and Houston.  As I crested the hill, I noticed 4 cars stopped on the side of the highway, people out of their cars, staring into a field to the left of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed two lights in this field moving quickly, sporadically.  I stopped my car and got out.  I recorded the following events on my CELL PHONE CAMERA.  I have 8 pictures of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two lights/crafts.  They would &#34;float&#34; above the ground about 10 feet, and just kind of jerk back and forth, as if &#34;hound dogging&#34; above the ground.  Then, one craft shot directly up and became bright pink.  The other craft turned bright white and shot to the right and behind a hill.  They both came back together to the original area, and their light was dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one of the craft started to glow orange. and shot up about 50 feet, then back to the ground, and the two just circled a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one turned a bright green and started this zig zag movement, and the other one turned blue and shot to the right.  They traded places in the sky, and one of the pictures I recorded shows a distinct blue saucer shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then came together, turned a bright pale yellow, and shot up straight in the air.  They were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the witnesses shared their experiences before departing, changed forever.  We believe we witnessed a true encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we went to leave, we had no idea that we had spent 21 minutes observing this phenom.  It was as if time had not passed in outselves.<n>

My girlfriend ((name deleted)) and I noticed a small cylindrical shaft of bright white slowly ascending in the sky before us.  The object was positioned in front of a low lying dark cloud and allowed us to gauge distance and direction better than if it were only a clear sky.  After ascending for a few minutes the object simply faded away, though not within the cloud or behind any obstruction.  It simply dissolved.  Object left no trail.  A minute later a hellicopter flew out to roughly the same spot then turned and flew back in the direction it came.  I&#39;ve never seen a ufo before, I probably never will again, but this was definitely not an airplane or bird or reflection of the sun.  It was a tangible something-or-other that had us both entranced.<n>

There are a lot of military aircraft in the area, so it seems like I&#39;m always looking up. I watched the cloud, nothing came out.? Bear in mind, I was driving,probably about 30 mph, so I had to keep one eye on the road. Usually military, and some commercial aircraft,I would have heard, but I heard nothing. I pulled over. I watched the cloud for ten minutes. Nothing came out. I wear glasses,so I&#39;m not above saying I could have been mistaken. It just seemed so clear. The sky was clear with white clouds on a blue sky. What I call a Simpson sky. I don&#39; have the ability to judge the distance of a cloud, but if I had to guess I would guess ten miles away. I just came directly in and entered &#34;ufo&#34;on my computer to see if maybe someone else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Same size and height as before.  It was firey orange/red this time, not silver.  We both looked at it with binoculars again.  We go outside to look for it on the weekends now and sometimes after work...and usually we see it.  That is very odd to me.  It was moving North to South this time.  Then is blinked out after a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there looking more and after about 20 minutes we saw it, or another one again.  Same size, height, but silver this time.  It moved in a zig zag motion quickly this time, then shot away behind the tree line.  It is very high, maybe 50,000 to 70,000 feet it seems.  I can&#39;t believe we are seeing it so often.  I see other people here are seeing the same thing we are.  That makes me feel a bit better.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I reported a sighting to George filer approx aug. 2002 along with photos that are still on his sight. It was extremely hot during week of 23rd july, 04 in rialto, ca and i could not sleep. So i went out to get fresh air at about 2 am when just above the mountains north of my house a huge and extremely bright light apearred. larger and brighter than anything i have seen in sky before except sun and moon. I watched this enormous and bright light with and without binoculars for an hour as it slowly traveled in a southern direction. on occasion there seemed to be a green glow surrounding light. it then began to fade to nothing and then reappear as bright as it was before and it continued this for about 5 minutes until disappearing completely. I did take several pictures from a camara that was in my company van for accident purposes. They have not been developed yet.

The light faded before reaching the water, and travelled a distance of approximately 2 hand lengths with arm extended. It did not &#34;explode&#34; like a firework or a boat flare normally would.  There were no boats visible on the lake at the time, and it was too far over the water to have been a firework launched from the shore. We also did not hear any sound come from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s possible that it may have been a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Right at that moment the object darted off at a right angle and within 8 seconds dimmed and was gone...disappeared out of sight.  The object was round in shape and lit up all around and had spike type legs (approximately 5 to 6) extending from the round center of the object.

The object at its distance would be as bright as a garage flood light about 50 ft away. It seems to stay low to the horizon, and a variably slow straight heading.  This is now the 4th occurence I have had so far.  There are only 2 quirks about this I have noticed.  I am now keeping notes of when i see it and what it does.  Then i noticed tonite, that the moon was out, waxing crescent.  The last time i saw it, the moon was at half phase.  The last thing was that soon after I observe the object, a plane or chopper of some type, appears from the direction of our local airport which is southwest of here.  Once that plane is airborne and climbing, the object begins immediately, almost, move in the opposite direction of the plane, until I lose sight of it in a treeline or building height.  Tonite however, the craft was about a ruler and ahalf away from the first plane following(holding a ruler to the sky), then two more planes or choppers(they had a distinct red light on each) joined in, but the object was too far ahead and they seemed to give up and turn due south.  The object still headed into the west, until i lost it in the treeline.  I happen to catch this object when i step out into my balcony for a smoke.  The last thing which i doubt is possible, i took my office sized(3inch) laser pointer with me the third time i saw this object(early last week) and pointed where i thought wsa directly at the object and it suddenly sped up, moving at a constant distance until it disappeared in the trees once again.  Although when i first see the object its moving away from the same location in the horizon each time, which is in between two towers of sorts with 3 red lights each.  The space between is where i first observed the object last month, and i believe i saw it lift from the ground(horizon at that distance), and continually head west as all the other times.  I am 26 yrs old and originally from New Jersey.  I am in the field of Security and i also do some work from home.  I am a deeply studied person in UFO&#39;s and phenomenon.  I believe i was in sound mind each of the times I have seen this lit object.  The color of the light that this object is would be a pale yello, leaning towards white, and sometimes will seem to pulsate.  I hope this story gives a good idea of what may be in my home state of Nebraska, which I dont doubt carries many mysteries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you and keeps your eyes to the skyes.

Object came from the North-eastern horizon heading South-eastern. I first noticed it while driving back from the store around 4:00am. It had the same coloration as the stars however was at least 10 times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. It moved very slowly across the sky. At first I thought it was the lights from an airplane however it was moving far to slowly. It is moving much faster than the stars towards the north almost directly. I watched the object for over an hour. During that time I saw several meteors that streaked across the sky in almost the exact same path that the object is taking. I also saw a satellite heading straight towards it until it could not be see anymore with the naked eye. Most likley it&#39;s reflect was over-powered by the light from the object. This object is at an extremely far away. My best guess is that it is one of closer planets and is just reflecting far more light than usual. This would explain the slow speed, and why it was still going much quicker than the rest of the stars? Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I noticed a bright light shining through my kitchen window. I looked at the light while I was out side, and then noticed one higher above the one lowest to the ground. The higher one had red lights blinking. As I looked past a tree in the neighbors yard I could see one that appeared to be a rounder one with blinking blue and green lights, and sometimes white. Sometimes the lights got dimmer. They were in kind of a V formation. I watched them until about 4:30am and then I went to bed. I also saw them the next three nights. They do the same routine. Maybe just a little different. There are electrical towers on a mountain where I think they hover over. I do not own a cam corder or I would have taken pictures of them.

I just gazed up into the sky and started looking around when I noticed a really really bright star just over the tree line. I pointed it out and we watched it for about a minute, then it started moving. It moved slowly to the left, then back to the right. It went diagonally in all directions and once did a circle. It stayed in the same general area for about 2 hours, then when it left it would curve up to the right, then up to the left, etc. until it finally curved up to the right and disappeared. When it was floating around it would be a really bright white light, then dim down to a blueish glow, then back to a really bright white light. Occasionally the bright white light would disappear and through binoculars you could see 4 lights, green, white, blue, and red. Once it emitted a white beam upwards from the white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Venus sighting.  PD))<n>

Suddenly out of the southern sky is a light heading due north. I assumed it was either a high flying plane or a satelite (probably a satelite because of the apparent altitude and speed), I&#39;ve seen quite a few in the last 3 or 4 weeks which I believed were satelites because of their apparent altitude and speed (I watch the ISS whenever I can and their speed is comparable although slightly faster). It was heading directly over my head when it suddenly stopped and then about 5 seconds later just vanished. The sky is very clear with no clouds whatsoever and where it vanished was among a number of stars. As far as I am aware, satelites cannot just stop in mid orbit and neither can high flying planes. Were it not for it stopping and then vanishing, I would not have found it unusual, I would have just assumed it was a satelite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both friends spotted it before me, as it took my eyes a minute to adjust to the clear bright sky. We were looking west in the direction of W.hwy 80. The object hovered and intermittingly moved as though it was going in and out of visibility. Every time it would do a sharp fast maneuver the sun would reflect silver. The object appeared to be at least 20000 ft high at first, hovering, then disappearing and appearing 1000&#39;s of feet lower, sometimes higher. Then it would do a 180 degree (half circle) maneuver and disappear only to reappear higher again. It was moving from west to N.east and eventually went straight over my apartment. The object was the typical silver saucer type. When it moved from south to north in a straight line it had some kind of tail behind it, hard to describe. It glowed amber/white. We watched this craft for 30 minutes. I watched my watch carefully as time seemed to stand still. I have never in my life watched a UFO for this long! 5-10 minutes at the most with a few past sightings but this was unreal. I remember the times specifically because I had a doctor’s appointment at 1:30pm that afternoon which I ended up being late to by 5 minutes and the doctor’s office is right across the street from my apartment not 2 minutes away. My two friends watched it for 5-10 minutes after I left for my doctors appointment as they say it came directly over the apartments at what they said was about 4000 feet. It then turned reddish amber and then just disappeared. The movements and maneuvering were simply mind blowing. No sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest part of this sighting was that after watching the craft for about 10 minutes I heard a jet high above. It must have been at least 30000 feet up and it was all white with a radar type thing on top. Military for sure. It came from east, (possibly the Fallon, NV airbase?) and turned left and was heading south straight for the craft. The craft seemed to toy with the jet, appearing above then below flying in front then behind. Then the craft just hovered and seemed to start ignoring the jet as the jet flew from north to south maybe 20-30 miles and then banked east and just flew till we couldn’t see it anymore. The strangest part was that as the craft hovered and maneuvered around the jet, the jet turned on some kind of ultra bright light of some kind that came from the center area of the plane and flashed a steady bright light that resembled a huge camera flash but it stayed on for at least 45 seconds then went off. All I know is the gov knew it was up there and must have been checking it out. The craft as it toyed with the jet, it seemed to show off to us. I think what seemed like a 30 minute sighting may have involved missing time. All I know is my watch said 30 minutes had passed from the time we first started watching the craft, until I left for my appointment.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No objects/crafts seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A report on events experienced by myself in late July of 2004 near Hays, Alberta, Canada.  I do not remember the exact day any more.  Time of event was between 10:25 pm and 11:00 pm (so after dark) and the sky was overcast.  My own position was roughly 50°04’20.91” N, 111°45’37.62” W (on Google Earth, if you wish to see the area).<n> <n><n> <n><n> These events were documented right after I experienced them, but I have since misplaced the paper I wrote on.  I did not know of any organizations that I could report this case to, though I’ve told about three other people since it happened.  In general, what I experienced were two separate and distinct events that appeared to be the effects of a release of energy of some kind.  I did not see the source(s) of the energy release(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The narrative of events:  I was working (for my third summer of employment) on a grazing lease near Hays.  My job was to maintain and operate the pivot irrigation equipment on the lease land.  I was about to retire for the night when I remembered that I needed to check on a pair of pivots, through which we were spreading fertilizer, to make sure they were still running.  I took the farm truck to the site (the coordinates given above) and checked on the fertilizer feed (the pumps were still running).  As the fertilizer was almost gone, I sat in the truck to calculate how much longer it would last so I would know when to close the fertilizer feed (looking at my watch at this point, it was around 22:25 local time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon finishing my calculations, I closed the door (which I had kept open for the cab light) and looked up through the windshield in time to see a dull red spot of light in the clouds to the south and a little west.  The spot expanded, becoming a ring of the same red light, and continued to spread across or, more appropriately, through the clouds like a wave created by a stone dropped into water.  As the edge of the ring passed overtop of me, both pumps were shut off (they were electric).  The time from first seeing the spot to the edge of the ring passing over me was 2 to 4 seconds.  I heard no sound that I did not recognize and assume that there was no sound to accompany the red light ring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After wondering at this for a couple more seconds I got out of the truck and turned the pumps back on.  Having to prime them manually, this took roughly 15 minutes.  As I opened the truck door again to get in, my attention was turned to a little south of east, where I saw a bright flash of light that seemed to come up from the ground, its source hidden by the hill between me and it.  This time the light was bright white nearer to the ground and was shaped like a beam from a spotlight pointing straight up.  Higher in the sky, but well below the clouds (probably less than 300 ft) the white light became blue, then purple before becoming too dispersed to see.  This light event took place in a split second and gave me the impression that there had been some kind of large electrical spark or a small, contained explosion, which would be a cause for concern as there are oil wells and a storage area or processing station in the vicinity of where the light seemed to come from.  Again,! the light was not accompanied by any kind of sound, except that of the pumps surging, as if the electricity had been affected by this light or its source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for two or three minutes to see if anything else would happen and to make sure the pumps continued to run.  Then I set out in the truck to investigate the area where the oil wells are, but being already low on fuel and not seeing anything amiss on the other side of the hill, I went back to my bunk, definitely feeling “weirded out” by the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I told my boss about the second light I saw (but not the first) to see if he knew who monitored the oil wells.  He did, and he called them, but they reported no irregularities in their operation and no-one from their company was around that night.  Going past the oil well sites to check on other pivots, I noticed nothing different.  The pumps where I was the night before were still running when I checked that morning, so it would seem nothing else happened after I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never heard of anyone else seeing something similar, but would like to know if anyone has or if anyone knows the causes of either case.<n>

They were very bright in the sky along the foot hills that run on the south of the freeway.I was at about a 10 mile distance from where i was and the lights in the sky. The lights were a bright orange, kinda like a street light,these two balls of light side by side of each other and as I was looking at them all of a sudden they just slowly fadded away and then reappeared further west of the first time seen, but this time the lights were on top of each other for about 5-6 min.I had just pulled off the freeway so that I could view them thruogh my binoculars but all I could make out was the bright light, and no formation. What was Kinda rare was to see what seem to be some jets fling close to the lights in a circling motion.Then all of a sudden they slowly dimmed out into the night sky. I could still see the jets fling around since i could hear them. I Didnt see the lights anymore, also a Driver that was running with me saw this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I wathced the cloud, begining as a little puff, horizontal but very white, it began to drift down towards the earth and divided into two forks, which I thought might be a tornado.  This is why I took the photo.    I took the snapshot on my digital camera, stepping out the back door.  You can see the 8 foot board fence, which gives an idea of elevation of the objects in the sky.    When I downloaded the photo, the cloud is not apparent, but these two objects are visible.  I did not see them, they must have been obscured by the wispy white cloud, but I don&#39;t see how.  They did not appear to move, the cloud eventually disappeared or disappated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She and a friend that was visiting were in the swimming pool they were both facing south. My daughters friend was the  first I believe to see it and her first words were &#34;It looks like something from startrek&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter described the object as a big cross she said it was if you could reach out and touch it she said it was a dark color with a arrowhead point on the top of the cross it also had two lights on the underside at the bottom rear of the cross.  My daughter describes a light in the center point of the cross which she says illuminated most of the cross. the object was flying flat and there was no sound the object was coming from the south and heading northeast.  My daughter said it was moving in a very diliberate way not fast but not slow. The weather was clear skies and very warm.  With being in the pool and surrounded by houses my daughter had to get out to further observe the object moving to the northeast our friend never got out of the pool to further observe. Both could describe the object in great detail My daughter drew the object for me and she did not hesitate in any detail.  She called for me and my wife to come out but we did not hear her and she didn&#39;t want to lose sight of the object by coming in to get us. Both her and her friend continued to swim after the object moved on and they did not observe any further anomolies from that point on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went into my backyard to look at the sky since we saw the 3 objects yesterday.  After about 3 or 4 minutes, I saw the original silver sphere moving the same direction (west) as I saw the day before.  I told my wife to come out and that it was back.  She saw it, I went in to get the binoculars to see it better.  She kept watch on it.  We both looked at it again magnified and it was silver and a sphere.  At that height, It was probably a little smaller than a jet flying at about 40,000 feet.  This time we didn&#39;t see any other objects like we did yesterday flying around it (see my report from yesterday). Then at once, it blinked out...gone.  There was no high cloud cover this time like there was the day before.  I still had the trees as a still reference.  I think the odds of seeing this thing twice in two days is really strange.  The objects from the day before moved in odd directions around it and changed direction and speed.  This main sphere kept the same course during both sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very bright like a star in the sky but close and very visable.  And it made me want to look at for some reason I just had this feeling like it was kind of watching me. I then said to ((name deleted--friend)), I feel like its watching us man. He laughed and said &#34;oh no its a ufo&#34;, being sarcastic. And as I watched it it dimmed out very slowly and it was gone. But, what reminded me of this was that one report in Wisconsin Rapids, that was also reported like what I had witnessed around the sameday in Nekoosa and I&#39;ve always had this event in my head ever since. To this day I can&#39;t explain what it was.<n>

A bright reflection caught my eye. I was driving, my grandmother was in the passenger seat. I thought it was a plane but then noticed two of them, so I thought they were jets from the nearby airforce base. I noticed that they changed shape, the best I can describe it was like from a disk shape to a blobby orb shape. Then they would disappear then reappear. This is when i freaked out and asked my grandmother to look at the sky. I pulled over to try to convince myself that they were airplanes but there was nothing in sight. I did an internet search to see if I can find information which I did so now I am a believer.<n>

The weather conditions at the time were ideal, clear skies and warm temperatures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As stated, the object had no clear definable shape.

The gentlemen was pointing at the object as it silently moved across the sky overhead. I glanced upward and made visual contact immediately. Speed and altitude were difficult to estimate as I had no references to estimate the size of the object. I visually tracked the object for approximately 20 seconds. I then observed a small group of teenagers approximately 100 meters away from me also visually tracking the object. All of the persons in my immediate area were strangers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Gila Bend Az<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this to respond to a report by a truck driver who saw the same thing I did on 7/20/2004. I was the car behind him and I also  pulled off the road to watch the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming home from Yuma , driving North on HWY 85. I had been watching a large light that was above the Palo Verde Nuclear plant. It was very large and very bright white.  A color white that is hard to describe.  It was over a no fly zone for at least two hours.  (I had seen this object before when I was 10 years old in Mesa Az.) I was very excited and started calling everyone I knew to ask them to take a look. Then as I got closer to town  I pulled off the road to take some pictures,not long after a semi truck had also pulled off. I was stopped  right in front of Lewis prison and started to take photos.  Just then the object started moving towards my car.  The light actually turned off, I could still see the image and my camera caught it on film.  It was a bar bell shaped ship. Then about 12-16 f-16s came from all different directions  and went straight for it. I caught this on film to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw a bright , I wanna say explosion, it was like the ship sucked in one of the planes or  crashed into it or something.  The ship got extreamly bright, and in my photos you can see what looks like smoke. Then all of the planes went off in different directions and the ship got dim then  very bright once again. Then it swayed back and forth about three times , as if to get momentum, and took off very fast directly over my car.  It made only very quite , warm sounding vibration - if that makes sense? I was on the phone with my dad at the time and my cell phone went dead. After a few seconds I got service back and just then a cop pulled up and ordered me to leave. I asked him if hed seen what happened , he replied &#34;A lot of strange things happen out here , now get lost!!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day on the news they reported an f-16 had crashed while doing test maneuvers  and the pilot had died. The crash  was in the same area where I had witnessed the bazaar  event.  I sent the pictures and story to a gentleman at Shadow Research . They had the pictures analyzed and declared it a ufo and declared them as authentic. I have been trying for years to get some response from the air force, police, anyone to get some answers. Of course no one had any comments and or said I was crazy. I had photos to prove what I had seen. Since then all the pictures I had have been erased or lost. My lap top was stolen shortly after this and it had all the images stored  on it. I am now going to contact the guy at Shadow Research to see if he has them saved and ask for copies. I am sure he would have saved them, I know he did a lot of research on the story.  At the time this happened I was told by the air force they knew nothing about it.  How could they say that when one of there planes crashed and a pilot died?   I was also told to LET IT GO!  So I did.<n>

From where I was observing, it was presenting at approximately 10deg above the horizon or less, at a guess, 5 times higher than 30 St Mary Axe. As for its size, all That I can say is that I distinctly saw three lobes at maximum magnification, which is 60X on a Bauch &amp; Lomb Discoverer Zoom Telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky had broken cloud cover, and there were no stars visible to me at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending you this report in case someone else saw this object, in the hope that it might corroborate the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Riviera Maya, Mexico<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfrined and I went back to our hotel after dinner in Riviera Maya, Mexico, an hour south of Cancun. It was approx around 12/1AM. It was a very dark and clear night. Our room was right on the ocean and my boyfrined and I were on the balcony enjoying the cooler night air. I was looking for satellites (I do this often when outdoors at night). I saw what I thought was a satellite and pointed it out to my boyfrined. We watched it float across the sky slowly in a very straight line. We were faceing the ocean(East)and it was moving from North to South across the sky. After a few seconds it suddenly slowed down then moved BACKWARDS VERY VERY QUICKLY! From there it started moving very fast and erratically. Most satallites that I have seen in the past move in a very linear pattern at a semi slow and constant speed. This however would shoot across the sky, stop and make a 180 degree turn and shoot diagonally throughout it&#39;s random motion. We both kept asking each other if we were seeing the same thing, not quite beliveing our eyes. Whatever it was it gave me chills. Both my boyfriend are avid outdoor types. We have spent countless nights camping out all over the western USA in some very remote areas and neither of us had ever seen the likes of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Riviera Maya, Mexico|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38412.html|140|ndxe200407| I was visiting my parents and had just arrived at their home around 12:30am from the Los Angeles area. My folks were asleep and I put my luggage in the spare room and went out to the back patio, by the pool area to call my husband. As I was talking to him I saw a red triangle come up from behind the church roof. My parents live on a busy road but their house is set back from the road and the church is about a football field away. It was bright red inside the triangle with an outlining of yellow/orange. It was moving very slow, there were no sounds except for crickets and the sound of a light breeze through the trees. It was dark except for a few street lights across the street and the sky was clear as a bell. It also had like a white tail coming from the lower left hand corner but it wasn&#39;t attatched. I whispered into the phone, oh my god, oh my god, hon, there is something weird in the sky, he laughed and said why are you whispering, I just said I don&#39;t know this is really weird. Then the triangle began to get smaller where you could only see a little bit of the red part and the yellow/orange outside. It was still moving slowly up into the sky at an angle towards the Big Dipper. It then began to slowly get bigger again and I saw a red dot fly out of the lower left hand corner and disappear. Then seconds later there were 3 more balls of red. One came out the bottom center, the other to the right of that one and the third came out from the right hand corner, all disappeared in a flash. The triangle stayed at that size and was still slowly moving up into the sky. Moments later I heard an airplane coming from behind me, I turned around and it was going at a high rate of speed towards the triangle. I&#39;m not good with distances but if you out strecthed your arms this is about how far the plane was from the triangle, then the triangle suddenly just disappeared! Then out of the corner of my eye I saw 2 more airplanes coming in the same direction as the first plane. I looked and saw the first plane had turned around coming back towards me. These planes didn&#39;t sound like jets, just regular planes, but I couldn&#39;t figure out how come they were moving so fast. I was shaking, it was so amazing I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it, I could&#39;ve went inside and grabbed my mom&#39;s camera as she always has it right on a shelf handy, but I was afaid it would be gone and I didn&#39;t want to miss a second of it. Needless to say, I was there for 3 more nights and I found myself constantly going out looking for it, hoping to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a circle object, dark in color, lights all the way around the bottom of the object. Absolutly no sound what so ever. It was rotating counter-clockwise. About a couple hundred feet above the ground. I watched it until i couldn&#39;t see it no more. It continued eastward. The sighting lasted aprox. 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Continuing to watch, I braced myself against my patrol car to get a more stable point of perspective. The object had the brightness of a larger, bright star, when compared to the other stars that were visible, and, using other stars for points of reference, it was, ever-so-slightly zig-zagging, or tumbling as it headed toward the north-northwest. As it jogged about, its brightness remained constant. I watched until it went behind the clouds that were moving in over Seattle. There were no other lights that I could see on the object, and no con-trail. This thing must have been at or above the normal flight altitude that I regularly see airplanes at, and covered about thirty degrees of arc from the time I first noticed it until it went behind the clouds. No aircraft were in the area, which I thought was unusual as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We kept looking at it because a red flash caught our eye. It was not a plane because it seemed to be still. Then the lights kept changing color red, blue, white and green. Kind of flashing like police lights. Then it seemed to slowly move right stop up stop then left. We stayed watching like we couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing. It was to high up to make out a shape. But it seemed like a straight line when the colors were flashing. We eventually went inside to see if there was anybody we could call. We decided to go back outside to take a second look and reassure ourselves it wasn&#39;t just a star or our eyes plaing tricks on us and it was gone. All the other stars were visible. We live on five acres in the country so it is very easy to see the sky without the obstruction of streetlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Tonite a friend was visiting.  We went out to the back deck and we joked that we would see another UFO.  Immediately our eyes were drawn to a large star like object moving somewhat steadily through the sky, directly from north to south. Tonite there were no colored blinking lights, only one large white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it passed into the distance, the same dancing star as the night before began performing for us - moving slowly from side to side, ,back and forth, small circles, disappearing foro short periods of time, only to reappear somewhere close, but certainly out of line of a normal flightpath.... I couldn&#39;t believe our luck.  I kept asking my friend if she saw too its movements.  She did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was exactly one hour earlier, 24 hours later.  I just checked again and it&#39;s still up there, I watched it for 25 minutes and then cloud cover spoiled my view.  No sound from either craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is anyone else seeing this??<n>

I began to look at the stars, it being a clear evening (a rarity in central Pennsylvania). Almost immediately noticed a bright light traveling very slowly from west to east. The light was circular, very bright (shimmering) and was considerably larger than aircraft lights (at least 5 times as large).  I observed the light for several seconds (I&#39;m only guessing that it was 5 seconds) until it just vanished. Again, it was a clear evening so clouds were not a factor. I suppose this light could have been a meteor (although it was moving very slowly, and there was no &#34;tail&#34;).  I feel pretty sure, though that this object was not &#34;man made&#34;. Lastly, I&#39;d also be very surprised if others did not see this object as well.  Several conventional aircraft were visible in the area shortly after the event so I&#39;m tempted to call the airport to see if they heard anything about it. On the other hand I don&#39;t want to sound like a nut :-)<n>

They darted sideways and diagionally in a seemly random pattern; staying within the same general area of the sky. Occasionaly they would surge (sometimes two consecutive surges) extremely fast in a direction, leaving a briefly visible trail of light. When an aircraft flying north to south approached and flew past the area of the lights (but at a lower altitude),the red lights moved into the Western horizon and eventually disappeared from my vision behind a tree (at approximatley 9:30pm).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don&#39;t know if the pilot saw the spheres and intended to circle them or was some kind of  ground  traffic  news  plane? I could not identify the plane since I was more interested in the spheres. It circled several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were coming from  the  south  just  over the &#39;West Hills&#39; area at an altitude  of about  1000&#39; to 1500&#39;  and traveling at a constant speed and holding a constant altitude.  There was a large cumulus cloud directly over them with a base of about 3000&#39; that should have had enough thermal power to pull them straight up --if balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 2 to 3 of each color of  red,yellow, black and I think blue.They appeared to be 1foot to no more than 2feet in diameter?  There was some movement  of the spheres in the cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now comes the best part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they  were at  their closest point to me (I had a strong feeling at this point that they were not balloons) one of the black spheres separated and came straight down at a speed  almost  like a rock falling and came down somewhere close to the Clay Towers appartment building -- one block down from me. At this point they went out of view and I moved  to another location to watch as they continued over the city out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went over to where the black sphere came down but could not see it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Balloons cannot do this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an experienced  sky watcher and pilot. I have seen this phen- omena many times in other locations but I was quite surprised to see it over busy downtown buildings very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event proves to me that it is now almost impossible for most viewers to tell the difference  between balloons and real (possibly alien) UFOs.  If seen, you must watch them constantly to be able to catch the impossible--  as we know it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Go to :http://www.hbccufo.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1756 to download a video of a similar event  to what I saw-  captured in Arizona of a cluster releasing  an orb one month after my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speculation:  It&#39;s possible that real UFO spheres are mixing in with real balloons for cover?<n>

I saw it at 11:30 am. Over a time span of about 90 minutes, the object was witnessed by at least 30 people, including campus police officers, police cadets, teachers, staff and students of East Los Angeles College. One witness is a MUFON member. He told me to note that the oject was 265 degrees west. I would estimate the object&#39;s angular distance above the western horizon at 80 degrees. The object was seen through a single lens spy glass and through binoculars. My impression was that the object was a flat oval shape, reflective with a black coloration at the bottom that I took to be a shadow. It was parallel to the horizon, not moving. I phoned in a report to NUFORC at around 11:45 am. Shortly after, a second object was witnessed by about 10 people, including the police officers. The second object approached the first one, stopped, moved around a bit then &#34; took off &#34;. One witness said the second object disappeared.Campus police returned at around 1:15 pm and found the object again. About 6 people, including myself, looked at the object again through binoculars. This time the the object appeared tear-drop shaped, white and at a 90 degree angle to the horizon. It&#39;s angular distance above the western horizon had decreased to about 50 degrees. I took a digital picture in which a tiny white dot can be seen when you zoom in. My co-worker who had the original sighting starting at 8:45 am, and who found the object again at 11:30 am, returned that evening and located the object a third time at around 7:30 pm. Now the object was about 50 degrees above the eastern horizon! I took several digital pictures. The object appears as a tiny white dot. It seemed to slowly drift north. My co-worker will follow up with a report about what he witnessed between 8:45 am and 9:30 am, which was even more bizarre than the group sighting!<n>

There are electrical towers there. Above the one bright white looking light is something that looks round, but has red lights. Just beyond my yard is a tree and I could see another one there, and had lights that blink green and sometimes a blue and white. It seemed like the one that was red follows the one closer to the earth. Kind of like a V formation. I have observed this same sighting for four days in a row. I wish I owned a video cam corder, but I don&#39;t have one!At 4:49 I watched the one near the earth fly into space and dissappear within seconds. I tried to look at the shape of the bright white light near earth but it sometimes looks diamond shaped and then sometimes it looked more triangular. It was hard to tell, but the others appear to be rounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not moving very fast, so I thought it was a satellite.  It did not blink or twinkle.  It suddenly began growing in magnitude and got so bright it left a retinal burn that lasted a little while, maybe 5 minutes.  It kept moving without sound, never picking up speed or stopping, but soon faded into the dark.  I have no way to tell how high it was, but suspect it to have been very high, possibly in space.  This experience was quite humbling.  I waited a while to see if there were any more, but there were not, and it did not return.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw an object that was very high in the sky and moving very quickly.  All I saw was white light... not very bright, hazy in appearance. It seemed like the size of a airplane, but there was no noise and it&#39;s speed was incredible.  Because of the haze and distance away, it&#39;s impossible to say what shape the object was.  It moved south to north going the same speed the whole time.  I thought it may be a satellite, but am not so sure, I&#39;ve seen what I think are satellites and they&#39;ve alway had the appearance of a star moving across the sky relatively quickly.

We both saw a sphere, silver colored hovering at approx. 50,000 to 70,000 feet.  Below the very high cloud cover.  I went and got 2 sets of binoculars for us to see better.  We had a stationary tree as a reference point.  In the binoculars we could see it was round, silver and moving slowly west.  Then a smaller light, could only make out it was shining in the light, a glistening spec, blinked in slowly next to it.  The larger sphere always moved slowly west.  Thought it may have been a weather balloon.  The smaller one moved from above the sphere to below it, around it and then to the east.  The sphere moved with the clouds west.  It seemed as if the small light was moving around the sphere in several different directions at different speeds.  Then a red sphere appeared in the field.  So now 3 objects are visible all next to each other.  The small light moved southeast and blinked out.  The red smaller sphere moved away to the east and blinked out as the original siver sphere continued moving west until it was out of vision to the horizon.  These objects were very high up.  Very small even with the binoculars.  I assumed the two smaller objects that blinked out moved behind the cloud cover, which at that time was about 50,000 to 70,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeard as if the two smaller ones were examining the larger silver sphere, then they lost interest and left.  We both saw the same thing at the same time.  I am an electrical engineer and it was the oddest thing I have ever seen in the sky.  It was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At aproximately 2:47am while waiting for our camp fire to die down an object which was brilliant white light no strobes or sound could be seen or heard, Flew from a southernly direction over to our right and ahead of us to the north over some trees where it then proceeded to circle the area. The object could be seen as it passed behind the trees. It then dotted to the right along the trees Rising just above the tree line and then back to the south where it turned and then headed east and out of view. It then came back into view from the east and again ahead of us just over some trees. We could see the object kind of circling behind the trees before it dissapeared. Note: when the object was flying it looked as if it were skipping like a light being turned on then off then back on again made it look like dots being drawn in the sky. earlier in the evening it was overcast but the sky was clear at this point during the sighting. I did grab my video camera but so far I can&#39;t really see anything on it but static and our own voices.It looked saucer shaped but with a small flat section around what seemed like the back of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It started with one white circular object that came out of almost nowhere and dropped above a tree on a corner of my girlfriends street.  The tree is proably 30 feet high and the craft hovered about 20 feet above that.  It sent down 4 beams of light to the street and just stayed there.  My girlfriend and I noticed darker squares or rectangles towards the middle of the circle.  After hovering with NO NOISE for about 20 seconds it lifted slowly then bolted out of sight.  It flew up first then down then out of sight. After this I was a bit excited and looked towards the skies.  Out of nowhere a triangular shape came into focus.  It was a pulsing red color and then as it got closer and in front of us it turned BRIGHT WHITE.  We saw about 15 of these, that came from the same direction, SE.  About 5 of the craft seem to flow back and forth, and change altitudes the other 10 just flew straight.  All started red, then proceeded to change to white.  I tried to put it all of this off as maybe a helicopter for the hovering object and maybe just some military aircraft for the other 15 but it just didn&#39;t seem right.  All were color changing (red to white for the triangles, and white with small dark squares or rectangles for the hovering craft) and seem to just handle much better than military aircraft. We called the local police and guess what the craft stopped coming, so the police thought we were crazy.  Maybe I was just exaduating, but to me this was more odd than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then two spotlights came on from the southwest. Then two blue-white streaks moved from southeast to northwest moving much faster than the typical airliner traffic seen in these skies. THEN a F-A-S-T red streak came flying overhead from southeast to northwest!!!! What the hell was this thing? The only airbase that exists up that way is Beale, and that&#39;s been out of commission for years. Still seeing some residual helo traffic.

Being afraid owls would take the pup and my chihuahua, who was also out, I walked out onto the lawn to see how many owls there were and to keep and eye on the dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw instead was a wedge shaped object circling in about a mile and half radius. It was first colored a bright blue/green. I got the impression of metallic coloring, then after about 20 minutes had a rainbow like color rippling through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it going in a clockwise manor then abrubtly change direction and go counter-clockwise. It would then go in a rectangular pattern or triange....zip south to north in the blink of an eye. It would stop and just hover, or it seemed would hide behind trees from my view.  I know this sounds nuts, but it was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time I was watching this thing my chihuahua was barking like crazy at it and my adult lab was just watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very intriqued by this craft or object since I do see numerous craft from AF Plant 42 which is 2 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object made no sound whatsoever....it did cast a shadow though....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became concerned when it appeared to get lower with each lap in it&#39;s circle.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 40-45 minutes I went into the house and do not know how much longer it was out there......<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see at one point when it appeared to be coming straight at me that it appeared to me like 2 wedges with a space between them with lights through the whole point and back both sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know exacly how high it was, but would estimate about the height of small aircraft, not 30,000 like commercial planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just before it went over my car I opened my door really fast and heard the sound of it&#39;s engine , so it sounded like a plane , but it sure didn&#39;t look like one , at lest no plane i have ever seen . When i got to the store , and there was a guy working outside and he seen it too , he told me he thought it was going to crash . So you can see just how low it was . Can you guys there at mufon find out if there was some kind of military training going on that night ? If anyone else seen it please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have seen 3 sightings on 3 different days, but this is the latest one which happened 2 days ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a sphere shaped craft hovering over my house at nearly 2500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not move at all, and there were 2 times when it was non-visible then reappeared in the same original location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it was a nice day out, the craft appeared to be equipt with  the most personalised self luminous white light. This light looked somewhat neon white, or a flourecent white that was obvious to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister was outside with me, and I was pointing over the house but she was not able to see because she was seated under the umbrella for shade from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, &#34;look at that in the sky.. If you see what I am looking at, you will believe in UFO&#39;s&#34; but she did not bother to get up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did have my camcorder with me, but was hesitant on filming at first because it is very difficult to find small distant objects in the view finder and LCD. Now this is a brand new 3 week old &#34;P*n*s*nic&#34; digital camcorder, plus I wanted to absorb it mentally, but then changed my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to look at the location of the craft by sight, this way I would not spend too much time looking for it with the camcorder. When I first pointed the camcorder into the sky and hit record I did not realize that the craft was in the bottom left corner of the viewfinder so I tried to zoom in thinking I did not yet find it. Shortly after I gave up when the light was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before, this was the third sighting. This one appeared to be a stationary self luminous neon white light that disappeared and reappeared twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other sightings were black spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other sightings were also with my sister, and I again pointed out to look in the sky over the backyard which she did and saw what she described as &#34;birds&#34; possibly out of denial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just some backround info. I have lived in my relatives house for 20 years, and then moved out to an apartment complex in Brooklyn 13 years ago. It was great to get out from home but I have much difficulty adjusting to confinement in a small apartment with no yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is why I am always outside looking up in the sky from time to time enjoying where I spent many of my years as a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Disc was only about 3000 ft in the air or less.  Disc glowed or reflected miday sun but with a noticably dark shadow at the bottom of the object.  I move torwards an area that I could get a good look at this object and try and make out more detail of it.  I noticed that after a few minutes that the object started moving torwards in a north west direction directly away from my veiwing postition.  It never changed direction although it did change reflectivety but shadow of the underneath didn&#39;t.  Something that is a bit strange about this shighting is that I also was witness to another sighting the day before of a completely different object but with four other wittnesses. Made report of object also.  As object move in northwest direction it eventually vanished.  Had a strange feeling that it was observing the refinery.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While at a stop light, I a bright shiny object was up in the sky ahead of me in my field of view. I could see other objects that were flying in the sky over San Jose. All objects in the sky were aircraft except one object that stood out and was obviously not an airplane or jet or helicopter. This object was moving very slowly at first giving the impression that it may be hovering. Then the object seemed to suddenly move rapidly and then slow to a stand still. The traffic light turned green and I turned off into a parking lot to get out of my car and observe this shiny object and to determine what it was. I saw that the object was slowly moving southeast. I was wearing sunglasses but still could not make out its exact shape. My best guess was that it looked like three bright shiny baloons or spheres connected together that seemed to reflect suns light or emit bright white light. The baloons or speres of light seemed to change shapes. It took the shape of a triangle and then change to form a cylinder shape. Two minutes passed and the object seemed to quickly ascend high in the atmosphere and appeared to look like a bright star and climbing much higher and going east south east and getting harder to see. I hope someone else will report seeing this because I know that it had to be seen by a lot of people especially those traveling north on Saratoga ave toward 280 hwy during noon time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The first 2 were vertical in nature, long &amp; thin, approximately 150 feet long, phosphorescent green glowing consistently &amp; rising slowly as if they were a streamer from a hot air balloon. No balloon or other object was visible above the objects. The third object was 2-3 times longer &amp; had an offset near the top 1/4 of its length. It rose very high over a period of 15-20 minutes, decended slightly &amp; continued east until out of sight.

As the sun began to come up it got futher and further away. I have not seen it since and the was no report of any thing in the news I&#39;m not sure what I saw but it was not like anything I have seen before. Shortly after this like 10 or 15 min. our friends two dogs dissappeard out of thier yard and ten turkeys appeared in the front yard we did not see them apear or go away when the dogs came to the back door the turkeys were gone. not sure if it has anything to do with this sighting it was just kind of strange.

We were traveling west on I-70. it was slightly rainy out, but not enough to obstruct your view too much. I&#39;m not sure where we were the first spotting, but it wasn&#39;t far out of Dayton. My friends both saw it and pointed it out. It was maybe a mile up in the air and was triangular in shape. I only saw a glimpse of it, but it appears to be illuminated. The whole ship was lit up in a light blue/white glow. It passed us pretty quick and we kinda shook it off as a plane in town for the air show at Wright Patterson this weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceded to drive down the interstate when my two friends pointed again at an object in the distance. We were near the Lewisburg, OH exit. It was only a light at this point, but it was dead ahead of us. We kept driving towards the light, which never seemed to move. It wasn&#39;t going left of right. So I assumed it was flying in the same direction as us. The closer we got, the more you could make out of the craft. Again, it was triangular in shape. But not a perfect triangle. The nose was more narrow, then it contoured out, but difinetely triangular in shape. There were two lights on the outer &#34;wings&#34; that blinked in sync about once per second. The front of the craft put off a decently bright glow, but was not a beam of light. I can&#39;t estimate the exact size of the object. It was bigger then a stealth bomber, but not by too much. It wasn&#39;t very tall either. Very flat in appearence. It couldn&#39;t have been more then 10-15 feet tall. The only way I know it wasn&#39;t a stealth bomber is it wasn&#39;t jagged in the back. I&#39;ve seen the stealth upclose, and I can definetely say it wasn&#39;t one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to get closer to the object, and as we did we started to realize the craft wasn&#39;t moving. We slowed down pretty good as we got within a half mile or so from it. By now, you could see that it was maybe 500 feet in the air and was simply hovering. We could now also see the underneath part of the craft. This to me was the most significant part. The ship appeared to be facing us, and on the front underneat part was the light. After that there was a narrow and long opening, rectangular, that was lit up. Not brightly, but enough to tell that you were looking into the craft. I&#39;m not sure what was inside the opening, but to me it looked like red pipes are bars of some sort that were red in color. This also made it seem like it put off a red hue with the white light around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We slowed down to around 40mph while we drove under it. I hung my head out the window and looked up at the craft, which was posistioned directly in the median off the interstate. I couldn&#39;t hear anything, but then again I was driving down the insterstate with the wind in my ear. I also happen to be deaf in one ear, so not hearing anything didn&#39;t suprise me much. I didn&#39;t even really think about that fact until later anyhow. All the traffic seemed to be slowed down with us. No one passed us and the semi ahead of us wasn&#39;t pulling away from us either. I think everyone was looking as close as they could at this unexplainable object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to pull over, but I was hesitant too. I had two females with me, and they were a bit spooked by this, as was I. After we went under it we watched it as best as we could. We decided we had to have another look. We sped up to the next exit and turned around. I drove about 80mph to get back to the spot. It wasn&#39;t long before we realized the ship was gone. And then I realized I did something pretty stupid. I had my camera phone on me the whole time, I just never thought of it. I will never forgive myself for not thinking of it. But I was so in shock that it just slipped my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only really give you credible background for myself. The two girls I was with I&#39;ve only known a short time. I believe they are good people. And I know they saw what they saw seeing as I was there with them. As for myself, I&#39;ve always been a believer in the paranormal. I&#39;ve always believed there is life outside this planet or solar system. I&#39;ve listened to Art Bell many times. I&#39;ve watched anything UFO or alien related I came accross. I even went as far as to have a tattoo of a cartoon alien in a spaceship made of wood on my arm. I&#39;m sure all this leads you to believe me less on this story, and that really doesn&#39;t matter to me. I know what I saw. I never in the world would believe I&#39;d see something like this. And knowing a thing or two about UFO&#39;s made me think that even more. I mean why would it happen to someone who would love to see such a thing? I can only say that I&#39;m an honest hard working 32 yr old American man. I don&#39;t lie, cheat, or steal. I&#39;ve never made up a story in my life for attention, and I frown upon those who do. I know what I saw, and what I saw was a huge craft hovering in thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t reported this to any local authorities. I really don&#39;t know what I would say when I called to report it. I&#39;d think they would think I&#39;m just some drunk guy seeing things. But it does so happen that one of the girls mother is a corrections officer at the county jail. We&#39;re waiting for her to return to work this week and inquire about any UFO sightings reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to contact me via email. I don&#39;t feel safe giving out addresses and phone numbers at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I started to ponder what it was, and a meteor would not have been able to be bounced offthe atmospher like that, this thing was bright maybe due to it comming into the ozone or something but then shot right back into space. from what i know and understand of today&#39;s technology. no natrual thing could monuver like that.

These four lights attracted me, coz they are constantly in little vibration, which is very impossible for a air-craft or a bug. And the light vibration with those four light fly in a curved shape from left to right.

We lingered behind to talk and smoke a ciggarette. As we made our way across the lawn toward the back porch...I noticed a faint glow on top of the trees....kinda like a full moon cast it&#39;s glow on trees....only this was alot dimmer than that....just barely noticeable. I looked up and toward my left...towards the east. There was what at first appeared to be a star...but it was brighter than I have ever seen an inner solar system plannet get...and it was growing in brightness and size. In about 2 or 3 seconds it was almost half as large as full moon would appear and much brighter! It seemed to pulsate at a low visual frequency and had blackish blotches or stripes by the outer edges. Then suddenly it went 130 degrees backwards and to the south and upward.....  as it dimmed greatly and shrunk at the same time. Now it looked only like a far away satalite moving much to fast at an awkward angle. It then transformed into a bluish white haze or mist and vanished without a trace.  There was no sound from the sky at all durring this 4 - 7 second U.F.O. sighting. We were both amazed...and talked a bit about it. We hurried up to the back porch and jacuzzi where amazingly both my wife and the other couple had seen what we had from a different angle. Needless to say we had an interesting disscusion for quite a while!!<n>

It was much brighter than the brightest star in the sky and was moving very rapidly. It had no blinking lights and I couldn&#39;t tell the shape, just the light. It was moving straight across the sky then suddenly straight down at a 90 degree angle and disappeared about midpoint before reaching the ground.  I turned off the road to see if I could see it and it was just gone. I have have never seen anything like this before. I was not under the influence and know how to identify planes, shooting stars and satelites.

Upon noticing the clear sky, I saw what appeared to be a small craft, like an airplane or satellite, traveling from north to south at a slow pace.  As I studied it, I thought it might have been an aircraft coming to or from Paine field, which is a ½ mile away.  Then a second later, the craft sped up with extreme, high velocity across the sky and suddenly turned into a bright, yellowish fireball-orb.  It raced across the sky with great speed and made a quick zigzag motion before flying out across the southeast direction of the horizon.  I have seen plenty of shooting stars in my lifetime, but this was no shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Her apt. window is about 6 or 7 stories up facing west, towards O&#39;hare airport.  We were sitting in her living room and she said, look at the pretty lights.  So another friend ((name #2 deleted))), and myself went to see what she was speaking of.  ((witness #1)) said those lights have just been sitting there in one spot all evening, before I made it to her home around 8pm.  When I looked out the window there were dozens of planes flying around. some really close others very far but definately more than usual.  At first we thought they were flares.  But we did not see them fall out of a plane or shoot up from the ground.  There were at least 3 lights just slowly fading in &amp; out in a row.  One of them slowly hovered up and down.  But the thing that struck me is that it was so damn bright. Not like a plane with a few lights and definately not a blimp.  It just sat there in one place for hours while other identifiable planes were around.  We decided to go the the roof of her building 3 stories higher, and they were still there. Then we thought it could have been planes waiting to gas up or for a place to land.  But planes just do not sit like that, not even military fighter planes and with no noise. we can hear evey plane that flew around but these were very quiet.  The objects, from the few miles distance were from, looked egg shaped light bulb about the size of a Mini-van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It flew as gracefully as a bird, incidentally one of the reasons this may be a misidentification.  The craft was in the shape of a black wing.  It flew  around in circles first up the Mississippi toward me, asscending some.  At its closest point, I saw what seemed to be manufactured rather than somethin of God&#39;s hand.  If it was a bird, it would have been close enough to make out more clearly.  I could see that it was shaped as a wing, and looked further off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then for about four minutes, I watched as it turned and moved southward away from me along the river.  During the ladder half of this encounter, it was joined by a smaller object, along the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Taking thermals into account, this corse makes me wonder if I did see anything this time, after all if I did, then its the second time this week.

The objects moved in and out of a loose triangle to a very tight triangle formation. As the objects kept cirlcling counter clockwise, at the 12:00 position the furtherest 2 objects would completely dissapear, then as they reached the 10:00 position, they would reappear again. I don&#39;t know  if they could have been some kind of kite? If this had been at night or any place else I would have thought maybe they were advertising something, but there is NOTHING around to advertise. Also, for some reason, as I was intently watching these strange objects I never once mentioned to my husband what I was seeing. He may have noticed them, but if so, he isn&#39;t the type to admit it or talk about it. What I saw has been on my mind for over a month now so I decided to report it.  Also, because of the mountains and hills I couldn&#39;t tell if they were small objects close by, or large objects far away. Also difficult to tell if they were large and very high in the clear blue sky, or small and low. This was my first time in the Hat Creek, Lasson National park area, so maybe this is something common that I am not familiar with, I just don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I know what my friends and I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in the summer of 2004 I was attending a Wednesday night Church service in the Richpond area of Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The area is located just off the Nashville Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were outside in the Church parking lot preparing to leave.  We were all just chatting away as friends do after our Church service.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden we began to hear a very loud &#34;roar&#34; approaching our location from up in the sky-extremely low.  We looked around and could not see any lights or aircraft at all.   The &#34;roaring&#34; sound became louder, yet we could still see no object whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I looked directly overhead of us and saw a very large black triangular object flying extremely low.  My friends saw the object too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was probably a B-2 Stealth Bomber, but why would it be flying so low?  The object was flying only around 200 feet above us.  Also, why did the object have no lights flashing as all aircraft normally do-especially flying so low?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could only see the outline of the triangle, and it was really large.  It was no blimp either.  We all observed the mysterious large object until it just simply disappeared into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking back, I do not think that this was an aircraft we saw that night.  The whole episode was really strange.  Whatever this thing was defies logical explaination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some people might think that we are crazy, but this event really happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading my message.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

One of the co-workers had brought out a pair of binoculars and was observing the object when I had arrived for work that morning.  The place of business is an LPG Refinery and where bring the plant online at the time.  I had an opportunity to observe the object throught the binoculars for about 15 minutes.  The object was that of a diamond shape on end and was made up of several dome shaped serfaces.  It was metalic and what was wierd about the object was that it gave off a multi-color glow of orange, gold, yellow blue and magenta. Like a prisim.  It acted as if it were floating and changing orientation to me the observer.  After about 10 minutes into the viewing it changed shape into a hourse shoe shape but maintianed its multi color.  Something else that was observed was that the color was not as detecable from the ground.  First thought was that it could be some mylar ballons perhaps but if they were they maintianed tight formation, maybe tied together.  Object was however approximatley 15,000 ft. so if it were some kind of ballons they were very large.  Co-workers acted strangely as though it were no big deal.  I can&#39;t say that I was excited but very couious.  Note:  I spotted a different object the next day.  Different object structure and no wittnesses.  Observed it for approximately 10 minutes until it vanished from view in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Some appeared to be docked @ one location,the others wre roaming across the sky at will. They were all exactly the same in dimentions and appearance. From due east at 3:00am a single ufo appeared,roughly 060 degrees magnetic. this one was huge when compared to the blinkers.AT first, I thought it was a weather balloon. This one rose in the sky to maybe 45 degrees,Blinked off and on twice very slowly. IT sat still a few seconds and started changeing color. From white to plum to orange and back to white with a pea green ring around it that looked hot.Almost like steam rising from it. It appeared in that area of the sky untill daylight and no longer visable. The object was very active spinning and changing color. On a few occasions it looked as if its size (overall) was changing. still circular, but smaller or bigger.At daylight all the ufo&#39;s we saw that night just kept doing the same thing until the sun was too bright and they could no longer be seen with naked eye. Several of the observers have been watching the blinkers everynight from 070704  to present. This was the fist time any of this group had seen the big circular object.

I was leaving my home at 11:40 P.M. on a Thursday night to pick up my daughter from her father after their vacation.  It is very dark this time of night where we live 15 miles out into the country.  My eyes immediatly made contact with the only thing in the night sky hovering about 2 telephone poles high- if one were to guess- aproximately 100 yards from me.  I counted three port-hole type lights glowing.  I could see a vague outline of a craft above the lights.  I also noticed beams of light shining down from each individual &#34;porthole.&#34;  I was fear stricken because I have never seen anything like this before and I was alone.  I got in my car and headed for town.  I immediatly called my husband on my cell phone who was working. As I turned the corner,  I noticed it appeared to follow me.  As I passed the neighbors house on down the road, I saw it hover about 10 feet from their roof at which point the craft&#39;s lights turned a quick blue/red then a spinning purple all the while tilting at an odd angle.  I observed it all the way to town and it transformed back into the way I first witnessed it with the clear lights.  The craft made no sound that I could hear and also noted my cell phone nearly impossible to hold a connection with my husband.  That has never happoned since  I have talked to another individual who reports nearly the same sighting 15 miles from our home the next night about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were talking, I was star-gazing because it is always so much more impressive outside of the cities (of course).  I soon noticed what I thought were three stars in a perfect triangle at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon.  They were inching along in the sky for about 5 minutes.  These three &#34;stars&#34; eventually worked their way up practically directly above us in the sky, then shot simultaneously and were gone without a trace.  We were both 17 at the time, and not quite sure what to make of it.

I am an avid sky watcher and know the Northern skies fairly well. It was just after sunset. As I walked onto the patio I became immediately aware of what appeared to be a star in the corner of my eye.  I thought to myself, &amp;quot;that does not belong there&amp;quot;. I turned and looked directly at it.  It looked every bit like an ordinary star.  It was in the northern sky about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It&#39;s distance I cannot say, but I had the impression it was quite far away.  I watched it for perhaps ten seconds and then it began to move away from my position in a north easterly direction at about 45 degrees to the horizon. It moved across about 30 degrees of the sky accelerating very quickly until it disappeared. It did not change in size or color.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately a minute later I looked above me and saw a collection of bright red lights, round, sitting in one spot flashing on and off in a seemingly random fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason, and I do not understand why,  I attributed no significance to the red lights and walked back in the house.  I was, however, quite struck by the star like object.  I am very convinced to this day, and again I do not know why, that the star like object knew I was there and was aware that I was watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is quite average.  I am working stiff, a tour bus driver at the time.  I do not drink or do drugs.  I was completely sober and had all my faculties with me at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I judged the distance to be about 20 miles to my east.  I live at approximately Exit 12, off Insterstate 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 19:40 MST I was watching a thunderhead that was to my east and east of the Gila Mountains.  The thunderhead, from my observation, extended from north to south.  Below the thunderhead was a smaller, darker cloud separated from the thunderhead.  There was blue sky between the two sets of clouds.  As I watched I saw an object drop out of the thunderhead and hover in the space between the two clouds for a few seconds.  The object dropped into the small cloud, disappearing.  Suddenly the object shot out of the lower cloud and hovered again between the two for a few seconds.  Then, just as quick, it shot back into the thunderhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now my curiosit was up and I waited to see if the object would appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After roughly a minute the object dropped out of the thunderhead again.  This time after hovering for roughly 15 seconds it moved quickly north and hovered again between the two clouds.  By this time the smaller cloud had moved north somewhat and the tunderhead seemed to have gained some height.  After about 10 seconds of hovering the object shot down into the smaller cloud.  It stayed there for about 20 or 25 seconds  When it reappeared it had moved back to the south and shot out of the cloud to hover for about 10 seconds below the thunderhead.  Then it shot up into the thunderhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for it to reappear but did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thunderhead appeared to be moving slowly north by north east in the direction of Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the thunderhead and smaller cloud under observation for approximately 12 minutes by the object did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared that the object was playing with the clouds as the thunderhead began to break up as I continued to observe it.  The small cloud seemed to be traveling due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went in the house to get my wife to come and have a look  at it,she looked through the binoculars and while she was looking she suddenly said somthing just came out of it and is about a inch from it,  and it was a lot smaller. I took back the glasses and started to look but i could not see the small object she was talking about. She went back in side and i contuined watching the red light,within about two minutes i was ammazed to see two small objects that looked to me like round or bubble like craft flying from a distance of about six inches in my view through the binocularsto wards the bigger object and they both were leaving a small vapour trail behind about i would think a quarter of an inch.They both came  up to within about one inch of the big one and stopped,and stayed there and the three were clearly vissible.At this point i decided to run in side to get my camcorder which i was using the week before and had my battery still on the charger,and when i came out with about one or two minutes going by i looked up and they were gone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The day was partly cloudy with puffy white clouds moving through the area all day. As I was enjoying my time on our yard swing watching the clouds while my then four-year-old Son was playing I seen what I can only describe as a &#39;Tinkerbelle&#39; object come from out of the clouds toward my yard. I honestly shook my head and blinked my eyes in disbelief! As the object moved closer it seemed to get smaller but remained fuzzy in appearance, almost like a dandelion bloom. Buy get smaller I mean it did not seem to become larger as it came closer. Therefore I can only assume it performed some shrinking act while it moved from the clouds closer to the Earth and our yard. I would also add that it appeared larger in form as it first came out from the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute of it buzzing around a small area -- much in the fashion of a dragonfly -- it went out over the trees and swamp near our home. I can only guess it to have been about 50 to 100 feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I watched for a  a good ten seconds  - ran into the house to alert my family to come see and when we came out it was gone.  I should have stayed outside with it - maybe it was a stealth plane - but it had to be one that could stop and stand still in the sky.  This happened over half a year ago and I think about it ofen.

One of the links was to a UK Daily Mail article titled “UFO sighting bring town to a standstill”<n> <n><n> <n><n> (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=470579&amp;in_page_id=1770),<n> <n><n> <n><n> about a UFO sighting over Stratford-Upon-Avon.  What immediately struck me in the article was the picture at the top, which made me think &#34;I&#39;ve seen this before.&#34;  A friend and I once witnessed a very similar triangular aircraft flying around the area of Charleston, SC, in summer 2004.  This drove me to look into how many others have seen what I saw.  I figured I’d find one or two stories, not the hundreds that can be found that describe the same thing that I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe in encounters with aliens or anything like that; I think it&#39;s obvious the distances across space are far too great for such a thing to happen.  Despite that, or perhaps because of that, this event had struck me as being very strange, and has left a strong memory of what I would usually dismiss as someone “seeing things”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure the exact month when it happened.  It was during the summer of &#39;04.  A friend and I who were going to school at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Goose Creek, SC, decided to go out and get some late night Waffle House.  My friend was doing the driving, as I don&#39;t have a license.  Perhaps if I drove more I&#39;d remember the exact locations better, but I don&#39;t.  You don’t remember driving directions well when you don’t drive.  Looking at the area&#39;s Waffle House locations on Google Earth, I figure it was most likely the one on Goose Creek Blvd, or perhaps the one on Aviation Rd near the Charleston Airport, which is also very close to the Charleston Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, we ate our Waffle House.  Afterwards, we figured we had time to waste.  It was probably a Friday or Saturday night or something.  We didn’t know the area well as we were only there a short time for the school, and our spare time was usually spent within the city of Charleston.  So, we went exploring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We weren&#39;t more than 5 miles away from one of those two Waffle Houses.  We took a turn onto a long, straight, wide, smooth road.  It seemed to be a strange road.  I know I&#39;d never seen it during the day.  There was a little traffic on the road we came off of, but none on this one.  It was wide, 6 lanes if I remember right.  It looked like it was freshly paved.  The street we came off of was in the open, but this one had the forest close in on both sides, I&#39;d estimate within 10ft of the road.  The trees were tall on both sides, probably 20-30ft, or a little higher.  It would give me the impression of a planted forest since they were all about the same height, but you can&#39;t really tell at night.  We couldn&#39;t see the end of the road in sight, the road in front of us was the only break in the trees, for the whole length of the road.  No other roads turned off that we ever saw.  The street was completely unlit, except for our truck&#39;s headlights.  I don’t remember if there were any markings or signs at the intersection that stated the purpose of the road.  There were no signs whatsoever during the length (a couple miles) of the road.  The road turned out to end in a military base, which makes the lack of identification of the road confusing, though it explains it’s otherwise spartan appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving down the road no more than a minute, when my friend pointed out some lights above the trees to the left.  I can&#39;t remember if there were 3 or 4 lights when we first saw it.  There were definitely 3 white lights (not &#39;glows&#39; as I&#39;ve read some people as seeing) at the 3 points of the triangle.  We slowed down the truck to about 5-10mph so we could get a better look at it.  It quickly became clear that what we were looking at was no commonplace aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember trying to determine if I could see a shape of the aircraft, and vaguely thinking I saw a darker (black against the midnight blue sky) shape against the sky.  It had reminded me of a nacho chip, with a light at each of it’s points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next I noticed how slow it seemed to be moving.  It gave me the impression of being low-flying and extremely slow.  (I can’t understand how people are claiming that these flying triangles they see are at 1000ft and going 30 knots, etc.  How can you tell from the ground at what height it is, and how large it is?  You can’t really tell if it’s 170ft wide and 100ft off the ground, or a mile wide and 50 miles off the ground.  At least I couldn’t tell in the dark of that night…)  It made me think of something like a B-2, but if it was only 170ft wide, or however wide they are, then it must have been almost unmoving.  I know few aircraft we have can hover, and a B-2 sure ain’t one of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my friend pointed out something that should have been far more obvious – it was very quiet, perhaps silent.  We couldn’t hear any discernible sound over his little Toyota truck.  This later made us think that it could have been a much larger craft higher up, but that seems less likely.  While an extremely large craft could appear to be moving slowly and be silent if it were orbiting the Earth in our upper atmosphere at high speeds, the idea of some Independence Day-sized aircraft remaining undetected by everyone on the planet seems unlikely, not to mention the absurdity of such a design.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next part is still what strikes me as the strangest.  It reminded me of the old stories and movies of a beam of light coming out of a flying saucer to abduct people.  In the center of the craft there was what appeared to be a searchlight, one of those directional beams of light used to illuminate specific parts of a landscape.  I don’t remember the light first turning on specifically, and I don’t remember it being there when we first saw the craft.  The reason I stated that there were 3 or 4 lights at the start is I figure if it had the searchlight on from the start I would have noticed it a lot quicker, but the clear image planted in my brain is that of the flying triangle with the 3 lights, and the one searchlight in the center.  It was being directed around apparently randomly, like you’d see one being used in a prison escape movie to search for an escapee.  The beam could be seen moving quickly and erratically, but smoothly, over the forest, and it occasionally passed over the road we were on, as well, but it never really got close to the truck.  We were still moving slowly down the road with our truck, and the craft was still passing slowly above us.  I couldn’t help thinking at that time that whatever piece of magnificent technology that had to be, that they must have known we were there.  But if it did know we were there, it didn’t give any indication of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept looking at it in awe as we crept down the road, it eventually being above us and to the left, so that my friend was sticking his head out the driver’s side window, and I was looking straight up at the dashboard.  It slowly passed us, or we passed it; whatever happened, it was behind us.  Not much farther down the road we spotted the trees straight ahead that marked the end of the road.  The road split off to the right side, and I think to the left as well.  I remember the right side more clearly for some reason.  There was an empty guardhouse to the right of a small 2-lane road, which had 2 or 3 large yellow-painted pylons staggered along the lanes to keep anyone from flying through.  I’d swear I remember a sign to the right side of that road, on the side of the guardhouse, which declared it as an Army something-or-another.  It didn’t seem strange to me at the time, but my searching indicates no army bases in the area.  Not even abandoned ones, which would explain the empty guardhouse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, we turned the truck around and started heading back, about 30-40 seconds after passing the aircraft.  The aircraft was gone.  Just like that.  We heard no sound that indicated any type of engine speeding up, or any aerodynamic noise, or anything.  It was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about it as we drove back to our Navy base.  We figured it was some sort of experimental military craft.  All the branches of the military were represented in Charleston, except for the Army, as far as we could tell… except for that sign that I still remember seeing.  We joked that we’d probably be assassinated in our sleep by the CIA for seeing something we weren’t supposed to.  It still doesn’t make sense to me why they would fly such a craft over a populated area we were in.  Admitted the exact place was a thick forest, civilization wasn’t very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That had remained sitting in the back of my mind – the time I saw that crazy experimental military aircraft – until I read that article today.  It didn’t make sense to me.  The picture I see there looks just like what I saw, through from a lot farther away, but it’s in the UK.  Why would experimental US military aircraft be flown in across the ocean?  They could be participating in it, but that doesn’t make sense.  It’s the American policy to share our old technologies, not our new ones.  Not to mention, the searchlight?  What was that?  With such advanced technology, it seems like a pretty archaic means of trying to find things at night, and not a very stealthy one.  I don’t think we even use beams of light any more for weapons targeting, and we’ve got much better ways of communications than using lights.  Makes no sense to me, but it was there.  Oh, and unlike those stories, it was definitely a clear, white light, like the 3 at the corners, except that it was a directed beam as opposed to a simple light.  It definitely wasn’t red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I place this event as taking less than four minutes, though I can&#39;t really tell for sure.  It&#39;s not like I was counting the time on my watch.  My best guess was it was 1:30am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, that’s all the story I have.  I’m no UFO expert, or even a military aircraft expert, but I know what I saw wasn’t anything the government will admit to having at their disposal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There was a lot of what I call &#34;heat lightning&#34; because it did not come down. In the middle of allof the lightning there was a red light pulsing in the clouds. One, two three, pause, one, two, pause, one two three so I knew it wasn&#39;t lightning and there are no TV, radio, or cell phone towers anywhere nearby, So I called my mother out to see it before it went away. She saw it and couldn&#39;t tell what it was either. Then it suddenly stopped pulsing and since it was above the cloud line disappeared. About a minute later the winds gusted up to about 60-70 MPH and some of our potted plants and plants in the garden started to snap so we started putting them in a protected area when almost directly above us the red pulsing started again. It was still above the clouds, but when it pulsed the shape was perfectly round and about 1/4 to a 1/2 mile across. The clouds were moving very quickly and the winds kept increasing but the object was stationary. It pulsed slowly three times and then stopped and dissapeared. As soon as it did the winds began to die down dramatically. We went inside and turned on a local TV channel and even though a news report was not on there was a small map in the corner of the screen showing which counties were under a severe thunderstorm alert. The map then changed to a doppler radar image that showed the squall line stretching across the area, and right over our area there was a perfectly round &#34;image&#34; wider than the squall line and in the center of the storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting on my balcony playing a new song I have written on my guitar.  My balcony faces south.  I looked to my left(south east) and out of nowhere appeared to be a hazey sphere that I mistook for the moon for a second.  It then got larger and larger and a light appeared in the middle of it.  I stopped and fixated on it.  I told myself it must be a helicopter looking for pot crops or something but it then burned so bright that my eyes hurt and I had to look away.  It was very close to a star of which I don&#39;t know the name and I used the star as a marker to see how much it moved. It dimmed out to a cigar shaped haze and zigg zagged a little and then started to glow in the middle and had a haze on top and below the glow. It looked like a star if you were to glance at it quick.  Obviously &#34;they&#34; have this way of camoflouge(hope I spelled it right) it can trick your eye.  I looked at this thing and could not believe I was seeing it so plain.  I woke my 66 year old father at 4 in the morning to have a witness. He calmly told me he had seen one as a little boy and I should keep watching because I will take off really really fast. I then discovered another one more to the direct east glowing on and off.  That is the thing.  It glowed on and off. It disappeared and then reappeared about 15 times approx.  Totally amazing.  I have never had any doubt that there are entities out there but this is an affirmation. It hovered in the relative same spot for nearly 2 hours glowing on and off and slowly moving around.

This was a very pussling incident and one that they cannot explain. As they were lying on a trampoline, the three were looking at the stars. They say one star beyond the rest which was moving in a straight line. They speculated a falling star, ruled that out because it was traveling in a straight line. They decided it was a satellite however the star stopped moving. To thier astonishment it began to travel backwards. I was told they could not believe thier eyes, they went to call thier friends. By the time they looked back up the star was gone. This incident left an impression on them especially since their interests are not about UFO&#39;s.

Mac OSX, Mozilla browser).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. July 14 midnight Saw a dim satellite or other orbiting object travel from SW to NE overhead at typical satellite speed in a clear sky (clear for Toronto, that is). The only notable thing about this was that I couldn&#39;t match it to any entry on the Heavens-Above! website for satellite spotters. But it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if a lot of junk floating around up there isn&#39;t mentioned on that site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. July 14 0005 Saw another very dim &#39;satellite&#39; overhead travelling northward. Average satellite speed, but still in a clear sky and just vanished after a couple of seconds (going northwards so it wasn&#39;t entering Earth&#39;s shadow). For ten or fifteen seconds after that a small dim point of light, same brightness, seemed to pop up for an instant in the same general area, then popped up again in a slightly different part of the sky (i.e. less than the palm of an outstretched hand). This happened seven or eight times and reminded me of an optometrist&#39;s test for blind spots. The flashes of light were so faint I have to admit to the possibility that my eyes were deceiving me, although I definitely saw the moving object that started the sequence off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. July 14 0010 Saw a brilliant spot of light (Venus x 2 in magnitude) travel from NE to SW, covering about the 60 degrees of sky visible between buildings and trees in a fraction of a second, seemingly at the same altitude. Possibly just a meteor or re-entering space junk, but notable for the fact that it was just slow enough to be seen as a point of light rather than a streak and also for the fact that it didn&#39;t leave even the hint of a trail as one might expect for such a bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I say, not particularly exciting but may correlate with information provided by others.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Secondly, it is not a meteorstar, which is extremely fast and disappears in seconds. Thirdly, it is not a usual aircraft, which is much much slower.

We watched it for about 7 minutes until it went out of sight. It looked like a star but it didn&#39;t have any tracers following it . It was just a bright light like the north star , it was way to high to be an airplane , and it was traveling to slow to be a falling star ., and to fast to be an airplane.  It did not ever fade or blink but at one point it seemed to swerve around for just a brief time then it continued along it&#39;s path. I have never seen anything like it . My 19 year old daughter my 11 year old son my daughters 20 year old friend  my 33 year old my and me (43 years old ) all seen what ever this was .we watched it until it was out of sight then we continued to watch for about 45 min. longer and did not see anything else that was like this strange object . We would just like for someone to explain what this thing was.  ((name deleted))<n>

They stoped and hovered for a few mins.  Another white light appears about a 1/4 of a mile south the of original three. It hovered for a moment and then went south the object # 2 &amp; 3 followed.  About five mins later a fifth light seemed to appear out of the cloud and it for a moment and then headed south and it never approached the original light (that still had not moved). Finally a 6th white light appeared higher up.  At first I thought it was Venus because it was in the same spot for a while. It finally approached the original light and then headed south. The first light hovered a few mins longer and then headed south as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

Just before dusk I was driving on a surface street heading southwest when I saw a round sphere type object at approximately 400 feet AGL due East from me.The object was 500 yards from me at the time. It was black and appeared to be spinning on an axis and about 6-8 feet in diameter. At the time I was driving about 40-45 mph as the object was also moving at least that speed parallel to my direction. As I made a left hand turn on another street it darted eastbound at the same speed. I tried to follow this object and pulled into a parking lot to observe its direction. For a minute or two it stayed in one place and around 500-600 feet AGL. I got a couple pictures of it before it moved off in a easterly direction. I picked up a family member within a minute from my location at the time, and we went towards the last known direction it headed. We saw it once more now at around two thousand feet AGL and watched it move eastbound in a steady climb through three thousand feet AGL.It appeared to have a blinking white strobe that blinked once every 2 minutes. We then left the area.It was now 8:15 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 12:35 last night, while I was sitting at my computer, which sits in front of a second-story east facing window, I noticed a glowing object in the sky.  It was about 75 degrees from the horizon and moving from North to South.  I turned off my computer monitor, as it was the only light in the room, and stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the object as it passed nearly over my position.  The object was 3 or 4 times the size of a star and glowed dimly but steadily.  Unlike the many planes and helicopters that can be viewed from the sweeping views of my east-facing windows, this object had no blinking lights from any visible angle and made no sound. It did not twinkle, like a star and was far too large to be a satellite.  It was about 1/3 the size of my pinky nail held at arms length.  It did not really emit light, but rather had just a dim luminosity. The roundish shape of the object and its glow appeared the same as it approached my position from the north, passed over and continued on toward the south.  Before passing out of my line of sight to the south, the object made a sweeping curve toward the west appearing to gain elevation during the curve.  As it proceeded west it appeared to descend a bit, then it paused for a second and then continued on toward the west.  This event took about 30 seconds from start to finish.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There are only farms and fields in that area that I know of and no tall towers or offices. I know that I&#39;m not the only one who saw this as many drivers were looking at the light while we were stopped at Dundas and Trafalger&#39;s intersection.

While travelling south on Interstate-5 in the central valley of California, at about 10:15 pm, we encountered the I-5 UFO phenomenon that has been reported to NUFORC several times since at least the year 2000.  It was a triangular aircraft flying a repetitive aerobatic pattern over the interstate and swooping down very low over traffic, creating a hazard to all who were driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw it as we approached from 2 to 3 miles away, and were amazed at it&#39;s agility and audacity right from the start.  It occurred 28 miles north of Highway 198 at the intersection of I-5 and the overpass of Manning Avenue.  The aircraft&#39;s maneuvers were incredible, but not beyond human capability.  The craft flew a fast, distinct, unchanging pattern over the interstate and overpass, swooping down to an unbelievably low level over the freeway traffic.  We and every other vehicle around us slowed down to observe it, and once underneath it, we hoped we wouldn&#39;t get hit.  We drove past the overpass, which was remote and had no exit/entrance ramps and then parked on the shoulder about 100 yards south of it, right below the pattern that the aircraft was flying.  My wife and I tried hard to get a good look, but it was very dark; no moon and no city lights anywhere near us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to be triangular, yet not an equilateral triangle.  It was shaped more like a Vulcan bomber; the wings formed a wide delta, yet their leading edge intersected the fuselage well behind the nose.  I could not make out the profile of the nose, yet I could see the profile of a vertical tail fin.  The vertical height of the fuselage seemed thin, but not too thin for a human pilot.  It&#39;s lights were completely unconventional; no strobe, no red and green position lights, no navigation light.  It just had 3 big bright circular halogen white lights, about 12&#34;-18&#34; in diameter; one under the nose, and one at each wingtip.  The nose light would turn off and then turn back on.  They all shined down and forward about 45 degrees, and were built into the body; they weren&#39;t fixtures hanging down.  They put out an ambient glow onto the fuselage, which was a very pale tan or grey.  There were no other markings and no landing gear visible.  Unlike previous reports of this phenomenon to NUFORC, which described a silent craft, (and I don&#39;t discount them), this craft made a lot of noise.  In fact, it sounded like it had a single jet engine.  As it approached, it made a whining, hissing sound, which turned into a roar as it passed, yet not as loud or fast as a corporate or fighter jet.  The craft maintained a speed of about 80 to 100 mph throughout it&#39;s maneuvers.  A high-performance engine might explain how it made steep climbs and 90 degree banking turns without stalling or losing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew a repetitive kidney-bean shaped pattern above the freeway intersection with the overpass.  It dived down and flew 15&#39;-20&#39; above the I-5 traffic, climbed up, hung a U-turn, then dove down to the field on the east side of the interstate, and flew an amazing 2-3 feet above the ground for about 100 yards until it approached the embankment of the overpass, then pulled up and climbed at about 45 degrees without slowing down to about 200 feet above ground, hung a sharp U-turn banking at 90 degrees to the ground,then dove down again at the interstate, and repeated this pattern over and over.  Whether the pilot was an off-hours yahoo cropduster or an alien, he was out of his mind.  While parked on the shoulder, we watched the aircraft fly the pattern right over us several times before driving off (my 6 year-old daughter was getting scared).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I could provide a more definitive identification of the aircraft, but it was very dark that night and the craft was constantly making sharp moves: banking, climbing, and diving.  My best guess is that this was a powerful, unconventional, yet terrestrial airplane, but the pilot was performing maneuvers that weren&#39;t just bold, but crazy and malicious toward the traffic on I-5.  Everything about the aircraft&#39;s actions and lighting was illegal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the California Highway Patrol after driving away, and the dispatcher shrugged it off, saying, &#34;I&#39;ll put out a bulletin, but there&#39;s not much we can do.  You might want to try the FAA.&#34;  I&#39;ll forward this report to the FAA in the hopes that they might look into it, being that this incident constitutes crimes being committed with an aircraft.  Either this is some rogue cropduster that hasn&#39;t been caught yet, or this area along I-5 is definitely a UFO hotspot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  High quality graphic of the flight path of the object above Interstate 5 is provided by the witness.

It went to what I will call the &#34;road&#34; and went E. As I watched over time there were many &#34;tiny lights&#34; coming from all directions yet ending on the same &#34;road&#34; heading E.  One of them stopped and shot off a couple of white lights and then moved on. Then, on July 15 I saw one tiny star and got my binoculars and was stunned to see about 30 white circles around it. I couldn&#39;t see the white things with out the binoculars. They looked like huge plate shaped clouds. They didn&#39;t seem like metal. The sky seemed to have white chicken pox.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was at work noticing how the moon was still visible in the middle of the day, when a flash of light in the sky caught my eye. Then it flashed again, and I saw a shimmering ball to egg shaped object moving north holding an extremely constant heading, altitude, and speed. There was no sound or contrails. I thought it might have been a mylar baloon, but it was odd that when it was&#39;nt reflecting light, it was black. IF you put a silver baloon against a blue sky, it will apear white. I know because I worked in the Air Force as a weather observer, and rawinsaunde operator. I am also an instrument rated pilot. Since the object had no wings or protrusions, it was impossible to reference it&#39;s size, altitude, or speed. If it was a baloon, it could&#39;nt have been more than 500 feet high AGL, traveling at 100 kts. (the upper air winds were out of the south, but only 15kts.) After the object went out of view, I stared at the sky for a couple of minutes, then started to go back to work when I heard the sound of a jet engine out of the southeast. I spotted the jet, and could make out the delta wing. It was up around 30,000 feet flying a wide S patern coming up behind whe object&#39;s path screaming at well over mach 1. If the object was at 30,000 feet, I would estimate it to be the size of the space shuttle with a ground speed of over mach 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched the object for approximately three minutes while talking on the phone to my Dad in CA describing what I was seeing the whole time and do not believe it was a satellite, because prior to the sighting, I watched a satellite move from the south to the north, so I could compare the two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have a routine of looking out my window when I go to bed and this time as I look outside into the eastern sky, I notice a bright light?  At first I thought it was the moon?  But I looked to my right at a southeastern direction and there was the moon.  Then I thought it was a star and as I was about to look away I saw a small ariel vehicle approach this bright light in the sky from the north and it position it&#39;s self to the right of this bright object?  The small ariel vehicle did not have that blinking red light that most heliocopter or airplanes have under it&#39;s belly.  This smaller ariel vehicle had a pulsing motion to it?  After viewing the video tape of what I saw early this morning till the sun started coming up, I saw that this bright image had a dark middle area with multiple rings moving out from it&#39;s center?  At the time, I was seeing this I was having a severe headache from a strange humming sound in my ears that was louder then normal?  I have contacted some of the local news stations to ask if anyone reported this sighting in the A.M. hours and only one station NEWS4 KMOL said that there were a few reports.  I told them that I recorded this sighting and all the news stations want my recording but I told them that I will give them an answer later.  I believe I started seeing this object about 5:00 A.M. but did not start filming till 5:30 and my camcorder shows an ending time of 6:20 A.M. but I stop filming because the sun was coming up and I was very tired and wanted to get some sleep.  But the object was still there as the sun started coming up but the best view was against a dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then from the corner of my eye I saw a huge &#34;star&#34; that was once still, suddenly dart off, going Southeast. It was much larger than the other stars. It moved at an incredible speed. It was bright white and circular in shape. Familar with planes flying over, it clearly had no blinking red and/or white likes, like planes. And usually, at night, you can barely see the plane, except for it&#39;s blinking lights, whereas this was completely covered in white light and was very bright. As it increased in speed, it moved across the sky in a horizontal direction, then it began moving upward on an angle, going higher and higher. Then all of a sudden it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At a much lower altitude about 20 degress in the same eastern sky we observed airplanes on their approach to the Miami and Ft. Lauderdale airports.  Comparing the two, it was evident that the first light we saw just a few minutes prior was not a plane.

We watched it until it was out of our site. It just moved along the sky until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

What attracted our attention was the loud noise from a Blackhawk helicopter beating as it was flying as top speed with white lights pointing forward and about a half mile ahead of the helicopter was a very low flying disk.  It was very large (larger than 747)and made no noise, it was as if it was floating in the air and the flying so low that I could have shined a flashlight on it.  I could not tell if the helicopter was just following the craft or chasing the craft.  I believe the blackhawk was trying its best to keep up with the craft and because the lightes were pointing forward, I am sure the craft was just following the craft.  The craft may have had troops on board in case it crashed and would be able to secure the area if it crashed.  We were very frightened as the craft flew over our heads and condinued flying south and we lost sight of the craft and helicopter over the city of Victorville.  There were absolutely no lights on the craft.  Iam retired military and well aware of what blackhawk helicopter looks like, the helicpoter was completely black and no markings visible. It is very strange that an object that large should have made a tremendous nois, but not a sound could be heard,,only the helicopter following it.  Both craft and helicopter flew very low over our heads and I am sure they saw us looking up and watching it fly over our heads.  The craft we saw could not have been man made...our technology is not that advanced. We both have been very reluctant to say anything to anyone.  My friend still does not like to talk about it.  Afraid of what may happen if the word gets out what we saw.  Since that date, we both have witnessed another UFO over the town of Norco, California.  I really need some time to be able to talk about it.  Well, I felt someone should know what happened that night and I am sure the government has full knowledge and access to such craft from other worlds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates &#34;Victorville, HI,&#34; located in San Bernardino, CA.

It was moving from a southeast direction (from the direction of Phoenix) towards a northwest direction (towards Sedona and Cottonwood). It was about the size of a pencil eraser when held at arm&#39;s length. Jets seen at this distance make an audible noise, this object made no noise whatsoever. I watched as it moved away from me, getting smaller and smaller, until it finally was no longer visible. It seemed to be moving towards California. I live 5 miles out of town (Camp Verde) on Hwy 260, and this took place in my front yard. Not the first stange object I have seen from out here, and most likely will not be the last.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday afternoon 7/9/04 at approx. 4:45pm, I was standing in my front yard watering my grass and I looked up into the cloudless sky as I often do. I clearly saw what looked like a star towards the south. I noticed the light was very bright and was moving very slowly towards the south. At first I was a bit excited, but I thought quickly that someone else should see this because I could not belive it. I knew I didnt have any film for my camera but I did have a monoscope with 25x sight. I raced into my house, got the monoscope and told my daughter and my friend inside to come out. We all saw what looked like the type of light one would see on the front of a plane coming in for a landing however when I looked through the monoscope, I could see no visible body nor could I see any type of wing, balloon or rotor. What I did see was 2 lights, 1 red on top and 1 light on the bottom whith nothing between them. There seemed to be a faint pink glow around it only visible through the monoscope. This was very exciting to me. We watched for another 7-8 minutes while this light moved very slowly away from us towards the south. I noticed while we watched 3 airplanes come into view with one in close proximaty the this light. The light was noticeably higher that the plane which seemed to be at about 8000 - 10000 ft and asscending eastward. We have John Wayne Airport at about 15 miles to the west with aircraft flying over all the time. This took place in the afternoon in a beautiful cloudless sky. Visibility was high. The light did not appear to be a reflection of the afternoon sun. It ws much brighter. I took about 10- 12 minutes to move approximatly 25 degrees in the sky until visiblity was lost over the canyon wall where I live. One interesting note is there is nuclear power plant approx. 25 miles to the south of where I live. I have never seen anything like this before and I thought very much before writing this report. I am eager to see if anyone else saw what we saw. I am truly regretful I didnt! have any film. I wont be with out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We turned around to see a craft flying parallel to the shore, then make a hard 90-degree turn towards the direction of the water. It was relatively silent, but the maneuver we saw it perform caught us off-guard. It then became very silent and sped up to an unnatural speed and flew right across the lake away from us. It cleared the horizon in a second, and it was gone. It was roughly the size of a typical jet plane, but a thin cylindrical body with a pair of straight wings making it into a cross shape. however, on the back portion of the craft was a half-circle wing bisected by the body of the craft. hard to explain, but very strange. I&#39;ve never seen an aerial craft maneuver that way. Only he and I saw it out at the lake, for we were the only ones out there that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The garden is about 150 feet east of the house.  As I walked I looked up at the sky above the roofline of house. There was an object making an erratic motion, almost like a piece of paper drifting on a wind.  As I watched and it came closer I could see it was making small circles and I thought it was a turkey buzzard riding a thermal.  I live in western New York near the shore of Lake Ontario and this is a common sight on warm, sunny days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was with me and I commented to her that it looked awfully high.  At about this time the object disappeared behind a small cirrus cloud.  I then knew it was not a buzzard and ran into the house a got binoculars.  By the time I got back outside the object was directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought looking at it with the glasses was that it was a bald eagle because the color was right and had what appeared to be a white head.  After watching it make a few circles I could see that it was a circular craft and when it banked with top facing sun there was a bright metalic shine like stainless steel.  It traveled slowly across the sky from west to east continualy making circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After five minutes it was east at about forty degrees to horizon and approaching solid cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if it was still visible without the binoculars and attemped to locate it without them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I spotted it, it suddenly changed direction, looping north over the lake and headed west at blazing speed.  I said to my wife &#34;look at that sucker go&#34; and just that quick it was gone.  Went in house and checked time, 12:10 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object&#39;s shape:  Circular with portion missing, like a clock face with portion between 5 and 7 cut away. This missing section extended to center of craft and always faced to the outside of the loops it was flying.  It looped counterclockwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object&#39;s size:  Hard to determine not knowing its altitude.  I checked local weather information on the internet and clould cover in region was listed at 20,000 feet.  It was above the clouds. As stated before I thought it was a turkey buzzard soaring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Color:  Brownish to light black on bottom.  Top portion visible only when banked facing sun was very shiny, like polished stainless steel.  At certain points in the loop it shone like a mirror reflecting sunshine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusion:  I think this craft was purposely drawing attention to it by its pecuilar motion.  If it had been traveling in straight flight I would not have noticed it.  Anyone looking to the west as it approached could not have missed seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was traveling on 95 Interstate Highway North going in my car at about 60 or 70 mph I told my girlfriend &#34;look at that! there they are.....! I told you!..... waaaooooo&#34; I was so shocked i keept repeating&#34; do you see it?&#34; and of course she said &#34;yes....&#34; &#34;Its amazing&#34;. At that point I was getting close to my apartment complex. I stooped at a red light and took a good look at it. It seemed to me as a bright star but not quite since stars look distant and very small. This type of star was close to the moon and when you looked at it for more than a minute it would radiate like tentacles of light that changed colors from green, to orange, to red and then go back into the color of a star... white. I then drove home got inside my apartment and when I opened the door to my balcony my brother and his friend scream out&#34; come watch this&#34; I then got goosebumps and told him &#34; We saw it too&#34;. I realized for certain that it was a UFO. I grabbed my brothers binoculars and it was diffucult to put together a shape but the colors were glowing still. I was Happy and scared a very weird feeling.I just wonder if anybody else saw them.... thats why I came into this web site! I can say now i saw a UFO and I beleive they exist!<n>

When I used to live in Maple Valley Washington me and some good friends would spend a couple nights camping a few miles up some logging roads in a town known as cumberland. I believe the locals call it huckleberry hill its a left turn a bit passed kanaskat palmer state park, the gravel road winds its way up to a rock quarry where we usually stay. Around sunset a strange green meteor came from the east headed west and faded out around the olympic mountain range passed the puget sound. I thought that was strange but of course not strange enough to think twice about. We camped late into the night since none of us could sleep until around 3 to 3:30 am when oddly enough I became adventerous and bothered everyone to drive up further than we ever had into cumberland hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove a nissan sentra datsun wagon up there so it wasnt in the best shape after climbing the 5 miles yet we agreed to to go anyway, about 1 more mile up and arrived where we now know as huckleberry point. More cities could be seen than before to the west, and to the south mt rainier stood with all of its valley. We all jumped out pretty excited that we had found such a spectacular view. we all had stood around for a couple of minutes when three lights appeared to the lower left side of Rainier. At first glance I mentioned that they were fast moving semis on a long straight gravel road because of the way they appeared. until the back 2 lights as though connected by a piece of elastic, sort of swung themselves passed the leading light and reformed into a straight line. they had to have been moving in excess of 400mph to move ahead of the other lights like that. They appeared to be a little brighter than any stars in the sky but looked like stars nonetheless. The lights traveled all the way across to the right side of the mountain and moved into position to form a triangle. the triangle as a whole then shifted to reveal two more lights and a half diamond shape was revealed, it tilted as a complete object that looked geometrically perfect so the poin of the shape faced the mountain, the light then flared bright red and all the lights seperated. the top light that turned red morphed into 2 lights, and the bottom sets of 2 stayed together....they acted fixed like a pair of eyes, and as they would wander around looking back and forth one eye would dissapear before the other as though they were giant  black heads with glowing eyes. One of the pair of lights then dissapeared behind a hill about 300 feet away and about 150 feet tall so the thing was close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What appeared over the hill still to this day makes me question reality. What we all described as a jelly-fish or octupuss the size of a blimp that was clear like glass with small lights running down along the tentacles and very bright lights for eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became very frightened but calmed down as it just seemed to wander up check us out and float away. it sort of bobbed around as though it was propelling itself through water. after that all the lights pretty much appeared far away near the mountain moving from place to place, morphing into pairs of 1, 2 ,and 3 and then combining again.we watched them all night until  the sun came up all the lights returned to where the original diamond shape had first appeared and landed on a small hill that had been logged away. they appeared like little white dots in the day time occasionally catching the sun and shimmering like a s signal mirror. We all went down with plans to come up the next night with cameras and video tapes which we all had but none of them seemed to work. all we had was a disposable camera in which we snapped a few shots with of the lights the next night when they came out and wandered around again but all the pictures came out completely black with stripes of light going completely across the picture where a dot of light should have been.  we kept going up for many months until it eventually became expensive to keep doing so but we all had many encounters with these entity&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now live in california, this all took place last summer of 2004. Though I recently went camping with a buddy and around 2 am a bright light appeared on the side of a hill about a mile away, seperated into 2, and they both started wandering around until they reconnected and dissapeared. Seems as though they remembered me as I do them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway this is all very true and I have read of many similar sightings especially a place called sattva sanctuary. they have videos of some of the EXACT things I saw during all my visits  P.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we found out there is a highway running through where we witnessed the sighting and after a few days could destinguish cars running along the highway with these things floating above them as though they were chasing them. At times what we thought were planes because of the way they moved steady and blinked with colored lights but either vanished in thin air or moved right towards the lights and dissapeared into them. we had flashlights and tried to signal them by turning them off and on in timed patterns which seemed to catch their attention and other times not. The flashlights would always have trouble turning on and off even with new batteries. And most importantly one thing we did Notice whenever we screamed EX: &#34;Hey over here!&#34; the entity&#39;s would follow our echoes as we heard them bouncing through the valley. Everytime we all screamed loud enough for their to be a good echo all the lights would stop what they were doing and all move toward the sound. Its been awhile since the even and I saw so much of them its hard to distinguish everything properly I believe I have submitted these encounters before closer to when they happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> EVENTS THAT SEEM SIGNIFICANT BUT MAY OR MAY NOT BE ATACHED TO THE DEFINATE SIGHTINGS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember after the meteor appeared, I found a old piece of card board paper around midnight at the edge of the campsite I picked it up thinking how odd it was to find litter and the the two M&amp;M&#39;s guys were standing on one side of a rainbow and a pot of candy at the end. and below it read &#34;See you on the other side,&#34; which meant nothing at the time but the next day I kept thinking about how that was some sort of subliminal invitation. Though I accept that this could be my own delusional thoughts after witnessing something so profound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also when the lights first made a half diamond and pointed the tip towards the mountain I said &#34;the mountain is gonna explode?&#34; and then the top light flared red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this could also be coincidence but is worth mentioning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember having a thought in connection with the idea that the mountain was going to explode and the top of the half diamond flaring red. They appeared to be jelly fish with intentions to imply that the mountains eruption would go all the way to puget sound and extend it all the way to Mt. Rainier. This could be my own rationalization as to what happened since the idea of real floating jelly fish seemed impossible even staring right at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Next morning when we were driving down, we saw a total of 8 red identicle ford rangers heading up towards where we camped. All the fords had a logo of a road with a leaf on it, I think it stands for custom built or something. that was more cars then we had ever seen heading up to cumberland at one time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I noticed Weyerhaeuser has a very unusual method of cutting timber unusually close to the northern base of Rainier. Somebody mentioned that weyerhaeser cuts trees in triangular patches so the wildlife can run to the strips of trees inbetween the triangular gaps. This also is possibly coincidental but there were literally hundreds triangles spread across the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the day where the lights had landed me and one other may have seen a white dot dodging in and out of the treeline but it was too far away to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we brought groups of people up during the months we saw these things they didnt seem to act up as much with larger groups of about 10 or so but I think it was an equal shyness between the people and the UFO&#39;s but they always managed to show off a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed as though the ufos were alive with emotion and curiosity attemtping to mimick things they saw and interact with us. at times they come very close but appear very small. and sit and hover for hours rocking back and fourth atleast 100 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the original 4 people claimed that when the big jelly-fish peered over the hill for the first time the first night what he claims to be a floating fish with fins all the way down its sides and no fins ontop or bottom like an eel passed right through him. I remember him saying it happened and having trouble breathing but none of us saw it and were standing right next to him so that is also inconclusive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many months before this event happened and had never driven passed the quarry because we assumed it was the highest campable place to drive to without a truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late that night what appeared to be infrared goggles clicked on and off over one of the side of the quarry, we all ran up to investigate and when we did someone had run by with a what looked like a potatoe sack with no markings full of sand and slit it open over the fire. when we all looked back the fire was out and we could hear several people moving around the campsite. they also managed to collapse the tent puncture every single can of soda and water we had and slit the rim of the tire so it exploded about 4 minutes after we passed kanaskat state palmer. 2 days later we drove back up with guns because we we all scrambled out of there leaving my friends 6 person tent which was strung up perfectly even though it was torn down when we left also all the small trees that were around the outside of the quarry were cut down and replanted around the tent. we looked around and what appeared to be body sized holes with caps made of woven brush and mud. My mother says before I was born she used to camp with my dad up in the same area when he went hunting and one night a bunch of people with night goggles circles the camp and put out the fire and tore all their gear apart. She filed a report about it and the police said there had been a few cases of what seemed to be secret army operatives playing war games on unsuspecting campers. Supposedly their is a ranger base around where we camped and saw the sighting. All I know is this even was too strange to not mention since it only happened a few months before the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ALL OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE PASSED OFF AS MY OWN COMMENTARY AND CONCLUSIONS,     NOT CONCRETE DETAILS OF THE ACTUAL EVENTS. I HOPE THIS EVENT BRINGS LIGHT TO THOSE WHO GAVE WITNESS TO SIMILAR EVENTS BUT DIDNT WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF BEING A FOOL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OF COURSE AFTER MY OWN PERSONAL TIME SPENT WITH THESE BEINGS I NOW KNOW THE ONES WHO DONT BELIEVE ARE THE FOOLS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On closer inspection I saw it was changing colors. I ran inside and grabbed binoculars, what I saw was slightly diamond shaped I think (it was blurred a bit) with flashing lights in blue, red, green, yellow, and white. It seemed to be moving back and forth very slowly.I woke up my parents and told them to get outside and look. I said I wanted a witness so they couldn&#39;t call me crazy. They both looked and saw what I had seen. I then saw what appeared to be an airplane with the usual red light flashing fly towards the lights. I lost sight of it when I noticed another set of blinking changing lights towards the north. This one was moving towards the west in the direction of the other object. We came inside and 5 minutes later I went back outside and they were gone. I know there is a chance I saw &#34;weather balloons&#34; but what I can&#39;t account for is how uncomfortable I felt as I watched them. Not scared but just not right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a twinkling star, or some other celestial body, would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses were looking at a genuine UFO.

It all began when my freinds had an experience out at their parents home, and ever since then we started looking upwards and were surprised to see how many sightings we did come to incounter. On the early hours of July 10 @ about 1:00 A.M. I was just home from work and was watching T.V. trying to unwind so that I could go to bed. My phone rings, I cringe to the thought of who it could be at that time of the day. It was my friends who where in the habbit of chasing bright orange lights we were seeing so much of in this area. They ask me with alot of ugency &#34;What are you doing?!!&#34; I tell them I was just watching T.V.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Friend then tells me there is this object going my way and that I should go out side and see if it flys by my appartment. I was kind of frustrated thinking I was wasting my time, because I didn&#39;t know if it was going to fyly directly by my house and i didn&#39;t know which side of my appartment I should look for it, plus I was tired. Just as I was going to head back inside I decided to look one more time, then I see it. I was standing out on in front of my driveway,looking south. there was no noise but this huge object was flying at the treetop level very slow. I remember standing there waiting for it to get closer, but as soon as it reached the tree line that was about 200 yrds away from where I was standing, the object stopped and hovered over the trees. There were no colored lights flashing, but It was so close that I could see it was in the shape of the chevron sign and what it looked like big windows around the sides of the object that was faceing me. I started to crouch down by my van thinking that the object was not advancing forward due to maybe it knew I was standing there. Then The object started to do something I did not even expect it to do. It started to move and it appeared like it was landing. The object started to hide lower and lower behind the trees. I was so amazed. We know this area and the direct spot it was hovering over and knew there were houses surrounding the feild it was hovering over, so it was impossible to drive around the block and see anything in the feild. By the time my freind arrived, we drove around the area and seen nothing. I told them what I seen, where and what it did. We stayed out side for about another hour just talking and looking up at the sky and still wondering what happend to this object, when one of a sudden we see this object take off from the south sky at a really fast speed. It looked like a falling star but only this star was shooting up wards from the ground. So the landing was in that area only we could not pin point it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was also spinning in an erattic fashion with no specific pattern. It was triangular and there was a light on each end of the triangular shape, one could say pyramid like in a 3 Dimensional sense, as the lights spun with the shape. They were yellow and red and green in color, and it sped across the sky in no way a conventional craft, helicopter or anything else could fly. It spooked my wife who is a confirmed skeptic, until the other day when she couldnt believe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then spun below the tree line and disappeared.

I didn&#39;t look like a plane (no flashing warning lights) and there was no sound.  It was eluminated in a white glow (not to bright) but very clear. It keept moving towards the park and all of a sudden it disapeared (it was like turning off a light).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eariler in the day we were up at Glacier Point and before leaving we saw many people (15-20) with telescopes that were planning to stay late into the night.

As a stargazer I looked across the sky to see what was up.  I saw a light that looked like a plane comming from the direction that planes usually fly from in my neck of the woods.  I noticed that this object was different.  It appeared to keep going up as to go into orbit.  There were no marker lights on this object, like the ones aircraft have.  I also noticed the object moving in stages.  It seemed to move a little, then it moved a bit more, as if it got a boost.  I don&#39;t think this was an alien craft but I do believe that it was something unusual.  I attempted to run inside and get my Tele Vue refractor telescope to get a better view.  I got the scope set up very quickly however, it was not quick enough.  The object was either to faint to see or was in orbit.  After being very frustrated I went inside to see if any orbiters have been launched today.  The only thing that is close in terms of a launch date is July 11th.  That is when Boeing is launching the AURA ozone layer data collecting orbiter from Vandenburg AFB in California.  Well what ever I saw I am 100% convinced it was not a plane, weather-baloon, or satilite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They began to move very slowly, then more quickly and others appeared -- they grew bright and then would disappear.

It was making a rather distinct humming noise, which vibrated through the air. I got out of bed and was goign to head out of my room where all of a sudden the light expanded and shone on my wall and this HUGE sense of gravity hit me, i could barely move, i tried resiliantly to get to the door from my knees, however when i got as far as a cm higher the gravity was just too much and i fell to the ground, i noticed too that i was awfully tired which is extremely unsual, it&#39;s as if i had been gased as i could have fell asleep if i wanted in 5 seconds. Which i did. As i was thinking what to do in the short period of time i came to the conclusion of conforming to the gravity and gas (or wateva it was)and fall asleep as i would havefelt it extremely tense and frightening to have stayed awake. IF it happens again i just might stay awake. Anyway as soon as i fell asleep lying on my bedroom floor i wokeup just at the same rate as i fell asleep. Slowly gathering conciousness remembering only the time when i saw the light until i fell asleep. It felt to me as a huge time gap had been erased as when the &#34;incident&#34; had occured it was dark and when i woke up it was light, however i felt as if i had just woke up from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take this into consideration however take into considerationh that it could have been a dream, a dream like NONE OTHER as it was terrifyingly realistic.

The lights seemed to disfigure as it rose makeing different shapes. But the shapes were solid curcle sqare etc. They made no noise other then the wind gust blowing the trees and it was extremely bright. We could see it rise up in to the sky for about 10min or so and it just cept getting smaller and smaller. When it first rose out of the trees it looked to be the size of a small one floor house.

What my wife and I saw this morning was something other than a &#34;craft&#34;, I suspect, yet it was quite bizarre.  It involved a &#39;something&#39; shaped exactly like a vertically oriented Greek letter omega, complete with the small &#39;wing&#39; out to each side at the bottom.  The &#39;thing&#39; seemed composed of a very solid-looking tube with pointed ends that was of a bright white, opaque-looking, and highly coherent &#39;vapor&#39; (or something else). It subtended about four full moons or two degrees in height (somewhat less in width), as measured objectively by my wife using fingers at arm&#39;s length, and by me, independently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Omega-like thing hovered at about 42 degrees elevation in our north-northwestern sky while a brand-new-looking (very clean, bright paint) blue and white helicopter circled several times between us and it at only a couple of hundred feet (maybe 300-400 maximum) just to the east and southeast of the &#39;thing&#39;, until the thing suddenly began to disintegrate or dissolve as a white vapor that was quickly carried away to the east on low-level winds that were the same as at ground level. Then, the helicopter flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the extraordinarily noise of the low-level, circling (in a N-S oval) helicopter (that had just flown into the area) that caused my wife and me to look up in its direction and, as a result, see the bizarre omega-shaped thing hovering what seemed, subjectively, no more that a thousand feet to the northwest of the elliptical path of the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter departed once the &#39;omega&#39; began to disintegrate, after having completed several traverses of its elliptical path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have subsequently learned the identity of the helicopter and the name of its pilot, plus the phone number were I should be able to reach him early in the morning (Saturday). Anything I learn from the pilot will be relayed to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would stress that this definitely was not a jet aircraft&#39;s condensation wake, nor was it an ordinary low-level cloud, by any stretch of the imagination.  Whatever it might have been, it gave the impression of being of artificial, and at least to us, anomalous in origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live just inside the northern edge of the Washington, D.C. Beltway (I 495), and a short drive west of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get the camera but could not locate it, so I ran back out while my wife (who had watched in the interim of my absence)went in and found the camera and came back outside with it.  By that time, the object had disintegrated, with the residue drifting east.  I took several photos of the vapor drifting east along with small clouds and trees for reference, in order to show that the residue was drifting on the lower-level wind and not with the atmosphere higher up where jets fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observation was not frightening, but it seemed quite bizarre, that impression enhanced by the elliptically circling helicopter just to the omega&#39;s east and southeast, and only while the object was there.  It will be interesting to learn whether the pilot saw the phenomenon, and I have learned the pilot was &#34;on a photo mission&#34;, so he might even have gotten photos.  I shall not hold my breath, though, because the pilot and anyone else aboard may have been distracted downward because it was a photo mission. If not the observed phenomenon, I wonder what they were trying to photograph in that area.  The photo objective may have been something prosaic, however, although I can&#39;t help but hope they saw the phenomenon and took photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within six minutes after the observation, I checked the ELF magnetic environment with one of our instruments, but found nothing magnetically anomalous in the monitored range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would judge, subjectively, that the vertically oriented (at least from our view, and seemingly relative to the ground) &#39;omega&#39; was located approximately over the intersection of the northern side of the D.C. Beltway (I 495) with I 95, going north and south toward and from Baltimore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so windy this morning that I am confident the &#39;omega&#39; was not &#39;skywriting&#39;, and, furthermore, being just north of D.C. within its beltway, we are in a highly FLIGHT CONTROLLED zone. A skywriting aircraft would have been attacked by the Air Force, immediately.  Furthermore, sky writing would not have hovered in the sky, as did this phenomenon before its &#39;disintegration&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope no one tries to read anything into the fact that the phenomenon was omega-shaped, even though I could think of some political commentary.  :)<n>

It appeared almost overhead, but shifted about 60 to 70 degrees above the western horizon, low enough to be easily seen.  As an object it seemed a bit large, or a bit close, say 1000 to 3000 feet altitude, and made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not seem to rotate much about its own axis.  Visually, it had a squarish, or four lobed appearance, like a diamond shape, with a larger sphere in the middle.  This was evident when it was at its closest, when I first glanced up and saw it.  It was startlingly large.  I observed it for nearly 5 minutes from overhead to losing it behind a house roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two pictures are either attached or sent separately by email, Pict5704.jpg (optical zoom 10x) and Pict5708.jpg (4x additional digital zoom, 40x total).

During summer it gets dark later in the day, about half a hour once the sun fully set we all sit up on this hill.  Me and my cousin were the first to notice, but in the sky about 80 feet above us was this saucer.  It stopped above us.  This thing was crazy!  The machince was rotating fast, really fast to were it almost looked like it was still.  This inner circle had a dim light as well and light and somewhat windows at the top.  The level of peace that me and my friends had when we saw this was unbelieveable those who have had something like this happed would agree.  After 2 or so minutes and everyone now in the group watching this thing, it took off and flew 6 miles into the mountains.  The time to go into the mountains was roughly 20 seconds and it was gone as a blur of light.  This whole situation was comepletely silent even birds in the area had stopped chirping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Totally unlike anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed a bright light in the sky, looking like a very large, very bright star. I then thought it was a planet, although it looked a little large. Then I became aware of a red light to the side of it and realized that the object was moving closer to my position. At this point I decided it was a helicopter, as police helicopters routinely fly by this location. I waited to hear the familiar sound of a helicopter in flight, but the sound never came. As it drew closer it looked very much like a big car in the sky was headed towards me. By this I mean that the most noticeable thing was two big lights, on what was presumably the front of the aircraft, looking very much like car headlights in the sky. There was a third, smaller light between these two. All these lights were rather standard looking lights, although very bright. I&#39;ll note here that these lights were constant, not flashing. The object wasn&#39;t moving very quickly, but it was moving in what I consider to be a normal manner for an aircraft. As it drew closer I began to wonder why I still couldn&#39;t hear the noise of the helicopter&#39;s rotars, it seemed as though it was close enough that I should be able to hear it. When I did finally hear it it sounded like a jet airplane rather than a helicopter, though it was still moving at a speed that I associate with helicopters, not airplanes. The sound was also remarkably quiet. I am familiar with passenger airlines flying by with a deafening roar, this was nothing like that even as it passed almost directly over me. Now, as it got very close I began to notice the bizarre shape of the craft. It was night, so most of my impression of the shape came from the positioning of the lights, but I also got a general feel of an outline of the thing. It looked essentially like a big cross or letter &#39;x&#39;. The &#39;headlights&#39; I had seen before were still visible, and I now noticed that they also extended under the object at what I assume to be the front, reminding me somehow of a cockpit although I make no! assumption that is what I was looking at. This was approximately at where the branches of the &#39;x&#39; join. On each branch there was a light near the end, plain white light on three but a red light on one, as best as I could tell. It is hard to be sure because the general impression I got was that I was looking at something the likes of which I had never seen before, so that added to the darkness made it hard to draw any 100% conclusions. I immediately called my friend who I know to be interested in this kind of thing. When I explained to him what I saw and told him the direction it was travelling in he informed me that it was heading directly towards Forbes Field. Interestingly, he had noticed a lot of military aircraft flying here lately, I had seen one or two myself while out with him. Also, almost immediately after I saw this UFO I noticed a helicopter circling the area for a few minutes. While my friend was here with me we actually noticed several aircraft flying by. It seemed like a lot more than usual, but it&#39;s not like I usually pay much attention to be honest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background information of the observer:  I&#39;m 22 years old, currently unemployed. I&#39;m English but I have been here in Kansas for 3 years. I&#39;m not sure what background information anyone would find useful. I did very well in high school, followed by a couple of years in college in which I didn&#39;t do so well for personal reasons. In that time I did get an AS level in psychology though. I&#39;m fascinated by anything unusual, but anyone would tell you I&#39;m also a very down to earth guy. I have seen unusual things in the sky before but I have never made a report because I always had doubt. The general populace already mocks the study of UFO&#39;s enough without vague reports adding to it. This time I am positive I saw something highly unusual, an aircraft of a design that I am totally unfamiliar with. I am sure background information is meant to supply credibility for the observer. I can&#39;t think what to say to increase my credibility, but I assure you I am a sensible person, fascinated by the unusual but if anything I tend towards cynicism. I do not make this report lightly, and I have not embellished or jumped to any conclusions. I make this report because I feel it is the duty of credible witnesses with honest experiences to make a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my friend were looking out at the intercoastal from inside the house.  Nest thing we know we see this triangle shaped craft come towards us. It was soo low to us, probally less than a pine tree. it passed right over the house and made no noise at all. the only thing i could say this was would be a UFO, seeing that the craft was flying way too low, shaped odd, and made no noise.

Brown, cylindrical shape no lights or obvious features, except it seemed very large, larger than normal aircraft. Altitude apprx. 800 ft. Viewed at first as an aircraft in a barrel-roll, because it spun as a stunt pilot would. As the object proceeded, the view was no longer overhead but from behind, as it left almost straight away. The observation from here presented wonder for how long a pilot could continue such roll, as it was continuous and without falter from its course. Then when far enough away the observation was astonishing. The view of a rolling plane from behind would show its wings on end, becoming mere lines to the eye&#39;s perspective, yet this view showed a continuous and slow roll with large flat oval-shaped wings very visible from behind, [or the object was shifting in form from round to oval and back, which is where the mind and the eyes refused to agree.] Not until after it went beyond the tree line did observer realize that it was not a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The next day, 7/8/04, I decided to lounge on the patio during the afternoonto read magazines and scan the sky periodically for another sighting.  It took awhile to be rewarded for the wait, but at 5.55 PM I saw what appeared to be the same object from the day before, again, in nearly the idential eastern placement in the sky.  Again, through binocs, it was a single sphere, apparently reflecting the sun, but not glinting.  I watched it as it very slowly moved toward the south, passing BEHIND one small cloud which itself was drifting generally northward.  (The local online weather details indicated a north wind in Denver, though I&#39;m not sure at what time or altitude that stat was documented).  As previously, this object gradually faded out of sight, though it was visible for about 10 minutes total, until 6.05, during which time it had moved only a few degrees.  NOTABLY:  Less than 1/2 hour later, the same or a similar object AGAIN appeared, but several degrees north of the location where the earlier one had disappeared, and once again it very slowly headed to the south/perhaps SE as it gradually faded in intensity.  Second event lasted from 6.30 to 6.38 PM.  Using Occam&#39;s razor, I started thinking about these 4 sightings which had occurred in a 30-hour period, and there are several things worth noting:  1) I did not change the focus on the binoculars from the time I saw the distant, near-stationary object SUDDENLY accelerate during yesterday&#39;s sighting, indicating it was the same object and not the result of an unintentional, split second &#34;blink of the eye&#34; viewfinder adjustment to something closer to me (for instance, cotton from a cottonwood tree)and besides, the speeding object looked identical in size and shape to the steady object, 2) in addition, this time of year there is no cotton drifting in the air,  3) the object was relatively stationary and steady in intensity -- rather unlike a balloon might appear if drifti! ng in upper level winds, and 4) the object moved slowly southward while the clouds at apparently a similar altitude were drifting northward.  I am going to continue watching for this type of object and would encourage other Denver-area skywatchers to keep their eyes peeled for this recurrent daytime object in the eastern sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.

Mazarron, Murcia, Spain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 13.45 and 14.00. Hot day, temperatures in high 20&amp;#8217;s C, light breeze, enough to stir the leaves, clear blue skies. No clouds to the north, east or south, Clouds forming to the south west, up and over the distant hills, and moving to the west. These hills start at about four miles south, and run down the coast southward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking the dog up the road, in a northwest direction I noticed a bright white cloud ahead. It caught my notice, as there were no other clouds visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to within 150 yards of the end of this road, where at the end there are a line of trees, all about 40 to 50 feet high. This cloud seemed to be very close behind the trees and low. Half of it was below the top quarter of the trees, the remainder in clear view. It was swirling like clouds do, changing shape and forming tails that broke off into small pieces of cloud, move away, and seemed to go back into the main cloud. Then the cloud seemed to evaporate a little and re build itsself again. I watched for two or so minutes, and it disappeared totally. I turned back to home, but glanced back about 15 seconds later and the cloud was back again in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On reaching home, I took my binoculars and went up onto the roof of the block of apartments. I estimate the deck to be about 65 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are three blocks in a row all of about the same size from the roof you can only see the roof of the next block. There sure enough was the cloud, but it must have been higher than it&amp;#8217;s original position as it appeared to be a few feel higher then the top of the roof of the next block.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo !. Shows the roof from where I first observed it, point A on the map, behind the left of the two chimney like stacks, and extending midway between the two. It was doing as I previously described, shrinking, fading enlarging and disappearing. It did not drift in any direction, but remained in roughly the same spot, suddenly to vanish completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other clouds in the sky remember. Suddenly a round cloud, appeared over the top of the hill to the west, a mile from here, marked B on the map, in line with the two palm trees in the centre of the photograph. It was about half an inch across, remained stationary there for about a minute, then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud at point A reappeared within seconds of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud evaporated again, and the round cloud appeared over the same hill slightly to the right and lower than before. It changed shape, ending up seeming to stand on end in a curved line, and just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reappeared over the hills at point C on the map, over the end of the line of hills three miles away to the north, remaining stationary. It did not appear to change shape, and seemed a little bigger than when it was closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed a large cloud appearing from behind the line of hills to the north, in direct line with the round cloud. It came slowly in a straight line, stopping a distance away from the round cloud, point D on the map. Neither moved as I watched for about a minute. When I glanced back in the to centre of the valley to my amazement there were ten or more small clouds over various parts to the west of the valley, some below and some above the top line of the hills to the north. These cloudlets changed shapes, evaporated or grew larger, some starting with a small dot of white, and developing into small clouds about the size of my little finger. The cloud in the original position (A) was back there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo B. Is taken from the point I moved back too, to get out of the sun. I was able to see points C and D, and across the valley to the east. I became aware of a large cloud coming over the hills to the east, eight miles or more from here, the highest hill to the right of the photograph, and it slowly came in a straight line across the middle of the valley, followed by an identical cloud some 15 seconds later, on the course as the first. They were travelling at the same speed. The first one at its closest point was between me and the hills to the north east, and there was about two inches of sky between its bottom edge and the tops of the hills. It seemed to be about four inches long. It stopped at a point just before the cream wall in the photograph. Both of them stopped, at points E and F on the map, and began to evaporate, and I looked at the two other clouds at C and D and they too were fading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was not a cloud to be seen. After a few minutes the original cloud re appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to leave at this point. Sighting lasted 25 mins. On the roof At 18.00 hours I had to go out, and the cloud was once again over the trees at the end of the road. I did not have time to observe it, and it was gone when I returned an hour later. There were no other clouds in the sky anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have drawn the clouds as best I can. They were like no clouds I have ever seen, in formation, movement across the sky and lack of movement within itsself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area is semi arid, with the valley floor covered with plastic greenhouses, but no industry. I checked for a fire as the possible source of the clouds, but there were none. I Thought maybe the local climate could have caused this effect, however this is unlikely, as we have had a week of similar weather conditions, some days with clouds, all of them very high in the sky, and all of them behaving as one would expect clouds to behave. They were unlike any clouds I have ever seen, (both from above and below  clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a map and three location photographs.

As it quickly descended, I awaited the crash but didn&#39;t hear anything. The whole event probably lasted 3-5 seconds, but it seemed longer. It was probably a meteorite, but I&#39;ve never seen one on fire before. What a fantastic sight!

It was heading North, and we were looking to the east from Garland TX (basically Dallas).  The front was a big orange and red fireball followed by a blue and green tail, bigger than a comet&#39;s tail.  I thought at first some one was shooting off fire works close by till I realised the distance and apparent speed, and then I thought it was a big meteor and when it went behind the trees, my friend and I both waited a second, holding our breaths, for the impact. It seemed really close.  Then I said, do you know how few people get to see something that cool?<n>

It was so bright, and colorful, it was amazing.  It was approximately seen at an azimuth of 181 degrees and approximately a zenith angle of 50 degrees (with 180 being to the center of the earth).  It looked to be the size of a number 2 pencil eraser.  I observed blue, red, yellow, and white flames around it.  You could actually see the tips of the flames.  It streaked from west to east, but probably was actually coming at me from south to north.  My only guess is that it was either a meteorite, or an aircraft exploding and completely burning up before my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just after a car passed, a glowing, green, rocket-shaped object caught my attention. It was at about a thirty degree angle directly in front of me. There were no obstructions to my vision. As quickly as I fixed my eyes on it, the object appeared to gain speed and change in color from green to a bright orange. At this point, a tail of what appeared to be fire developed. The tail glowed momentarily in a long strand and then faded out. This object was travelling out of the south, and appeared to be on a course to strike the ground a couple of miles to the east of the Monroe airport. I kept waiting for an explosion, but none came, so I cannot say without a doubt that it landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been using this same route to work for ten years.

It was a relatively clear nite, only a few cumulus clouds and unlimited visibilty. I saw a bright white light, slightly brighter than the ISS moving at high speed due east, initially thought it a satellite until I saw it bank southward hard 45 degrees. Just than I saw a plane almost overhead approx. 10,000 feet flying intercept to object, plane was unusual in that it seemed to fly much faster than regular commercial traffic and had a solid red light on belly, and a much brighter red flashing one in same general area, no blue wingtip lite seen and I was looking intently at it. As the plane neared about 4 to 5000 feet from object the light simply went out and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked as if it was flying around 40,000 ft. (est.), and was in straight line motion. A small cloud cluster was moving into it&#39;s path below it (8,000-15,000 ft.). I was going to grab my camcorder, but didn&#39;t want to take my eyes off of it. As the clouds passed in front of the object, I expected it to reappear on the other side...but nothing ever emerged. I scanend the sky for a possible turn or movement in another direction, but there was just local traffic overhead around 2,000 to 4,000 ft. landing at our local airport. Viewing only lasted about 8-10 seconds before it vanished. Looking to the northwest sky, at about a 70-80 degree angle, from a location of 41.45903N / 81.70817W<n>

I ran inside to grab my binoculars and was back outside within about 30 seconds, but I couldn&#39;t find the object, so I scanned the sky to see if it had moved to another location, thinking it may have been a balloon very high in the sky.  I located it, or another object like it, substantially east of the original location, but again, appearing stationary.  (I subsequently checked the current weather report and found that the wind was coming from the north, so apparently the object was not simply drifting in the wind.) I sighted it through the binoculars and it appeared to be a single, round, whitish object.  As I watched it for a couple of minutes, sometimes with the naked eye and sometimes through the binoculars, it seemed to remain almost motionless.  Then SUDDENLY, it took off heading to the south very quickly -- erasing any suspicion I had that it may be a balloon.  Whereas I had been holding the binoculars steady, I now had a hard time keeping up with the object.

On the morning of July 7th, 2004 while on a break at the local hospital I noticed in the sky a very bright light glowing in the sky.  The light appeared sort of orange in color and resembles the sort of light one would expect to see on an approaching helicopter, the light was stationary in one area for about 2 1/2 hours.  I work security at the hospital and have access to the surveillance cameras at the facility, so I went inside and decided to position the cameras skyward to see if I could get a better and closer view of the object.  Once I fixed the cameras on the object and zoom in on it the object appeared to be a bright circle with another circle inside of it, I then focus the view of the camera to view as near as possible and the object appeared to glow outward from the center and had the appearance of a huge eye.  The sky was clear and stars could easily be viewed by natural eye but this object appeared closer than the stars.  I took pictures of the object on the camera with my picture phone.  I don&#39;t know if this is a UFO or a natural phenomenon of some sort, but I am definitely sure it was not an airplane or manmade craft.  I am sending via email some pictures of the object, the photos will be EyeNSky1 and EyeNSky2.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to search for my camera and when I finally found it, these shapes we&#39;re no longer appearing.  I focused the camera in the general vicinity where we saw the observation and noticed a bright light that was far up in the sky...possibly near the stars.  It was moving erratically and rapidly...travelling across the field of view of several stars in only seconds and changing direction rapidly. I captured this observation on videotape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The strange and perhaps frightening thing was they both appeared out of no where and we both were in awe. The one elevated above the other one really and I mean extremely slowly , then all of a sudden we seen both of them in what appeared to be targeting our balcony in which we were standing with red lasers. We both couldn&#39;t even move nor talk to one another at that time , it was like we were in shock. These red lasers were not pin lasers by any means and they moved on the edge of our balcony as well as landing on each of us. As soon as we looked down and seen these red laser balls on our bodies they disappeared as well as both rectangular objects in the night sky. This took place right around midnight and lasted no more than 15 minutes , furthermore the same night while laying in bed trying to sleep after what we just witnessed we seen a red laser on our bed move and bounce around yet nothing outside as we both jumped and looked out our window.

While on vacation and walking my dogs I saw a b2 bomber and at least 2 f18&#39;s in the area, mostly over the nuke plants yet meandering hither and yon over the city. Never did see exactly what they were looking for. All I know is that the rumble from the b2&#39;s engine made the air in my lungs vibrate. Deep and throaty powerful roar. WTAM am radio station even did a special segment on all the frequent sightings in approx. 7/6 to 9/25. And don&#39;t even mention contrails. I really think they are trying to obscure our view of what really is going on up there. The most dramatic sighting was on 8/20/04 when I was out catching a smoke. I saw at about 1030 pm est a yellow cloud with a very bright white light in the center of it travelling at about the speed of ISS or just a little faster heading ESE and making about a 15 degree tilt to the South. This thing was big. The size of a basketball with fist outstretched. I really wanted to start screaming but my neighbors were asleep. All that came out was repeated &#39;oh my God&#39; in a whisper. I cannot even give a good description because it was so anomalous to anything I have ever seen before. It looked like a shape shifter like a yellow aurora with a friggin bright white light right in the center. Between all the heavy contrails and numerous sightings leaves me a little disturbed. I just hope they can show us how to make energy cheap before we destroy this planet with fossil fuel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The conditions were excellent: blue skies, with a few sizable white clouds making an appearance. At around 11:45am, I noticed a single bright &#34;dot&#34; in the sky, almost as high as a satellite would appear at night. No sound was coming from the object. It was moving very slowly. I decided to fetch a pair of 10-zoom binoculars so that I could get a clearer inspection. Through the binoculars, the object appeared oblong-shaped, with luminous sides that alternately glowed then dimmed as it continued to travel slowly along in a strange tumbling-like motion. All the time it maintained its near-satellite altitude. The middle of the oblong-shaped object appeared translucent, and I could see blue sky through it. At no time was the sun reflecting off the object. The object also wasn&#39;t a balloon, as it appeared to stop for 20 seconds or so before moving on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was proceeding in a westerly direction, until two USAF tanker planes appeared close by from the south, at around 20,000 feet. The object then changed direction, gliding slowly about the sky in it&#39;s strange, tumbling motion -- falling end over end -- at the same altitude. I continued to watch the object through binoculars until it was directly overhead. A light aircraft, at around 5,000 feet, passed under the object. I eventually lost sight of the object in a big cloud. I gave up observing due to a stiff neck!  I&#39;ve seen some strange aerial objects in this part of Cambridgeshire (we also get chemtrails around here too), but this one ranks as the most bizarre, due to its odd plasma-like, quasi-organic appearance. I&#39;m not a trained observer, just a normal civilian.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All we sya were the lights, nothing visible to the eye in the formation, just black. It traveled for about five minutes or so when two of the ends of the triangle started to fade away. The formation started to slow down, and the two corners of the formation dissapeared and the final end left stopped and stayed still.

On that particular night I had stayed up to see the ISS passover, it was due at 4:30 AM, and when I went out at 3:29 AM to have a cigarette, I was looking in the sky in the direction the ISS would be coming from, SSW and almost immediately saw 3 white lights in a triangular shape moving from that direction towards me. I looked inside at the clock, because I thought maybe I was mistaken as to the time, and saw that it was 3:30 AM. I came back to the railing and watched the 3 lights. 2 of the lights were on what I presumed was the front with one light trailing behind but centered on the other 2. There appeared to be about a 1/2 degree separation between the 2 lead lights and the other trailed about 1 to 1 1/2 degrees behind. The object appeared to be moving across the sky at about the same rate that the ISS appears to be moving whenever I see it. As I continued to watch it, I realized that it would be passing directly over my head. I noticed that any stars which it seemed to pass in front of would disappear until after it had passed that position in the sky. After a couple of minutes I further realized that the object was not getting any larger, as a plane would if it were approaching, which meant that it had to be extremely high for that to happen. I watch planes on a regular basis and even when they are flying at 20,000 to 30,000 feet I can still notice a change in size as they come closer. Therefore, whatever this was it had to be very, very large. I never heard any sound or saw any other lights on or around it. Just before it got over my head, one of the lead lights suddenly started pulling away from the other 2 at a tremendous rate which made me think that maybe this was not one craft but three. However, I remembered from earlier when it had passed in front of the stars that it had seemed to be solid. Now, suddenly, one of the lights was pulling away very quickly. At this point I had to question w! hether it was 1, 2 or 3 objects I was actually seeing and, if it was more than one object, then why did the stars get blotted out &#34;behind&#34; it. As it disappeared, I live on the second floor of a 3 story condo building, pass the edge of the roof, the light which had begun pulling away from the other 2 now had about a full degree of seperation from the light which it had earlier had only about a 1/2 degree of seperation from earlier, and the other lead light and trailing light had not changed position relative to one another. Since then I have been puzzling out in my mind how it could have blotted out the stars if it were actually 3 objects instead of one. My conclusion is that it must have been one object, but somehow maybe launched something that was at that one point, that it was extremely high flying (possibly suborbital or even in orbit), was travelling extremely fast for the altitude and was very large because if it was at an altitude of 100 miles up in orbit, it would have had to be miles long. I can hear jets fly over at altitudes up to about 40,000 feet so since I could not hear it it had to be at least that high, and at even 50,000 feet, given it&#39;s apparent size, it would have been thousands of feet long to take up that big a slice of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

By the time i got outside (maybe a minute) the formation had moved to the far south side of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the minute i was outside, i saw the formation increase its speed and altitude, until each star seemed to reach an altitude that was no longer visible.

It then looked like it was moving north, but then it looked like it was coming towards us for like 10 seconds, then went north.

I spotted five satellites in less than five minutes.  All exhibited the &#34;basic&#34; characteristics of satellites regarding speed, distance, and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after spotting the last one of these, I noticed another coming from the south and moving towards the area of the night sky near the &#34;handle&#34; of the Big Dipper constellation.  I immediately tried sighting it through my binoculars (10x50) using the normal technique of aiming in &#34;front&#34; of the object (ahead of it along its apparent trajectory), assuming it had a straight line trajectory as satellites do.  I noticed also that it seemed slightly brighter than the other satellites I&#39;d seen that evening (about twice as bright) and that it was moving about 1/3 to 1/2 less than the speed of the previously spotted satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t see it through my binoculars, and lowered them.  I could see it easily with the naked eye however, yet each time I lifted the binoculars to the area where it should have been travelling, I couldn&#39;t find it.  I kept lowering the binoculars, recapturing it with my unaided eyesight, then lifting the binoculars again, only to lose sight of the object.  After four or five attempts, I gave up trying to spot it with the binoculars and just &#34;eyeballed&#34; it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I discovered why the object was hard to track.  As it was travelling toward the north, it was also turning slightly to the right (east).  When the object reached the point in the sky where its apparent position was between the two outermost stars which make up the &#34;handle&#34; of the Big Dipper, it began a slow but tighter turn toward the east.  It completed this turn after a course change of about 180 degrees, and then continued heading back toward the south.  The object completed this 180 degree turn when it reached the point in the sky where its apparent position placed it in between the four stars which make up the &#34;scoop&#34; or dipper part of the Big Dipper.  Thus, the apparent diameter of this 180 curve ascribed by this object was the apparent distance from in between the first and second stars of the Big Dipper&#39;s handle to the middle of the Big Dipper&#39;s scoop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a satellite do that before... or, was it a satellite?<n>

I just looked over the Gulf like I have countless times in my 21 years of growing up here. About 1/4 mile of the beach were there reddish-orange lights about 300 ft above the water. I roled my window down to get a better look and asked my brother (who is in the coast guard)if those were signal flares. He replied yes and told my dad to pull over, luckily there was I large stretch of open beach were we spotted them. We rolled down the windows and we slowly realized something wasnt right. the lights were stationary and in perfect alignment as well as space from each other. My brother replied &#34;those arent flares and a curious silence came about us as wew tried to figure out what we were looking at.There were 5 lights, they kept blinking in random patterns(one side to the other or 1 would turn off and on while another did the same in reponse. the night was perfect for visibility the moon was full and to the south shining down onto the Gulf waters. There wasnt a cloud in the sky so I still dont understand why I along with my familydid notseetructure, it was just these lights. had there been a structure I would think we could have made an outline of it becuase there was moonlight behind it but we saw no obvious shape. The lights went on for only about 30 seconds and they dissapeared for about 5 seconds then all of a sudden on the horizon the southeast we saw the same lights only 2 this time turned on and off one time and we didnt see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Months later my roomate and I were traveling down the same road as we did every day because we lived in a house on the beach about 2 miles from my first sighting. it was about the same time at night and I saw one the lights agian! This one was a single light with a more orange-white color to it. I shouted &#34;look at that&#34; my roomate Immediately saw it and I pulled off the road at almost the same spot as before. I told all my friends about what I had seen before and they didnt really care because you cant emphasize how amazing it was to see what I had seen. i pointed in my roomates face and said  &#34;Y told you&#34; and he was spaechless like I was the first time. We watched this light for only about 15 seconds and the light either jetted south at a rate of speed which no U.S. aircraft could match or the object literally went down into the water. I still dont know what it did to this day. We then went to our house and stood on the porch and looking over the Gulf and we saw an event of lights whish I cant put into words. I dont know how far they were from us but they were definately more than 2 miles out. i saw countless bright red lights popping up all over the sky close to the water not up in the stars.We also saw the orange white lights again but not in the numbers like the red ones. We watched for over 30 minutes and we heard and saw military planes coming from the east (from Eglin air base9 as well as from the west(from Tyndall air base) they proceeded out into the Gulf. at one point I saw a string of lights go off at once which really resembled counter measures that are released fome fighter planes to evade missles. I should mentionthat none these lightsdidnotdo eratic manuvers but the red lights appereared  stationary when they &#34;poped up&#34; in lage numbers (between 20 and 50). we went back inside beacuse it was so cold and to this day Feb.15, 2006 I have yet to the the mystrious lights which I will NEVER forget. Oh yes and the lights never had a sound or a trail to them. Everytime I look out to the Gulf at night i still hope to spot these lights again. Please E-MAIL me if you have any questions about what I ve just told you. I would be gratful for any explanations for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stayed at the St Anthony Hotel downtown.  This hotel has a roof top patio with a good view of the sky.  Although we had a lot of sky to look at, there were not many stars out because we were in the downtown area.  We were hanging out at around 3:15 am having a cigarette.  Both of us were sitting facing the south discussing the previous evening.   Looking southward at a 65 degree angle we both saw a fast moving light.  It lasted about 3 seconds and moved quickly from east to west.  The light was the size of my pinky fingernail at arms length with a white/green tint(white center and green glow around it.)  The light object disappeared.  It did not burn up or leave a trail like a shooting star.  It just disappeared.  I am an avid star gazer and this was not a shooting star.  Nor was it an iridium satellite because it moved so quickly and was not just a brief flash.  I have seen many things in our skies, but this was most unique.

I pointed it out to three others, my son, daughter-in-law, and friend.  We watched it for about two minutes as it continued North.  It was travelling at about 4 to 5 times the speed of a jetliner and zig-zagged erratically from side to side.  It was brilliant, brighter than the stars and any other object in the sky.  It was not an aircraft. After it moved from view we saw a satellite pass overhead.  The satellite was a small fraction of the brightness of this object.  I have practiced law for 24 years.

They looked like a satellite one would see on clear stary night, but a bit brighter. They would probably be mistaken for satellites, except they moved in exact formation. We spotted them to the North and they moved South, SouthEast. They moved a bit faster than a satellite would. We saw them for about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some personal observations:  They certainly could have been satellites, but I know of no satellites that fly in formation (again, both my wife and I notice specifically that they moved together without the slightest separation, at least that can be seen with the nake eye.)  Though its hard to explain, you could see that the objects were a great distance just by the look of the lights. The only thing I wish I would have taken note of at the time was whether any stars were visible inbetween the lights, thus indicating some sort of solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More than anything, I would like to know if there is a reasonable explanation. If there is someone who knows what this might be, or if this a common occurance. Of course the other interesting thing was that it was on the fourth of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellites, which orbit in formation?

At 6500&#39; and a crystal clear sky, the view was breathtaking.  We watched a couple of satellites go over head, the first one faint and normal speed and the second one much brighter and faster (I&#39;m not sure if it was the ISS but it was very bright for a satellite).  Both moved in straight lines directly over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, we noticed another &#39;satellite&#39; following in the same flight path as the first two.  All of the sudden, it took a hard turn to the left (not 90 degrees but a fairly fast turn) went for a short distance, curved back to the right and continued  curving right and then left for several more turns a bit irradically (going straight for 1-4 seconds between turns).  The speed of the object didn&#39;t seem to change at all during the sighting as the turns were all fairly smooth.  By the time it went out of sight, it had veered off 45 degrees from it&#39;s original flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m certain that it wasn&#39;t either a low flying or high altitude air craft and at the elevation that satellites fly at, the G forces within this object must have been massive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have another witness who watched the same thing I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry there isn&#39;t much more to the sighting than that but it freaked the both of us out as we couldn&#39;t think of any known explanation.  Is there any similar reports to this sighting and does it have a rational explanation?  thanks!<n>

Though the lights were small, they immediately captured everyone&#39;s attn at the same time; this was interesting in that we were all concentrating on the show in the distance. The lights seemed to simply turn off rather than diminish (again, like traser fire); unlike traser fire it didn&#39;t curve back to earth and there was no sound nor logical point of origin (if from a gun).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since my brother and law and I had our children with us, we decided to stay outside to view a local fireworks display.  There were several neighbors doing the same in the vicinity.  After a few minutes of viewing I noticed one group of neighbors standing 10 feet away looking up in the opposite direction of the fireworks display.  I followed their line of sight and noticed two red points of light flickering in the sky.  What struck me at that moment is that these lights appeared to possess the same characteristics as the lights that I had seen on two previous occasions (single point, bright red, same intensity).  Both lights were located in roughly the same area as the single red light my family and I witnessed just after 12:00 AM New Years 2004 (I called several family members away from our party to witness that event) and a single red light I witnessed some time in the early morning hours of October 2003.  During the New Years sighting I watched a single red light slowly move from south to north and to nearly overhead where it then stopped and stayed stationary for 15-20 minutes.  The light subsequently disappeared.  During the October event I drove 3 miles west in an attempt to align myself directly under the light.  I did this in an effort to try to ascertain what exactly it was. I eventually positioned myself to what I perceived as being directly under it, but still could not make any real determination as to the type of aircraft I was observing.  It too then disappeared abruptly within 20-30 minutes of initial sighting.  July 4th&#39;s lights appeared stationary at about 75 degrees above the horizon west of our position. For the majority of the sighting there were two distinct lights approximately one fists distance from one another.  They appeared to remain equal distanced and didn&#39;t produce any sound.  Unlike the previous sightings these flickered. There were private aircraft in the area and on one occasion a small aircraft passed slightly east and under the lights as it continued on its the downwind leg for Gillespie (KSEE, small regional airport in the vicinity 2 miles north).  I would estimate the small aircraft was flying at 1000-1500 AGL.  These lights seemed much higher and both the small aircraft and unidentified lights were unaffected by one another’s presence.  Some minutes later the north side light dimmed, flickered on and off in random pulses, almost like it was struggling to stay lit, then disappeared entirely.  The south side light continued to flicker for an additional 5 minutes and then it too disappeared.  The final light disappearance strangely coincided with the conclusion of the fireworks display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems too much of a coincidence that two of my observations occurred on holidays and during what most would consider the peak period of the holiday.  I live in a densely populated, brightly lit suburb in east San Diego.  I have 2 small regional airports within 15 miles, and MCAS Miramar is 10 miles northwest.  I have been on the MCAS Miramar air base several times and the installation has never struck me as a special projects installation.  It seems to me that any sort new platform testing from Miramar would be unlikely considering the base&#39;s proximity to greater San Diego.  Perhaps some type of new surveillance device related to homeland security?  The lights had to be noticed by many this time.<n>

After deciding not to go view the fireworks, I was in my backyard with some friends trying to catch a sneek peek at a show several miles away. After hearing the sound of the show starting, but nnot being able to see them, I was heading in when my friend (who witnessed this phenomena this New Years with me, see report)said..&#34;look...the red light is back!&#34; I turned and noticed indeed, two perfectly red lights high in the sky directly due north. they appeared to pulse and twinkle as they moved upward in the sky. The moved slowly, alternating positions. I went for my video camera, but it was out of batteries, so I grabbed my computer controlled telescope and headed outside. I managed to get the two lights in focus and began to track them. Though the viefinder, the objects did not twinkle at all! only pure red &#34;stars&#34;...no craft was visible. They appeared to my eye outside of the atmosphere at least....after a few minutes, the batteries on my telescope failed. Unusual, as I had used it very little. So I grabbed my fully charged million candle power spotlight. I attempted to flash a signal at the light, and I believe it repeated a pattern back to be, however I can&#39;t be sure. However, the battery in the light failed as well. Possibly a coincedence..but you never know.  The lights flickered and faded away as the sounds of the local firework show began the gand finale. The whole incident occured during the time frame that every fireworks show uses here in San Diego, serving as perfect cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched them with binoculars, and the movement of the lights and the flickering and fading out one by one over the next 45 mins. or so do seem to support this theory.

At all times the red lights flickered continuously and stayed in a vertical position.

They were about if I hold my arm out I could put my thumb out and that was about the spce in between them. The red lights were a steady red light that&#39;s what caught my attention. Then when they were stationary they would blink occasionally like they were talking to each other during the fireworks show. Then after about 5 or maybe even ten minutes first one went out then a few moments then the other.

We did not know where any of the fireworks would actually be, but we just set out for a stroll and catch a glimpse of any festivities around our neighborhood. At apx. 8:30 pm, my girlfriend noticed in the Northeastern sky, 2 giant red oval/circle lights in the sky. It was apx. 2 miles from our location, and maybe a mile or more up altitude wise. Considering the distance and altitude, I guessed that they were apx size wise to be maybe a few hundred yards long and maybe 250 yards wide, they probally were a lot bigger. To describe them I will say they seemed to be fuzzy or had an aura, no solid edges, and it  seemed they might have been somewhat flat, definetely red. They appeared to be somewhat oval/circle like. There were no blinking lights noticable on either objects. They moved very slowly, and traveled side by side, but were independent of each other. One would move a little away from the other, but not far, then seem to come closer back to what would be a formation or safe distance from the other object. The speed as said, was very slow. As they moved towards the south, we would notice on ocassion they would wobble or vibrate, then go back to there normal slow direction heading south. Of course there were many other people out in front of their homes to witness the fireworks set for 9pm. I noticed apx. 10 or more people outside close by to us. I yelled over to the people close by us, and asked &#34;do you see those lights&#34;?, and they replied that the lights had been up there before we both had arrived, maybe 15 minutes or a half hour (I&#39;m not 100% sure). Of course I did not have my digital camera to record the incident, and asked if any of the neighbors had something to get images of the objects. I asked if someone could call the TV stations or police, etc, but only got the silent treatment. We stayed in our position for apx 30 minutes until they were now overhead us. So that means these objects took almost a half hour to go apx 2 to 3 miles from the original position till they were directly overhead. They exhibited the same manuevers, moving away from each other, but never very far, then to come closier to each other. It looked like when they were overhead us, that at one time they looked like they were going to merge together, but did not. They did vibrate or wobble at intervals, maybe every 5 or 10 minutes, then to return to there slow smooth approach to the south. I could not stand still any longer and we returned home, so I could call the police. Both lights were still up in the sky when we did enter our home. I spoke to an police officier, and he said I was not the only one to call about the lights. That done, I went back outside to see if they were still there. I was planning on bringing my camera to photo, but was not sure if they were still there (I was in a hurry, and also figured they were moving so slow, I would have plenty of time to photo them). One was gone, and directly over our home was the last remaining light/object. And of course, it was going straight up at a much faster speed that they had ever exhibited prior. It continued to go straight up and then out of eyesight range, and was gone for good. I was surprised to not hear of any news or information concerning this sighting on any local news or television stations, etc. This sighting has bothered me since that time, and I just  now (1/15/05) deceided to see if any one else has seen this same event. So I typed in UFO Red Lights over El Cajon CA, on July 4th 2004, in the search engine &#34;Ask Jeeves&#34;, and came to this website. And so I find now (6 months later) that  there were indeed other wittnesses to this event. I to, like others that have voiced their opinions, think that on New Years Eve, and 4th of July celebrations, is the perfect time to have a cover story for objects or UFO&#39;s to occur. Most people would say that it was only fireworks, etc. But it is quite obvious that no know aircraft exhibits such manuevers, shapes or discription.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light or circular object decended to the earth around the Keller Watauga area. The object emitted no smoke and did not flicker. It emmited a bright light and slowly decended toward the ground. I got my Sony Camcorder and filmed the object. at some point the object seems to change from a circle to a circle dividing like a cell and then to cone. The object was west of me, alliance airport is a few miles north west of me, and DFW airport is a few miles east of me.

My mother who was driving said something about lights, so, I looked out my window and saw a gigantic triangular &#34;ship&#34; (don&#39;t know what else to call it) spinning around in a circle and very slowly moving to the west. It moved from the large field to Drake Rd. As we turned onto Drake Rd. It went over us and the car junk yard we parked next to so we could watch it. I got out of the car as the &#34;ship&#34; turned onto it&#39;s side. It was pointing with one side aiming towards the ground. I got out my mothers picture phone and it went dead, at that same time the car went dead. *Suddenly I was in the car. Everyone was seemingly asleep. I looked ahead of the car to see the scariest thing I have ever seen, three small creatures in what seems to be black uniforms. After they left the ship rotated so the point on the ground now pointed to the sky, the lights on the bottom brightened (three red lights on the points and one blue in the middle) and shot off to the south west in a flash.* I am the only one who saw this last part. After it was gone several black helicopters flew over us, going in the direction of the &#34;ship&#34;.<n>

It seemed to come out of nowhere. It flew into my field of vision so quickly that it took me a second to focus on it. At first I thought the black chevron was a turkey vulture, but soon realized that it was flying too fast and dead straight, SW to NE. We were facing NE.  My wife has a compass on her key chain. The object was flying with a purpose. It made no noise. It took my wife awhile to see the object and by that time it was a black dot in the sky, heading in to the horizon. She thought it had to be a military or business jet because of the speed and the manner it was flying, but what I saw was too small and not shaped like any aircraft I know of and I can identify any type plane flying. The Dash 8 was about an inch long in the sky with my hand outstretched and my fingers apart. The object was about 1/8 to a ¼ inch. It never deviated from its flight path and it seemed to me that it passed very close to the Dash 8. The sky was partly cloudy with two different cloud decks. The object and the airliner were both below the lowest cloud deck. I do not know the altitude the planes fly at that point from the airport. The distance is 12.5 miles due SW. The turbo props fly at a lower altitude than the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was roughly the size of a medium-sized pea held at arm&#39;s length, at what appeared to be a relatively low altitude, and gave off an extremely bright golden orange light, which would periodically dim, then brighten up again. The object was moving at a fairly high rate of speed in a circular pattern. After completing a little over 45° of the circle, it disapeared.

The first flash appeared in one spot then a split second later further along in a horizontal line the second flash appeared and then it was gone. I figured it was the same object that made both flashes; considering the distance between the two flashes in a split second it had to be traveling at a fantastic speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They hovered and moved too slowly.   The fighter jet was in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:35 am. MST: I was sitting alone outside at Brewer&#39;s Market in Boulder Colorado having a cup of coffee reading the paper.  The location is between Arapahoe and Canyon on Folsom street.  The coffee shop patio has a panoramic view of the Front Range and continental divide.  The skies were clear with some clouds to the south.   I happened to look up and see a very small spherical, metallic white object to the west about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was very far away but had a uniform color, and spherical shape (i.e. not an airplane, jet or glider shape). Because it was spherical it was difficult to determine the altitude of the object; but I would guess that it was about 10 – 15 miles to the west, somewhere over the continental divide in West Boulder county.  I would guess the altitude was at 20 – 50 K feet.  It was not moving which I found to be strange.   I marked the position of the object using a tree in the parking lot.   I thought that it might be a weather balloon.   I noticed that without my polarized sunglasses the object was almost unperceivable in the hazy blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:40:   I notice two airliners (DIA is 15 miles to the East).  One was flying West about 5-10 miles North of the object at about 15-25 K feet; the other airliner was flying East about 5-10 miles south of the object at about 15-25K feet.  Both airliners were traveling in regular flight paths into and out of DIA.  I live in the mountains and watch aircraft fly into and out of DIA and Jeffco Airports regularly.  I know the flight paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:45:  The object started to slowly move East toward my position.   It moved too slowly to be an aircraft at any reasonable altitude.   It moved too quickly to be a weather balloon propelled by the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12:00 :  The object had moved almost directly above me, from 30 degrees to 90 degrees from the horizon.  It was still at a very high altitude.  It was still a metallic white spherical object.   It was at this time that I noticed another identical object moving past the first object heading due west both at similar altitudes.   Both moving at similar speeds.  I doubt that both objects were weather balloons, moved by the wind in opposite directions. Clouds had started to form to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12:05:   I watched the first object move slightly to the east of my position towards the sun. As it approached the sun it appeared to shine a red color around the object, like the light was shining thru or around the object.   I soon lost the first object in the sun and clouds.   I tried to find the second object that had moved to the West, but was unable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12:08  To the west at a very high altitude I spotted a fighter jet moving towards the West at about 45 degrees above the horizon.   It was clearly a fighter jet, not a Lear or Gulfstream, or airliner.   It has wings swooped back at a sharp angle.  It was moving very quickly, even at the high altitude.  I would estimate the jets altitude at 20-30K feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusions: The objects were too high to clearly discern any features other than the spherical appearance of the object based upon the way that light reflected from them.   I was surprised to see the fighter jet.   The appearance of two objects passing each other did not support my theory that the object were balloons.  They did not appear to be any type of aircraft that I would recognize.  They were not gliders that frequent the Boulder skies.  These objects were very high up.  There were barley visible to the naked eye, but definitely objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((COMMENT FROM READER))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fighter Jet this person is talking about is most likely a Mig-15.  I am a private pilot and fly out of Jeffco Airport.  There is a private pilot who has restored a Korean War Mig-15 and flies it all the time.  By the flight path and swept back wings and altitude I would guess this is the fighter he saw.  The only fighters in Colorado are Air Guard and those are F-16&#39;s.  And we all know they always have a wingman, they never fly a mission solo.  Just my .02<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

Size was approx 3/16&#34; when measured at arms length; color was like a solid glowing neon white tube which did not vary as it moved across the sky, that is, there were no wings casting any shadow or reflections.

We stopped for a rest at the Little Ali Inn in Rachel. May i point out that Rachel is about 20 miles outside Dreamland, a.k.a Area 51. i was standing outside the restaurant waiting for my family to come out when i saw three triangular shaped lights come out from behind a mountain just behind dreamland they proceeded to fly around for about a half hour then quickly dropped behind the mountain. by now my family had come out and they had seen it. if anyone else saw this somehow please post it on this website. i normally dont believe in aliens or the paranormal but when i saw this event it changed my beliefs. apparently rachel nevada has a lot of sightings like these so other shud have heard about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It [was we called it, a falling star&#39;] however, the unusual sight of it and the eerie shape could not be exactly triangle- but it was disappearing so fast, and it seemed to be on a fast out of control- perhaps a falling star dissapearing only seconds as it glowed green with yellow and white, then nothing, as it fell sharply fast! We called this a falling star. My boyfriend and I were both in the car and waiting at the red light, as we saw this very interesting sight! The points of the shooting star- or the triangle- as it was falling at a very fast rate, its points were bright yellow to white as it faltered to the mountain side. WE kid around about the shooting star must have some message for us as we oohed and ahhhhd the sight.[ The lime green seemed to be a slow down- just before it totally disappeared.] So,the the most interesting thing was it was coming down at a very sharp angle as it went from a arched acceleration on its way out of the night sky, and I said I wonder if we will hear about this on the news?<n>

They had blinking lights, most of which were 3, white, and circular, and then a red one came on and off, in a diamond pattern(three whites in the front, and red in the back).  There were also 2 constant white lights at the back of the aircraft.  We observed as many as 20-25 of these over the course of about an hour. Very clear night, full moon, all very visible.  They would usually go in parallel lines from east to west, normally in pairs of some distance apart.  One was seen going straight up out of the west sky, rather than toward us and overhead.  It did this at a very rapid speed, more than the others going from west to east. We were under the impression we were possibly watching military aircrafts until we saw the one going in a totally unpredicatable pattern.  No sounds were heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It then moved about, performing rapid sawtooth patterns and &#34;normal&#34; linear movements and pauses. I called a family member to bring some binoculars. With them the object still looked like a star, red in color and of constant radiance. I lost the object as it moved lower in the sky and blended with the haze of the city lights. Having a masters in physics, and having worked 7 years in aerospace on missile programs, I know of nothing man made that could have flown the pattern this thing did, pulling tremendous G&#39;s to reverse direction the way it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(State Hwy 170), July 2, &#39;04 at around 1815hrs. As I was approaching the entrance ramp to I-75 south, which was on my right, I was admiring the dramatic storm clouds ahead of me, as well as scanning for airborne anomalies; I spotted a dark dot among the clouds. It was moving uncharacteristically fast for a conventional aircraft, zipping from left to right in my field of view. I grabbed a digital camera that I keep with me at all times now, and started taking pictures. I took the first pic through my windshield just before I hit the on ramp. As I drove down the ramp going south onto the highway, I took another pic, through the driver&#39;s side window. I just pointed the camera and snapped the picture without looking through the viewfinder, obviously, since I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had traveled approximately one mile when I took the third pic out the driver&#39;s side window. I lost sight of the object, but did not dare look up too long for fear of running off the road. I took the next two pics through my windshield hoping to catch something even though I could not take my eyes off the road. I did not pull off to the side because I was in the left lane and I did not want to be late for work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance traveled from the taking of the first pic to the last is around 2.5 to 3 miles and the time interval around three minutes. The camera is an hp Photosmart 315 digital, a fairly cheap camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I experienced no electrical disturbances with my vehicle or radio. No one else seemed to notice what I saw, but it was a very busy time of day for traffic. I was too busy negotiating the road to experience any emotional or psychological phenomena. However, I did get a cold chill Sunday morning when I looked at pics and saw what I had captured. In two of the photos I took, there are distinctive disk-shapes. This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen something anomalous in the skies over my sleepy little community, but this is the first time I&#39;ve been able to record an image.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it would turn solid green and wip through the sky like nothing on this earth even military aircrafts. then in a matter of 4-5 sec it would turn solid red then stop on a dime. start and stop it repeated the same thing for about 45. min i missed the last half of my movie because of it. it also hovered around the sky moving very slow at times and moved closer to us very close, at one point it was hovering right over our heads. back and forth i followed this object flying back and forth the shy wipping through the sky like a line of fire. it then made it&#39;s way totally east and began to slowly fall from the sky moving down past the tree&#39;s and out of my view. all i know is that after i lost my view about 5 min later, a fire truck, ambulance, police car were seen and heard driving like mad down the only road that was beside us toward it. it seemed like it was chasing it or someone called it in or reported an accident or something. all i know that it was like nothing i&#39;ve ever seen before and i spend alot of time watching thee sky before and more now. i&#39;ve seen a few things that are unexplainable..  thany you<n>

Now as the two of us were stargazing, I happened to notice a particularly bright star, which was not quite static. In fact, it made a motion, as if it were moving in circles. The motion was relative to the other stars, not the vessel. It then moved to the left, eventually obscured by a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I’m not a pilot, engineer, or doctor, but it’s my best guess that &#34;star&#34; had to be rather far away to be behind a cloud and only a gleam with no form.

As all of our attention was on this plane, we all spotted another object, much higher in the sky, which was in the same line of sight.  It looked about the same size as the high altitude plane, despite apparently being much much higher.  It looked white and moved about 1/20 the speed of the normal looking plane (very slow).  Our impression was that it was so high, it might have been the International Space Station.  However, upon looking up the current location of satellites and the station on NASA&#39;s public J-Track website, the station was actually over Africa and no satellites were overhead at this time at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved so slowly in the sky that I was able to run inside and grab some low power field glasses I keep in my office.  As the object moved slowly in the sky in north by northwest direction we were able to watch it for about 5 minutes. Under the field glasses it looked like two large globes with a large metallic connector.   The size must have been enormous considering the extremely high altitude we observed it to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wind speed and direction at the time as reported by the O’Hare weather station was due West 8mph.  Although I know wind speed and direction at very high altitudes can differ dramatically, this is clearly at odds with speed and somewhat at odds with the direction of the object we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The soft, wispy clouds I referred to had the dispersed chem-trail look to them familiar to us in IL.  Depending on the object’s size, it may have been at or just above that altitude.  Can anyone offer an explanation? Perhaps chem.-trail related? Perhaps a secret DoD blimp of enormous size as has been reported to exist?<n>
