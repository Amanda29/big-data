It was perhaps 10 meters in diameter (30 feet).  No sound emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see it clearly and close at about 500 meters away from us.  My dad looked at it with binoculars but could not discern a mass on it, the light hurt his eyes like the sun does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes about 5 or 6 other smaller spheres came out of it.  They lit up the water!<n> <n><n> <n><n> In time they lined up parallel to shore and began moving in our direction over the water, not touching it.  They stopped on shore right in front of us, very close at a distance of about 160 meters or less.  They just stood there, shining, we got very scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad and his friend (both psychologists who worked for the Uruguayan government) thought it prudent to leave the beach in a hurry back on our way home.  We did!.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad and his friend could never find an explanation for what we saw that night.  It was a very traumatic experience!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It’s so long ago, I’m not sure of the exact year, possibly 1973.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wentto attend a little nightclub there.  It was about 11:00 on a summer night when I parked in the parking lot of the club, walked across the dark lot and looked up, and saw lights in the sky.  There were six white lights flying in vee formation at a very great altitude, like satellites, which I had seen many times in Arizona.  They came up over the hill of the horizon, and flew towards the ocean. There was a light at the tip of the vee, but missing one light at the end of one arm of the vee.  They were bluish white, like medium bright stars, and they made no sound, and flew halfway across the arc of the sky in only about ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I felt ecstatic and began to leap up and down with my arms outstretched.  They blinked off and vanished all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I assumed that they were six separate objects.  In those days there was no talk of giant vee shaped craft.  It didn’t occur to me that anything could be so large but I was still puzzled as to how they could fly in such unwavering precision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in 1973 is approximate.

And distance, i assume it was more then a mile away, maybe several miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So to my judgement  it must have been the size of a house, possibly larger .<n> <n><n> <n><n> i remember leaning to with my back to the car, eyes riveted to that thing for almost one hour, till it shrunk the size of the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that altitude it  appeared shifting in all directions, but i assume that was due to the atmosphere, or my eyes being tired concentrating on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this is what i saw, and to this day i havent found an explenation. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also  would like  to mention that  i dont believe in UFO&#39;s , at least in the 90++% of the materiel thats being reported ..<n> <n><n> <n><n> but what i saw that evening was big and it was real.(at lest to me it was)  Jeff was urging his audience to report things, so here is my story .<n> <n><n> <n><n> and it is NOT a hoax!!! lol  Oh! almost forgot..    the next day i took my friend Rudy and his gf to the site and we wondered for hours thru bushes, tall grasses and  along the Mures riverbank, but didn&#39;t see anything unusual .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say at times i kinda felt a bit embarrassed  .. :-)  this isen&#39;t easy to tell people, so therefor i mostly kept it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> regards, ((initials deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

When they pulled over they both got out of the car.  I&#39;m not sure who saw it first, but they saw a triangular shape hovering close to them it had flashing lights (white light on all tree points and a red in the middle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later it shot out a white light in front of it and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both got back in the car and drove away.  My brother and I were born shortly after the the incident and my mother told me afterwards (almost dying of a c-section) when she awoke (dream state or awake, unknown) the walls were bright white and see through.  Black shadows apeared behind the wall, they were trying to get through is what it looked like to my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Than a few moments later they were gone and my father was standing in the doorway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

It was summertime . A group of us kids used to play cards on the playground or sometimes at a neighborhood pizza parlor. This night we were at the pizza place sitting at a table by the window . It was about 6:00 - 7:00 when we arrived and it was still light out.Looking out the window directly to the east we all saw a bright light just above the horizon . My first thought was  this is a star of some kind but much brighter than any other star I have seen . It kind of flickered at times but stayed at the same place &amp; maintained the same intensity for about 2 hours .I thought during this time it must be a plane coming this way but It never really seemed to move at all.At dusk some of the group left.Two of us remained and we went to sit on the steps outside . The light seemed even brighter now being darker out but seemed to be in the same place. I mentioned something about the light to my friend &amp; we both looked at the same time. Just then the light sped north and then made a perfect right angle turn straight up &amp; gone!This happened in a split second &amp; it had to be going very very fast. I have been told it was probably a meteor.I cannnot guarantee this was a UFO but i feel it was .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It got our attention because there were no wings! We watched as it moved towards the South. As it passed over us, it stopped and rotated to what appeared to be a vertical position &amp; began to glow brightly for several seconds (minutes?). Altitude was at least many hundred (thousand?) feet as it was above the surrounding mountains. Eventually it rotated back to a horizontal position and moved off away from us to the Southeast. This was a distinct directional change from the original path it had been taken. During this entire event, there was no sound - another thing that we found odd. Several weeks (months?) later, I remember my parents discussing a strange burned circle in the yard, in almost the exact location where my mother &amp; I had been standing. Seems like it was roughly 10&#39; in diameter but that could be innaccurate based on the memories of a 7 or 8 year girl from more than 30 years ago! It was several years before grass grew again in that location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed coming from the north a sphere very high up heading towards the south east, because it was so high it took quite some time to cross the sky. Then we noticed another coming from the east, at a right angle, at about the same altitude (very high up).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two shperes came together, looking like a figure eight, almost appearing to be right above us. They remained together for at least ten to fifteen minutes.  They then separated and the one coming from the north continued to the south east and the other went straight back towards the east.  This was a Saturday afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Sunday newspaper there were reports that others had seen the same thing.  Rhodesian Air Force had received reports but had no comment.  They were not birds or aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a child in the 50&#39;s, I remember my uncle who drove a truck that picked up corn from farms saying that early one morning out in the countryside he had had a frightening experience when a large light appeared behind his truck, it was a dark night, the light followed him for some time then flew at very high speed over his truck and disappeared up into the sky.  There had been two black workers riding on the back of the truck when it happened and they were absolutely terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also in the 50&#39;s my grandmother, a no nonsense type of woman, had also seen a UFO from her house early one morning.  These were times before any jet aircraft were common in African countries. Granny&#39;s UFO was also reported by a number of people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was only 4 years old when this happened and did not witness it myself although I was present for the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started at my grandmothers’ home which was just a quarter mile NW of ours.  My family owned a 90 acre ranch in the NW section of the county and both homes were on the same property.  My grandparents and my dad had lived on the property for about 13 years and my mother and I had just moved to the property after she married my dad.  Most of the property was cleared but we were surrounded by a thick forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 2 am one morning my grandmother got up to use the bathroom and as she was going back to bed she saw a very bright light outside her bedroom window facing east toward the front of the house, the bedroom was in the southeast corner of the home.  She didn&#39;t know what it was so she went to her kitchen window also facing east to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She described an intense light hovering above the ground at the tree tops and moving toward her house from the east.  She said it was very bright and lit everything up like daylight and she said there was a high pitched whistling/whooshing sound that was so loud she had to cover her ears.  She watched as the light moved up and over her house to the west when it suddenly disappeared.  The light and the sound were just suddenly gone and she did not see it anywhere in the sky when she walked outside to look for it.  My grandfather never woke up and has no recall of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the same time my parents were awakened by a high pitched whistling/whooshing sound and the whole house shaking violently.  My mother said the house was shaking so bad that the mirrors on her closet doors were rattling violently and she thought they were going to break.  She said the sound was incredibly loud and she and my dad had to cover their ears and shout to each other to be heard.  They made their way to my room and found me sleeping soundly as though nothing was going on.  They could not see an object but said it was circling the house incredibly fast and making that horribly loud sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They said after a few minutes the atmosphere changed and it became very difficult for them to breathe and they felt like they were in a vacuum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They said all of this lasted about 10 to 15 minutes when suddenly everything stopped.  The sound, the vacuum and the violent shaking just stopped as though it had never happened.  They told me that neither of them was able to get back to sleep that night and they never knew what it was that had caused all of the ruckus.  I have no recall of anything related to this event and I never experienced anything like it in all the years that I lived there and my parents never had another experience after this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe in &#34;little green men&#34;, aliens or extraterrestrial beings but I know something happened that night I just don&#39;t know what caused it to happen.<n>

It was red, blue, green, yellow, and pink.  It was shaped like a see thru box.  Like a 3-D one you would draw on a paper as an optical illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So here goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a high school senior with my boyfriend and another couple driving out one summer night to my boyfriend&#39;s family farm.  As we approached a hill near the farm I noticed a very bright light ahead of us up the hill slowing moving across the road.  It was so bright and unusual that we pulled over, stopped the engine and watched.  Scary as it might seem now, we were just in awe of what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In what seemed like eternity the object made its way across the road almost directly in front of us just above the tree tops with no sound at all coming from it.  By this time the object, which my memory now thinks of as a fat (in height) oval, was not as bright.  We had also at some point gotten out of the car just staring at it, not believing what we were seeing.  And there were maybe 3 or 4 other cars that had stopped and parked as well on both sides of the road watching the same event, but I don&#39;t recall talking to any of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how long we stood there, but the thing I remember most is that the object made absolutely no sound and just hovered there with some kind of colored and white lights revolving on the top very slowly.  I felt then and still do now that whatever it was, it knew we were there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object started very slightly backing up away from us.  Just a moment later it backed away much faster then stopped again.  Before we could blink it was gone!  A massive object was a small dot in a matter of seconds!  Gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is amazing to think of today is that everyone watching that night just got back in their vehicles and left without a word!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

But I know that the event that took place was witnessed by my stepfather ((name 1 deleted)), my half-brother, ((name 2 deleted)), and myself, ((name 3 deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After talking to my step father a few yrs. ago we talked about the UFO that we saw in Kentucky,  It was in the month of June 1973, we were driving to a friend’s house at around 5pm.  My mother and sister was there and we were going there to pick them up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving we saw a large ship overhead, and it hovered over us, the whole way to town. (Mount Sterling, KY), this ship was huge, all we could see is the bottom of the ship.  It was lit up with all kinds of lights, different colors.  Flickering off and on, all the lights flickered in different speeds, it was like red would flash one time, and then blue lights would flash, and as we could tell there were about 6 different colors of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ship was about one hundred feet of the ground and to this day,  I cannot believe how the ship did not fall to the earth.  It was just there, over the car, moving over us as we moved in the car.  There was not beams of light, no rays or sound that we could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove into town, we saw people all over looking up at the craft.  People were on the streets, standing alongside the road, sidewalks, by their cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And when we arrived at our destination, the ship stopped and after a few minutes, the craft took off.<n>

My father had this central fan that sucked air from the outside in and I remenber the window was open and cool night air coming in and it was plesant so it had te be late winter to early fall  or in between being in Weslaco Texas(Tip of Texas).  I remember looking out towards the open field and there was a lone tree directly in the middle of this 4 to 5 acre field with the cemetary across on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must of been about 9 to 13 years old. I remember looking up at the sky as I pressed my face up against the screen window. and I saw what look like the Lubbock lights, the old thing is that I remember the V shape with lights in a single formation of 2 rows with single lights making the V formation.  It did not make a single sound. I was amazed and just remember it here and there. My kid is in college and brought it up, and that is how I came to this web sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remember the lights being sort of white to off white. It was not going slow of fast, so I don&#39;t recall a speed, but it was easy to follow till it was out of my sight.  It just went in a straight line from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/15/73 22:30|San Jose|CA|Triangle|15min+|triangles made of 9 lights--no object seen|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50566.html|18|ndxe197306| triangles made of 9 lights--no object seen<n> <n><n> <n><n> I submitted an account of this event two or three years ago. It apparently was not received, as it is not in the website database. Since that submission, my recollection of the event has improved and therefore changed somewhat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a recollection of a sighting of unknown lights in an unusual pattern sometime in the early 1970&#39;s, perhaps 1973 or 1974. I have tried to remember details and circumstances as accurately as possible. I am no aviation expert but I have grown up around aircraft, living near Reid-Hillview Airport, well before it was purchased by Santa Clara County and became a FSS, and I was acquanted with the former owner, his daughter and her family, as well as others who worked there or had tiedowns or hangars, so I know more than a little bit about aviation. There are some explanations for those who are unfamiliar with aviation as well as to explain why I do not believe that the lights belonged to any ordinary aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early 1970&#39;s I was at home during a late spring or summer evening and looked up to see nine orange/amber lights arrayed in three equilateral triangles which were themselves arrayed as one large equilateral triangle. Each orange light was at the point, or vertex, of each small triangle which themselves were at the points of the larger triangle, nine lights in all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was warm and the smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen. There was no moon. Typically, above the smog, I am told there is a strong Westerly wind in the evening and into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The array maintained perfect equilateral triangles as it headed roughly north-northwest in a straight line, It appeared to move slowly, like a light airplane but seemed to be silent. I watched the lights closely for some time, from when it was almost overhead, as it passed overhead and then was lost in the smog and reflected city lights somewhere over the north part of the city, trying to see the outline of some object and watching the lights to see if any moved independently, as well as for any lateral drift. I never could see any object, just the lights, none of the lights moved relative to the others and no lateral drift was observed. I estimated it could be seen for at least fifteen minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The array was unusual as no navigation lights were seen: No red, no green, no white, no strobe or flashing lights of any kind, just steady orange/amber lights, which I realised later had the same color as low-pressure sodium street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what aircraft look like in the sky at night, as I lived next to a small civil airport at that time and lived directly under the southbound departure route for the city&#39;s major airport and I often watched aircraft go over, trying to guess what kind it was. Sometimes, because of the smog, all that can be seen are the navigation lights. I have never seen such lights on any aircraft before or since. It occurred to me that the aircraft might have been some of the new SR-12&#39;s recently made public but the lights never moved relative to each other, they never drifted from course and there were no navigation lights, as would be required near the airports under VFR rules.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no engine noise. At the time, jet engines were still quite loud and some DC9&#39;s, 727&#39;s and 737&#39;s, as well as DC8&#39;s from Mexico were still using turbojets instead of the quieter fans. Neither turbine nor piston engines were heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The array was viewed through smog which reflected the streetlights so there was only a view of the orange/amber lights. No solid object was seen, no reflections. The smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen, neither could any aircraft from either airport. But somehow those lights could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the smog,  the exceptionally slow speed and the lack of any visible shape I could not determine the altitude or the size of the object or objects attached to the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked around to see if anyone else had seen the aray of lights; no one had. The FAA and the local newspaper both pointedly expressed their lack of interest in the event. It remained forgotten until I saw another very unusual sky object while in Monterey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was lying back on the hood of my car just looking up at the sky. I saw what was either 12 seperate objects or 1 big one. There were 12 blue lights in a triangular formation flying at about 3 times treetop level. There was no noise at all. I was sure that no one would ever believe me and was very exited when 2 guys came running up the street yelling &#34;Did you see that?&#34; They had been chasing it for several blocks. That should give you an idea of it&#39;s speed. It moved slowly away at a steady pace and headed directly towards Langley Air Force Base, which was only several miles away by air. Having grown up in the area, I knew what planes looked like in flight and usually paid them no mind. This was not any type of conventional aircraft. I tend to think it was only 1 craft with multiple lights as I could not see the stars between the lights. If it was multiple objects, they were no more than several feet in width. I had never seen anything like it before or since that night. I would love to know what it was and will never forget it. There was no mention of anyone else sighting it on the news or in the papers, although it must have been seen by many others. This was almost 30 years ago and to my knowledge there is still no aircraft that resembles it in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

She looked out and across from our house, above the treeline she noticed something strange so she called out to me to have a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a friend over and we both looked out the window as she pointed out a stationary light above the trees on the mountain across from our house.  To me it just looked like a star, perhaps just a little bigger or brighter than an average star, but just a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told us that the light had been moving and it had flashed different colors. I think she said it had changed to red and blue.  But it was just a normal white star color and stationary when my friend and I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out onto our porch to get a better look, but it still just looked like a normal star and it wasn&#39;t moving.  Further, there was no sound. Well, that&#39;s not true.  There was the normal sound of a clear, windless summer night in south-eastern Kentucky: a million frogs and insects, but that was a prime indicator of normalcy. If there actually was silence, it was time to get scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as we we about to go back to whatever we were doing previously, the &#34;star&#34; started slowly moving to the left and my mom gave me that &amp;quot;told you so&amp;quot; look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t tell you how far it moved, since I don&#39;t really know how far away it was, but as a guess, if the object was directly over the trees across from us, at least 100 feet.  Then it just stopped again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it moved, it moved slowly, silently and perfectly horizontally without any vertical motion.  There was no inertia to its motion when it started moving or when it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I distinctly got the feeling we were being watched and I suggested we go back inside (a fact my mom brought up every time she recounted the story over following decades).<n> <n><n> <n><n> From inside the house, we watched the light for a few more minutes and then it slowly descended out of sight (or flew directly away from our house which I think would have looked the same).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw any other colors of light than white, but I believe my mom did. I don&#39;t think that the object I saw would have ever caught her attention otherwise as she always had sheer curtains over her windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Within a few minutes I noticed a craft pass directly overhead at an estimated altitude of 200-300 feet.  At the time I was a ((rank deleted)) in USAF working in flight ((deleted--involves flight activities)).  I had been in USAF about ((duration deleted)) years at that time and had worked with aircraft for about 7 years and could identify most of USAF flying inventory at that time.  After the craft passed over I told the girls that I hoped that that EC-121 was not in trouble and did not crash because he was way too low for normal flight.  My first impression was that it was a USAF EC-121 Radar Picket airplane which were stationed at McClellan AFB.  These planes were 1930&#39;s era Lockheed Super Constellations.  As we steped back into the house the program we had been watching had been prempted by a local newsbreak.  An unidentified craft had been reported in the Fair Oaks, Citrus Heights areas.  Upon reflecting on what we had seen I realized that there had been no engine sounds.  An EC-121 at 300 feet, assuming not all engines were out, would have been deafening directly over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my contention that the brain does not immediately misidentify objects which it cannot readily identify; but initially attempts to identify such objects as a known object.  When I ponderd why I initially identified the craft as a 121 a number of clues came forward.  It appeared to be a medium gray color in the bright moon light the 121&#39;s at the base were painted gray.  It appeared to have a wing; however upon reflection I could not recall a fuselage, only a wing.  It appeared to have portholes with light emmanating from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the excellent report!  Given your credentials as a USAF military officer, the report is particularly interesting to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If possible, I would like to pin down the date with somewhat greater accuracy.  Is there any way you could reconstruct the date, do you think?  For example, do you remember the program you were watching, by any chance?  Also, do you happen to recall the station you were watching that broadcast the news report?  Do you remember the phase of the Moon, perhaps?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do your daughters remember the incident, by any chance?  If so, would they be willing to submit independent reports of their recollection of the event?  We have observed that different witnesses recall different details about an object, and all those facts help in understanding what was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, could you provide us with an illustration of the object you saw?  If your daughters could do the same, we would be happy to post them with your reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would very much like to help pin down the date but all I remember was that I am fairly certain it was in the summer and it was not oppressively hot that night as I recall so I believe it to have been May or June and the moon was full as I recall.  I am fairly sure of the year because we bought the house in summer of 1972 and I resigned my commission in ((month deleted)) 74 and I was working ((location deleted--West Coast)) by Summer of 74.  I put the patio in subsequent to the first summer we were there.  I have not a clue as to program or channel we were watching I am fairly certain it was one of big three ABC, CBS, NBC.  I have talked to my daughters about the incident in the past and they vaguely recall it but primarily because I have brought it up not because in left an impression upon them.  The image in my mind is of a wing with portholes with light emanating from them.  I can sketch such for you and email it.  I had another incident which took place at my parents home in a small village called ((town name deleted)), NY in early July 1978; I will submit it sometime.  At this time I am sort of busy moving my possessions from Maryland to Northern NY; have been at it for about 4 months.  I am heading back to MD within a day or so to pick up another load and drag it up here.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My sister-in-law was visiting and we were out in the back yard checking out the planets and stars.  I told her to look at that little &#34;star&#34; next to Jupiter.  It had not been there on my last turn to look through the scope. We took turns observing it when all of a sudden it started moving and I exclaimed,  &#34;It&#39;s not a star, it&#39;s moving.  It must be a plane but I have never seen a plane that high up in the sky.&#34;   She took her turn to look and the thing was moving fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We shortly could see it quite clearly without the scope and we stood out in the yard with our heads up to the sky watching this thing zoom through the sky.  Some of my neighbors noticed this and heard us and came out to see what the commotion was all about.  It kept getting bigger and bigger and came right over my house and hovered.  It never made a sound but it was huge. I had a 4-bedroom ranch house and the thing was as big as the house.  We all stood there awestruck, no one saying a word, when I finally said &#34;what the hell is it&#34;?   One of my neighbors was an older man and he said, &#34;I was in the Coast Guard for 25 years and all I know is it&#39;s nothing of ours.&#34; \<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house and called information to get the number to Scott Air Force Base.  I called them and a man answered.  I told him everything. I asked him if anyone else had reported this and he said &#34;Hey, lady. What are you drinking&#34;?   I told him I wasn&#39;t drinking, that there were 6 other people besides myself who were with me and I didn&#39;t care if he believed me or not.  He said, &#34;Calm down, lady, calm down.  We have had lots of reports tonight but we don&#39;t know what it is. We&#39;re checking it out.  There is nothing from Scott Air Base that fits that description.&#34;   He then proceeded to take my name, address, phone #, etc. and said that someone would be contacting me.  No one ever did call or contact me in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slammed down the phone and ran back outside to join the others.  The thing was still there.  It was huge, had a domed top and windows (I guess) all around because we could see light coming from the inside.  It looked metallic against the night sky.  It just sat there hovering, not making a sound and finally started to move slowly away and then instantly (like woosh) shot off and disappeared.  After it was over we just milled around, talking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just shocked.  It was an awesome, unforgettable experience.  I have asked myself a thousand times why no one thought to go get a camera.  To tell you the truth, I didn&#39;t even think about a camera that night. I don&#39;t think anyone else did either. We all just stood staring at that thing and there wasn&#39;t a sound out of anyone until I wondered out loud, &#34;what the hell is it?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and children and I moved into the Westglen Woods subdivision in December, 1970. It was a brand new area of new homes. We lived at ((address deleted)) Drive. There were no large trees to block our view, just open sky. It was a warm night, clear night. Houses were on 1/3 of an acre. My children were sleeping and my husband was out with a group of his friends at a local school gym where they played volleyball.I was 28 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

They were often moving to each other and back and when a car would drive by they would move toward the cars . I remember the children on the  school bus on the way to work had inspired us to see this odd appearance in the sky. It was often a nighty watch of hours of lights outside in the sky. My sister was older than me. My father said we were only watching weather balloons and would go back inside our home after he would check on our excitement of the nightly lights following each other and at times cars. We became so fasinated with the objects that my mother would start to come home after work and join in observing this strange array of moving lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening has haunted my memory the most. We never usually spoke of the scary experiance after it happened. ..I had run upstairs to get a better view of the lights from the 2nd story window of our rented house. Suddenly the cat jumped off my brothers bed..cows started mooing , every animal in the area made noises of alarm...<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the time a huge saucer shaped ufo appeared out of the sky and was so close I feared for my life. It was very odd and the noise it fineally made was more like a whooping sound very slow and paced. I never forgot the feeling in my heart when it made the noise. My mother and sister never usually talk about it. I was around 13 at the time and am now 42 almost 43 years old. When I asked my mother the other day if she remembered the experiance she even was able to recall the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is something when people look at you if you even whisper you know there are strange saucers in the sky...and you know what you saw. So, all I can do is state to this report today that there were 3 of us. ...We saw it as close as you see your neighbors house if you live next to anyone close...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was spooky and years later when I fineally saw a movie called close encounters I could fineally realize someone else has seen something..The saucer in the movie is larger than what we saw , but almost a perfect match. The lights went around the object making it look like it was spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to be afraid to be alone....I know that people will one day see something in the sky....and I can only hope they don&#39;t have the nightmares I have had in my lifetime. The occourance was one I know will never forget ..it is something that stays with you. I remember the tops of the trees swaying when it passed...Then the saucer shaped thing left as it had arrived...It really was beautiful. But it was also very spooky. I am glad we left the country farm home after that..I am so very glad I now live in a town 5 miles down the road within reach of friendly neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, on nights I look up and name a star..remembering the time a ufo came to Medaryville, Indiana....and I am so happy I don&#39;t live in the country anymore. I never will again..Not after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first it was motionless then very quickly it went left and stopped with precision. At this time is when a second similar object moved very fast next to it. They both were motionless then after a few seconds the first object went upwards very fast, while the second one went left then straight upwards. These objects were very precise and fast. I was only a kid at the time but remember it pretty well. I now reside in Punta Gorda, FL near FT Myers where I just read about the latest sighting reported to you.

It was early evening, and as I watched him turn a lap I noticed what I first thought to be a KC-135 heading to the north over the typical Mac Dill AFB runway path. The object made a gentle wooshing sound, was approximately 300-500 feet in length, and moved slowly (est. 25-50 mph) at an altitude of approximately 1,000&#39;. I pointed to the object hoping my friend would see it, but he was enjoying his go-kart ride and did&#39;nt look. The metallic object literally seemed to vanish as it slowly continued northward. I am very familiar with aircraft, military, commercial, private, and balloons-- this was not any of them.<n>

My mother and I were sitting on the well deck (a deck around a well) behind my grandmother&#39;s house.  The house bordered highway 72.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw to the east a saucer shaped object in front, leading a large cigar shaped object.  Both were headed north toward Chattanooga, Tenn.  They were about 3,500 feet or less high.  Moving at about 200 to 300 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both were approximately three to four miles from my location.   Both moving over Sand Mountain from the south moving to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening there were many reports on the Chattanooga news of UFO sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only speculate at the exact month and date.  I know it was warm enough to be outside.  So April to October of 1973.<n>

Rotating slowly in a clockwise direction it slowly rose to a hovering position about two hundred feet off the ground, it began rotating faster and faster and began emitting a fiery orange glow from the undercarriage, suddenly it shot straight upwards almost out of sight and returned to an unknown height in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting motionless for a few seconds it suddenly manoeuvred in zig zag motions and made instant right and left turns at rapid velocities, it streaked back and forth across the sky then it rapidly disappeared into the north east mountainous region.

It was traveling at less than 50 mph. The coast is dark at that point, and the city lights made the lower to upper areas visible. There were rectangular windows with rounded corners. A very light pinkish light shown in the windows. No markings. It traveled inland, east, for about 10 seconds and then made a slow (flat) 45 degree turn north and with a 20 degree rise flew another 10 seconds and then with an abrupt rise of 70 degree, increased speed and quickly disappeared into the night sky. If this object was infact an airplane or jet, I would have seen the tail section with a flat reflection, not, a cigar to oval end reflection. I viewed this object at approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile distance. I have been in construction all of my life and I know how to judge distance, shape, reflection, degrees, and travel speed. This object broke all the laws of physics. Did I mention, I stopped the car on the side of the road and opened the door and stepped out with one foot and listened for sound? There was no sound at all. None. No high tention line electrical type buzz, no jet like sound, no prop or motor noise, no nothing. I, of course, thought that it might be a blimp, but it was about 300&#39; long, 30&#39; high. This is not a cross section of any blimp I have ever seen of heard of. Besides, if this was an extraordinarly shaped blimp, why was there no motor or prop sound? Even a blimp makes a slight roll when it turns. The turn I observed was flat as a pancake. Also, I have never heard of a blime making a rise of 70 degrees, nor, pick up speed as rapidly as the object in question. If there is a logical explination for the occurance, I am all ears.<n>

and i looked at it,,, AND IT WAS NOT THE MOON!! it was some sort of gasious ball of light,, it overall was,, like i said,, if you just saw it out of the corner of your eye,, and didnt actually look right at it,, you would have easily have mistaken it for the moon. but i caught something moving within it,, so that is when i looked right at it,, it was not the moon, it was moving,, up,, then down,, then up,, then down a little farther, then up,, the drop a little farther, slowly desending,, behind the mountain top,, i got a very good look at it,, it had a &#34; erie, gasious, moving center, it had a brighter outer ring, around it, it was solid,, you really had to look at it to disginguish these features. again,, i thought it was the moon,, once i noticed it was moving,i knew it was not. i yelled to my dad,, my mother,, and my brother,, &#34; look mom,, look,, !!! because it was decending behind the mountain,, my mom saw it,, she said to my dad,,bill. there&#39;s something up there! my father was driving,, and we were winding up the canyon,, he did not see it. this is not some sort of flying saucer,,, this was some sort of gasious ball of light,, some sort of natural,, or maybe made man thing,, i once saw a program that said that the rocky mountain arsinal pumped a bouch of mustard gass, and all sorts of chemical waste into the ground, and the gasses from this are now comming up through the old mine shafts in the blackhawk,, central city area, as this area is litteraly is like swiss chese with these old mine shafts. i do not believe this theory,, my brother and i stuyded the skys after this,, although we were scared to even look at the sky for a long time. but we have never seen anything else since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time in 1973 are approximate.

(i want to see if the remaining details of my sighting matches anyone elses) did anyone else witness this ufo in mechanicsburg pa or know of anyone who claims they did?  does the national ufo reporting center know of any info in regards to the above events that took place in silver spring township approx 25-30 yrs ago?  (it went on for days - my mother says many people claimed to see &#34;unexplained lights&#34; in mechanicsburg, but i want to know if anyone else had as close of an encounter as i did) i have a hard time believing my &#34;memory of this event&#34; myself, but i can not deny that it was real.

I was living in Brockton Massachusetts and I had an only child--ten years old at the time..and  I was living in an apartment complex in a small one bedroom apartment.  It was somewhere between 10 and 11 at night and I was watching television in my livingroom ..and this room had a picture window in it so that if I looked out of my window I would be able to see the lawn behind my building and also see a back shed for storage…This shed had lights on it so that the yard was lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well this particular evening I was watching television and sitting on my couch...my son was in his bedroom, when all of a sudden the television turned off.  Just went black.and at the same time, the lights in my apartment went out…I saw flashing lights  .alot of flashing goin on and I heard like a buzzing loud noise…didn’t understand what was going on so I arose from the couch to take a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw…all I can say is…I was stupefied……I  called to my son to come quickly to take a look…and as we stood in the window…we actually saw a spacecraft….or whatever it was…flying saucer? Land in our backyard.  It was perhaps 15 ft wide  and round and had some sort of dome on the top whereas it opened and  six or seven people….when I say people  I don’t know what they were but they looked like human bodies….there were 6 or seven of them that climbed out of this spacecraft and they all appeared to be wearing spacesuits with helmets on.  They were all working..by that I mean they were doing some kind of job…sort of like unloading something and lifting things and handing them to each other. I couldn’t tell what they were doing with this stuff or what it was that had them all working together..seemed a little frantic…like they were in a hurry…from what I can remember…  While my son and I were watching this..I remember thinking…I wonder if I could walk down the back stairway and open the back door so I could get a better look but was so afraid at that point that maybe I would be putting myself or my son in harms way that….I don’t know  cant remember anything about the rest of that night…and never spoke with anyone about what I saw for fear of being ostracized….It has been after all of these years…I am now 64 years old…and starting to remember more…of which is very disturbing to me…in no uncertain terms  I awoke this morning…and oddly remembered something about that night…that is most disturbing to me.  I do remember that at some point while I must have gone back to the couch…not sure about sequence…so much is all mixed up in my mind…but I now remember that my television came back on but it was not your regular television. I was the aliens that were on my television screen….and now that I remember what they showed me. I am mortified about the whole thing…. They showed me the destruction of the world…huge storms….devestation…showed me wars going on all over the world…showed me explosions…people being devastated by storms and fires and water and it was so horrific seeing all that on my television that night that I think somehow it was too much information  for my brain…I either got shut down somehow by them or they did something to my memory…..What I find odd is that I am only now starting to remember..and naturally…it is extremely unsettling and I wish with all my heart that I could talk with someone who knows and believes about these things happening..because when I try to talk about it…people thing you are crazy…they don’t believe me and I find that most disturbing.  I am a normal woman….I know I am not crazy…this has been such a burden to me in my life…never understanding what and why I saw this……I realize this is old information…very old…but I guess I need to talk with someone and found this site because of the internet…..

We thought a helicopter had flown too close to the lines that were supporting the tower, which is what my father, who was driving, initially exclaimed. As we neared, we saw it wasn&#39;t a helicopter, but was a dark &#34;kite shaped&#34; object, flattened, with the longer pointed end directed &#34;forward&#34;. The lites were underneath and moved around. As we drove even nearer, it began to follow or fly nearer to us, and we saw that it was huge, like maybe the size of a football field! It flew about the length of itself above us, sometimes faster and ahead (so it was visible to the front in the windshield) and sometimes in back, for several minutes as we continued down the road - dad had speeded up but I don&#39;t know how fast. At a certain point it was behind us and then suddenly swooped upward and away in seconds shooting into the sky. We were pretty freaked out. My sisters (2 younger) were with me in the back, but only vaguely remember it. My mom is not too willing to admit it either, because of her religious beliefs. Dad remembers it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Something caught my eye and I’d thought someone threw a Frisbee or pizza box over our car. I took a direct look at it and it was something entirely else! It was a large UFO, and it was headed towards the sea. But, it was only about 200’ above and it was about 75-90’ wide. My wife saw it too. It went right over the movie screen and then below the line of sight, hidden by the movie screen itself. You could see the shape due to the reflection of the city lights on the bottom of it. It had a curve to it. No sound whatsoever. Then, other people at the drive-in who saw it started honking their car horns!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/73 21:00|Austin|TX|Sphere|10-15 MINUTES|Played with by a UFO|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58418.html|46|ndxe197306| Played with by a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returning from an night practice low level photo training mission in a RF4C as we were nearing Austin, Texas, at as I remember around 15,000ft, I noticed in the distance a light that would instantaneously and abnormally change positions ahead and below me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my Weapons Systems operator behind me if he happened to notice that and he responded very positively that he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear and beautiful evening with no clouds and a bright moon.  I told my back seater that I would maneuver to try to intercept what ever it was doing that.  It wasn&#39;t long before what ever it was was seemed to be playing games with me for it would be here and there and when I would go towards where ever I thought it would be, it would be gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued this for maybe a few minutes and by this time were somewhere Northwest of Austin and somewhere around 10,000 to 15,000 for our directions and altitudes kept changing due to this light in the sky I was trying to catch up with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly in the distance before me the light made a tracking 180 degree turn and was obviously returning directly headon into us.  I made a comment to my back seater &#34;Damn &#34;___&#34; I think we&#39;ve pissed it off.  I pushed the stick rapidly forward to avoid what I thought surely was going to be a midair collision. The instant I knew we had avoided the collision, I immediately went into afterburning to initiate a high g turn for that really angered me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have just been my imagination, but as whatever it was we had just missed seem to give our aircraft a compression push downward.  That may have been from my own action of abruptly pushing the stick forward and then going into afterburner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To continue, craning my head back during the high g turn, there is no doubt to me I saw an eerie blue glow quickly fading away from me.  For a brief a moment I thought the thing was gone and my back seater and I began a rather spirited conversation about the preceeding events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made calls to other aircraft in flight as well as both control towers in the area, BUT none had seen anything unusual.  Had almost called it a night when we both saw what looked like a firey crash just off of Robert Mueller airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called the control tower, but they said that all was normal and they saw nothing.  We circled just north of the airport for we both confirmed with each other what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, from off the airport the way it went in, we saw a spectacular show of something shooting into the sky to the north.  I again called the control tower but they saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pushed the throttle forward and flew in the direction of the thing we saw leaving the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly before us and about over the city of Georgetown, the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life happened.  This thing we were pursuing stopped in mid air and lit up like with flashing lights and what looked like a classically described UFO, Oval in shape with portals and flashing and beaming lights coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My backseater and I confirmed together all we were seeing.  I told my back seater, as I remember, &#34;---&#34; this is too much. We need to bring this thing down -- it is too important to let it escape.  I am going to try to give it a glancing blow and think we will be ok, but be ready to eject if you have to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I again went into afterburner and aimed for that UFO.  It suddenly went completely dark and the next thing we knew, we watched as it left an almost vertical path upward and we knew at the speed it was going, there was nothing we could do about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few seconds it was gone and mixed in with the heavenly stars above.  Our fuel by this time demanded we land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not make a report.  What was there to report that just the 2 of us experiencedd???<n> <n><n> <n><n> YES, we are being monitored and examined by a superior existence somewhere in this Universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I saw a off white light high in the sky Going Northeast to Southwest (I am not sure on those directions).It sailed on by and I kept fishing. 15 minutes later another one floated by. I kept watching. About every 15 minutes an off white UFO would fly by unril I had counted seven of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When number seven appeared I became scared. The fishing was lousy. I left in a hurry and am glad to this day I did. There was nothing in the area that indicated danger but I had a sense that something was very wrong and I should leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was probably more than seven that night but I was not there to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

One evening we were entertaining several people and happened to look out over the city and saw a huge fireball coming directly toward the city from the mountains across the valley.  It was travelling slowly, in a straight line and appeared to hang over Bogota for quite a while.  We noticed on either side of the city, coming up just over the lip of the mountains, a craft which would travel vertically up and down as if checking on the ball.  The ball travelled backwards towards the far end of the valley, began to descend and changed from red to white while descending.  For a two week period after that, at the same time every evening, we would see three craft come up over the lip of the mountains and one would come in and hang over the city.  It would be there one minute, then blink out as if you had turned off a light switch, then come on again. It would do all kinds of crazy loops and turns.   It would always travel back to the mountains in a straight line, and when it would descend behind the mountain ridge, would start to change color.  I watched this for 2 weeks and never forgot it.  The fireball was so big is seemed to be right over the city and you could see the heat emanating from it.  We checked the papers the next day but there was no story.  We think we saw this because we happened to be living in a tall apartment building.  I have never forgotten it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Sort of dull like aluminum. It had no windows, portholes or anything hanging underneath it like a weather balloon does. Also no visible seams or bolts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a weather balloon. I know what weather balloons look like.

It was traveling horizontally, not going up like a balloon. It made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no lights on it and we watched it for approximately 7 to 10 minutes until it disappeared behind another ridge with trees.

MY sister and her two kids years later also saw a huge UFO just above hwy 101 at the marin county civic center.   The year of the sighting is based on best guess on my part recalling what she said.  On a side road above the hwy my sister was driving along when she was amazed to see a huge UFO below her hovring just over the hwy with traffic passing under it and no one appearing to notice the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She atopped the car and got out to look at it and could have easily bounced a tennis ball off of it.  The craft was making faint humming noise but no one else appeared to notice it.  As she and her kids watched black helicopters came over the hill and they chased the UFO around in ghe air over head above San Rafael.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the UFO took off flying north with the helicopters after it.  No one else still seemed to see the UFO.  Looking down on the hwy! traffic my sister thought what terrible fools they all were Years later black helicopters were involved in an attack on my sister<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the same time coming home late at night to my home in the deep woods I was surprized to hear deep heavy growls of a large animal in the dark.  I pulled my legally carried firearm and a dog whistle begain to blow recalling the animal.

No sound.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65772.html|55|ndxe197306| Hearsay (my granddad now dead) saw greenish light travelling above road (good visibility to road) for 2-3 minutes. No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is one old and &#34;hearsay&#34; report so ditch it if you wish. Anyhow I&#39;ve never told anyone but... Here&#39;s the thing:  My grandfather (now died) told me in early &#39;80&#39;s when I was very young, 10+ years of age, that he saw a green ball of light moving (following a road) towards &#34;south&#34; (see GPS/map I give later). I thougtht he was referring to late 70&#39;s or early 80&#39;s-it doesn&#39;t matter since no local paper gave confirmation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandmother did say (at the time granddad told me) &#34;don&#39;t tell him odd things&#34; and still my grandfather (known never to take any alcohol and/being totally sober from drugs also-I just mention this since drugs are common in some countries now-a-days) insisted on the sighting. He said it was nothing spectacular/odd, just a cigar-shaped 30/200cm ball of green light never seen by anything he had seen/read about. (He had nice library I quite liked it) and he was not least ashamed nor quiet about it if anyone asked. He even called local newspaper &#34;Etelä-Suomen Sanomat&#34; about it (next morning), but nobody else had seen it. So he really did not go to any trouble telling about it, just stated me the facts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first time hearing about it was when I read and told him (in dinner table, later) about advanced flight (I told stuff about &#34;planned aeroplanes 2 mach&#34; I&#39;d read in a book in his bookshelf-there were so many books... At my age I did not think he had had time to read them all-now I&#39;m sure he did not because I can say he never read/understood the german/russian/hungarian books in the shelves).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t make much of it at the time (nor anytime later since now), but you might be able to find out on our local newspaper ? (if You&#39;re interested, I still think it was marsh-gas, plasma, or equivalent natural though unknown phenomena). And poorly described. But it was obviously larger than a &#34;torch&#34; worn by persons/car/bike, nor did it &#34;sparkle&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location of the sighting was from north to south via road (above road, not touching it). Speed was nothing spectacular, just 50km/h or so. Like a fast moving car but there was nothing below it, and it just took the road(looked like it) since there were pines all around. Viewer lost sight when the road ended (up+south there&#39;s a T-intersection-both sides left&amp;right and up(even steeper hill) had lots of pines and some leafy trees) and not a clue which way the thing took off. If it&#39;d taken up it&#39;d have been seen against Salpausselkä, so obviously it took of right/left or disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Terrain: There is very old granite hills East (spelling?) but some very deep ditches of marsh (North) and there a never-drying lake with no river out. I can draw if google doesn&#39;t provide/if you insist, the landscape is&#39;nt too different today I could take a picture if I thought it made any difference... It should be obvious in google maps ?  All the area around is max 100mx100m private properties, each one with one house. Odd nobody else reported seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He especially stated there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ---Below here is for personal/documentation usage only, please--- The location will tell my/grandfater/etc personality to people in town so anything below is not for public review: http://www.02.fi/kartta/m%C3%A4yr%C3%A4nkatu+5/lahti  My granddad was watching the item move from north Purokatu (viewed from Mäyränkatu) to south purokatu, lost the item view close/before purokatu-kiveriönkatu intersection. View to the first end (looking right-hand) of the sighting is blocked by lots of birches, so he propably saw it from the intersection of mäyränkatu/purokatu towards south (near road). There&#39;s an opening, a small pond, so it is not sure the light followed road, but behind that opening there&#39;s a very tall hill so it was between the hill and the viewer. The hill curves back towards road rising so the thing was seen either back on the road or going all the way the road. Finally it went up the hill&amp;road towards the T-intersection near/where he lost view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry I did not proofread this report with any program, but I&#39;m not too interested in spelling mistakes. Also I do repeat things my granddad said with emphasis. This is the only &#34;odd&#34; story I heard from him (or I heard anyone else about him telling).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all I think this is just another swamp-gas/plasma thing-I just thought I&#39;d submit another unverifiable &#34;heard from someone of&#34; sighting... (oh, you can call the &#34;rather big&#34; newspaper about things near mäyränkatu/purokatu but you better send the email about the names while in phone-or have someone talking Finnish:). http://www.ess.fi/ &lt;- not even sure anyone recorded...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Toni K.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suchros_trashmail at hotmail.com Feel free to ask specific questions though I am not sure I can answer... Or want to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please do not contact my grandmother she&#39;s very old (oh yes, I do say THIS because otherwise you would bother her:she will confirm anything I say). If you prefer just dismiss this report rather than contact her. Other persons do not know (maybe my 2 uncles but I&#39;ve never asked-and anyhow they don&#39;t have 1st hand experience and one is a drunk).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I clicked &#34;aura&#34; around the object since it was floating and he said there was nothing below it-I figured out it&#39;s green glow reflected from the road and nearby objects... But this was only my thoughts, didn&#39;t think to ask about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ps: I have never seen UFO myself, not even sure where they come from, and my grandfather was in the war and did not tell stories about it at all, just stated it was horrible-&gt;do anything to avoid, even &#34;give some leeway to russians until country&#39;s in danger again&#34;... Still he did tell me this in a matter-of-fact stuff, he didn&#39;t believe in aliens or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Lived on Whidbey  Island.  My brother and I used to play in the woods right behind the elementary school (Oak Harbor Elementary).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular day it was hot and  as we were playing army I lost sight of my brother. So I started running while looking for him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember as I was running I felt like an electrical charge, all of my hair was standing up on my arms and my ears felt funny.  Almost like when you are up high in altitude. I looked to my left and I saw a 12 to 13 inch high humanoid running beside me on a log keeping up, and it turned its head and looked at me. The most horrifying thing was when it smiled. It had a really big mouth with a lot of teeth. It might have been small but I will never forget the terror I felt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately stopped and turned to run in the opposite direction when I felt something extremely cold, Large, square, hit my back and sent me flying about 10 feet through the air. It knocked me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I woke up, I went home and complained to my dad about my back. I was bruised with a black and blue square mark about half the size of my back. I never told my dad how I got the bruise, but it was so traumatic that to this day I will not go to far into the woods by myself. I always have to be able to see a clear path to my car. I have never gone back to those woods on Whidbey Island. I hope this helps in your quest for knowledge. I do believe something is there.

6/1/73 02:00|Folkston|GA|Light|3-4 houres|I left home in Macclenny Fla and drove north on rt. 23/121 into Georgia around 2am I came to a crossroads just out side of Folkston Ga.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32380.html|57|ndxe197306| I left home in Macclenny Fla and drove north on rt. 23/121 into Georgia around 2am I came to a crossroads just out side of Folkston Ga. It had been raining and was extreamly dark. At that time I was still on time, when I came to the cross-roads I took the same turn I always took on to rt. 252 going towards Brunswick Ga. I drove this route many times on my way to Kingsport NJ. to make deliveries. I was driving a tracktor trailer and was loaded with shower bases. As I drove up rt. 252 something seemed to change, things got really quite. The night seemed to become still and black my head lights were not going out as far as they normally did, I couldn&#39;t see very far in frount of me, and the amount of distance I could see seemed not to change.All of a sudden I came up to a singe in the road, it was the same one I had turned at about a half houre earlier. I thought that it might of been a differant cross-road, so I took rt.252 again, and drove for another half houre or so then I came to the cross-roads again. Then I figured that someone might of changed the signes, but I knew that I turned the right way, but that direction wasn&#39;t doing any good kept comming back to the same cross-roads.I stoped and looked at my map and picked a differant route to Brunswick,I desided to take rt.40 to Kingsland then take 17 up to Brunswick, I turned on to Rt. 40 and headed east on 40 for about half an houre and came back to the same cross-roads. It seemed strange that I hadn&#39;t met any other trucks or cars in all this time, I didn&#39;t know what to think, at first I was worried that I wouldn&#39;t make my drop in time, now I was worried that I wouldn&#39;t be able to go any whear and that I might be stuck in some kind of time warp or something weard like that. I tried the other routs from the Cross-roads and they all lead to the same place, the cross-roads. I really don&#39;t know how long I was in this loop but I was scared. I stoped the truck and got out , it was really strange because I could bearly hear the engin running on! the truck. It was as if it was muffled, and all around the truck was lit up it didn&#39;t seem like it came from a &#34;light&#34; the area around the truck was light enough to see the asphalt and the texture, but I could only see to a distance of about 20 feet then it was as if there was a wall of darkness out side, and it felt threatning. I was scared enough to kneel down on the road and pray that god would get me out of there. The tears were running down my cheeks as I prayed. Then I just got in the truck and started to drive this time things started to change my lights started to light up more and I could start making out things that I could remember.I headed up 252 and got into Brunswick pulled into the truck stop, and knew I was running late, as I walked in the waitress said hello as if nothing was wrong, I looked at the clock and it said 3;00 oclock right on time I wasn&#39;t behind at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

6/1/73 00:00|Bentonville|AR|Other|hours|Was I abducted in 1973????????????|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20062.html|58|ndxe197306| Was I abducted in 1973????????????<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was only 5 or 6, but was awakened some how and I saw what seemed to be a square shaped somthing with several different colored lights on the outside, the next thing I knew I was with this strang looking something (not the usual described alien)  We did things together  but do not remember much of what happened but when I&#39;d tell my parents about it they said I was dreaming it, I did&#39;nt.  Then after this night I would have strange dreams of being squeezed or a feeling of being squeezed and a strange noise that would awake me screaming.  I also remember having earaches and hearing a sound in my mind every now and then, I still today hear this sound in my mind.  My most wanted to know question is- does any one else have this occur?  I also seem to know things before they happen but it comes automatically, I can&#39;t seem to be able to control it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

There was no noise.  I still thought it was a plane, but as it came closer I thought this is going to hit the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as it grew from the size of a dot to a base ball and now was the size of a basket ball.  It was round and red.  It then stopped and hovered abouve the roof of the house.  I was standing at my fornt door .  I turned and yelled to my husbqand to come out.  When I turned around it was gone.  My hauband had joined me and we searched the sky for what I had seen.  Then I spoted to my right -high in the sky again looking no rarger than a golf ball.  It again was still -   Then I saw three drops taht would best be discribed as looking like wax dripping. Three drips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the objuect shot straight up at a fantastice speed and was gone out of sight inless than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband clearly saw the last part of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this althought I have never reported it again because I have never heared of any one seeing such a thing and would very much like to know if anyone else has ever reported such an item in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was very long ago but I remember it very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I&#39;m 50 now so it was good long while ago but I do remember exactly what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any way we where out camping some where around Sultan or Gold Bar Washington East of Monroe some where off of Hwy 2.  We were sleeping out under the stars.  I had gotten up some time during the night and went back and layed down in my sleeping bag looking at the sky through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From a northern direction I saw a silver disk of bright light.  It was a little smaller than the full moon but was the same kind of silvery light as the moon and was very high in altitude.  It was hard to gauge its speed or altitude but moved in a pretty much north to south direction at steady pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I followed it with my eyes it instantly changed direction to a due east direction.  It didn&#39;t stop, slow down or curve as it changed direstion.  It was going south then it changed directions at perfenct 90 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I wasn&#39;t asleep and I&#39;m sure of what I saw.  It wasn&#39;t a plane, helicopter, satilite or any thing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
