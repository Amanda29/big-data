It had not hit me yet that i was able to see in my room with out my light being on.  Thats when i was startled and i looked out the window thinking it was day time but finding a light yellowish orange.  I did not know what it was but i had ran out of my room to my parents room that was directly to my right if i was facing that same window.  When i got to my parents room i had notice by looking out of there window that the light was gone.  I had gone back to my room and turned my light on and did not bother to get my parents up.  I remember leaving the light on all night and I also remember that while I was looking at the light it gave heat and i can compare it to the heat of being in front of a TV or not as hot as a heat lamp.  This light did not move or apear to be moving but was fixed.  And then in seconds gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I was not upducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The skipper and I were chatting.  He was at the tiller and I had the job of intermittently shining a flashlight onto the sail to let other vessels know we were out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 01:00, we noticed we hadn&#39;t heard from our third member in a while.  We kidded him, asking if he was asleep, because he was laid back, face to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He answered with a laugh and said he&#39;d been watching three interesting lights. He pointed them out to us.  They were very high in the sky; if one horizon was three o&#39;clock and the other horizon was nine o&#39;clock, then these lights were now at about 11:30, nearly overhead. He said he&#39;d been watching them for a long time and they hadn&#39;t changed formation.  They were arranged in a triangular formation, one light leading the other two, and they were just progressing across the sky.  It was hard to distinguish them from the stars on this clear night, they seemed to be just about that size and brightness.  We thought, at first, it was a plane; but then noted you could see the background stars between them as they went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights finally made it to directly overhead and they stopped.  They just sat in place for about half a minute.  Then, from a complete stop, they shot apart in three directions and out of sight in a brief second.  We had no idea what they were.  No one talked about seeing them the next day.  No coverage in the news media.<n>

A red light appeared on the horizon and moved across the sky towards us.  As it got closer, it became clear that it was more than one light.  It was a cluster of about 6 to 8 lights, arranged in a roughly circular array, with 4 lights, corresponding to 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees on the circle, being brighter than the rest.  This cluster of lights was flashing in a bizarre way, not in a pattern.  It was difficult to discern any physical shape other than the lights, but as it hovered above my house, I estimated its altitude to be about 200 feet.  It made no sound whatsoever, that I could tell.  As it stopped above the house, a spotlight shone down from it.  At this time, I became frightened and ran into the house, followed closely by my friend.<n>

Today, 11/16/07 I visited your site again since 8/7/07 and was happy to see my first posting up, so now I would like to post the second one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The summer of 1990 my extended family was visiting from overseas, and we decided to vacation in Ocean City, MD.  On or about July 20, 1990 after a long day shopping and enjoying the beach weather, my brother and I walked down to the beach for a smoke.  We sat on the shore and talked, when I noticed a set of triangular lights that seemed to dance around each other in the night sky. At first I just thought they were stars, but I also noticed they would blink every now and then, as if they disappeared and reappeared again.  At first I thought, the motion of the waves might have influence over balance, and perhaps on a clear night stars really do twinkle, so I quickly dismissed it as just a quirk. Then suddenly I saw one light dart away from the other two. At first I had hesitated in telling my brother what I had seen, but noticing that the other two lights had now followed the stray light from East to West, I asked him to look up in the sky and tell me what he saw.    My brother then affirmed what I had seen, and we began to speculate as to what it could be, he was the first to say it might be UFOs.  This went on for about 30 minutes, it was definitely not something that was just momentary, it seemed as if the three lights danced around each other, followed each other, and perhaps signaled each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second sighting, both of which I&#39;ve witnessed with two different family members, who can verify my stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to further add that coincidentally on August 1977 I became psyschically intuned with departed loved ones through dreams.  I just find it fascinating that my first sighting which was a direct encounter with a saucer might have enhanced these abilities or are directly attributed to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since my encounters I&#39;ve read many books, including the powerful Edgar Cayce on Indigo children which represent a new evolutionary human society.  Emissaries from heaven is the term that is associated with children with psychic abilities.  I was 13 when I became psychically aware.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to thank your website for helping me realize that what I have witnessed is not something I dreamt up.<n>
7/18/90 22:00|Ames|IA|Disk|10 minutes|At a stadium concert, I and others saw a disk silently hover directly overhead, and then accelerate away at great speed.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29499.html|6|ndxe199007| At a stadium concert, I and others saw a disk silently hover directly overhead, and then accelerate away at great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching a Paul McCartney concert at the Iowa State football stadium, I noticed a flying object slowly approach, thinking at first it was an advertising airplane or a helicopter trying to get a look at the show.  It came directly overhead and hovered completely silently for 3 minutes.  It was a clearly visible disk, 20-foot diameter, with multi-colored lights ringing the underside.  Then it tilted and revealed its top side, which had a solid white light ring around it.  Then it flew away continuing in the direction it had been moving, rapidly accelerating until it was out of sight within a few seconds.  I would estimate the speed to be greater than that of a conventional jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several people in the seats around me also witnessed this and all believed it to be a UFO.  Some of them borrowed my binoculars for a better look.  Interestingly, immediately afterward, no one was willing to talk about it or acknowledge what they had just seen.  The person I was at the show with also saw it but has been unwilling to discuss it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Footnote: Although I was at a rock concert, I did not drink or take any drugs that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness may have been able to establish  the exact date of the concert from a ticket stub, check book, etc..

I didn&#39;t have a car at that time so I rode my mountain bike back and forth to work. One night I was riding up to one of the homes after a fairly tough uphill ride to do a sleep - over shift from 11:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. the next morning. As I approached the house I rested back on my seat an noticed on my right a bright white star-like object traveling from the bottom left star of the big dipper to the right bottom star of the pot on the big dipper. As quick as it arrived to the star on the right it traveled back to the star on the left at the end of the handle. It did this one more time then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/15/90 23:59|Thoiry (France)||Unknown|30 seconds|zigzagging light traveling through space and traveling around stars|4/22/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28440.html|9|ndxe199007| zigzagging light traveling through space and traveling around stars<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to post this only now after having heard of similar reports. I hope to give some evidence that this type of sighting is not unique. It was when I was still a child (in other words before using perception changing substances) with a few of my friends that we noticed a light high in the sky whilst sleeping outside and mindlessly looking for satelites. I&#39;m not sure how many of us noticed the light but I do know that we were at least 4 to have seen it. The light was, I suspect, very far off. At first we thought that it was another satelite, but as we gazed at it started  moving in a zigzagg motion at a very quick pace. After a number of seconds, the star-like light stopped zigzagging and continued to move in a straight line. This was already a great surprise to us, but that wasn&#39;t it. In the path of the light there was a star, which the light did a semi circle around and then resumed its course until it was no longer visible as it faded. I know it sounds ridiculous that the light went around the star, since the star was probably nowhere close to the light, but thats what I saw and so did my friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Looking up in the sky I saw a small light that was moving in an unclear pattern but stayed in the general vacinity. It seemed to be close by the way it moved but I could not hear the craft. I had, at the time, a million candle power spot light in my car. I pointed it to the sky in the direction of the object. It did not seem to change direction or activity. It actually scared me and I went inside. I came outside a half hour later to see nothing. No idea what I saw. I thought it could have been an ultralight aircraft, but it made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Rectangular craft with colored lights down each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home. It was a warm summer night and I was going east on the River Road between Hwy. 44 and Highway 30, a stretch of about 2 miles. The road follows the Meramec River the whole way. I was about half way between Hwy 44 and Hwy 30 and I saw a reflecton of colored lights in the river. I stuck my head out of the window and looked up to see what was causing the reflection. I saw some sort of craft about maybe 100 feet up. It had 8 to 10 different colored lights that were blinking in order. There were two rowes of these lights, one row on each side of the craft. It was hovering directly above the river. At first I thought it was a helecopter but it didn&#39;t make any noise at all that I could hear and a helecopter would cause ripples in the water, and there were none. It was a fairly large craft but it was hard to judge just how high it really was, so that made it hard to judge the size. I didn,t stop to look at it further because there wasn&#39;t any place! to pull over, so I only saw it for maybe 30 seconds. I passed a couple of cars going the other way so they might have seen it also. I am not sure what it was, but I have never seen anything like it before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seemed to get brighter and bigger in diameter as it got closer. We were all looking at it and it was as if it were looking at us also. The object then stopped and took of into the sky almost like a reverse shooting star quickly fading over the horizon. We never actually saw the object itself, only the light from it. It appeared to be only a star, but that was the first time I ever saw a star move in that manner. Could somebody please E-mail me and let me know if there is any explanation for what we saw?<n>

We for some reason looked up to the night sky to see a disc shaped craft approximately 100 to 200 feet in length and  maybe 50 feet in height.  The craft was very low in the sky maybe fifty feet taller then your average telephone pole and It had several different colored lights circling the craft and several black &#34;windows&#34; around the saucer.  The craft was a light grayish blue color that to this day I have never seen on any aircraft.  It passed over our grandmothers house making no sound at all.  We witnessed it in the front for about one minute moving very, very slowly as if it was studying us.  We then ran through the house to the back yard and the saucer was gone.  I spent four years in the United States Marine Corps working in and around aircraft from several branches of the military.  I have never seen an aircraft that matches the color or metal con! struction to this aircraft.  The saucer appeared to be one smoothly constructed craft something that I have never seen since.  I have seen other things in the sky since then and have heard numerous stories from around this area, even a couple of abduction stories, and was wondering what information if any you guys had on this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Credible witnesses. Four retired male co-workers, and one 25 year old female co-worker who looked up to see what it was the others were looking at. It looked like the black stealth plane, but was up extremely high, and stationary, and had me wondering after, why THAT plane would be over this neighbourhood. Then I thought maybe it was a hang-glider, but it wasn&#39;t moving.  It was  clear, blue skied, sunny late afternoon. It did not appear to shine like metal, nor did it have any visible lights. It did not change shape or size.  It appeared higher than the highest visible airplane I&#39;ve seen, and at the same time it&#39;s size seemed bigger than an airplane would be at that height.  It has had me wondering since that day what it was that I saw.<n>

It was summer time, and I was in a friends backyard playing.  When my little brother noticed something flying in the sky over our town.  It struck us as strange, cause it made no noise, and flew funny.  It flew like a football when kicked, end over end style.    But it was like two orbs stuck together.  The two orb shapes would seem to separate, then come back together as it flew.  It was very reflective. Silver in color. My Brother and Two friends watched it for about 15 seconds till it passed from view behind trees that obscured our view.  It was north of our location, and flying in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never seen anything like it sense then, and it still is very clear in my mind.

We thought at first that there was a car up there, but then became confused because of the strange way the light was acting. It kept growing stronger over a period of about 15 seconds.  We then thought maybe it was a helicopter, but there was a noise. Not even a noise really. I&#39;ve only been able to describe it as more of a vibration operating outside the range of human hearing. It seemed to have the properties of a very low cycle oscillation and a very high oscillation at once. It was very eerie. Anyway, as the light grew brighter (around 15 seconds elapsed so far) This gigantic blue-green ball appeared over the ridge. It seemed to shimmer and pulsate a blue-green light.  It was very bright and light up the valley(mountainous logging type area) we were in. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and tears well up in my eyes. It was clearly a gigantic glowing sphere. It hovered there for around a minute, it was about 1-2 miles and it wa huge. I&#39;m guessing at least 1/4 mile across. I mean, it was ridiculous. It lit up the entire area like day. After standing there in complete and utter awe of of this thing for around a minute saying things like, &#34;holy ((deleted))!&#34;, my friend and I began to run down the road in the direction of the sphere. Believe it or not, we were yelling,&#34;take us with you!&#34;. We got about 50 yards and the mammoth sphere started to rise straight upwards.  Its speed seem to increase at an exponential rate (slowly, then faster and faster). The time from the begining of it&#39;s accent until it was completly out of sight(on a partly cloudy night) was about 3-4 seconds. It moved very very fast the last second or so. It was very dis-appointing. For a moment we both thought we could make it up that ridge. I think I was in some variation of shock. It wasn&#39;t until the sun came up that I could really see how big the ridge was that it came over and the surrounding area. It was then that I concluded that it must have been about 1/4 mile wide. I was 19 when this happened, 29 now working at microsoft. :( This event has been on my mind for a long time, I think about it often. I went to alta-vista this evening and typed &#34;blue-green ball&#34;, and voila! here I am! Please take note that the date is really sometime in the summer of &#39;90<n>

It was about 02:30am, I was driving our van, my brother-in-law was sitting in the front passenger seat and my wife and son were asleep in the back. In my rear-view mirror I saw a very bright light behind me, like a car with high beams on at a very far distance. A few seconds later, 20-30 seconds, I looked in my sideview mirror again and this light lit up the whole van and roadway and all I heard was a &#34;swish&#34; the whole van shoock as if we were hit with very strong sidewinds. The radio died, all we heard was static for the next 15-20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother in-law, who was dosing off in the passenger seat jumped right after the bright light and &#34; swish&#34; and yelled, What the hell.  He thought that I was falling asleep. I said, hell no, did you see that, holy smokes.  Even though this happened quite a few years ago, I have retold it countless times and remember it as if it happened yesterday. I have always felt a presence of something ever since that event.

I WAS LIVING ALONE BACK ON JULY 15, 1990 IN A NEW TOWNHOUSE IN GLEN BURNIE, MARYLAND.  I HAD BEEN LIVING THERE FOR TWO WEEKS WHEN THE EVENT HAPPENED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WAS AWAKE LYING IN MY SECOND FLOOR BEDROOM WHEN AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 AM I WAS AWAKENED BY AN ALMOST BLINDING BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT THAT SHONE DIRECTLY INTO MY EYES THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW WITH THE SHADE TOTALLY RAISED.  THE LIGHT WAS ROUND AND AS LARGE AS ABOUT 5-6 FULL MOONS.  IT SHONE DOWN TOWARD MY EYES AT APPROXIMATELY A 45 DEGREE ANGLE FROM THE SKY. THE LIGHT SOURCE WAS ABOUT 200 TO 300 FEET AWAY FROM MY HOUSE. IT SHONE VERY MUCH LIKE A SEARCHLIGHT FROM A POLICE HELICOPTER ONLY 4 OR 5 TIMES BRIGHTER.  I KNEW IT WAS NOT A HELICOPTED BECAUSE THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND AND THE LIGHT DID NOT MOVE OR FLUTTER BUT WAS PERFECTLY STATIONERY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WAS COMPLETELY MESMERIZED BY THE LIGHT AND COULD NOT MOVE AS IF I WERE PARALYZED.  IT SHONE FOR WHAT I FELT TO BE ABOUT 15 MINUTED.  I DESPERATELY WANTED THE LIGHT TO STOP SHINING.  I FELT AN UNSEEN ALIEN PRESENCE CONTROLLING ME ATTENTION SO THAT I COULD NOT LOOK AWAY OR JUMP OUT OF BED.  THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC CONCEPTS OF WHAT KIND OF THOUGHTS OR TRANSMISSIONS MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED DURING THESE 15 MINUTES.  I FOCUSED WHATEVER VOLITIONAL THINKING I COULD  MUSTER ON ASKING WHOEVER OR WHATWVER WAS FLYING THIS CRAFT AND SHINING THIS LIGHT INTO MY EYES.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FINALLY I WAS RELEASEED FROM THIS CAPTIVE HYPNOTIC STATE AND WAS ABLE TO BLINK. WHEN I REOPENED MY EYES THE CRAFT AND LIGHT WERE GONE AND I FELT AN EERIES CHILL UP AND DOWN MY SPINE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I HAVE TOLD MY TWO ADULT CHILDREN AND TWO CLOSE FRIENDS ABOUT THIS INCIDENT BUT NE ER REPORTED IT TO THE POLICE FOR FEAR OF BEING LABELED AS NUTS.  I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I AM VERY STABLE MENTALLY AND AM NOT PRONE TO HALLUCINATIONS OR DELUSIONS,  I COULD SUPPLY YOU WITH MANY MANY SOUND MINDED UPSTANDING CITIZENS WHO COULD ATTEST TO MY CREDIDBILITY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OCCASSIONALLY I HAVE BAD DREAMS ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE.<n>

THERE WAS A FULL RAINBOW IN THE SE OVER WILLAMINA LUMBER COMPANYS&#39; MILL.  I TOOK THESE FRAMES FROM MY FRONT PORCH WITH A NIKON 8000 S CAMERA, USING A SIGMA ZOOM LENS, 28-70 MM MAGNIFICATION.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHEN DEVELOPED, THE NEXT TO THE LAST FRAME HAD WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A DUST PARTICLE ON THE PICTURE. BUT WHEN I CHECKED THE NEGATIVE, IT WAS VISABLE THERE TOO.&#34;   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SENT IN REGARDS TO THIS PHOTO AND SIGHTING FROM THIS INVESTIGATOR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a photo of an unknown object taken about late evening 12 July 1990.  The local farmer I received the photo from was taking a shot of the &#34;rainbow&#34;.  When he had it developed, the object was noticed. It also shows up in the negative, so it is not from the processing.  It was taken from his front porch, the dark area in the upper right corner is the roof line of his house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness lives on the corner of Ten Bush and Fort Hill Rd. here in Willamina, Oregon.  He is a long time resident here since about 16, he is 72 years of age now. He is an advid photographer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object is estimated at about 2000-3000 feet in altitude, at a range of about 1/2 mile to under a mile.  Flight direction looks to be south by southeast.  The lights seen in the bottem of the photograph is the local wood mill here, estimated time was about 7-8pm on the 12th of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness does not remember anything being in the photograph except the rainbow... it was taken with a 35 mm. camera.  I live right at the top of Oak Lane, so I am familiar with this area...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Currently, the witness is writing his account on the sighting with some additional info on a &#34;blue sphere&#34; his wife saw in the same area just a few years back.  Most the land around this area is Confederated Tribal Lands of the Grand Ronde ... so it has some interesting history.  I will forward this on your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I scanned and enhanced the object.. which is interesting.  The closest military base is a Air Guard  Base, but for the 3 years I have lived in this area, I have never seen any low flying military a/c in the area, except for choppers.  For now this object is &#34;unknown&#34; as for its orgin, as it does not conform with any conventional commercial or military aircraft I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have not yet received the photograph, to the best of our knowledge.

I was about 13 or 14 years old back then. I went outside on my parent&#39;s bedroom blacony (4th floor of an appartment) to look at the Ottawa city lights and the stars in general. Then I looked up and saw 3 orange circles, that look like when you turn on your stove to high.  The 3 circles formed a large dark triangle shaped object.  I immediately called my younger brother and he also observed it with me.  It was flying directly above our heads without making a noise what so ever. It looked very large, larger then a commercial air plane but flew to low for a commercial air plane.  I can&#39;t say how high it was, but a guess would be 500 to 750 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1 year later, I saw on the &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34; show, a person who submitted a live video tape of a UFO, in Ottawa and it seemed to coincide with the time of year I saw the object.  The video showed a craft that was landed on the ground with a lot of lights, and it&#39;s hard to determine if it was triangle shaped. So I don&#39;t know for sure if it&#39;s the same one... Could be a coincidence or maybe not.  Then later on I did research as I got older and this triangle shaped object with 3 orange glow lights has been seen in different countries.  At least I&#39;m not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another strange event, but not a sighting, which happened perhaps 5 years ago... Is that I dreamed I was having sexual intercourse with an alien.  Didn&#39;t think of it much really.  But then 1 week or 2 later I see a special report on aliens on FOX and in that report, a man was being hypnotised because he claimed he got abducted by aliens and had sexual intercourse with one of them.  They showed what he was describing and that freeked me out really bad and I didn&#39;t know what to think. It wasn&#39;t one of those deja vu&#39;s because I was involved in the intercourse instead of watching it on TV.  Just too weird for me.  Probably not even worth mentionning and don&#39;t know why I wrote about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would definitely like to be hypnotised to recall the event I saw that night, in more detailed then what I said here... but I don&#39;t see why?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approxmate.

In watching one of the latest episodes, I was astounded to hear of all the other activity right there in South Haven so close to my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was hovering right over the cottage spinning really slowly and looked like two dinner plates, one turned upside down on top of the other...it was grey like made of metal...where the plates met there were many different colored lights but when the UFO started spinning faster the colors began to run together..I saw the alien outside of its craft...with an ultrabright light surrounding it...It definitely glowed...It was testing the soil with something that looked like those lights that commonly light walkways up to a person&#39;s house only the light from it was neon green...I think it was testing the soil..I ran inside to get my parents and when I returned the alien and the craft were gone...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It remained at this point for more than four hours but could have been longer, there was no way to tell as the daylight had waned and it faded from view all the time never moving.  I estimate that it was at an angle to my point of view roughly southwest and seemed to be at a slightly tilted position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted my brother after our conversation on the phone and he basically related the same scenario that Im sharing with you.

Once directly in front of me, still 1-3 miles out and same twenty degrees off horizon it changed direction instantly (90 degree angle turn) and slowly now moved towards me.  I watched as it approached for about 5 seconds and suddenly my next memory is of three large lights (the colors of which I cannot recall with any accuracy) directly in front of me about 15’ away silently hovering motionlessly at my balcony as I lay on a couch watching all this.  I remember some object directly behind the lights that left me with the impression that the lights were attached to it.  But, that memory is there for only two seconds and my next memory is of whatever it was having simply disappeared and something rumbling away overhead.  All was silent till that moment.  Around this time three tiny red puncture marks appeared on my lower left abdomen but disappeared with in a day or two.<n>

We were in an A-Frame house. The bedroom had long windows that looked out into a grove of trees. The forest was pretty thick. I looked up and seen this circle object come into the sight of the windows. From the distance of the house it was probably about 50 ft away. The size of the craft was about 20 ft wide and about 4 feet in length. The color of the craft was a shiny silver. But the lights going around the outside of it were very bright and lit up the area where it floated. It just hovered there for about 1-3 minutes. I don&#39;t really know how much time passed but it seemed to be there for quite awhile. I got the attention of the other girls in the room and we all just stared and awed at it. Just as soon as it came, it jetted out of sight with no sound made. Even while hoovering in the grove of trees there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran across the street to my moms house and told her about it but she didn&#39;t believe us. This is the first time I have mentioned it. I was watching a UFO show on tv and wondered if it was too late to report this.  I am 34 now and this happened when I was 16. I don&#39;t even know if this is worth reporting now, but hopefully one more sighting even if it was almost 20 years ago will help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE AIRCRAFT THAT I WOULD SEE ON A DAILY BASIS. THIS HAD NO RUNNING OR FLASHING LIGHTS LIKE AND AIRPLANE.

The light disappeared into the sky after about two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in 1990,  I was going home around 11:00 P.M. and witnessed a police car stopping a car while I was waiting for a signal light to turn green.  As I passed the police car,  I noticed a bright light above the police car at 60 degree angle and coming from a western direction.  At first,  I though it was a police chopper serving as a back up to the police car.  However, after looking at it for a couple of seconds I did not notice any characterisitcs of a chopper.  In other words,  the police chopper was not doing its typical circular patterns that is common to see when looking at a cop chopper, and it was not shining it&#39;s strong bright light on any thing on the ground.  A block later I got home and got out of my Jeep to find two neighbors looking at the object.  However, minutes later the bright light disappeared into the night sky.  Although, at the time I was a college student and it was a Saturday night,  I was not drunk or had any to drink that night.  I was sober and total!ly awake.<n>

It travelled from the ocean, across Biscayne Bay, over the Hamilton on the Bay Luxury Apartments in under 10 seconds.  In diameter, it was the size of a single engine aircraft.  It made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over head, it cast a shadow of our highrise onto the building 200 feet north of us.  It lit up the night&#39;s sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was witnessed by my roommate, Timothy E. Kidd.  I contacted Miami, Channel 10 News located just a 1/2 mile from The Hamilton.  I called the news room within 3-5 minutes of the sighting in order to report it.  They said their weatherman who lives in our same building called.  He had witnessed the same object.  Weatherman, Brian Norcross confirmed his sighting. He is still working at Channel 10, Miami.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark outside and the weather was warm and clear. We were driving northeast along the road that takes you past the Jeffersonville Ammunitions Plant. We both saw it at the same time. An object in the sky with no lights. It didn&#39;t appear to be moving. The object was hovering above one of the old closed down factory sections. It wasn&#39;t really high but it wasn&#39;t what I would call low either. I would saw that it was as high as a very tall radio tower(if that makes any sense). If I had to guess how big it was, I would have to compare it to jets I have seen at airshows at that altitude. I would say about the size of a B1-B. We approached it. It was off to the east of us. It never moved from the point in that point in the sky. My mother slowed down and I stuck my head out the window for about three minutes. I never heard any noise coming from the object and there were only a couple of cars in the area but not near us. The object was dark. Not reflective that I saw. It was triangular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was with a friend and we were in heavy traffic that was moving slowly as we approached the 5N merge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked up and saw what looked like a huge high voltage tower on its side, moving very slowly, approximately twenty miles per hour through the sky toward the Calfornia coast.  It was several hundred feet above the freeway, but the sky was clear and we could see it plainly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made absolutely no noise.  It moved from east of us to the west.  We looked to see if anyone else say what we saw.  The object was very long, at least 200 feet.  You could see sky through the object as you would see through a metal upright tower.  The object had several round lights around the body of the structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not report this to your office at the time because I didn&#39;t know of the existence of your service at the time.

Event occurred mid-afternoon on a bright, clear summer|10/15/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25585.html|46|ndxe199007| Uh, date is very approximate.  It happened within a year of the summer of 1990.  Event occurred mid-afternoon on a bright, clear summer day over the city of Victoria, B.C., Canada.  I was in a backyard, in the city, looked up and noticed, flying directly overhead, apparently very high up, an object.  It flew right over the city.  It was roughly football-shaped.  Both ends were the same, and more rounded than a football.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its shape was approximately a marriage between a football and a watermelon.  Oblong.  It looked sort of like a pod.  Very symetrical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had smooth, distinct, well-defined boundaries.  Definitely an object - a craft - and obviously artificial.  And it definitely had no wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its surface appearance was a light...dull...silvery...metallic.  But...  I dunno.  The surface seemed to my eyes somehow...a bit odd.  Not blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quite clear and distinct.  And yet...I couldn&#39;t seem to see the surface of it clearly.  So it confused me some.  I wondered: what was I seeing? The object was flying too high to make out any surface detail.  It appeared to be featureless.  I saw absolutely no evidence of any wings, nor windows, nor anything that would have allowed me to know that it was some sort of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was utterly unlike any aircraft I had ever seen, or ever have seen.  And it was *really* moving.  In fact, it startled me, how fast it appeared to be flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, to two other people who were with me, &#34;What is that?&#34;  I pointed up at it.  They both looked up, and they both also saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my friends suggested that it was a &#34;cruise missile&#34;.  (Like he could immediately see for himself that it was not an airplane or a jet.) (Some cruise missile testing has been conducted in Canada, but I doubt that any such tests have occurred over Vancouver Island.) I said no, cruise missiles are long, like cigars.  That is definitely *not* a cruise missile.  It looked to be totally the wrong shape, and far too large to be a missile, and it was also flying way too high, and travelling too fast.  Usually cruise missiles travel close to the ground.  The object I saw was at very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several things about that object have left a lasting impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (1) It appeared to be flying very high.  I would estimate that its altitude was likely several kilometers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (2) It appeared to be *big*.  I guessed that it was probably approximately the size of a small house.  I got the impression from observing it that its body was much larger than the body of any aircraft I&#39;d ever seen.  I&#39;ve been around Hercules transport, and even flown on one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are quite large aircraft.  So I konw their size.  The body on this thing looked to be a lot fatter than a Herc&#39;s.  This is guessing, as you can understand, because I was seeing this thing from a considerable distance.  But right above me, on a clear day.  Its size would naturally depend on its distance.  But what my brain was telling me was: it was big, and very high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (3) It was also really moving.  I guessed that it was probably travelling at approximately Mach 2.  It was in sight for only about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In that time it travelled all the way overhead.  It was just racing across the sky, at several degrees of angular travel, per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely *not* a meteorite.  No glow, and it looked definitely *constructed*.  I could see it very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw first it when it was almost directly overhead.  I was just stretching or something, looked up, and bingo.  I&#39;d say it was moving at about 5 degrees of arc per second.  Fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the object I saw was at high altitude - several kilometers up - and it did appear to be, very high up, that means that it was going pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably supersonic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (4) It was totally silent.  That struck as me as strange.  I was listening intently for some engine sound, or possibly even a sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I thought it was probably flying faster than the speed of sound.  So I naturally expected to hear something, maybe even a boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I heard: *nothing*.  Just silence.  It didn&#39;t make a sound.  I heard from it not even the faintest whisper of an engine.  Just silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I thought: whoa.  That is pretty weird.  Why can&#39;t I hear that thing? And I was really pondering then.  There&#39;s this...high performance craft of some sort, flying high up, probably at close to Mach 2, yet it is *silent*.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I wondered, how can any aircraft move that fast, apparently supersonically, yet make *no* sound? I kept listening.  I heard no engine sound; no boom, no anything.  It just seemed so strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it also *looked* weird.  Like a football.  Something with no wings.  Flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (5) And no contrail.  No hint of any conventional engine.  It was flying along like it was propelled by magic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For those several reasons - its apparent size (big), its shape (weird, round, no wings), it&#39;s apparent altitude (very high up), its apparent velocity (fast), but especially its acoustic stealth...it all kind of spooked me.  I thought: wow, whatever that is, it&#39;s *really* different.  If it&#39;s some sort of experimental aircraft, some new kind of jet, that a human pilot is flying, then it must have a pretty wickedly *different* engine in it.  Powerful, for one thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because it seemed to be really travelling overhead, and effortlessly.  I&#39;d gues that even the most advanced scram(?) engines that are capable of pushing an aircraft that fast, or faster (even to Mach 5), must make a lot of *noise*, yes? I kept wondering, as I stared at it, what kind of airplane looks like a football, has no wings and is *silent*?  I just kept staring up at it in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, bear in mind, I am a skeptic.  I think a lot of the reports are due to either intoxication or imagination or are just bull.  But my report is sincere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have attended university and I have worked in a scientific field.  (Earth physics.)  I have studied science.  (Physics.)  I&#39;m a very logical person.  I do not believe easily.  I always want *evidence* before I believe something.  But on that sunny summer day...I figure that I got some evidence, with my own eyes.  Enough.  I saw something really strange in the sky.  Enough to warrant a report, I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I have a lot of difficulty believing that what I saw that summer day, about 12 years ago, flying high overhead, was designed and built by humans.  Because every time I&#39;ve seen an aircraft flying overhead - even if it&#39;s flying at 35,000 feet - I can always *hear* something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Always.  I used to listen to jets flying over the North Pole, way up.  Intercontinental jets on their way from South Korea to Europe, or the other way, over the pole.  (We were on their flight path.  I was posted at a weather station up there for a while.)  And I could always hear the jets flying over, no matter how high they were.  Even when one was just a tiny dot in the sky.  Even then.  Always.  And I could always see wings on it.  Moreover, I could always see their contrails.  Hot gases condense, cool, and form clouds behind the jets, when they&#39;re high up.  Hot gas plus cold air leave a trail.  But this thing left no trail.  Apparently very high up, in the atmosphere, yet no sound from it, and no trail.  No wings.  An absolutely quiet football, passing quickly right overhead.  It was rather spooky, in fact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And perhaps more importantly, the many jets I&#39;ve seen fly overheard - at approximately, apparently, the same altitude - were not moving nearly as fast as the thing I saw that day appeared to be moving.  Jets travelling at around 35,000 feet and at roughly 3/4 the speed of sound move across the sky rather slowly.  They just kind of creep along.  They move at maybe one degree or so of arc per second.  Ballpark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So it takes them about a full minute from the time you can first see them until they are out of sight.  So call that 180 degrees, from horizon to horizon.  Divide that by 60 seconds, that is roughly 3 degrees of arc per second, give or take.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw that day covered about 90 degrees in only about 15 seconds.  That&#39;s roughly 6 degrees per second, or twice as fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was indeed flying at the very high altitude that I thought it was flying, that means that it was travelling at something like 1200 or 1400 miles per hour, or almost Mach 2.  Almost certainly faster than the speed of sound.  Should be a shock wave from that.  So logic told me, that thing should create a sonic *boom*.  I knew it had a powerful engine, pushing it - it had to be, to go that fast - so I should hear some sort of sonic bang.  And if was flying at a *lower* altitude than I thought it is, then it should definitely be able to hear its engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what did I hear?  I heard nothing.  I heard absolutely *nothing* from it.  Not a blessed sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was getting kind of weirded out about this, you know.  I was trying to make all the pieces fit, logically, in my mind, and they just wouldn&#39;t fit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no way to objectively know that object&#39;s true size or altitude or speed.  And I realize that they all factor together.  If I was wrong about its altitude, then I&#39;d be wrong about its speed, and also about its size.  But I saw it very distinctly, quite clearly, for a good many seconds, and I was studying it.  I think my gut instincts are pretty good.  My hearing is pretty good, too.  I did not hear a whisper from that thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a whisper.  Just silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after it was gone, I began to reason it out.  (Or tried to.)  OK.  I just saw something that had no wings.  Definitely no wirngs.  Yet...it was flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK.  That&#39;s pretty weird but...a high performance jet that has no wings....  Hey, they make them every day.  In fact, there are some craft we&#39;ve built that have hardly any wings.  (For example, the space shuttle has hardly any wings.)  This thing that I saw - I am sure - had no wings at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None.  A flying football.  But also....  No engine sound.  Ergo, no engine, either.  And to me, that&#39;s altogether another matter.  No wings is one thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No engine is...whoa.  Over the line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that is why, despite my healthy skepticism, I have some *doubt* that humans built the thing with no wings that I saw that day, high up in the sky, and moving very fast.  It bothers me.  I still can&#39;t make all the pieces.  Unless we didn&#39;t build it.  Then...everything fits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I read and heard about an object that apparently flew right *under* (and close to) a British passenger airliner, as it was crossing the Atlantic Ocean.  At some considerable risk to his career, that pilot bravely (and officially) reported a UFO that I believe was of similar size and shape, to my object.  I believe he reported something that was shaped approximately like a watermelon, or a football, i.e. round? And *big*.  Bigger than his airliner.  And he said it was also travelling a lot faster.  He estimated it was moving at least twice as fast as him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just whizzed by him.  Now that would mean that it was moving faster than the speed of sound.  He was going maybe 500 or 600 mph, so it was going roughly 1,000 or 1,200 mph.  Maybe even 1400 mph.  He said it passed right under him! So he expected to feel some turbulence from it, but in their statements, he and his co-pilot both said that they felt *nothing*.  Not even a bump.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They also reported that they heard *nothing*.  That the object that passed by them was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I believe that pilot indeed saw what he claimed that he saw.  After what I saw, I believe him.  And it&#39;s occurred to me that that sighting (a fairly respectable sighting) - by two professional airline pilots (who had a lot to lose by reporting what they saw) - matches up reasonably well with what I saw with my own eyes, from a distance of several kilometers, about 12 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In both cases, it was something *big*.  It was round, and fast, and silent.  I think *I* have seen that one, too.  Maybe I saw the same craft, or type of craft, as they saw.  There is bound to be some overlap in the appearance reported, if they are real.  If at least one is real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it is, I know - for pretty sure - that it&#39;s something approximately as big as a house, and it can move very fast - definitely supersonically - and yet it evidently does not disturb the atmosphere around it, and therefore it makes no sound.  Somehow, it just slices through the air without creating any turbulence or wake or chaotic vortex behind it.  It can move faster than sound, without creating a sonic boom.  Its propulsion system Is, I can verify, dead silent.  Now...you tell me, please, what sort of aircraft we (humans) have built that could possibly fit that description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I&#39;m not aware of any.  And I suspect that not even the U.S. military are aware of any.  Unless they do know, about those things, and they&#39;re keeping their mouths shut.  Maybe to keep our sensitive brains from overloading.  :) I suspect that it will be a very long time before *we* know how to build something like what I saw.  Whatever it was, it just kissed the sky, a nice silent kiss.  I would call it the ultimate in graceful flying machine.  Thinking back now, on what I observed, during those few seconds...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d have to say that it was not only impressive, but beautiful.  Somehow...elegant.  Such a remarkable craft!  To fly without any wings!  Wow! If you ever saw it, I know it would be enough to make your jaw drop, when you witnessed it for yourself, zipping along, lickety-split, and passing quickly overhead, silently, like God throwing a silver football.  You don&#39;t hear a thing.  That&#39;s pretty neat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose the whole subject of UFOs alarms some people.  But if I may speak to the issue of fear.  Personally I regard it as unwarranted.  Or at the very least, as unhelpful.  It can only cloud our thinking on the issue.  Of whether or not some extraterrestrial intelligence does indeed exist in the proximity of the Earth.  I don&#39;t know if it does.  It may.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They don&#39;t scare me.  I never felt scared, or alarmed.  Instead, I felt...awe.  I remember feeling just very impressed.  And I still feel that way, all these years later.  As the amusing Pat Paulsen once said, there is nothing to fear, except fear itself.  And of course, the bogeyman!  :) I figure that if &#34;they&#34; are up there, cruising around, as though our atmosphere is their playground and race track, they are probably not bugs, or critters, like us.  They are probably not green, or grey.  They are probably not even alive, in the same sense that we use that term.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My own personal speculation (if I may be allowed that here) is that the pilot onboard that quite incredible craft I saw (if not human, and if that craft was not of human design) was probably the equivalent of a very advanced robot.  Maybe I saw a probe.  Something...probably self-repairing, highly intelligent, and autonomous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps - I merely speculate here, because I *doubt* that we made the thing I saw - the pilot and the craft were one and the same.  Maybe I saw one of the same sorts of things that weve sent out, to explore other planets.  Unmanned.  Yet still capable of doing a lot.  But a *lot* more sophisticated, and a lot more capable.  Maybe - just maybe - *one* of their probes, centuries or even thousands or perhaps even millions of years ago, found a planet with bugs on it.  So it set about building more probes, using materials it found here, and now they are *all* busy studying us.  :) I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m just throwing that out as the most &#34;reasonable&#34; explanation, as I see it, if there *is* (indeed) something of an extraterrestrial nature in or around our atmosphere, and present there fairly often.  There certainly do seem to be a lot of sightings, including a large percentage that some from very reasonable and responsible people, who have no interest in hoaxing anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you don&#39;t believe me, fine.  But I *know* what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I see, &#34;machine&#34; intelligence (only) would get around the long flight time problem.  Let&#39;s suppose that matter indeed *cannot* travel faster than light, so even their fastest spacecraft travel at &#34;less than&#34;.  A robot probably wouldn&#39;t care how many centuries it took to reach another star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even if it took 10,000 years for it to get from there to here, so what?  A well-designed, very advanced, sophisticated, intelligent, self-repairing probe could still be in perfect working order after many centuries, or even thousands of years.  In fact, in theory, even a million years could pass, and it could still be fully functional.  That would violate none of the laws of physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not a UFO nut, at all.  I actually have not a great amount of interest in it, because I think hard evidence will be very difficult to come by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically if they&#39;re up there, I figure they&#39;re too smart and too fast for us.  So doubtful we&#39;ll ever be able to capture one, or even real close to one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But from all that I&#39;ve read, and seen, of video clips of sightings - and there are now quite a number (including at least one video of things flitting around in space near rocket launches, caught on film)....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d humbly suggest to everyone that the behavior of those apparently ET vehicles that many have seen (maybe myself included) is probably best described (and understood) as the behavior of quite logical and advanced *machines*, rather than the behavior of living creatures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They do not seem to much care what we think, do they?  To my mind, that says: machines.  Smart, analytical, but otherwise mostly devoid of sentiment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any event, if they *are* here (and I am not suggesting they are, because I don&#39;t know what I saw), they may &#34;just&#34; be doing science.  Studying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Collecting data.  Curiosity is a trait we should easily understand.  We - as a species - are very curious ourselves.  We are already exploring other planets, too.  I&#39;m sure that if those craft are real, and alien in origin, and are piloted by &#34;machines&#34; (as I suggest), then those machine are still many times smarter than humans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is a logical assumption too, I think, because suppose they started exploring space &#34;just&#34; 100,000 years ago.  In less than a hundred years, from now - and maybe in only a few decades - *we* will have machines that are much smarter than us.  So...truly advanced (artificial) minds on those craft is not that hard to imagine.  If you work it out, using carbon nanotubes and molecule-scale processors, one cubic centimeter of their processor cores could have approximately the processiong power of about a billion Pentium IVs processors.  So an alien processor even a meter cubed would dwarf all of our computers, and maybe all of our minds as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Put in those terms, one of those ships wouldn&#39;t have much to worry about, in terms of being outsmarted, or outclassed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I see it, there is no inherent reason why even very advanced, intelligent probes should want or seek any direct or intentional contact with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That doesn&#39;t fit within the agenda of &#34;study&#34;.  Especially if we seem to them to be very primitive.  And I wouldn&#39;t argue with them on that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re still all pretty...duh.  :) But even *if* that object I saw flying high overhead about 12 years ago was built in a plant somewhere right here on earth, by humans who get a paycheck for building neat stuff - I would say to the guys who built it (if I could): boys, congratuations!  Your new airship is technology with a capital T.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mean...first of all, it looks *alien*.  It looks like...puh, Hollywood, move over.  And on top of looking weird and ET-ish, you&#39;ve managed to build something that&#39;s evidently about the size of a cottage, that has no wings, and it can zip through the earth&#39;s atmosphere at quite high altitudes, faster than a rifle bullet, and do it without making a sound.  That&#39;s a pretty neat trick.  Where did you get the design for it?  :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We pulled over and looked up and there was a black, triangular carft above us, hovering...not moving, just hanging there in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one else stopped, so we left and went to our home. Once we got to the front steps, my mother pointed up to the sky and we saw about 4-5 more of the triangular black craft flying over what we believe was our locanl beach area (Venetian SHores Beach). They were flying like nothing we&#39;ve ever seen, smooth and all over the place, looking like they were just taking everything in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our neighbor who witnessed this with us was so disturbed she called our local police dept., where she was told that it was the Long Island Railroad conducting tests. I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s so late reporting...but I haven&#39;t been able to talk about it really and even my mother and I never discuss it!!<n>
7/1/90 01:00|Whitehouse Station|NJ|Unknown|2 minutes|Slept at my friends house for the night when his brother and mother burst into our room to show us strange lights outside.  By the time|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34197.html|48|ndxe199007| Slept at my friends house for the night when his brother and mother burst into our room to show us strange lights outside.  By the time the door opened, the entire 2nd floor of the house was illuminated with multiple colored lights from an outside source as if a craft was hovering just above us.  There was no sound at all except for many neighborhood dogs barking like crazy.  The lights moved passes the home slowly and were eventually gone....Minutes later there was a smell in air as if something was being electrified (only way to describe it)...Then about 5 minutes later we heard a low-pitched, bass sound, as if a guitar amplifier was pulsing.  Then nothing was heard or seen that night.  I have living in Whitehouse my entire life and remember this event vividly.  Plus, from what I have heard, this same part of town had similar events in the 1950&#39;s where an entire wedding congregation seen similar events in daylight with actual photos in the newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Moved very slowly away from us but then shinned very bright light at us!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This info is as close as I can remember: Me and my brother inlaw were on a four wheel drive trip to the top of Bald Mountain in Shaver Lake Ca. Shortly after we had arrived at the top of the mountain my brother inlaw saw somthing behind me slightly above our elevation in the valley between us and the nearest mountain 1/2 to 3/4 mile across. The craft was triangular with 7 red lights across the leading edge. The lights did not flash and were very bright. The object moved very slowly. (too slow for for any aircraft to stay airborn)I would say the craft was 100 yards across Min. The most amazing thing about the whole sighting was when my brother inlaw shinned a high power flashlight at it. It shinned a VERY bright white light back at us! I dont remember what happened after that,the next thing I knew we had cut our trip short and were headed home. We dont talk about that night any more but the last time I mentioned it to him he asked me if I could remeber any more about it. Neither one of us can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Anonymous source.  PD))<n>
7/1/90 00:30|Shaver Lake|CA|Light|1-2 minutes|Intense light over Shaver Lake, California.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49229.html|50|ndxe199007| Intense light over Shaver Lake, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While riding my motorcycle from Fresno, to my home in Prather, California, my girlfriend and I came into a clearing atop a mountain when the entire night sky lit up like daylight. All I could see was, a massively bright light over my left shoulder and about 10 miles out. It appeared to be over the Shaver Lake community and even though this light was about 3/4 to 1 mile long and 1/4 mile high, it wasn&#39;t focused on us. Whatever it was looking at was on the mountain it was hovering over, yet the light was blinding from over 10 miles away. I stopped my chopper in the middle of the road and the light just went out. I shut off the bike, but I couldn&#39;t hear a sound. Not even the summer bugs were making any sound. Kinda freaky. Anyway, I lit up a smoke and my girlfriend said, &#34;Did you see that??&#34; I looked over my shoulder and said, &#34;What&#39;d YOU see??&#34; We never saw anything about it in any of the local papers or on t.v. or anything. I didn&#39;t think anyone else in the world had seen it until I was reading one of the reports on this website. That&#39;s pretty cool. I thought I&#39;d lost my damn mind and I pretty much kept it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
