We were looking at a full moon. We noticed this very bright star that appeared to be aout 6&#34; from the moon. This very whites blue light all of a sudden started jumping around as though it was one of those little black water bugs that you see in streams. This thing finally just when up and out of site. We never told any one about this because of what we would encounter from our superiors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked like a very bright star. Could make 90 and 180 Degree turns. Looked as thought it was jumping around the moon. We heard no noise. It  would leave a trail like a sprinkler that you light on the 4th of July. Never seen ant thing like this ever again. I trully believe this was a UFO&gt;<n>

The first morning was in an orchard in Kansas...the second morning was in my bedroom at home. My friend Dave, and I, were sitting on a fruit shade...which is a sheet of corrigated tin on four wooden posts.  We were observeing a steady glow that was comeing from the interior of a nearby wooded area, when everything went completely quiet...no crickets..no breeze..no sound at all.  I noticed a deep red light...similar at first, to an aircraft light, moveing from right to left..in the sky ..in front of us.  I pointd it out to him.  He said...&#34;awww...thats just an airplane.&#34; I said..I don&#39;t think so.  Then he said your right!  It isn&#39;t an airlpane!  Its movement from right to left wasnt slow..or fast..but rather..somewhat..well..hypnotic.  Then..the red light changed into two small white lights...which grew larger..as they moved up ..and away from each other..in these elongated archs..as they were doing this..they were gettin LARGER..then pauseing in the air...two spheres of a very pure..white light...appearing to be ABOUT 3 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter...illuminateing the tree tops.  Dave said.&#34;I&#39;m gettin outta here!&#34;..I grabbed him by his shirt..and said..Wait! Look!  The two spheres of light then followed the identical archs..back dowm...getting smaller and smaller..and merged ..and turned back into the original red light...which then departed our field of vision..in the same manner as it had entered.  The two spheres of light at thier largest...looked to be about 40 or 50 yards away..and seemed to be about 5 yards apart. We then said to each other..no ones ever gonna believe this!  We described what we had seen to each other.  We both jumped down to the ground, and started walking tward the farm house.  I remember looking down at my foot as I began a stride...then it was ABOUT 11 AM...bright sunshine..I was sitting in a bedroom in the farm house.  NOW COMES THE STRANGE PART...For the rest of that day...I was wandering around in a kind of a daze...or trance.  That evening..(actually the next morning) at what seemed to be about 3 AM...I was sleepin in a fold out bed..(from a couch)..in the liveing room...when in my sleep..I became aware of the room..and from a certain area of the room an awareness ..or intelligence..which asked me if I wanted to know what was in the balls of light.  I immediately realized that I could not decieve this ..whatever it was..so I replied YES..I have been wondering about that. My reply was non-verbal. Then I was lookin down at my body still sleeping on the bed...and wondered how I could &#34;see&#34; if my eyes were in my body...I also wondered why I was not afraid.  Instantly..without physically turning around..I was &#34;looking&#34; at the wall opposite the foot of the bed..where &#34;I&#34; &#34;saw&#34; a sphere of very pure white light light ...that was about 3 3/4 feet in diameter..stationary by the wall.  I then moved across the room..and entered the ball of light. It was very bright inside ..with what seemed to be human souls...no identites..or genders...blending together..then briefly some would kinda &#34;spin off&#34; from the main brightness, then rejoin again.  Also I was saturated by a love that I had never experienced before...also I noticed there was a tim! eless element...like a hundred years could pass..seemingly..in seconds.  The love had a very secure...serene feeling about it. At this time the same &#34;voice&#34; that was initially in my room... asked if I wanted to stay...or return.  I thought that if I had said I wanted to stay..that my physical body would ...well...die. I figured my mom might be really upset by this...so I replied that I wanted to return...I left the ball of light...went back across the room..and re-entered my physical body.  I woke up &#34;all together&#34; again at about 12 noon....Sorry about the length of this report. I still don&#39;t understand how it seemed to be a UFO..or UAO thing AND a spiritual experience..in the SAME experience..I do know it was spiritual.  Also I had..at the time a kind of &#34;flashback&#34; of Dave sitting on this stainless steel like bench..with his shirt off..stareing straight ahead..as if he were in some kind of trance.  I went to a lot of trouble to type this out..so please let me know what you think of it...Thanks, Robert  P.S.  I am being completely honest and up front with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw the object suddenly flaring up to double it`s size, (appr.1/4 size of moon-size). Out popped a second object, moved a short distance away from object one. A arch-weld like beam attached between the two objects, than the second objects popped back to the first object, and once again popped out. The second object moved 4 fingers away, and stopped suddenly. A third object came travelling from east, and stopped a 10 finger distance from the first object. The second object then began zig-zagging around first object and moved up-ward, between first and third object. The second object continued west over the sky, passing across big-dipper. The first object took of south, and the third object returned east, where it originally came from. This took approx.5-10 minutes. We biked to our friends home and got a binocular, and my friend said he could se the second object which was going west, dissapear behind a few clouds on a otherwise clear and bright night-sky. This took place within 20 min. After this experience, I biked home on a lonely country highway. Very frightened. At one point I could feel electricity in the air around me. I bet my hair was charged up on top of my head. I just took one short look at a bright star on the sky infront of me biking south, but was to scared to look again. Years after, I still have a funny feeling about the time it took to bike home, It should only taken appr. 10 minutes, still when I came home I woke my sisters and parents,to tell about the sighting, it was 01.10 past midnight. Still, 30 years after this sighting, I have dreams about aliens. and ufo,s. It certainly affected me, making me open-minded, about the un-known.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that time and date are approximate.

After the movie, we went to park and &#34;neck&#34;.  We were moving slowly down a dirt road that I had never gone down before. I looked to read my date&#39;s face to ensure she was not opposed to stopping for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw on her face may best be described as pure fear. Her eyes were fixed on something in the air coming right at us. As it went overhead, it could not have been more than 500 feet in the air and no more than 1000 to 1500 feet away.  The car did not have air conditioning so the windows were all down.  I sat and watched and listened as this craft went by.  There was not any sound that could be heard other than the purr of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about the size of a large passenger jet.  You could see a row of windows that were near the bottom of the bowl just before the shape flatten out to make a saucer shape.  The window lights would go out one at a time in a series so that all of the lights were on but one.  It gave the appearence that the upper part of the craft was moving counter clockwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom of the craft had a red light on the leading edge and every quarter that blinked but moved in the opposite direction.  My date did not want to look at this and I think I was telling her that she had to to make sure that she can confirm what I am looking at.  How much she did look, I do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had passed and I was certain that it was making no sounds, I turned the car around and took off in the direction the craft was going.  We hadn&#39;t gone any distance before it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued on down the road until I came to a few houses where some men were standing outside their homes. I stopped and asked if they had seen anything strange.  One of the men was an older black man who responded by saying, &#34;yesssir, we just saws us a flying saucer&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I called the airport but they said it was probably nothing.  I never dated or saw the young woman I was with again.  I went off to college and she stayed in Greensboro.

A bright star got brighter and brighter and bigger then it blew up.  Like 50 small fire balls shot out from the center of this bright pulsating star and slowly faded away. Many years later when in college I asked my Astronomy professors who said no ones ever seen a star blow up in the sky.

I would like to report a UFO sighting that I experienced back in the month of August 1968. I know that this is long time ago, but I was so impressed with this incident that I still have a vivid memory of it. So there it is: On evening around 7 :00 P.M. during the month of August 1968 (I can’t remember the exact date), I was sitting on the porch of one of my friend’s house located on Decelles Street in St-Laurent, Quebec, which is a suburb of Montreal. We were three persons there: myself, this friend who lived at this house and another friend. We were 16-17 year old teenagers at the time and we were just talking. The porch of the house faced west and the sun was setting, but the sky was perfectly clear and it was still quite bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, something caught the corner of my eye, in the Southwestern sky, at about an elevation of about 45 degrees. There was a cluster of at least a dozen disc-shaped and dark-colored objects that were moving to the north. As they crossed the sky, they assembled in a perfect V-shape and vanished somewhere in the darker part of the northern sky. The discs were about the size of pinky fingernail held at arms length and it took them about 5 seconds to cross the sky. I would say that their altitude was above 20,000 feet and they seemed to travel very fast. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than a minute later, another similar group of objects that seemed to just materialize in the same southwest location of the sky, crossed the sky, while assembling in a V-shape formation, and then vanished towards the north. At first, not believing what I was seeing, I did not say a word to either one of my friends, but then I noticed that one of them was also looking at the sky in disbelief. We looked at each other exclaiming something like « what the hell is that??? ». We pointed out the discs to our third friend, who also saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued for at least another five minutes. We observed at least ten other groups of discs that would always perform the same maneuver: they would appear in a “bunch” and move to the north while lining-up in a perfect V-formation. All in all, we must have seen more than 100 of these discs cross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were definitely not aircraft or birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in August 1968 is approximate.

Afternoon.  Observer location at the Eastern end of Manor Road, Church Hill, PA (located on US 322 between Reedsville and Milroy). Visual angle on the object was about 85 deg above horizon.  Object appeared to be silver sphere, moving from North to South.  Sighting started &amp; ended about 45 deg to either side of zenith.  Two delta-wing fighters (considering the year probably F102s) trailed yhe onject (in terms of flight path), with distance between the object anbd the fighters increasing -- ie, object appeared to be faster than fighters. Object was *not* a reflection from a conventional airplane.  The angle between the sun (cloudless day) changed markedly between beginning &amp; ending of sighting, but the appearance of the object as a silvery sphere did not vary. Also, the fighters were always visible as conventional aircraft throught the sighting. The question, of course, is:  what was the actual altitude of the UFO? If at the fighter&#39;s altitude or greater, it was going faster than the fighters.  If less than the altitude of the fighters, it could have been slower than the fighters -- and if enough lower, could have been a balloon. At no time during the sighting did it *feel* like it was a balloon, however.<n>

While waiting, we noticed overhead, no more than 1/4 of a mile up several large discs progressing westerly under their own power.  The only sound I heard was more of the craft moving the air and very little else.  These objects had now lights and appeared to be shaped to cut through an atmosphere at very high speed, although the speed they travelled at this time appeared to be maybe 50 miles an hour.  These craft came into view only at a near direct overhead angle and seemed to vanish into the darkness at the same angle at which they appeared.  We were awestruck.  The person we were waiting on arrived and had seen them also.  An old man who lived on this corner was going to work at this time.  We saw him staring up at the sky and asked him if he saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said, &#34;see what?&#34; We said &#34;the flying saucers&#34;.  He said that he thought he was going crazy when he saw them and wasn&#39;t going to tell anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reported this sighting to the police and to the Air Force as these saucers probably flew directly over or near Bergstrom Air Force Base.  Two months later the Air Force sent a uniformed colonel to our house to inform us that we had seen &#34;space trash that landed later in Kansas.&#34;  He even brought an &#34;official report&#34; with him.  We laughed him off the premises.  We anticipated that the Air Force would be interested in hearing what we saw, not telling us.  As far as I know, only the old man has since died, and the rest of us remember what we saw.  However, the six saucers I saw were flying in a line, some of the other guys said they saw others off to the sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cool, huh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The craft produced a sound much like a very high-speed electrical motor, shrill and almost inaudible.  Its shape was that of two bright silver/white saucers placed face to face with a row of clear lights around the center much akin to windows in a commercial jet.  The lights seemed to revolve very rapidly like a gyroscope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft hovered approximately 300’ directly above our heads and seemed to place us in an electrical field, because for a brief time we could not move our bodies.  After a few minutes the craft began to move very slowly to the southwest toward a Niaki Missile base which bordered the camp property.  Just as it reached the tree line it banked slightly and disappeared in a split second, never to be seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Niaki Missile base located in Byron, GA is just a short distance from Robins Air Force Base, Warner Robins, Georgia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Six witnesses.|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79041.html|16|ndxe196808| Five lighted craft in formation investigating Morro Bay electric generating plant. Six witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the exact date or time but it was in the summer of 1968 and in the early evening/late afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were driving up Perfumo Canyon Road to visit friends who lived on top of the mountain. Perfumo Canyon Road begins in San Luis Obispo and winds up the mountain until it reaches the top, then it descends downward on the other side to near Avila Beach, California. At the time of the sighting there were only two residences at the top of the mountain. My friends had no electricity but had a gas water heater and a windmill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At certain points in the drive, which is made up of hairpin turns and sharp angles, one can get a view of the coastline stretching north from the point of Cayucos California to Grover City in the south. At the point where we saw these craft we had a view with Morro Bay and the towers of the electricity generating plant almost directly in the middle of our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw were five lights. They were at a considerable distance and no shape could be discerned. This happened during the early evening and the light can only be described as bright yellowish. We all saw the lights and were quite shocked and immediately stopped the car. One of our members was so excited that he actually pushed down on the handle of the car, I think we were in my 1955 Buick, but can&#39;t remember. Anyway, he fell out of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The five lights were in an obvious formation, three were in an absolutely straight line, waiting on the other two. One was directly over the Morro Bay power plant, the other was headed in a downward direction. We got the impression that they were either refueling using energy from the plant or were curious and were taking samples. We watched them for a while and then got our friend back into the car and proceeded up the mountain. When our car came around the sharp hairpin turn they must have seen our lights because the two that were down by the plant immediately zoomed up to the other three and in a perfect line they left the earth in a parabolic curve. They vanished in a matter of seconds at an incredible rate of speed and obviously did not want to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all very young at this point in time but all credible. We all saw the same thing.<n>

On the evening of  August 11 or 12, my cousin, his friend and I were walking to his friend&#39;s house. We were planning to camp out in the friend&#39;s back yard to observe the perseid meteor showers. The sun had just gone down, the sky was almost, but not quite, dark. We were walking from Lake Ave. to Lincoln St. On Hope St., along the way, I was looking up in the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of a meteor when my eye caught a pitch black disk, moving steadily from right to left (from south to north). I called out to my cousin and his friend, but they didn&#39;t see it, and I wasn&#39;t surprised as it was a black object moving against a dark blue sky (considering the sun had gone down but there was still a small bit of twilight) and if your eye wasn&#39;t already locked on it, it was very hard to pick up. But I definitely had seen it and it lasted just a few seconds. It was totally silent and at least 2000 feet high. Though this happened 35 years ago, I will never forget what I had seen that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in mid August 1968 is approximate.

I&#39;m 45 years old now I was talking to another old friend about that night and he told me that he and my older brother (5 years older than me) saw the same thing on the same night back in 1968.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My brother ran to his friends house about 6 houses away and told his friend about it.  They both attempted to take many photos of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had told many people on our block about it and there were around 20 people who were watching the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Brother and his friend were both in the photography club in the high school and of the 2 rolls of film they tried to take, not one picture came out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft itself had rows of lights that spun slowly in opposite directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was a bright moon that night and suddenly out of no where came 3 or 4 large saucer-shaped, disk-like objects that were intensely bright and could move rapidly in any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew swooping down towards the lake and lit up the whole area.  Across the lake were some high voltage power lines and these disks would intermittently hover over the lines and then fly over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience startled me because I was afraid that these objects might detect us and do us harm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told one of the boys that he should go get an adult because no one would believe us.  Another of the boys had a 9 volt battery powered flash light and he said he was going to turn it on.  I told him not to because I was afraid, but he turned on the light, pointed it at one of the objects and the flying disks rapidly flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was one of 4 witnesses and would never had believed what I saw.  I stand by this testimony as do the other 3.  I would really like to know what I saw and where these objects came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The weather was clear and warm, with no wind activity.  My boyfriend and I were parked on a quiet rural road star gazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10PM, we both noticed dozens of “zigzagging” stars on the extreme western horizon.  Fixated, we watched as these objects danced wildly across the sky.  Gradually they moved closer and closer, and by 11:00 PM were almost directly overhead.  We had the impression that these objects were observing US with ominous intent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this point, we were both absolutely terrified.  I remember him yelling “we have to get out of here right now”.  He started the car, turned on the headlights, and screeched away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left us quite traumatized, and we never returned to that area again.<n>

Late in the evening when darkness started to set in. A massive explosion of glowing colors lit up the sky.  Neighbors all around went outside and those who were already outdoors looked up to view it scratching their heads, asking one another if they had any idea what it was?   We were all puzzled and had no answers.  I watched from where I felt safe inside looking at it and everyone outside from our picture window in our living room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

Seemed to be emitting some sort of pale trail between each other occasionally.  All the people on the beach were watching.  Finally, all lights had disappeared one by one after about 4 hours.  I was about 15 years old at the time and wanted to post this to see if any other people present that night could remember and corroborate this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Eventually, he had me look at his right foot heel for some sort of splinter or spur that he thought was stuck in his heel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad had me probe his heel with needle where he thought the pain was.  I did this over the course of several weeks looking for this thing my dad thought he had in his heel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, I was able to dig out of my dad’s heel this silver looking metal chip or sliver of metal, it was thin and small but very visible.  It was metal or at least had a glint like metal, aluminum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few months later, my dad removed a piece of metal the same size, from my mom’s heel and my sister’s heel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had one in my foot pad that I took out, too.<n>
