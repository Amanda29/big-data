It was the size of a medium sized star and  fairly far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object caught my attention by leaving a bright yellow and orange trail down toward earth at about an attitude of 40 degrees above the horizon which lasted for about 20-30 seconds before it disappeared from the highest point of origin to the lowest.  It was round and tiny like a medium magnitude star and appeared at the time of the orange trail&#39;s disappearance and proceeded to move about directly East and perfectly parallel to the horizon, not appearing to lose any altitude at all.  I noted the time at the initial observation and it travelled eastward for 5 minutes before it disappeared over some high cirrus or haze.It appeared to be NNW of me,  perhaps over Orlando around a hundred miles away.I checked and there were no shuttles up that night.  I am a private pilot, a scientist and a weather spotter, with a degrees in Psychology and Education as well as having been recognized by Who&#39;s Who for outstanding career achievement.  I was advised to record this for posterity.<n>

AL  appx. 45 min. later. Because this is Public Hunting on National Forest he wanted to claim the spot for the last day of deer season. He planned to sleep in the truck until daybreak. When parked at the top of the mountain and facing west the glow of lights from the cities of Anniston (S.W.), Jacksonville (due west) and Piedmont (N.W.) are visible on a clear night which this was. Shortly after arriving he reclined the seat to nap but noticed a bright light over the city of Jacksonville.This he passed off as a bright star or the planet Venus. That is until the &#34;star&#34; started to move. He passed this off as a helicopter training flight from Ft. McClellan which lay just to the south of Jacksonville  in the Anniston glow of lights.  His assumption of a training flight was suddenly changed when this light darted at a humanly impossible speed to the north toward Piedmont. In less than a second the light hovered in the glow of Piedmont&#39;s lights having covered a distance of about 15 miles almost instantaneously.  After a few minutes the craft darted back so that it was again over Jacksonville.  This time he witnessed a beam flash downward. By now he had raised the seat from its reclining position astounded by what he was seeing. He observed the movements of this light for quite some time and in fact became bored and eventually drifted off to sleep.  After dozing for and an hour or so he awoke to the same activity in the skies to the west  This soon after changed when the light was approached by a larger and brighter one which came from the west.  The smaller began  moving around it in a way that is most easily compared to insects flitting around a light. This seemed to have served to convey some type of message because at that point the smaller light headed straight in my husband&#39;s direction. The larger light faded backwar! d in the direction from which it had come (that of Sand Mtn. approx. 4o miles WNWof Jacksonville.)  As the craft continued in his direction my husband chambered a shell  into his deer rifle.  This done the light almost instantly began backing away in the same direction taken by the larger as if it sensed danger. My macho husband who had for years treated my early 1970&#39;s sighting as a joke waited until daylight then raced home afraid that his headlights may allow the crafts to pinpoint where to get him in the future. He woke me as soon as he came in saying &#34;I won&#39;t ever laugh at you again&#34;.  He then related the story insisting that we report the incident. We called the local airports at both Weaver and Anniston.  They in turn referred us to the Airport in Birmingham who had no record of Military training flights that night.  My husband was able to tell them approximate times for commercial flights from Atlanta to Memphis  and from Birmingham to Chattanooga that had passed over during these events.  We were able to get the number for the UFO hotline from the Birmingham facility and filed a report that morning before 8:00. These events happened in the very early morning hours of Sunday, January 31,1996. Unknown to us at the time there had been numerous reports during the previous night and early morning. Similar sightings were associated with reports of cattle mutilations carried out with surgical precision in the Sand Mtn. area over the course of the next several weeks. Reports were filed by law enforcement officials, city council representatives and other such reliable figures.  The area was visited by  UFOlogists and there was quite a bit of press coverage. I believe this event had a profound impact on my husband. I noticed distinct changes in his personality almost immediately. He was better able to express his feelings and demonstrated increased patience and anger control. He also seemed more sensitive to the feelings of others. He seemed to sense when I did not feel well. I also noticed that he seemed m! ore protective of the children and me.  Although I have questioned the fact that maybe one of those beams got him he insists that it is not possible. He insists that he went to sleep during these events which I feel would have been impossible given his level of excitement upon returning home.<n>

I made a snack watched a little t.v. and then proceded to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon lying in bed for awhile with my head opposite to the window, I began seeing lights reflecting/shining on the wall. They looked similar to an ambulance a fire truck or police. Some kind of emergency vehicle. I remember thinking what the heck is going on here. I did live in a very rural area at the time and I know I didn&#39;t hear any noise of sirens relating to an emergency vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember lying there wondering what was going on. As far as I can remember I looked out the small window and saw nothing out of the ordinary...No emergency vehicle. So I climbed back in bed. Tried to blow it off as nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried going back to sleep wondering what the deal was. As I was lying in my bed I began to hear odd little noises. Quiet and suble. Kind of like voices, but they didn&#39;t make any sense. I heard some odd noise at the back door, but living in the country didn&#39;t think much about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I felt a un-easy fealing like someone else was in the room. I looked up and I swear to god I saw a figure, not much higher than my water bed. At very most the figure was 3ft tall. It was staring directly at me. I looked at it, and remember thinking I am not seeing what I am seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remember a sense of panic. I suddenly could not move. I remember trying with all my might to move, but I couldn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t move, couldn&#39;t speak or anything else. And I also remember be affraid for my life. I was never more affraid at that moment than I had ever been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I grew up out in the woods and in the country. I have seen wild animals, bear...deer...etc. Many people out of the area would be affraid of ther own shadow...in the great north woods so it takes alot to scare me. But I froze and can honestly say that I have never been more scared in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have mentioned this story to a few others and they just think I am full of it. I did mention it to a roomate the next day that was sleeping in another room that night and he told me almost exactally the same thing that I had witnessed. A little more vague, but with substantial similarities without me going into detail with him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally no alcohol, drugs or any other chemicals or stimulants were abused that night nor any time prior to that event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were bored one night ,which kept us at the hotel. We were all sitting out on the back deck near the pool. I have seen many objects before but my friends always laughed at me when I would tell them of such things. But this is what I needed to convince them. We were all facing the ocean, just like any northerner would do when they go to florida. It was a real dark ,clear night. I was the first one to spot the object. I pointed it out laughing and said &#34;look a ufo!&#34; My one drunk friend said oh thats just a kite. But how would you see a kite at night? And I could see how he could of mistakened it for a kite. It was round and clear but it had a glow within it. It spun around  and looked as if someone was controlling it with a string. then it stood completely still and took off with amazing speed out into the gulf.<n>

1/8/96 17:00|Langley (Canada)|BC|Disk|approx. 5-6 hours|A disk flew directly over my head. My mom and I continued to watch it for 5-6 hours.|2/5/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27341.html|41|ndxe199601| A disk flew directly over my head. My mom and I continued to watch it for 5-6 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date was January 8, 1996.  I was nine years old at the time.  It was a Monday... the Monday that I was supposed to go back for the first day of school after the Christmas holidays.  However, there was so much snow that the buses couldn&#39;t run so school was cancelled for the day.  I had been working on building an igloo an our side deck and was almost finished.  At around 5:00 (this is just a guess... it was dusk) I was kneeling inside the igloo when I heard what sounded like an airplane.  Living nearby to a small airport, I thought it was no big deal.  I then thought I heard a helicopter.  Not knowing what exactly was flying nearby, I backed out of the igloo and looked up expecting to see both a helicopter and an airplane, but to my surprise I saw neither.  However, I did notice something dark behind some trees that were located across the street in my neighbour&#39;s side/backyard.  It was hovering a little below the tops of the trees when I first glanced at it.  It then began to move up above the treeline at a very slow pace.  Once it emerged from behind the trees I could distinguish the dark shape of a disk against the slightly lighter sky.  It then started heading straight towards me and as soon as it had gone past the tallest trees it sank back down to it&#39;s original height.  It continued in my direction at an extremely slow pace.  As it began to fly directly over me, I remember thinking, from a nine-year-old&#39;s perspective, that it was strange that there wasn&#39;t a beam of light coming out from the bottom lifting me up off my feet.  I did, however, see three small lights that formed an equilateral triangle on the underside of the disk.  One was red, one white, and one blue.  After careful thought, I have realized (and I&#39;m fairly certain this is accurate) that the lights had some peculiar characteristics.  First of all, their brightness was constant and unchanging.  It wasn&#39;t as though someone was holding a flashlight that was blinding at one point when shone directly into my eyes... these lights were ! bright c ontinuously.  And secondly, despite the intensity of the lights I don&#39;t recall them illuminating anything else around me.  The disk flew past me and over the fence into my backyard.  Then one side dipped down, like the wing of an airplane, and it swung around behind the house and out of view.  Although it was a noise that initially caused me to look up, I don&#39;t recall the object making sound as it flew over me.  A few minutes later I went into the house and told my mom what I&#39;d seen.  My mom ran to the back of the house and looked out the sliding glass doors and saw that it was still in the backyard.  It&#39;d raised up to the height of our 2nd story windows and was gradually moving away.  My mom went upstairs as I started taking off my snowgear.  She clearly saw a row of windows lit up around the rim of the disk.  We continued to watch it for hours as it very slowly raised higher as it moved away from our house.  It wasn&#39;t until after 10:00 that we stopped watching it.<n>

As a retired USAF aircraft maintenance man I assumed that I was seeing landing lights since we were near the airport, however, they were more intense than I had ever seen and within 30 seconds or so, were near enough that I could distinguish 6 individual lights across the front. We had pulled onto the shoulder as had 2 other cars and were watching as the straight line of lights stopped and the object turned up at an angle and then we could make out a full 3D of a triangle shape that appeared to be larger than a football field. No sounds were heard from the object, however, the radio station I had the car radio set to inexplicably changed on its own to a different station. My wife was telling me to stop totally so she could get a better look, but instead I stepped on the gas and got the heck out of there as did the other 2 cars. To this day, I was nervous about mentioning this case to anyone and have advised my wife to not mention it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After that we drove the turkback to the fule center. I was looking toward the northward end of the runway and saw a UFObut ny brother didn&#39;t see it because he was looking the other direction while putting the ladder in the truck. It zipped across the sky at around 400 M.P.H and was bright green, really bright and it wasn&#39;t a plane, it was crossing the landing approach pattern. It came down from around 1000 feet to about 200 feet, then speed extremely fast westward while hugging the groung,about 150 feet above the local houses and dissappeared westward toward the bay. The object, to my caclulations must have been at least 70 feet in diameter and was circular. I am a current student as well as my brother in high school. I have seen many pictures of ufo&#39;s onTV and on the Sightings UFO report video. It looked similar to a ufo that I saw on TV that just zoomed across the sky in Mexico City.There was not any noise heard and the sky was very clear that night, the first clear day in about a week after large storms.I am not sure if anybody else saw it, but there wasn&#39;t many people at the airport in the area that we were in, but some peoplewho live in the houses next to the golf course, which is at the end of the runway towards the direction that the object was seen,might have seen the UFO. It was definately not a Learjet and didn&#39;t have flashing lights.P.S I will try to find a map and draw some pictures and e-mail them to you<n>

I AM CURRENTLY EMPLOYED AS A ((law enforcement officer)), BUT AT THE TIME I WAS WORKING FOR ((deleted)) YOUTH CAMP. I HAD JUST GRADUATED COLLEGE AND THIS WAS MY FIRST REAL JOB. I WAS ABOUT TO GET OFF WORK AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 HOURS.  IT HAD BEEN COLD AND WINDY ALL DAY, BUT THE SKY WAS CLEAR THAT NIGHT.  I WAS WALKING FROM MY WORKSITE TO MY VEHICLE WHEN I FIRST KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.  THE WIND, WHICH HAD BLOWN ALL DAY SUDDENLY STOPPED.  THERE WAS PLENTY OF LIGHT DUE TO THE CLEAR SKY AND THE MOONLIGHT.  WHEN THE WIND STOPPED BLOWING, EVERYTHING BECAME QUIET.  EVEN THE USUAL INSECT AND BIRD SOUNDS STOPPED.  THEN, I OBSERVED A SHADOW MOVE OVER ME, JUST LIKE WHEN A AIRPLANE FLIES ACROSS THE SUN.  I LOOKED UP AND OBSERVED A TRIANGLE SHAPED OBJECT MOVING ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE ME.  THE OBJECT WAS COMPLETELY BLACK, AND BLOCKED OUT THE STARS AND MOON.  IT MADE NO SOUND AT ALL.  IT SEEMED TO HOVER, THEN MOVE, THEN HOVER, THEN MOVE.  FINALLY, IT TURNED WHILE HOVERING, THEN IT QUIETLY MOVED OUT OF MY FIELD OF VISION.  WHEN IT DISAPPEARED, THE WIND STARTED BLOWING AGAIN, AND ALL THE USUAL NOISES OF THE FORREST RETURNED. I WAS UNABLE TO JUDGE ITS SIZE OR ALTITUDE BECAUSE I HAD NO REFERENCE BY WHICH TO JUDGE IT. HOWEVER, IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO BLOCK OUT SEVERAL STARS AT A TIME, AND CAST A SHADOW ON THE GROUND.  ALTHOUGH I HAVE WORKED AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER, DEPUTY SHERIFF, AND NOW A POLICE OFFICER, I HAVE NEVER BEEN AS AFFRAID AS I WAS THAT NIGHT.  WHEN I GOT HOME, MY WIFE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING BOTHERING ME. I TRIED TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT I HAD IMMAGINED IT, BUT WHEN I RETURNED TO WORK, OTHER EMPLOYEES INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAD ALSO OBSERVED IT. EMPLOYEES THAT WERE OFF DUTY IN THE ON SITE LIVING QUARTERS REPORTED THAT AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE OBJECT WAS SEEN, THE SATALITE TELEVISION LOST ITS SIGNAL FOR APPROXIMATELY 4-5 MINUTES.  I TRIED TO PUT THE INCIDENT BEHIND ME, BUT I NEVER FELT COMFORTABLE WORKING IN THE FORREST AGA! IN. I SO ON RESIGNED MY POSITION FOR PERSONAL REASONS.  I WAS ALSO AN AVID HIKER AND CAMPER. I HAVE NOT SPENT A NIGHT IN THE FORREST SINCE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is not an approximation.  PD))<n>

It flew relatively slowly. It had no apparent windows or doors, and was silver in color.I watched it for about 20 seconds, then ran inside to get some binoculars. I couldn&#39;t spot it again by the time I ran back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Size would be about one hundered + or - a small amount.  Completely blackened and traveling at about 35 miles per hour, no lights and no reflection other than off the upper edge of the fuselage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was anchored in tarpon basin which is just off the howard johnston restaurant and adjacet to the tower which placed the tower north by east of out boat.  This was in jan 1996 just prior to crossing to the Bahamas.  I got up to check out the anchor and went on deck as it was a clear warm night,looking up I noticed a line of white being reflected in a diagaonal formation to it`s line of travel looking and traveling somewhat like a flight of birds. A split second later I realized that it was a hard edge reflecting light back towards me ,but not down.  We sailors always have binocullars available so I was able to get a better view immediately.  Being 50mm lens and having good light gathering ability I was able to see the bottom somewhat,; it appeard featurless. At this point I called Connie on deck and gave her the binocs and she was able to see it also. At this time it was impossible to see with the naked eye.  I again watched it go slowely to the northwest  until it completely  blended into the night sky. It was easy to judge the hight and size due to it`s close proximity to the tower.  My background as a private pilot and having built and flown my  own planes and ultrlights allowed me to judge the speed.  As low as it was we both were able to trade off the glasses and abserve the progress.  I am a retired teacher and have been 22 years most of which  I have been captain and used to reporting factual reports.<n>

At 12:00-3:00, i woke up to my mom walking me and my brothers out to the front yard. It was a bright white light, it was spraying the whole mountain with a blue flash every 10 or 15 seconds. It was so bright white, that the glow around it was like beams. It sounded like a stampeed, but with loud birds and forest animals. Every kind of animal sound I think. Down the sidewalk was a black kitten spinnning in circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
