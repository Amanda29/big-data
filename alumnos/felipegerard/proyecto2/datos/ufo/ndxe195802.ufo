We were neighbors and good friends and we both lived about nine miles from Brighton. Neither one of us owned a car so we would hichhike home every time we went into town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as we were walking down Euler road and small talking about what we had done that evening we heard a low growning or sort of rumbling noise just over the tree tops to our right. We were just passing the Boys Camp when this occured. We became startled and could&#39;nt walk or talk, it stoped us dead in our tracks! We became scared as the noise drew closer. The ground was covered with snow and the moon was full, so it was easy to see. Suddenly a large object about the size of a small house apeared and seemed to &#34;glid&#34; over our heads from right to left. The noise had stopped and it glided over the road and across the lake. It was coming down by the boys camp and it looked as though it was landing. It was &#34;gliding&#34; but had no wings or propellars and it was&#39;nt a helicopter or airplane. We were close enough to see clearly and it was neither.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked as though the outer skin was glowing, kind of like &#34;glow in the dark&#34; toys we all had as kids. It was luminated from the inside but you could&#39;nt see inside it. We didn&#39;t see any signs of life. I was trying to remember everything that I saw but it was hard to see exactly what I was looking at because it was so low and close to us. It would have been easier to describe had it been a little further away. I did notice however as it passed overhead, small burts of &#34;fire&#34;  that seemed to come from what looked like &#34;seams&#34; near the rear of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disapeared in an orchard across Kellogg road and the other side of the lake by the Boys Camp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most people would have been sleeping at that time of morning in the country but if anyone else saw it, please let us know. This has haunted us for years and we both would like to know what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
