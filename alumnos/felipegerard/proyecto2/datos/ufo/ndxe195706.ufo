I was a child, sleeping in a sleeping bag in the back yard, and I think it was in the summer, when nights are warmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d often seen red lights, seemingly the size of stars, floating in the sky, but they&#39;d be blinking, which I&#39;d been told meant that these were airplanes – and sometimes, I recall, I&#39;d see a solid white light and a red flashing light in close proximity and moving in close conjunction – also airplanes, I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, this time I saw an UNBLINKING red light and a white light that weren&#39;t in conjunction at first.  One of the lights -- I think it was the red light – that looked just like a red star – was moving silently, perhaps more or less in a northerleasterly direction.  It approached what looked just like a stationary white star, and then seemed to hit the &#34;white star,&#34; which then moved in more or less the same direction that the red &#34;star&#34; had been taking, but off at a bit of an angle.  The red &#34;star&#34; kept moving, and may have continued in its course without altering its direction of travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case, both &#34;stars&#34; silently kept on -- until they were out of sight, I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They really seemed to be stars to me at the time, though I don&#39;t know how this could be the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An unclear thing in terms of my memory is that it could have been the &#34;white star&#34; that &#34;hit&#34; the &#34;red star,&#34; but I think it was as I mentioned above: that the &#34;red star&#34; &#34;hit&#34; the &#34;white star.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate.

6/30/57 03:30|Birmingham|MI|Unknown|5 minutes|Grey alien drills into my back when I was a child in the 1950's|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98464.html|6|ndxe195706| Grey alien drills into my back when I was a child in the 1950&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a True (two part) story about alien contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here goes Part One:  I was approximately 6 years old I believe,(not exactly sure) but it was the mid-late 1950&#39;s.  I resided in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan, with my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night I was awakened by the sound of muffled panicked cries coming from the other side of my bedroom.  It was my brother Mickey who was a year younger than me, and I became immediately and fully terrified.  I was facing the wall away from him, and I knew there was no way I would look in his direction, because I knew something or someone was in the room and from the disturbing intensity of Mick&#39;s whimpering noises, I knew it was not Santa Claus.  I did not move a muscle or make a sound hoping that whatever IT was, would not know I was there.  So I literally played dead, as I desperately did not want the &#39;boogey man&#39; to know I even existed.  My heart was pounding in my ears from fear, and my fears were not unfounded, as the next thing I hear is, “Look Out Jimmy!” , and I think Oh NO! He just told it I&#39;m Here! Now folks, those words sent me crashing into a terror, that in a few moments would increase a thousand fold, for I am lying on my stomach and suddenly there is a long fingered claw/hand planted firmly on the middle of my back/spine, ( a witches claw?  An evil Monster?!, I was going to die for sure!! I am not kidding folks; this was Thee most frightening moment of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I realize there is tremendous Heat coming thru its hand, so much so I could feel the heat coming clear thru my body, thru my chest/solar plexus area and onto the bed lying beneath me. And now shockingly, I am, without a doubt in my little boy’s brain, being stabbed to death with a knife as I felt the knife slowly &#39;corkscrew&#39; deep into my body, though I never flinched or made a noise. That was my brave but useless way of hoping it might think I was already dead!  Accompanying this penetration is a deafening noise in my head, a hissing type noise which I took to be the monsters breathing over me! The sound was sort of “haaaaaaaa” which only intensified my terror.  Please note, that during these moments, I was unable to appreciate the fact that it actually was not painful. What I felt was more of a thick bluntness turning its way into me. Not long afterward, I felt the &#39;knife&#39; come back out of me, I was shocked that I was still alive, though I did not want the &#39;invader! &#39; to know that. Then the heat stopped and its hand was removed from my back. And I Neither Made a Sound, nor Budged An Inch, Nor Opened My Eyes, Till The Sun Came Up!!  Before I finish this story, which is the second part. Let me make a few things clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  I Never for a moment forgot this experience, as it was clearly &#39;drilled&#39; into my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  For several days to a week, I snuck a knife from the kitchen that I was not supposed to have, and hid it under my pillow.  It was the only defense I could think of. But my mother soon found it, and took it away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  I do not have any conscious remembrance of the following day or morning.  But I ‘feel’ like we were probably told, “you just had a bad dream”, by our parents.  It would also be reasonable to believe my parents may have checked my back, and saw nothing.  Or if they did, they never told me so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  I Knew it Happened and I was Not sleeping, and it Was Not a dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.  As life went on, and growing up, I Never discussed it At All with my brother Mickey, and as an adult, I totally assumed he would not remember that night. He was probably five or six at the time. I was wrong about that assumption, as you will see in Part Two of this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Part Two: Fast forward from about 1957 to about 1994 or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in my living room, here in Montana, with my wife (my beloved, who passed away in 2006), entertaining ourselves by sharing ghost stories and strange experiences, etc. and between my wife and I, we had lots of events to weave into the conservation. I had just finishing telling the above story, when one of the group asked if Mickey had ever said anything about that night.  I said “Well no, I am sure he won’t remember anything”. But suddenly, for the first time in my life, I thought, “why don&#39;t I ask him”? I have nothing to lose, but I hope he doesn’t think I am crazy. So right then and there, I pick up the phone and called him. He was living in Portland Oregon. The following is the basic conservation that took place minutes later in front of my wife and friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Hello Mick, hey, were telling scary stories and I am going out on a limb here, but Mick, do you remember a night, back on Dorchester......? (That’s the name of the street we lived on as children) Well folks, I swear, that&#39;s as far as I got in my question, when he interrupts me before I can say another word and says, “Yeah, I woke up to find what I thought was Casper the Ghost &#39;floating&#39; over to the side of my bed and it was peering down into my face, with its hands held up in front and just above me. It had a big head and big black eyes, and I was completely terrified and totally freaking out. It just kept looking down at me and I was frantically crying or something, when finally it moved away from me, and went over to the crib that held Tim (my toddler age brother that slept in the room with us), and it raised its hand over the crib opening, and ITS Hand LIT UP!!! (I about fainted when I heard those words and the following: “Then it moved away from the crib and I saw it go over to you and I tried to warn you and I said “Look Out Jimmy!” as it bent all the way down over you and looked like it was touching you!!”  Well, I then told Mickey my end of the story (for the very first time), and of course the pieces of that puzzle now fit perfectly in my mind. He, however, remembered a few other details. He says he remembers some days/weeks afterwards, being taken to a doctor and having his brain x-rayed, because he said he was afraid to go to bed without the lights being left on, and he remembers night after night waking up shrieking with nightmares. I am sure my parents would have been very worried about him and he believes that for a period of time, he was under a great deal of stress, since mom and dad said “nothing happened, it was just a bad dream, and everything is ok”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of which makes sense as to why I would have been sneaking a knife under my pillow. Mom and dad, of course, would naturally have been reassuring us that it was just “bad dreams”, but I (we), knew,  that night was No dream, so that, I am sure, left us feeling very Unprotected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summation, I am sure now that Casper the big head, big black eyed ghost, was a visiting ‘Grey’ alien. What I am unsure of is what did it do to me?? I figure that it either &#39;fixed&#39; something in me, or, took DNA and /or left an implant, or all of the above? I suspect it left a tracking gizmo and took DNA, though of course, I don&#39;t know any of that for sure, but I since have had several uniquely close experiences with UFO&#39;s that occurred later in my adult life that lead me to believe we are connected somehow, for some purpose that I hope to understand perhaps sometime in the future? This is indeed a fascinating universe we journey upon. I thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely james<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/19/57 21:00|San Leandro|CA|Light|1.5 minutes or so|The night of Sputnik, a drag race in the sky of 5+ objects stole the show for us.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42676.html|11|ndxe195706| The night of Sputnik, a drag race in the sky of 5+ objects stole the show for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the night that Sputnik was supposed to be visible to the naked eye in my hometown of San Leandro, California.  The night was clear - no cloud cover at all.  My brother (about 11 yrs old at the time) and I (about 8 yrs) and our 16 yr old babysitter were out in the back yard, laying on the picnic table watching the sky for the spectacle of man&#39;s first craft in orbit! Sputnik was expected to be seen after dark in the southwest sky (going just over our fig tree in the S.W. corner of our yard.  The house was on the north side of the yard so we had no fear of any obstruction of our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we lay watching, we saw [no less than 5 nor more than 8 - I&#39;m thinking it was 6]what we initially thought to be our subject sighting.  The two problems were: a) there was more than just one object and, b)they were traveling from the wrong direction - coming from the east, traveling west!  Their time to go from the eastern horizon (which was the roof of the one story house of our neighbor to the east) to the western horizon (trees - quite a ways away) was about 1.5 minutes - possibly 2 minutes but not more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were quite bright but looked like Sputnik did when we finally DID see it - it was just where we expected to see it, too.  The objects had no specific formation but their flight pattern was direct: east/west.  No side trips at all BUT one ship or the other would race out in front of the group then slow and wait for the others to catch up.  This happened about 3 or 4 times while we watched them traverse our field of vision.  We called it the &#34;Dragrace in the Sky.&#34; We did talk about whether or not it HAD been the Sputnik, discussing the direction and number of vehicles, or had INDEED been &#39;flying saucers&#39; and decided we had been treated to a very special show before getting to see our (meaning earth&#39;s) Sputnik.  Seeing the first man made space craft was pretty exciting but, honestly, the &#34;dragrace&#34; pretty much stole the show that night - for us, anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I have wanted to tell my story since I was a boy.  I was 11 years old and asleep.  I woke up with vibrations in my body and a strong desire to look out my bedroom window.  It was a high window and I had to stand on my bed which was below it to see out.  We had 80 acres of flat land in back to look out on.  In the very back was a bright cigar shaped object that I some how knew was an alien ship.  I called it a flying sauser as that was the only term I knew that would fit.  I ran into my parents bedroom and woke them up.  I told my dad there was a flying saucer in the back yard.  He told me to go back to sleep.  I said, &#34;no it&#39;s real. Look!&#34;  He did and he saw it.  He called Soufidge Field (Spelling is probabbly wrong but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s still there) the military airbase in the Detroit area and asked them if they had picked something up on their radar.  When they asked why, he told them we had a flying saucer in our backyard.  They took his name and address and told him to go back to bed.  Right!  We loaded the shot guns and rifles.  The lights went out on the craft and it was dark in the back 80.  A few minutes later we heard foot steps on the porch and a knock at the door.  I opened the door and my father and older brother put the shotguns to the opening door.  The door opened and a cop was standing there staring down the barrels of two shot guns.  He asked what was going on.  We told him, and he said come outside and show me where.  We stepped into the front yard and pointed back to the area where we saw the ship.  He was taking notes on his clipboard and mocking us when all of a sudden the lights went back on on the ship.  It rose silently in the air about 100 feet or so, hovered a second or two and then rose quickly 10 or twenty feet and then vanished in an instant.  We all stood there in silence for a few seconds.  The cop went over to his patrol car and radioed in what he saw.  They told him to go back and investigate.  He said, &#34;Not me, you&#39;re not going to find my shoes in the morning.&#34;  He left, and that was that until the morning. Around 11:00 a.m. the &#34;Men in Black&#34; arrived.  CIA, FBI, Air Force, I don&#39;t know, but three cars pulled into the yard and my sister and I escorted the men to the back where we saw the craft.  The men weren&#39;t wearing black suits, but were wearing blue suits.  There were four men in suits, and two dressed in lab type suits carrying giger counters.  They found areas where they said they thought the tripods landed as the weeds were laid flat.  My father was at work, and my mother stayed in the house with my three younger brothers. My older brother was also gone somewhere at the time. The weeds in this area were tall, about three feet tall, and now were flat.  They took measurements. I don&#39;t remember the geiger counters going off. That was the last we saw of the &#34;Men in Blue.&#34; I had the same feeling of vibrations in my stomach a few years later when as a 17 year old, I was attending Interlochen Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan.  I told no one, but didn&#39;t sleep well that night in the cabin.  The next morning in the breakfast line, I over heard two of the counselors talking about the flying saucers they had seen last night.  They both said they saw a group of four flying saucers flying in slow formation over the camp.  It verified the feeling in my stomach and I worried that the aliens were after me.  I don&#39;t think they were, but at the time I was concerned.  Oh, also, one winter we had a huge snow storm.  I was 14 years old at the time. (Winter of 1960) and the snow was deep.  I had the same feelings in my stomach and was afraid to move.  I felt the aliens wanted to talk to me, or have me come outside.  I did nothing but lay in bed praying.  In the moring, the blowing snow from that night had stopped and had packed itself on my bedroom window in a thin layer. A pair of tiny bootprints could be seen on my bedroom window where a small alien had walked across my long window.   I thought one of my brothers did that somehow, and so I went outside to see whose foot prints I&#39;d find in the virgin snow.  There were no prints anywhere.  I was the first one to venture out in the new snow fall.  There were no prints anywhere in the snow, not even below my window.  The only fresh prints were on the side of the house and across my bedroom window.  I knew they had been there.  I can still see the prints in my mind.  They were small, about the size of a lady&#39;s  hand, shaped like a boot, and had ridges across the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

One of my ship mates was ((name, rank, and speciality deleted)) who previously had been stationed on the Sebago (a 255 ft. patrol vessel)  which was ((deleted)) home ported in Mobile.  He was one of the eyewitnesses who saw the UFO and was also the radar operator who actually tracked it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He explained the situation as follows:  The Sebago was conducting an Ocean Station Patrol in an area near Bermuda.  As was common practice during the late night hours, the ship&#39;s engines were stopped but still on-line and the vessel was merely drifting in the open ocean.  Around 2 or 3am a lighted object was spotted low in the sky off the starboard beam at a distance of only a mile or so.  It also showed up on the air search radar as being stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time there were several watch personnel on the bridge, including the Officer of the Deck.  They watched the object for several minutes before it started moving slowly in a circular pattern around the ship.  When it reached the starting point it suddenly headed away from the ship at a rate of speed which was beyond the capability of the radar to measure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The details above are approximations as I remember them and I am not not implying that they are totally accurate.  As a ((former)) Coast Guardsman, I have always been intrigued by this incident and would like to know if you have any data related to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for any assistance which you may be able to provide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name, address, and telephone number deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> E-Mail:  ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

I’ve been able to narrow the date down to 1957-1960 as I think I was 9-12 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I recall the weather on that day was quite foggy, so I am assuming that it was in the spring or early summer. I don’t recall where my parents were but I was in the house alone and heard a rather loud pulsating sound outside.  The closest sound that I have heard since then is the sound that an MRI makes.  The animals in the barn were making a lot of noise and the cat that was in the house was in a very agitated state as the hair on his back was bristled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and saw through the fog red and white lights that were about 45 degrees from the horizon. Almost as soon as I saw the lights, I started to feel extremely ill.  A similar feeling was when a broke my arm a few years ago.  My curiosity was more intense so I continued to watch.  The object started to move above me and then it continued moving in a West to East direction.  Within a matter of few seconds it disappeared in the fog in the Eastern sky.  The ill feeling went away as the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

She made a drawing of it for me before she died three years ago. She was credible as a witness, a mother of seven and not known to tell stories that were not truth.

I extended my arm with my thumb out and observed each object to be the size of the finger nail. This all happened in about 15 seconds. The objects were pitch black against a lighter background sky. Absolutely no noise, no lights, and no erratic movement as they flew over.

6/1/57 19:50|London (UK/England)|||10 minutes|On a Friday night in November 1957, during the showing of Wells Fargo on the T.V., my Grandfather came in to say that there was a Flyin|1/22/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11660.html|21|ndxe195706| On a Friday night in November 1957, during the showing of Wells Fargo on the T.V., my Grandfather came in to say that there was a Flying Saucer over the common in front of our house. This proved to be true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was young I lived, with my family, next to my grandparents house in Plumstead, London England. We lived facing Plumstead Common and, as my grandparents had a t.v., we used to go next door to watch Wells Fargo on B.B.C. every Friday night. My grandfather used to go over to the Windmill Public House on the far side of the common, in the evening, for a drink. On this evening he arrived home early and told us all that there was a flying saucer over the common. My grandmother thought that he was drunk but my mother, father, sister and I went to the front door of my grandparents house and saw a large, red flying saucer hovering right in front of us - at a height of about thirty feetand at about thirty to fourty yards away. The disk was about fifty feet in diameter at its widest part with a protruded central cabin area which was about twenty five feet in diameter. It had circular windows through which people could be seen and behind them was a central core - about ten feet in diameter. It hovered in front of us for some time and we could clearly see the people - not aliens - moving about inside. It started to move over the house so my sister and I ran through the house to watch it as it flew away but, when we looked - it had gone. The incident was reported in both national and local papers but were either &#39;rubbished&#39; or grossly distorted. I thought that this sighting was as spectacular as seeing a jet aircraft - nothing more or less. No-one had mentioned that UFO&#39;s did not exist and that what we had seen was a figment of our collective imaginations. I saw what I saw - and so did my family.<n>

6/1/57 10:00|El Paso|TX|Disk|5 to 7 seconds|The UFO did not make any sounds.  The craft's disappearance from the sky was like a blurr.|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23775.html|23|ndxe195706| The UFO did not make any sounds.  The craft&#39;s disappearance from the sky was like a blurr.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In June of 1957, I was an eleven year old and playing softball at a local El Paso, Tx southside park.  It gets hot in El Paso, Texas, so we started the game around 9:00a.m.  I had been designated to play shortstop and therefore was facing North towards the local Franklin Mountains (part of the Rocky Mountain chain).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a beautiful clear day with no clouds whatsover.  At approxiately 10:00 a.m. as we were out on the field, I  was distracted by a huge flying craft that &#34;hovered&#34; momentarily over the southern tip of the Franklin Mountains.  This circular disk was metalic and stopped in mid-air for about 2 or 3 seconds.  The craft had flown in from the Northeast area of El Paso.  After stopping in mid-air, the craft departed from the mid-air stop and disappeared in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds into the Northwest sky of El Paso.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The game was finished around 11:00a.m. and I did not tell any of my playmates about the flying object.  The whole episode seemed so unrealistic!  As I started walking home after the game, I noticed an Army Green Weather Ballon flying from the Northeast part of El Paso.  The Northeast El Paso area houses parts of Fort Bliss (Army base), McGregor Range (missle testing grounds, and further north of these installations, White Sands Proving Grounds (missile testing grounds), and Holloman Air Force Base.  Even as an eleven year old kid, I knew that I had seen a &#34;flying craft&#34; that others more mature than myself had also witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never publicly acknowledged this incident, however, 3-4 years ago, I saw a movie called &#34;Independence Day&#34;.  The huge mother ship in the movie resembled the flying craft in appeareance only.  The size of what I saw  was not that big.  I&#39;m now in my 50&#39;s and can still vividly see that UFO I witnessed some 45 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1957 is approximate.  PD))<n>
