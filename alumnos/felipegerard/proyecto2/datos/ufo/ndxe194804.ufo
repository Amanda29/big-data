My Mother brothers report sighting UFO too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the spring of  1948 in Kelseyville Ca. I was laying in a drawer on a pillow out side with mother while she worked, while my 6 year sister played nearby while Mom was hanging  clothes on the line a flash of light in the sky caught Moms attention and she watched a  silver disk with sunlight glinting on the surface of the craft.  The UFO  dropped down through the air moving back and  forth in a stair pattern, then it moved closer and closer until craft hovered over Mom and she saw a being in the  round  window, the Being had a sharp shaped face with pointed ears.  The middle of the craft stayed still while underneath the bottom of the UFO spun around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was silent except for the sound of the wind it created which pulled Moms dress and the clothes on the clothes line toward the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, the UFO began to rise back up to the sky about 300 ft where it began to wobble in flight then the UFO began to wobble and descend again.  The UFO dropped out of site behind the nearby mountain ridge, then there was an explosion and a fire and shortly after that, the forestry dept. made us evacuate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the beginning of a life long visits from UFO`s on our family.  My Mother brothers report sighting UFO too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
