1/31/03 23:30|Orchid Island|FL|Sphere|2 hrs|Dancing amber stars out over the ocean|2/5/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27541.html|1|ndxe200301| Dancing amber stars out over the ocean<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a security guard for an exclusive gated community and a retired police officer that is inherently skeptic about most non factual things.  This is my first known sighting.  I was on the oceanside of the beach club checking the club&#39;s beach access boardwalk.  I routinely look up and down the beach for small boats or boats out in the ocean because there is a lot of drug smuggling along what is know as the Treasure Coast of FL.  It was clear and the sky was full of stars.  In fact, I believe that night there was an alignment of planets, the moon, and earth going on.  I saw a light on the horizon of the ocean, almost due east.  I at first thought it was a fishing boat out on the gulf stream.  However, I noticed the light seemed a little high off the horizon for the mast of a fishing boat.  It was pitch black out there and all of a sudden, the light shot up into the sky going very high.  It looked like an amber star, a small star or one that is very far away.  I of course was astonished and began observing it.  It appeared to be stationary in the sky then all of a sudden it would move right, then left, and made loops like a helicopter.  This went on for awhile so I went back to my cruiser and got out the binoculars, 10X and focused them as best as I could looking into the black background.  I could tell this object emitted it&#39;s own source of light and had red areas on it&#39;s surface.  Sometime, when it would move I thought I could tell it was oval in shape, but I can&#39;t be sure.  I went to the beach gate house and had another officer go out on the beach and observe the object.  He came back stating, &#34;that thing is dancing.&#34;  I observed it later while locking up the building, standing on the second floor balcony of the beach club.  I locked my arms in a bi-pod position holding the binoculars in one position.  The object would move out of my field of view and come back.  I went on with my duties and at 0230 I looked for the object again but it was gone.  The next two nights I saw the object in the sky, almos! t due ea st, about 45 degrees from the horizon.  The third night I also noticed one, maybe two more objects at the same altitude that looked like the first object.  They were spread out going south down the coast.  The reason I am reporting this is because I believe my sighting is almost the same as two others on this board, Mokena, Il and McKinleyville, Ca.  I will say this, if I hadn&#39;t seen the object shoot up from the horizon into the sky, I could tell myself that these objects were stars and their movements could be optical illusions.  I&#39;m a believer now that there is something unknown going on.<n>

I was out walking my dogs in the back yard, when, as I looked toward the treetops, a huge, intensely colored neon-green sphere was slowly rising. Once it got above the tops of the trees, and was completely visible, it quickly shot upward even more, and within a matter of seconds had moved from one side of the sky to the opposite, leaving behind it a distinct crackling sound, much as a jet leaves a sound trail. For the duration of these happenings, the entire sky lit up neon green, and was, as I describe, brighter than day. I could see everything, and given the circumstances, thought we were being bombed. Once everything was back to normal, and the object was no longer visible, I could see flickering trails that were the same color as the UFO disappearing almost as quickly as they were able to be seen. This all happened within a matter of seconds, but everything remains so clear in my mind. As I went back inside to tell my family, there had been reports of transformers blowing around the county, and a wire down on a nearby street. These events seem peculiar to me, and though there could be some rational explanation, I am very skeptical. I know what I saw, and I&#39;ve never seen or heard of anything that comes close to being like it, especially not the fact that the entire sky was brightened even past the normal daylight we are all accustomed to. I leave it up to the readers of my &#34;sighting&#34; to come up with a logical explanation to this, whether it was something &#34;explanable&#34; or in fact a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous, providing just an e-address.

It was just hoovering, over the top of the trees, we looked at it because it look very strange in appearance nothing like I&#39;ve have ever seen before.  We look that it for about 20 to 25 seconds, then all at once it took off at a great speed, faster than any aircraft could ever move, I&#39;ve never seen anything move that fast before it was like in a blink of an eye and it was gone.  We looked up in the sky all-around and we saw nothing.  We do believe what we have seen classifies as a U. F. O. unidentified flying object.  Because to Me any aircraft that was in the sky flying would still have been visible to the eye.  In this case there was nothing.<n>

Many fast moving &#34;balls of energy&#34; appeared with one coming once every 5-10 seconds. Unlike meteors they moved at angles upward toward the sky and some looked very close up (within 50 feet), while others looked very distant in the horizon. The objects moved fast, but left no trail and would dissipate or disolve quickly. Phenonemon continued for quite some time over a pretty dense area, so I&#39;m sure others saw this. Objects varied from whitish to yellow and orangish tones. Objects made no sound and moved in straight lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

While I&#39;m on the phone I tend to look out at the sky and clouds.  Today I looked up at a contrail and immediately noticed something moving near it -- a pinpoint of light, like a satellite, but obviously a satellite can&#39;t be seen during the day!  The light was on a very steady trajectory from N/NW to the S/SE, moving about as fast as a satellite would.  I thought it might be a mylar balloon, as it was moving in the same direction as the cloud-level winds but slightly faster than the clouds, which were higher (i.e., the light was seen against the cloud backdrop -- it was partly cloudy).  But within seconds, I noticed another light, following in a straight line behind it, and I put my fist up to see how many degrees apart they were.  If my fist is 5 degrees, which is what I remember from astrophysics class, then they were about 2 or 3 degrees apart.  Then I noticed a THIRD light, equidistant from these two, so that they formed a string of three star- or satellite-like lights traversing the daytime sky.  I watched until they disappeared to the left from my window view -- a few minutes.  Because there was sun in the east, I could have been seeing a reflection off mylar or other metal, but I couldn&#39;t say with certainty that they were not self-luminous either.  And because they travelled in a straight line and were equidistant, I find it hard to believe they were mylar balloons, unless they were connected by a very long string!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Correction to report<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a correction to the report I made on 1/31/03.  For one thing, I may have entered 1/31/02 by accident, but it was 1/31/03, the same day I reported it.  Furthermore, I had forgotten that a fist-width at arm&#39;s length is 10 degrees, not 5, as I guessed in my initial report.  Therefore, the distance between the first and second object, and between the second and third objects, was about 5 degrees -- about half a fist-width at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.

When I looked again without my binoculars, I observed the object move east untill I couldn&#39;t see it any more (this took about 3 minutes). I stayed up the rest of the night to see if the object came back, but this did not happen. The next day I went to check with the residents of the houses near the area where I spotted the object and they did not observed or heard any strange things in the sky. They did hear a loud rumbling noise, wich lasted longer than normal compared to normal airliners, but did not pay any attention to it because they thought it was one of those old Russian airliners, wich isn&#39;t strange when you live close to a large airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

While looking in the sky I saw a white light flashing up really high in the sky, I thought it was a star at first. Then it started moving across the sky, within a few minutes it was on the other side of the sky, looking like it was about to circle us. It hovered and then zoomed off at the very beginning. The light would flash, we didn&#39;t see it for a few seconds and then it would come back. There was no noise at all. We have a few seconds of it on tape, when we could catch it.<n>

It was a very clear night.  I was watching a small airplane’s lights traveling due west, when I noticed a V-shaped series of white lights above it, moving in the opposite direction (East).  It looked like a boomerang formation of 7 or 9 round lights.  It was higher and less clear than the plane and had a halo around it, as if it was in some thin clouds (perhaps it was).  The V was moving much faster than the airplane - maybe 5 times faster (not accounting for differences in distance from me).  Shortly after I caught sight of it, the V turned right (south).  It did so abruptly and without much of a curve through the turn.  When it changed direction, several of the lights seemed to rearrange themselves - as though they were discreet objects in a formation, not fixed to one single object.  They did so very quickly - spontaneously - to go from a eastbound V to a southbound V.  The wedge flew south into a part of the sky that was bright from city lights, and I lost it.  It made no sound I could hear, and no one was with me when I saw it.  The whole event lasted 20 to 30 seconds at most.  I have no idea what it could have been.<n>

Tonight I was driving to my daughter&#39;s play in Spanish Fork, Utah.  I was facing North. The sky is cloudy tonight.  I saw a beautiful blue sparkling light, like 4th of July sparklers (but not sputtering or leaving sparks) in the sky.  It was below the clouds over the North end of the city.  It had a smaller red light exactly like the blue one either attached or in close formation to it.  I watched the object for those few seconds it was in view and looked around for others who may have been watching the same thing too, but saw no one.  There was a large spot light, like the ones at Car Dealerships when they&#39;re having a big sale, trying to follow it.  &#34;Trying&#34; is the key word here, because this object was moving so quickly that there was no way the spot light could catch it.  The sparkling blue light sometimes changed colors to a beautiful green.  Sometimes the red one either would go out or maybe it was in back of the big blue/green one.  I&#39;ve never reported anything like this, but I found myself saying out loud, repeatedly, &#34;I am looking at a UFO!  I am looking at a UFO!&#34;  I know what I&#39;m about to say sounds crazy, and maybe I am unaware of the maneuvering capablities of helicopters, however, this moved with such grace and so quickly, I only saw it for approximately 5 seconds.  It was initially traveling across my field of view from the west to the east and then it reversed direction.  First it went up at a 45 degree angle, then made this tight loop, then moved straight across (west to east), then another turn to reverse its direction to go back the same way it came, only lower, then down with the large (ground based) spot light trying to follow it all the while.  I didn&#39;t hear any sound.  An hour later a helicopter kept flying all around the city.  Anyway, you don&#39;t have to believe me, but I know what I saw, and I&#39;ll never deny it.  It happen! ed and I know what I saw.  If you have any other reports about this tonight, I would really appreciate hearing about them.  Thank you for your time.<n>

The light was circular and apparently motionless and seemed to be the same altitude as the planes.  The light had no contrail.  The planes were so distant that I observed no motion[only over a period of time as with a clock&#39;s minute hand].

I first thought of Mars and I stood admiring its brightness and color.  I then noticed that it began to move.  I stood watching and waiting to see some sort of a beacon to identify it as some type of plane, helicopter, blimp or weather balloon etc. It then moved across the sky with a bright, orange, flame colored glow.  this took about a minute as it moved slowly.  I didn&#39;t think much of it yet because it moved slowly.  I called my wife who was inside watching television and she wasn&#39;t impressed at all until it suddenly disappeared.  My first thought was it disappeared behind the marine layer but then we noticed that stars in the same area were still visible. She then noticed that it re-appeared on the horizon to the south.  We both watched it again for about 10 seconds before it again disappeared.  We were both still skeptical and I went inside to get the telephone to phone my father.  I went outside again after a 2-3 minutes and my wife soon followed and this time I searched and saw nothing. I turned to go back in the house and looked up to the east and saw the same orange glow quickly approaching our direction at a low altitude.  It moved westwardly across the sky and at that altitude and we saw it pass over us and noticed that there was an outer edge that was spinning slowly in a clockwise direction. We were able to see this because of the orange glow underneath appeared to be lighting up some type of marker in a square shape that rotated. We both watched as it moved west and after about 15 seconds it disappeared.<n>

I ruled out a weatherball, a commercial aircraft or a surveilance plane because the President of the US was in town that day.  It was facing southeast.  Then either my road turned or it disappeared.  My outdoor temperature thermostat in my car was constantly fluctuating within 20 degrees as I drove that evening.  Usually it is only a 5 degree variance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness in this case would be construed to be highly reliable.  PD))<n>

It was just after dawn, when only Venus and the moon were visible, and I was walking the dog on the deserted beach here in Mazarron, S.E. Spain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look up to see directly overhead a bright white light moving very slowly west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not high, by that I mean not a satellite, but I am not able to estimate how high. I got the impression it was about the height a light aircraft might fly, and it moved at about that speed. The light was very intense, and did not change intensity, and there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 1 1/2 to 2 Min&#39;s. as it progressed in a straight line eastwards. I thought I might see its shape as it moved towards the bright morning sky, but I only saw the light, and lost sight of it in the distance. What direction it came from I do not know, but I always look up at the sky and certainly saw nothing before seeing it overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing this report with NUFORC.

Unclear what these lights were my friend said, What is that? It was certainly flying to fast to be an airplane and no sound was heard. As it got closer to us we both said, it looks triangular or V-shaped. Flying in a west/north direction then in a north direction.  Finally, in an north/east direction when the lights suddenly disappeared. Within seconds my friend noticed the lights at the original point of sighting and heading in a east/south direction, seconds pasted and again disappeared.  I drove off in my car, entered the freeway in a west direction.  Suddenly, when I looked up in the sky there was the triangular shaped formation hovering motionless.  I called my friend on my cell phone and she too confirmed what I was looking at.  Finally, the object flew again in a east/south direction and lost sight of it.<n>

I had thought that as it went into the lighter part of the ske I might get to see a shape, but I saw only the light untill it went out of my sight in to the morning light.

Initally I saw two lights surrounded by a large amount of smoke...at first I thought it was a traffic helicopter having problems.  As I continued to watch - the lights seemed to rotate.  Next I saw three lights in a straight line and the smoke disappeared as the lights took off - about the speed of a commercial jet.  I pulled over and watched the lights move high into the sky (what I would say was higher than a commercial aircraft flying pattern in our area) and south until didn&#39;t see them anymore.  I had about 5-7 mile visibility from where I pulled over.  I didn&#39;t hear any noise, and I would estimate the lights were about 1/4 mile away from me and maybe the equivalent of 10-15 floors (as compared to a building) off the ground.<n>

It appeared to be located approximately in the direction of Mount Bachelor.  We watched it for 15 minutes until it dropped below the rooftop line of our neighbors house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one single disc/saucer type object observed that was stationary for the fifteen minutes we watched it. Skies were clear.  It was staionary although it was dropping some in altitude to eventually dropped below our neighbor&#39;s roof top which was our viewing area and certainly moving away from us as the vision got smaller in that fifteen minute period.  It was as if it was going sideways as it did get smaller and did drop in altitude a little, but appeared stationary at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was fairly large as seen at a distance,(hard to determine how far away it was) had a rotating outter circle of lights all the way around the saucer and the lights would change colors from green, to all red, to all blue and to all white.  Most of time, I observed more all red, or all green and these light rotated the whole time.  I was thinking to myself, just like they make it seem in real life or in the movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had time to get our glasses and also binoculars to take a better look.  With the binoculars it was strange to only to be able to see a white undefined mass.  Kind of like a thin white mass/cloud-like in the darness.  I thought that was strange. Obviously you could see it with the naked eye, but there was some sort of field that made it unobservable while trying to use another type of viewing apparatus. Thought about taking a picture of it, but didn&#39;t.  Glad there were two of us that viewed it, so there is no question that we saw what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it dropped below the rooftop line of our neighbor&#39;s house, we didn&#39;t pursure it any more.  As far as backgrounds of the observers - I am 49 years old and a professional by occupation.  The other observer is a 20 yead old college student who was home from school for a few days, and had been studying late.  He originally spooted the thing and brought it to my attention.  Interesting, yet kind of scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never believed in those things before, but I certainly have to change my stance on them now.  Either that, or our own government is experimenting with some type of contraption in the wee hours of the morning when they knew most people would be asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  The object seems inconsistent with a celestial body, since a star or planet in the southwest sky would appear to &#34;rise&#34; as the Earth rotates to the east.  However, the star, Sirius, which is very vivid during the winter months, would be in the southern sky at 0200 hrs..  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  PD))<n>

Although it seemed to be still it was rotating and yawing as a boat in choppy water.I noticed that one half was spherical and the other, trapizoidal or like a ziggurat. The spherical side resembled a planet and when the geometric shape was in view it looked not unlike a weave. There were black spots on it and what seemed to be high protrusions. The last I saw,at 07:15, it was on an east- west orbit and at this time should be near the west coast.

I stopped to get some Chinese food. I got my order, walked to my car and I got a feeling to look up because of the very clear blue sky that day. I looked up into the blue and stared for about 3 sec. and there they were, 4 ufo&#39;s flying in formation/parallel, white and disk shaped. There were two in front and two in back . The two in back were a distance from each other. They came to a stop for a second or two and quickly returned to the formation. They were high in the blue sky. Higher than the chemtrail planes. They were not F-16&#39;s, Drones or any conventional aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen. There was no sound or sonic booms. They were cruising from North to South at a slow pace. I grabbed my 8mm video camera to get a shot and lost the sight of them in the blue. I had a good visual for about 8 seconds and the feeling I got was that they had authority to obsurve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, so we are unable to contact him, and request permission to view the tape.

It was a boomerang shaped object that was covered in various colored lights, and had many pinpoint lights...like what planes have on their tails.....but there were lots of them. It sparkled like a diamond in the light. It moved in erratic and figure eight patterns n the sky, like no known aircraft. It hovered in the night sky moving in erratic patterns, then would move quickly below the line of sight...almost like it was landing....then appear again in the sky. The colored lights were briliant...as were the almost sparkling pinpoint white lights. Ive seen airplanes and helicopters...and neither would be able to float in such patterns as this craft. I was delivering pizza when I became transfixed by this object in the sky. I estimate the body was between 30-50 feet in width.<n>

They went in the same path untill around 9:30 when the two brightest ones dissapeared. The dimmest one kept going for about ten more minutes befor dissapearing.

The angle of the craft was about 50 degrees and approx., three major blocks south of my location  at about 1500 to 2500 feet above the ground.  I had to drive with my head out of the window in order to see it clearly.  I pulled over to get a better view, and noticed that it had no blinking lights and was not making a sound when it slowly drifted south.  I was trying to determin if it was a helocopter but the shape of the object fluctuated slightly from an egg or oval shape to a blurred oval or egg shape.  The object was clearly greyish and matted, not shinny or illuminated.  The path of the object was stable and straight and had a steady speed.  I say that it was travelling at 35 to 40 mph based on my ground speed.  Ieventually lost sight of the object as it drifted closer to the hills.<n>

It was a clear blue sky outside and I was sitting in the backseat between my kids looking out the windows.  I was looking around when I saw a white spot in the sky out the left window.  At first I thought it was a plane, but then I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving.  Further in the distance to the right of the object I saw an airplane flying leaving a white trail behind it.  This kind of helped me notice it was not moving.  Then I thought I might be a star, but it looked to big for that.  Plus the plane and this were the only two things in the sky that I could see.  No other stars.  Looking at it I noticed there was a sort of white, cloudy smoke around it.  Almost not noticable.  The object looked like someone took a pencil, dipped the eraser in some paint, and tapped it on the sky.  The color of the object looked like the same color white a very thin cloud might have. I was looking at it, and wife asked me what I was looking at.  I said I didn&#39;t know, and she made a joke that maybe it was a ufo.  I pointed at it to show her and told I didn&#39;t think it was a plane because it wasn&#39;t moving.  She looked but said she couldn&#39;t see it.  I looked at her, told her look where my finger was pointing, and looked back out the window where I was pointing.  It was gone.  I looked all around where I had seen it, but I couldn&#39;t see anything.  It was like it was never there.  I looked away for only 1 or 2 seconds to make sure my wife was looking in the right direction.  The car hadn&#39;t started moving yet, and the airplane was still in site.  It happened very quick.  But it was bigger than the airplane for sure.  There were lots of people around on foot, in cars, and shopping, so someone else might of seen it, but I don&#39;t know.<n>

The craft was larger than an a commercial airliner, flying at a low altitude and did not appear to be moving.  It was hovering just west of the highway, near a business park.  There was a fair amount of cloud cover in the sky, but pretty bright due to the city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we neared the object we were able to look up at it and see it in silhouette against the clouds.  The object was a perfect triangle.  My companion pulled off to the side of the road and we got out to the car to look at it.  Several other motorists also stopped to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had white and yellow lighting -- initially these lights were blinking and running along the back side of the triangle only.  After watching the object for approximately 20 more seconds it began to move slowly southward toward San Francisco, and as it did, all three sides of the craft lit up.  These lights were blinking and then moving in a sort of pattern around the edge of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 5 seconds after it started moving, the craft disappeared (in an area where it still should have been completely visible and free of the clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

However, I do believe in life beyond our planet and no, this is not a report based on my being an X-Files fan. I did not have any alcohol in my system and what I and my fiancee saw was as real as these words I now type. We had extremely cold conditions tonight due to the freeze that has hit much of the south. My fiancee and I were leaving our home at 1850 hours CST to meet a friend for dinner. We are both college professors, lest anyone doubt the validity and reality of what we saw. We live on the east side of the city where few if any street lights are lit. Our driveway runs north/south. We were walking from our north facing front door to my sedan to our right (east). My fiancee said, &#34;Look up, the stars are so beautiful.&#34; I did, and at that moment as were looking toward the eastern sky, approximately 60-70 degrees above the horizon we saw what appeared to be another bright star, only moving. This light (star) moved to the left (north) of the constellation Orion. I knew the constellation well--Orion&#39;s belt and his inverted triangular upper point stars and his lower standard triangular lower point stars. This star-like light seemingly moved slowly north. It had no trail of a comet, did not travel quickly and leave a streak as a meteor or meteorite. The moving light was as bright as the surrounding stars, moved awkwardly, but mostly in a straight line. This star-like object did not blink in patterns as an airliner might, was not blinking red and green as a lower flying aircraft, it just stayed aglow. Then as it appeared to travel north-northeast, the light diminished in intensity, then faded as if losing power? switching itself off? or climbed higher out of the earth&#39;s surrounding atmosphere into space. The light flicked out. There were absolutely no clouds in the sky; the heavens were clear. We went to dinner shaking our heads, but we both agreed that the object we saw was real. In fact, when we arrived at our dinner location, we looked u! p toward the eastern sky again and saw two aircraft, one flying high and blinking its steady strobe flying westbound and we witnessed another low-flying aircraft with visible red and green lights as a comparison to our original siting. I truly believe what we saw was not an aircraft, meteor, meteorite, or satillite. This object had none of their characteristics. I hope other individuals saw this event in this part of Louisiana because I never would have believed this as a young boy, but I definitely can attest to this sighting, as well as my fiancee, that it was perfectly and absolutely real. We are still discussing the event even after telling our dinner friend; NOW, we are having a glass of wine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object may have been the ISS/Space Shuttle.

It was a cold still night, and I was singing along to a cassette of the &#34;Mamas and the Papas&#34; on my car stereo. I just passed over&#34;Stephentown Creek Road,&#34; when something in the sky caught my eye. Ahead of me and to the right, just above the tree line, I saw two round white lights. They were much bigger than any stars and they appeared to be coming towards me in a south-west direction. I checked my car mirrors to see if any other vehicles were on the highway. There weren&#39;t any, and I immediately slowed my car down to about 10-15 km/hr. As the two lights approached it looked like big bus headlights in the sky.  I thought to myself,  &#34;What kind of a plane or helicopter has two white lights like that?&#34;  I&#39;m not too knowledgeable about aircraft, but I&#39;d never heard of anything with two big white lights. Then I noticed that there was a smaller red light blinking between the two white lights. It started on the inside of the left light and &#34;blinked&#34; its way to the right light, and continued this pattern back and forth. At closer look, I realized that there was also one small red light that stayed consistently lit next to the right white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was flying slowly and just over the treeline (approximately 2-3 telephone poles high). I quickly checked for traffic again, and then flicked on the high beams of my car, because I thought it might help me get a better look at this thing. I didn&#39;t stop the car, but I was driving so slowly I was barely moving. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes; it was a black equilateral triangle right ahead of me above the road. The triangle was exactly even and equal in length on all three sides and each of the three angles. There was a large white dome light steadily &#39;glowing&#39; at each of the three points. Each of these round dome lights were about the size of a half-volleyball. None of the lights were actually shining a beam of light on anything, or even casting a radiant light for that matter. I could no longer see the red blinking lights at all, and I wasn&#39;t sure if these glowing dome-lights were the same lights as the headlights or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly put my window down and stuck my head out. As it passed over my car I got a very good look at the bottom of the craft. It was flying point-first towards the Kingston Mills Locks area. The black triangle was actually very dark grey and almost shadow like above a very distinct 3-Dimensional black shape directly attached to and under the triangle. It looked like something out of a Star Trek movie! It actually had arrow-like points at each of the three corners. After the point, the shape made something like a small inward rectangle, then outward to a larger rectangle shape, back to a small inward rectangle, and then to the next point. Each side was exactly symmetrical to itself and to each other side. It struck me how slowly it was moving (maybe 40 km/hr), how low it was, and how small it was... it would easily fit in a school gymnasium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing that crossed my mind was that perhaps it was some sort of military stealth-like plane. I thought whoever that is, is so close they can probably hear &#34;Dream a little Dream&#34; playing on my stereo. I considered turning the radio off, but I didn&#39;t bother. Maybe it would draw their attention to me; then another thought crossed my mind; would that be a good thing or a bad thing? What about a real UFO; and possible abduction? I didn&#39;t feel scared, though, especially since none of those &#34;stereotypical&#34; things happened to my car. No stalling, or dimming of lights, or weird radio noise. I noticed two sets of car headlights coming towards me from around the next corner of the highway. I thought, &#34;Good, those people have got to be able to see this thing too!&#34;  I felt better that I probably wasn&#39;t alone in the &#34;sighting&#34; and I just continued around the corner. The strange craft never stopped or hovered, just continued slowly on its course towards the area of Kingston Mills Locks. I did not see the craft from behind. I looked at the clock in my car, and it read 6:21. Since my clock is set exactly 8 minutes fast, it would actually have been 6:13 pm. I noticed the next street sign that read &#34;Isle of Man Road&#34;. The whole incident probably lasted less than two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very excited about what I had seen, so I explained it and sketched it out for friends immediately. They asked me what it sounded like. Sound had never crossed my mind. I told them that I did have my stereo on, but I didn&#39;t notice any sound at all coming from the aircraft.  I also made note that I hadn&#39;t noticed any sort of big wind or anything like that. It was certainly a bizarre experience, and I will certainly never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This account was written on Monday, January 27th, 2003 (3 days after sighting) and  the diagrams were computer drawn on Tuesday, January 28th, 2003 from memory and from the sketches I made immediately after sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that drawings are approximate renditions only.

I have read extensively about this &#34;project&#34; online and in news sectors. Apparently the US military is developing a laser-based high energy beam system for disrupting/destroying satellites in orbit, they are also developing satellites with optic shields to prevent the same happening to our own. My guess is what people are seeing are tests being conducted on orbiting satellites and nothing more. Theoretically, a beam of concentrated light is fired at an orbiting satellite in the hopes of disrupting sensitive onboard navigation systems, thereby rendering it useless. By the same token, we are also protecting our own from the same possible fate by shielding any and all sensitive gear, including optical lenses, etc. It&#39;s just a guess...but seems likely. Any project requires some form of testing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE TO WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. ((message deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your message and comment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect our government is working on high-energy lasers, and other beam weapons.

The night had a light cloud and so I think that the lights of the craft or possibly each light was a craft flying in formation took on a larger(than the actual light source) hazy glow. The sighting consisted of approximattly twelve outer circle/oval light formation with an inner circle of approximatly five light formation.  The lights rotated all tagether first in aclockwise manner and then in inticlockwise manner, about five seconds each way, this was repeated continually.  I actually felt afraid, I have children and it seemed eother huge or lots of craft and seemed quite near.  We bothe went back to bed after about three minutes of watching I got up a couple of minutes later to look and it had gone.  My feeling is that it was one craft because it moved as one totally but it coud have been lots,  I could not see any outline of a .  I was not of this earth&#39;s tecnology.

While on corral road I noticed a very bright light south of where I was. I thought maybe it was technicians working on mt oso but when I got though the canyon of corral hollow road and onto 580 there it was. It was hugh, just sitting hovering about 500&#39; or so of mt oso. it was a large something with red lights blinking along the bottom of the craft. It also looked like the center of it had walkways or sky walks. I never stopped and as I connected with highway 132 towards modesto I can see it pretty good. I thought it was maybe tower or crain crews but no way. I know it wasnt a helecopter because I have flown on them and it wasnt a plane because it looked nothing like a plane. All I can say is I saw somethig that I have never seen before. There was other cars that had to see the sam thing. It was pretty wild.<n>

It was an orange glowing mass a few miles away that was shifting shapes.  Smaller masses would break off and re-join the glob of light.

They all stopped at one point and made a shape i believe to be a triangle. Then one by one they all went to the same location and slowley vanished. Since then i have senn them on many occasions. A couple weeks ago i saw three more but this time they appereard to be dropping something, it was the same color as the craft and it was making popping noises and they all flew towards the direction of the ocean and just vanished one by one than last night i saw another it would move very fast and very slow. They all look the same an amber color. There are no blinking lights just solid they look like mars but moving and stopping. I have never seen aircrafts move like this.<n>

It was very cold and the night or morning sky was clear.  For the past two mornings just before sunrise I have been seeing a brightly colored moving object off to the west. I thought it was a plane or something but this morning I found out different! It was out this morning and it was closer to me and appearing and disappearing but moving toward me.  It came to about 100 feet of my car and stopped.  I could not beleive what I was seeing!  I got out of the car and saw a craft, green in color with a large  frosted white dome on top of it.  It was hovering about 20 feet off the ground.  I could see movement in the dome shape fixture on top but saw only vauge shapes but there was very definately something or someone in this object. I got in my car and drove off at high speed as I was very scared.  The object made a swing above me and moved off to the east at a very high speed.  I know I saw this this morning and am very puzzled on what this could be.  I thought his would be the place to report this.  I will make a drawing and send it if you like.

It was so close to the ground, I noted it was in the typical gray livery.  This isn&#39;t unusal howeverm  because I leave near Minneapolis Internetional Airport, that has a military base, national gaurd, and Airforce.  I glanced at the Gerneral Electric Alarm Clock which is next to my bedroom window, the Time was exactly 2:54, as the min just changed.  My window is facing north, but I can see a large view, because its the second story, towards the St. Croix River Valley.  I live on a hillside, and it is very open.  It was a clear night, with moonlight which reflected off the ice and snow.  I glanced out my window to see the typical 777, or other Northwest Airlines Airliner enroute to the airport on a decent path to MSPIA.  however, a loud sound was rumbling in the vally, the Jets were out of sight at this time.  I saw a object in the distance about 1/2 a mile away from my house.  Visabiliy was very good, and I could see River Falls, Wi, 8 miles from my house, nice and bright.  I saw, what appeared to my at the time  (and dismissed as) a helicopter, hovering with very bright lights, I thought maybe an accident was on Hwy 29, and it was the MedEvac Helocopter, but this wasn&#39;t any helicopter I have seen before.  It was very hard to makeout, but it was just one very bright light, no green and red tail lights.  As I got out of bed, and looked closer (approch the window) i noted it was a triangular thing (best way to put it) As I watched this thing hover back and forth for about one min, the sound of turbine engines got very loud, enough to wake up my dogs.  The military aircraft reversed direction in a loop and headed towards the light.  They very very close the the ground, but gained altitude quickly. As they flew over my house, the object got brighter, then shoot like a metoriod accrose the screen leaving a trail like a con trail left by a jumbo jet, however this light left a trail that lasted about 30 seconds.  A! s the Mi litary Aircraft approched the trail, they broke formation, and went out of sight.  At first I thought,  it was military training, but after I thought about it more, it was very unual.  That day, I was talking about airplanes with my friend, who lives closer to River Falls, in the Area of the craft,he saw the formation, and the light, and talked to one of his friends at the hospital, and their  MedEvac helcopter stayed ground all night.  He also saw the trail, and a glow (aura) that stayed in the area for a good 30 seconds.<n>

Just as I reached the small lake on the right, I put on my high beams as I stopped and something walked out and stopped and blocked the left light for a second. I looked and saw a grayish color and thought it was an animal. I realized it was walking on 2 legs. The feet were small with brown/black on the side. I got scared, as it walked or wobbled (like an ape) across. When it reached the other side, it stopped and looked at me waving it&#39;s skinny arms with lights behind it. It turned looking over it&#39;s shoulder, and notice more of it. It definately was gray, about 6 ft tall. It&#39;s ear was about 5-6inchs wide, about a foot long coming to a point. The ear itself was tanned, with the inner ear a dark brown. On the base of the ear he had about 10 brown hairs? hanging from his ear laying ontop of one other. Eyes were dark black, with no apparent nose from the angle I was. It was cold that nite, and didn&#39;t see no breathe. The mouth was small with a small strip of red/ with a silver strip on top. I got scared and drove away. I looked in my mirror and saw it standing there still. In the wood it was bright like they were lite up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.

Partially clear night, wispy high clouds in some places.  Immediately was staring at two very huge, bright amber/orange lights.  They were to the southwest of my house, probably five miles away.  They were very low on the horizon.  Possibly as low as 3000 feet.  They were stable, did not move in any direction, did not fade, did not blink.  I stared at them for over 10 minutes to confirm this.  Off in the distance from Luke AF base or Phoenix National Guard came four helicopters or planes (I couldn&#39;t tell which)very fast.  Just as they arrived close to the two amber/orange lights, they both disappeared, as if someone turned off a switch.  The military aircraft circled for awhile, then flew off after 3 or 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for replying to my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope it&#39;s not too late, but unfortunately I need to retract this report.

I OBSERVED THEM FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES, THEN THEY SEEMED TO REVERSE THEIR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, NOT TURNING AROUND MORE LIKE BACKING UP. WHEN THESE LITES GOT LIKE FROM JUDGING FROM THE TREE LINES IN THE DISTANCE , I SAY ABOUT A HALF MILE NORTH OF ME AND LESS THAN 1000FEET OFF THE GROUND, ALL THEIR LITES WENT OUT FOR A SECOND OR 2, THEN ABOUT WHERE THE 3 BOTTOM LITES HAD BEEN THERE WAS A SEQUENCE OF 5 0R 6 STROBE LITES, FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, TWICE, THEN ONE BRIGHT FLASH FROM THE LEFT END AND RIGHT END LITES. THEN NOTHING, IT JUST WASNT THERE.<n>

Here is a brief out take of the conversation; Sighting Time; abt. 5:05pm Duration; 1 to 1 1/2 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Direction; West Object path; Travelling from north to south 20 degrees off horizon. ONE object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altitude; Approx; 20,000 to 30,000 feet estimated Weather; Partly cloudy, temp 48 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance; Approx. 2 miles Witnesses; 2//sighted from N. Portland Rd and Haysville Rd. Salem, or.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (((Object Video Taped for abt 45 sec.)))) Witness description of the object was cylintrical shape, round and long, brightly lit colors of orange/yellow. Object emitted a flame out the rear of the craft unlike any normal commercial a/c would do, to the extent of 6-7 times the length of the object itself. Again witness described the object as rounded cylinder tube shape, dark grey, which was noticed through his Canon Video cam, which had a zoom of 800X power. Witness also claims that object was moving across the horizon faster than a normal commercial a/c would fly, going from the North to the South abt 20 degrees off the horizon at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness called several law enforcement agencies, and some news stations, KPTV Fox News aired the tape abt 6 am on the 23rd of Jan. 2003, they still have the original tape, which will be returned to witness soon. I have asked the witness for a copy of the video which will be availible soon. Witness also stated showing the video tape of this strange object to local Military Reserve troops, and their claims were that they could not identify what kind or if the object was any a/c they could identify, and they were as curious as to what it was as the witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This investigator will follow up on this case and look at the video tape for further details as to what it may have been, thus far, it is unidentified...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ron Wright,Director, TRIAD RESEARCH Colo.

We will withold judgment on this case, until the tape has been reviewed by the investigator.  However, we observe that a major norht-south air traffic corridor is located just west of Salem, and the time of the sighting is correct for the setting Sun to be reflected off a contrail behind a commercial or military jet.

I randomly looked up and happened to see a craft with three lights in a straight line with a blinking light underneath the object, so at first i would think this is a plane or what have you. but then i noticed it was just hovering near the 495 interstate. then the craft started to float to the right for a bit and then floated to the left. so i got in my car and see if i could get closer to the craft. when i got to the main road i paused to see if i could still see it. i looked as i saw it hover for a few more seconds,and then it darted away from me in unbelieveable speeds. let me remind you that i did not hear any noises, and usually when helicopters and planes are near i can hear some noise.  Also i reported a sighting on April 25, 2000 in these reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

As I watched one plane heading south to north I notice a formation of 4-5 lights flying north to south.  The altitude was higher then the commerical airlines fly if their about to land or have taken off and yet the lights where as bright as if much lower.  The sky was extremely clear as I live in the country.  This formation flew silently until it reached the Orion constellation at which point as it was crossing it (from my vantage point) the formation disappeared.  I stood there for 5-10 minutes looking for any tail lights of planes in that area and saw nothing. I saw a plane in the north and a small craft far south east but nothing of the formation. Unfortunately I was by myself and had no witnesses.  I spend a lot of time looking at the stars on winter nights and this was very unusual.<n>

At around Newark, exit 13A, which is also the location of Newark International Airport, I saw five fire balls with a tail heading west towards Pennsylvania.  At first I thought it was meteors.  I continued to look.  Then these apparent objects shifted its position in a way that would rule out meteors.  These objects flew much higher than any plane I ever saw.  As they passed over the airport, airplanes were either taking off or landing. As my bus continued south, I could see these objects shifting side to side but heading west.  The person sitting next to me, a total stranger also saw these lights and could not explain what they could be.<n>

We dismissed this as wind blown ice. My supervisor drove off and we began to as well. My partner and I then noticed an object in the southeast sky that was in the forground with 2 jets in the background both showing contrails. The object appeared to be oval and very white or was reflecting the sun to a high degree. It looked to us as if it was traveling away from us as it was getting smaller with no side to side deviation from its course. We have both seen alot of aircraft both jets and props, and this was not a famlier &#34;look&#34; to the object. We were both watching it for about 2 mins when suddenly it appeared to go out of focus as if it was caught in the shimmer over heat sources. We both said at the same time &#34;did you see that!?&#34; The object then began to glow very brightly for 30 secs then faded again and rapidly dwindled away going up and showing no contrail. My partner said he thought there was a glow around it but i did not see it except when it was bright. We both watched it till it dissapeared in the distance. WE work for a parks dept and spend aalot of time outside and there is a military airbase very close to us and are used to various air craft in our skies<n>

It looked like a pitch black moon. It wasn&#39;t emitting any light or reflection whatsoever, only a single small white light underneath. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was flat, or spherical; or the size, because I wasn&#39;t quite sure how far away it was? It was too big to be a balloon, too still, and too perfectly round. It was really foggy out, so I&#39;m suprised I could see it at all; I couldn&#39;t see anything else, not even the stars. As we drove away, it stayed in place, and didn&#39;t follow like the moon does. It appeared to be rising up, out of sight (or perhaps we just got too far to see it).<n>

However, because of the background of the witness in this case, we make an exception.  This is one of two high-quality reports submitted by the same source.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Connection between my vivid dream and reported sighting of crescent-shaped ufo over Huntsville, AL?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing a June 2003 report of a crescent-shaped ufo over Byrd Spring Lake in Huntsville, AL (~3 miles from my home), and not knowing the details of the second sighting of the crescent-shaped object, prompted me to submit the following diary entry I wrote with respect to a &#34;dream&#34; I had in January 2003.  It took me weeks to stop thinking about my dream and I still wonder about it even now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I am a 40 year old mechanical engineer with much NASA and DOD design experience, have an avid interest in aircraft and flying machines, am happily married with two children, and am mentally stable.  I am very scientific in my approach to problems/solutions and take great care to apply my knowledge of engineering and science to the world around me.  I do believe that we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting a sketch of the object seen in my &#34;dream&#34; via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My rather lengthy diary entry is as follows:  Just so I can remember later I will document a &#34;dream&#34; I had the other night.  I can not say I actually observed what I will describe, but the vivid detail of the dream, the fact that I could remember so much of it, and a power outage that left both myself and my wife with an inexplicable &#34;weird&#34; feeling about the power outage that night makes me wonder if maybe it really happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the night of January 21, 2003 (morning of Jan 22), my wife and I were awoken by a strange beeping sound coming from somewhere in the room.  This sound reminded me of the sound that our old answering machine would make to indicate the end of a message.  The beep was periodic and would beep, then be silent, beep, silent, etc.  I remember about three or four beeps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was becoming conscious, my wife said &#34;what&#39;s that&#34;, and I said I don&#39;t know&#34;, to which she responded &#34;the power&#39;s out&#34;.  About that time there were no more beeps to my recollection.  We both were very puzzled as to the nature of this power outage, for some unknown reason, and felt there was something odd about it.  The baby monitor we&#39;ve been using, has battery back-up on both the transmitter and receiver side should there be a power failure.  A day or so later, I tested this feature by unplugging both the receiver and the transmitter power supplies and observing the result.  The battery back-ups worked fine and there was no beeping.  The monitor, nor any other device in the house of which I am aware, emits any sound when the power is off, or when the power cycles on and off.  (At some point in this whole incident, I noted the time to be around 3:00 am, must be after the power came back on??)  When I was aware enough of what was going on, I decided to get up to check on the kids and peek outside to see what was happening.  I do not recall that I actually checked on either of the girls, but I do remember leaving our bedroom into the upstairs hall and looking out the front Palladian window.  I noted that the street light was off and it seemed very dark outside.  The lights in the valley were on, so it appeared to me that the outage was isolated to our street.  At some point I remember that I realized the power came back on and that the street light was re-lighting.  My wife may have said &#34;it&#39;s back on&#34;, I don&#39;t know.  I think I remember getting back into bed, and maybe that I used the bathroom, first (I can&#39;t be sure).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of itself, the previous seems ordinary, I admit.  When I awoke in the morning, I recalled a &#34;dream&#34; or &#34;dreamy event&#34; in vivid detail and could not get it out of my head.  This is very unusual for me since I normally can not remember 99.9% of my dreams no matter how hard I try. This is one of three dreams I can remember in any detail for the last 15 to 20 years or more.  They all may be related.  My memory of this &#34;dreamy event&#34;, as I refer to it, is not complete, but I can remember many striking details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a north-westerly facing Palladian window, which is in our two story entrance foyer.  When in the second floor hallway/balcony, one can look straight out the window.  Otherwise, it is 14 to 20 feet above one&#39;s head, from the first floor.  Although I can not remember exactly when in the night this happened, or time-wise, how it relates to the power outage, I remember looking out the Palladian window and observing a deep red light shinning down from above the window.  The color of the light was not quite ruby red, it had a quality to it that hinted of a touch of purple/violet added to it, but not enough to move it very far from a pure red color.  My oldest daughter has a lava lamp that gives off light of roughly the same hue.  The light was diffuse in nature and seemed to emanate from a point above the house and possibly centered over the house.  From the foyer and hallway, no source could be detected.  There was also, what seemed like another light of exactly the same color that was flashing on and off with a steady period; it also seemed to emanate from the same unseen source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember walking down the stairs and looking up and out of the said window trying to determine the source of what I was seeing, but not being successful.  I also looked out the library window, to the north, and observed the same lights illuminating the trees outside that window.  Something led me to believe that I could get a better look if I went out the back door to look up.  The angle of the light, perhaps told me its source was closer to the backyard than the front. The next thing I recall was standing on the sidewalk to the back porch with my gaze turned toward the house, and up toward a point over our master bedroom.  I was in awe of the sight before me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hovering over our house was a very large disk-shaped craft.  I thought several things to myself at that instant. &#34;I&#39;ve got to remember what this thing looks like&#34;, &#34;I wish my wife was here to see this&#34;, and &#34;for it being in the 20&#39;s outside, I don&#39;t feel cold, in fact I&#39;m very comfortable&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My recollection of the technical details of what I was seeing at the time are more sketchy than I would like, however, here is what I can recall.  I would estimate its diameter to be approximately 30 feet, based on a quick mental comparison to the house directly below it.  The disc was hovering, completely motionless, maybe 20 feet to 40 feet over the house.  On its &#34;belly&#34; for lack of a better word, were what I recall as 6 lights arranged hexagonally with respect to one another, with a 7th light in the dead center of the craft.  The centerline of the hexagonal pattern of lights was inboard of the outside edge of the craft by approximately 4 feet.  The color of the 6 lights was the same red color I have already described, although at this point, none of them was flashing, they were steady and not extremely intense.  I don&#39;t think I could look directly at any of them due to the nature and quality of the light they were emitting.  I seem to think the light in the dead center was white.  All the lights appeared to be the same diameter and looked as though they were fixed and non-moveable/non-aim able.  I don&#39;t remember the diameter of each light, and can&#39;t remember if they took up a large portion of the available real estate on the craft&#39;s bottom, or only a small portion.  I seem to remember them as relatively small in diameter.  There may have been additional white lights, a sort of annular ring around each red light (I don’t know for sure).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The contour of the bottom of the craft and its thickness escape me.  I want to say it was very flat on the bottom and, at least, had a thin edge.  The total height and top side were not able to be observed from my perspective.  I made my observations in what seemed like only a second or two before the color of the lights changed; to what, I don&#39;t know, I want to say white.  The craft lifted higher into the air and rotated 90 degrees, or so, counterclockwise and pitched upward 5 or 10 degrees.  If I could have put a line on the disc pointing N NE, that line would have now rotated to the W NW. (direction of flight)  As the craft performed its rotation and changed its pitch to a more skyward angle, I observed 2 additional structures.  On top of the craft I could see a portion of a long, thin rectangular object oriented longitudinally, along the &#34;direction of flight&#34; (as described by my imaginary line, above) and positioned above and through the center of the craft, as if being lifted and supported by the disc. The rectangular object had a square cross section that I felt was in the neighborhood of 3&#39; by 3&#39; and a more broadened &#34;tip&#34; that gave the impression of it being a &#34;cockpit&#34;.  (Although I never felt it was a cockpit, that&#39;s just an easy way to describe its appearance).  It was (based on the 3&#39; cross section) about 6&#39; long, by 5&#39;wide, by 5&#39; tall centered left and right, as well as up and down on the rectangle.  The sides of the &#34;cockpit&#34; portion were flat and straight while &#34;nose&#34; was radiused and sloped both up to the top and down to the bottom surfaces with an angled portion (see sketch).  Looking at the color and sheen of the material gave me the feeling that the structure was made of a charcoal-gray ceramic material.  The finish was dull and lusterless, although very smooth and perfectly flat.  The structure was one contiguous piece of material with no seams, windows, rivets, etc.  It was perfect as though it was &#34;grown&#34; into that shape.  The &#34;cockpit&#34; portion of the rectangular object was outboard of the disk enough that there was a good separation between it and the disk (4&#39;???).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second structure I observed was at what could be described as the aft end of the assembly.  This was crescent-shaped object, in the same plane as the disc, made of the same material as the rectangle.  Top to bottom, the thickness was the same as the rectangle (3&#39;???).  The bottom surface was very flat and I could not see the top surface, but assumed it was equally flat.  The crescent inside radius was offset aft (with respect to the direction of flight) of the disk by the same amount the &#34;cockpit&#34; shape was forward and its radius was equal to that of the disc plus offset.  The outside radius of the crescent was such that it caused the crescent to look like a waxing or waning moon with a taper starting at 0 to a max width about equal to the offset between the crescent and disc (4&#39;??).  I did not note any attachment between the crescent and any other part of the assembly, it was just &#34;there&#34;.  I could not viualize the area between the disc and crescent as there was not enough light  The crescent looked as though it could be slid toward the craft and cradle it.  The chord length of the crescent looked to be the same as the diameter of the disc.  The surfaces of both the inside and outside radii were both perfectly flat and seamless.  The bottom surface of the crescent appeared to be in the same plane as the bottom of the disc.  Based, again on comparison with the house, I estimated the total length of the assembly to be around 45 to 50 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These observations were made in only a second or two.  As the disc rotated and pitched upward, the other structures only became visible as they apparently reflected some light.  I remember wondering why I could see them, since it was the middle of the night, but just assumed streetlights were the light source.  I also remember thinking &#34;so that&#39;s how they do it&#34; in relation to the dark rectangular and crescent structures and I knew for a fact that the disc was &#34;driving&#34; the whole assembly; the rectangle and crescent were there only for the ride.  As the craft  pitched up, I waved &#34;goodbye&#34; as if the occupants were good friends and it streaked off at amazing speed toward the West.  There was a very slight high pitched sound that it made as it left, similar to that of the sonar ping from many popular war movies, except without the reverberation.  The sound was pure, momentary, faint, and trailed off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember, it was morning.  Later in the day I discussed the &#34;weirdness&#34; of the power outage with my wife and she agreed there was something odd about it, but what she did not know.  I asked her if she had seen any lights that night and she answered that she thought it was the utility company.  Later, the day after that, she had no recollection of seeing any lights.  For a whole week following the &#34;dream&#34; the inside of my mouth was raw and dry and some of my molars hurt.  (I assumed that eating cashews was likely the cause, but I continued to eat them and my mouth cleared up).  A week later I spoke briefly to our neighbor, directly across the street, and asked her if anything odd had gone on with respect to the outage and she said that not everything had been without power and that one of her clocks was flashing 9:30 when she got up, and based on the time of the outage should have said 3:30, or so.  A few days later I was speaking with another neighbor, two houses up the street, and she had mentioned that there had been a power outage (I verified with her that that was the same outage) and that their transformer had burned out, leaving them and three other houses without power for over 8 hours.  The utility company attributed the transformer burn out to too much current draw on too small and old a transformer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no evidence to suggest that any of this happened, or could have happened.  For all I know, it was just a vivid dream and concerned a subject about which I have an interest.  I wanted to document what I remember because I still think about it over a week later.  I NEVER remember my dreams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ******* PLEASE CONTACT ME ONLY VIA EMAIL, IF NECESSARY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

I figured It was probably a news helicopter because of rush hour traffic &#34;logicaly&#34; Still I have never seen a plane or heli. do a steady SLOW beat, like a large search light going off and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got to my house In lynnwood washington, and saw two close yellow lights just over the trees behind our house, looked like a 747 when they are faced at you flying twards you so at that time it wasnt to odd to see because of our location &#34;airports ect. , but the craft never crested over those trees, it actually went down like either moving away or dropping in alt. Soo.. after I changed to go play HALO at a friends house I witnessed the last part of the sighting.  My brother was with me and I was about to get into my car when I saw the same two yellowish white lights coming from the right of the trees this time I watched it for about 10 seconds then noticed no sound and told my brother to get out of the car and look at this, he did and by the time he got out of the car it was over head and had three yellowish white lights in a perfect triangle , as it went over head I couldnt hear anything, but as it was past us to the North we started to hear what sounded like a low frequancy jet type sound but very quite and very low.I was exstatic because I have witnessed a triangle craft that to me was a UFO.  After we calmed down we started to drive the two miles to our friends house and on the way about halfway, we both witnessed another strobe search lite craft, I was alot closer this time it and thought it might have been the tail guy saying OK your through everything back to normal in the sky?? After I started thinking about it for a day I got to thinking the first strobe object we saw might have been the clear craft to clear the way for this huge triangle craft and the last strobe craft was to close the line so to speak or bring up the rear. Kind of like an over sized load on the freeway with the start car and the back car maybe, now if that is true then what we saw was probably human craft but MAN was it kewl and ill tell you alot kewler then the old stealth bombers!! ohh one last thing I forget to say at the time the triangle craft was over our heads my cat jumped into my car and refused to come out of the back, I was starting to get weirded out because I had to drag him from the back and hold him, he was shaking and apeared scared? maybe someone has some insite on what is REALLY going on contact me at ((e-address deleted))<n>
1/20/03 15:30|Byron Bay (Australia)||Sphere|7 minutes|six spheres emerge from cylindrical cigar shaped cloud|3/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27975.html|102|ndxe200301| six spheres emerge from cylindrical cigar shaped cloud<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting beside my pool looking out over the hillside. It was a fine day with no rain or thunder that day but about 20% scattered light white colored cloudes. While I was watching, a black cylindrical cloud formed, about 3/4 of a mile long and about 100 or 200 yards thick. This was the first cylindrical cloud I have ever seen, and the ends were almost square. It looked like a cigar shaped cloud.<n> <n><n> Have you ever seen a smoke ring blown from a cigarette? Well next a cloud shaped like a smoke ring<n> <n><n> formed, about 400 yards diameter. This smoke ring shaped cloud formed directly over one end of the<n> <n><n> cylidrical shaped cloud. This stationary smoke ring shaped cloud looke look like a single coil of rope, and was rapidly rotating like a smoke ring, with an active torroidal shaped flow. It was rotating at about one revolution every 45 seconds. The cloud ring was rotatintg so that the inside of the hollow, cirular shaped cloud ring was moving downwards and the outside of the cloud ring moving upwards, so I assumed while watching, that it must be very cold in the centre of that cloud ring.<n> <n><n> The cloud ring was directly above one end of the cylindrical shaped cloud, and then some flashes of<n> <n><n> light appeared between these two clouds for one or two seconds and then a clear sphere shot out from<n> <n><n> where the flash was.  The sphere curved upwards to the left and then disappeared or dissolved from sight. It retained its shape while it disappeaared, it did not shrink, but disapeared in a fraction of a second. The spehe was in view for about two seconds. I found it hard to believe what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> After 20 or 30 seconds another flash of light and another sphere shot out and curved up to the right and disappeared like the first one. Then several more flashes of light and several more spheres shot out in similar fashion at 20 or 30 second time intervals. Each sphere went in a different direction. All the spheres came out at about mach 5, so that they covered a mile in about one or two seconds. All came out straight and then curved away.<n> <n><n> This was all happening about three or four miles from me, about half a mile up.<n> <n><n> The third sphere left a black contrail, a mile or two long. This contrail was very black in color, just like the very black cylindrical shaped cloud, and not like the white clouds elsewhere in the sky. These were the only black clouds in the sky that day. The smoke ring was white in color. The contrail left by the third sphere started where the spheres appeared from and exactly followed the path of the sphere. This contrail formed in one or two seconds but remained for some minutes, showing the exact path of the sphere. None of the other spheres produced contrails. About six spheres came out in total.<n> <n><n> I did not report this untill after I read that other people had seen similar spheres.<n> <n><n> The color of the spheres seemed clear or silver, it is hard to describe the exact color. They appeared to  be about 30 or 40 meters in diameter.<n> <n><n> After the last sphere came out the smoke ring shaped cloud stopped turning and the cylindrical shaped cloud and the smoke ring cloud both disappeaered within two minutes, so the total time from appearence of the clouds to disappearence was about 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> These were not saucers or elipses or triangles, but perfect spheres. When they disappered, the retained their shape and size, and did not disolve by getting smaller.<n>

We have windows in our house that are very large and everywhere. I got something to drink and sat on my couch. Pearing out of my window  I witnessed 3 large teardrop like crafts floating about a few feet higher than the top of my house. There was a glare surrounding the outside of them. One was higher than the two and in the middle... and the others were lower and on oppisite sides of the middle one. I could tell they were spinning. All three of them were spinning towards the right of me. I stayed opened my back door and I heard a sound. It sounded like a loud humming sound. I was shocked because this was the second siting I&#39;ve seen within two years. The same thing came to my attention though. They were white and had a glowy look to them. After i gawked at it for about 4 minutes they started to get a little higher and took off at what seemed to be the speed of light up into the air. It left a trail of a redish white streak of light that faded away within seconds.<n>

I had mentioned to my husband that at any given time of day or night, there would be a minimum 3 planes in the sky view.  Traffic from Denver to Salt Lake City etc.  This was not a plane. I saw a round light through the first of three large panes of glass in my bedroom. I thought what a bright star, huge. I watched, it seemed to be moving, so I thought satelite.  No, this was skirting left, up, down &amp; right not dramatically but noticeably. It was in the distance, how far I don&#39;t know but close enough to see the back and forth movements. I watched it cross to the second pane of glass, still bright. No flashing lights like a plane, of which there were three I could see in the same sky area. It wasn&#39;t consistant moving like a statelite would very high in the sky.  This was a bright round moving light.  As it entered the third pane of glass, I woke my Husband to ensure someone else could see this.  He did, very clearly and he saw the darting motion...then poof !  It disappeared, we both gasped and confirmed what we saw.  It didn&#39;t drop, or speed away, the light went out - poof.<n>

I then noticed it was moving west from my vantage point. I could tell that whatever it was, was moving, although it was extremely slow. It sometimes appeared to split up into two different shapes, and then back into one, somewhat resembling aircraft in formation flight. It appeared to be between 9 and 28 thousand feet.It moved very little from where I first saw it, and then appeared to stay in the same relative area. At times it would &#34;split up&#34; although the second light never moved very far from the initial one. It would then rejoin and then hover. I assume this to be some type of aircraft(s)although a light that bright would not be needed at that altitude nor required. It was a cross between a planet and that of an aircraft landing light. I&#39;m not a believer in the whole UFO phenomenon and still aren&#39;t but this is worth noting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It traveled from East to West diredtly over head at about 75 degrees from straight up. I was at the back edge of my house and could only track it about 90 degrees in the sky, but it covered this distance in about 4-5 seconds. An F-16 at about 1500 ft could do this but I heard nothing and it was no plane. It was dimly lit,and seemed to be lit more in a triangular shape, I/E at the corners, and covered the area, that to the first nuckle of your thumb would cover. It was over very quickly and I was left there thinking, &#34;what in the hell was that?&#34;<n>

This object is a strange gold light it comes alone some times, and other times with another gold object just like it. On New years 3 object appeard and formed a upside down pyramid. The first time I have seen it was on december 7,2002.When the object comes it throws down balls of gold lights from it, and i also have tapes of not only orange balls falling from it but objects comming from the sides of the object that look like stars. it apears almost everynight, throws balls of light then disapears, my parents, and sister have seen this object. We have over 30 tapes of this object including very close tapes. it is about sky level then gets real high and vanishes. From seeing this object everyday, and taping it I have noticed that it appears to look like a cross on the bottom and on the top a parashute looking device that moves around it like a pendulm. It can travil very fast at times, and very slow at times, it can hover,and make a sudden reverse backwords without making any noise.It goes very high up, and very low down when it wants. The last sighting of this obgect was on January 18, 2002 at 6:20 pm which I manged to tape. It apeard again right after that sighting but this time when I reached for my camera it disapeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Their is these gold lights that appear almost everynight, they appear somethimes one light, and other time 2 or 3 lights. The most I have seen were 3 lights, they appear sometimes and fly by, and other times hover. They throw down what appears to be smaller gold lights, and I even managed to capture stars comming out from the sides of each not once but multiple times, and these stars stay long after the ufo has gone. This may sound like a joke but I have captured these ufos on tape over 30 times, and seen them over 40 times. I have also filled out a report along with others on your site. The tapes that I have, I belive are very good. some close ones. I have been watching the Los Angeles news channels and even our public accsess channels and they dont mension them, anyways I have the tapes of these objects I would not like to send them in the mail, I would rather either visit you, or you visit me, you might even get to see them yourself. It seems like the area that I live in in burbank is where they appear the most.

At that point on my drive, I was in La Jolla, California.  I looked up in the sky, and hovering above the hill to the right of me was a U.F.O.  It was enormous. There was no loud sound, because i opened my window to see.  But because of the traffic i had to keep moving with the traffic.  I thought at first that the large object was a blimp and that i was mistaken or perhaps that it was even a plane. But the object was extremely low to the ground and hovered over a local neighborhood.  It was almost a circular shape, but hard to tell because I was trying to look up and out of my windshield in my car.  The U.F.O. had 3 blue light that were placed on the edges of the object and one small red light in the center. This object was way too low to be a plane and was moving very slow in a forward motion, but going south in san diego, while i was going north. I was only able to see the objct for about 1.5 to 2 minutes since i had to pass it in the car.  I was stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We just spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded quite sincere and credible to us.<n>

I froze in one spot to see if it was me or the object and  it was the object moving. I also was looking at the star at the same time and it moved tward the star and then moved up from it.

I wrote what he told me down in a journal and posted it on an internet message board. My report is just as I recorded it on paper and is as follows...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son said he was sitting up in bed looking out the window. He said he could not sleep last night because he had a dream somebody was after him. Anyways, he said he saw a jet fly by. He stuck his head up against the window to watch it as it flew over head. Then, he said he noticed another jet that he happened to spot in the light of the moon. He said it had smoke coming out of. It looked like a missle. He also said it was &#34;flying all crazy&#34; and that he &#34;didn&#39;t think the driver was paying attention.&#34; He said it looked like it flew right into the moon. He said that as he was watching it, he thought &#34;oohhh, that looks like it is going to crash.&#34; (he is repeating the story as I write this) Then he says it just crashed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was very detailed in how he describes the crash.

However, we also recognize that different people have different degrees of training in the field of writing, and being able to compose a written description with the ability of a university don is not a pre-requisite for being witness to a possible UFO sighting.  Also, the manner in which people express themselves naturally in written form, we believe, oftentimes can provide information about the report, and the alleged sighting.

They appeared to be slightly changing in color, but basically seemed much redder overall compared to the moon and few stars in the sky at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I believed the lights to be either airplanes or helicopters, but their motion and behavior were not like any other manmade aircraft I ever observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> they seemed to move sloly y around each other, get closer two different times, then separate.  By far the weirdest part observed was at one point, a very small secondary light appeared to leave the lower craft, and move several degrees  down, then dissappear, as if it were a controlled satellited No movements were jerky or fast, just very slow and controlled Finally the lights compeleted faded out from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and found him to be credible and serious-minded, as well.

I am most interested in the number of people seeing and reporting this event, as I cannot understand how it could not have been seen by hundreds of people if not more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the initial spotting of the object, I was located on the street outside my apartment in Burbank.   The time was approx 5 min. before 11:00 P.M. but the objects could have been there much earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the best of my ability to estimate, the objects appeared to be about 30 to 40 degrees in the sky, somewhat below where the moon was in the sky at the time, and in approx the same direction, to the south-west of my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, Pacoima happens to be somewhat to the north and west of my position, so if the other sighting was at the same time, it could not have been the same objects I was observing.  Actually, from my main viewing position on my third floor apartment balconey, my view to the north and west is obscured by my building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not yet been able to find anyone else who saw the objects at that time, or have not seen any reports in any media.  Do you know if any media reports were made?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for doing the work you do.  There must be an explaination to these events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

After arriving home from work, about 8 minutes after first sighting the red light it was still in the sky. I ran to the front door of my home, and called my wife out to take a look at the light. We both look up at about a 11 o&#39;clock position, the red light as still brilliant in color, stationary, and soundless. The object was circular in shape and looked as if there was a large red light in the center with 5 or 6 smaller red lights around the primatier. Now it has been about 15 minutes, two smaller white lights shot out from the object dimmed, and disappeared in a southernly direction. Then the red light dimmed, and moved in an upward angle in a northernly direction, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and found him to be quite credible and serious-minded.

At first I naturally thought it was a plane but the whole thing was flashing. At this point it was moving left. Then the whole thing started to flash red. I thought this was a bit strange so i got up to have a better look. Still moving left. Then it changed a really bright white colour and it was about 4 or 5 times bigger than it had been before. I dont know if the actual craft changed shape or if the light was so bright that it made it look bigger than what it was but this could certainly not be a plane. After a few seconds it when back to flashing white in the smaller form and turned direction and headed to the right. Now i know this could not have been a plane because planes cannot chnage direction so ubruptly. After a while it headed in a direction diagonally down and to the left. It then started to flash red again. After it continued in this direction i lost sight of it because there were trees to block its view.<n>

Noticed a red light in front and above us heading North. Suddenly, it changed direction and headed south without turning or stopping first. As I was getting out of the truck my husband was steadily watching and observed the red light make a 90 degree turn without stopping and head West. We continued to watch it outside of the vehicle for about a minute when it suddenly stopped and seemed to get smaller or gain altitude. Within a few seconds it stopped gaining altitude and was motionless. A few seconds later 5 or 6 smaller lights appeared to fall from the bottom and saw 1 of them veer off to the East. Within a few seconds the red light disappeared and no other unusual activity was noticed within the next few minutes before we resumed driving home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar reports from the Los Angeles for the same date.

The sun was setting and the sky was bright and clear with very few clouds if any. As we approached the top of a hill i saw off to the west a bright object in the sky,it seemed to be almost metallic. It reminded me of the light reflecting off an aircraft as it turns, the object did not appear to be moving . My wife and daughter asked what it could be,at first i thought it was an airliner, but when it didnt move i began to wonder. We were traveling in that direction, at times it seemed to disappear but would return to the same spot.As we waited to turn into the parking lot i noticed a second object that appeared to make a turn toward the 1st but i was unable to see what it did after as i had to turn.After we pulled into the pharmacy parking lot i backed up into a spot so i could watch the object further, but after parking it was no longer visiable. It could have been 2 airliners or even a weather ballon but i really don&#39;t know, i do know it was metallic in look with the sun reflecting off it.<n>

Witness got his digital Sony video camera and shot film of the object. There was a fire and smoke contrail for a period of time. This stopped briefly, and the object was more clearly seen to be NOT a conventional craft. The oval shaped object began to flutter for a few seconds, then a large puff of smoke was observed, and then the fire reignited. The contrail again disappeared, and the object was more clearly seen. The entire path of the object was upward at an angle of about 30 degrees, moving from north to south. The object was approximately 1 1/2 miles from the observers, the sky was mostly clear. The original digital video film is available, as are still frame captures, and enhancements, which clearly show a classic UFO shape.

The oval object appeared to be flying at a lower altitude, but there were no noticable protrusions from its smooth appearance.  When movement was noticed this crafts ability to cruise across the skyline appeared to be much faster than what the commercial jets were doing.<n>

I was casually glancing up at the Western sky when an object caught my eye as it was moving Eastward.  I thought it was an airplane at first.  It didn&#39;t make any erratic turns, however it&#39;s movements began to indicate to me that this wasn&#39;t a plane (eg. it made a leisurely circle would stop for a few moments and then resume moving again).  At this point I got out of the motohome to view more clearly. I then notice that the craft seemed to shoot something out of the anterior (west) side. A second later an impact seemed to have occurred causing what I would call an explosion. The craft moved forward a little and I ran in the house to wake up my wife and son.  When all three of us were on our front porch, I pointed to the craft which they easily found.  A few moments later the craft sent another emanation from the anterion causing the same effect (the explosion) as I had seen a few moments before.  The craft remained stationery for a few more moments then then began winking in and out.  I noticed that it seemed to be shuddering - then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same source.  PD))<n>

It was moving rather fast, it was not that far up in the sky.  I stood there in complete awe for a couple of seconds.  It then completely disappeared.  No one believes me.

Around midnight, several nights a week, I spend an hour or so on our third floor deck listening to the ocean, looking for shooting stars and satelites (wondering about UFO&#39;s). This night I saw a very bright (brighter than the bightest star/planet) orange light in the sky moving from the shore, inland WNW. It appeared lower than a plane when it is on approach and holding. Behind it was a jet. We live near an Air Force base and often see airplanes traveling in tandem, so I assumed it was a pair of Air Force jets although an object moving across the sky with nothing visible but a bright orange light, looked quite peculiar. Less than a minute passed when I realized I was observing a jet in pursuit of the orange light. The two traveled back and forth and up and down, with the plane clearly following whatever the orange light was doing. It really looked like a rather slow chase. They were both moving at about the same speed of an airplane on appraoch as well. After about six minutes, the plane followed the orange light SE and out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 23 January at the same time of night, my boyfriend and I saw the same orange light in the sky moving inland from the ocean. It was a cloudy night and it disappeared behind some clouds in under two minutes. There were no airplanes in pursuit.<n>

I was going home at about 3am from visiting with my sister. On the base the have an elementery school. Just past the school there is a bunch of trees. I was almost to the school and happened to look up and notice some really big orange red object rising to the sky. At first I thought that is could be a very big hot air balloon or something and I kept looking at it but it was just too big to be anything else. I notice that it looked as if it were over the flight line of the base. and that there were no plains flying. It was still rising when I started to passes the trees and then i couldn&#39;t see around the trees so I sped up, it is a very short line of trees and couldn&#39;t have taken longer that 10 sec to pass them but by the time I got around them the object was gone. A little confused by what I saw, I went home to tell my husband what I saw, so he made a few phone calls and no one knew what I was talking about. I never actually got over it and I always thought what if? Untill I was watching one of the ufo shows where they were showing pictures of sighted ufo&#39;s and all the sudden the object I had seen appeared on tv. A little stunned I finally realized I really did see something wierd. It has taking me this long to report because I was affraid that the military would come after me and my husband feared it also. But they will i hope just think of this as being something no one will listen and I hope they ignore it. But since seeing that I now know that the military is involved some how weather it be the are hiding special aircraft or that they have come in contact with other life forms and have been in contact for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He was standing in our front yard staring at the night sky. I looked up to see an object being chased by an aircraft, a jet. The object being chased had what seemed to be a circular shape of very bright light or lights. The light appeared to be one mass from our distance and point of view. The shape of the whole craft could not be made out. We recognized the jet by the wings lights, one red, one green, and a center light. The lights on the jet were flashing in rapid procession. I commented that it looked like the air police. The jet was gaining in distance between it and the object, and just when it got close the object accelerated and began and incredible acsent as it was circling back toward the Charleston Air Force Base. We live only a few blocks from the AFB main gate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into my house to find a pair of binoculars. My son ran in to get the phone to call a friend that lives in the neighborhood. My son&#39;s friend saw the &#39;chase&#39;. I recall the chill in the air and wishing I had something on my feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was not very cloudy, or atleast there was no cloud coverage to obstruct our view. The crafts were flying SE to NW. Looped around the Air Base and then continued WNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son has studied aircraft since the age of 3. His goal is to become a pilot, but what he saw was difficult to explain with all his knowledge of aircraft, old, new, and experimental. Because of my son&#39;s interest we have for years looked to the sky. He is somewhat expert in recognizing types of aircraft from sight and/or sound. He, nor I, have any knowledge of what American craft uses such lighting. The object was so large and bright that it was highly noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought that something would have been broadcasted on the news. There was illness in the family which did not permit me to do an online search until now. I was very happy to see that atleast one other person in the area could confirm our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One explaination was that the USAF was testing out a new aircraft, but that gave rise to why it was pursued by a jet with rapid flashing lights. I would have thought such a test would have been more discreet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am suggesting to my son and his friend that they add their own discription and comments to this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We watched for about 3 minutes , then it started dropping what looked like burning cinders from the bottom that seemed to burn out before touching the ground. Then the object changed directions, moving away from us. we watched for another few minutes and it seemed to burn itself out, but would keep re-lighting itself. we watched it as far as we could before we could no longer see it.<n>

Above us were numerous white lights and not stars.  Stars don&#39;t move as fast as these were moving.  I believe they were going, I think, east to west.  We were not the only ones to see this group of lights.  People on the other side of our county did too and notified my neighbor and that is how we seen it.  Some lights were bright white and some more a duller white like up higher in the sky.  At first I thought they were stars but stars don&#39;t move from east to west at any rate of speed that can be seen in a short span of time and actually followed.<n>

The one on the right was as bright as a planet like Venus only twinkled with blue, red, green, and yellow and in looking through the spotting scope which isn&#39;t very strong, looked bow shaped.  The one on the left, maybe a mile - 2 (hard to tell distance over water and above) from the other one was at the exact same distance above the water, but did not twinkle at all, just a very bright yellow light.  I noticed them at 6:30 P.M.

My initial thought was it was a satellite.  After a few minutes of studying the object I realized it was not a satellite or it would of passed already.  The object did not go in a straight line either.  A gathering appeared and one theory is it was a weather ballon, I am hoping your sight would be able to confirm if a weather ballon was in the area.  The reason I do not think it was a weather ballon is it changed directions.  Due to the height of the object it was to hard to give an exact description.<n>

It was clear blue and was facing the south on the middle of Rocky Pond.  There was snow covering the pond and ground surrounding the pond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I had been watching planes fly over at there usual flying altitude (30,000ft+) all day, I gazed up to look for some more planes.   At I would estimate 15,000-20,000ft I noticed an object which I quickly thought as a plane due to its shape.  But the speed which this object was moving there was no way it was a plane.  At this distance it would have taken at least 30 seconds to watch a plane fly over and this object flew over from east to west in the southern sky in about 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught the glimpse of it after it was half way over the sky.  It was a diamond-jet shape but much bigger maybe scaled up to about 5 fighter jets.  It was a light gray to silver color but could not get a good idea of any other colors due to the speed it was traveling.  The object was seen by at least one other friend maybe two.<n>

The sky was bright blue no clouds air temp around 5 degrees. The 1st object I saw was followed in the same flight path by another about 30 to 40 seconds behind the 1st. The 2nd object was then followed by 2 disks one slightly ahead of the other. The 3rd set of objects was then followed by another disk once again 30 to 40 seconds behind, which once again was followed by the 5th disk again 30 to 40 seconds behind the 4th. No contrails were left and just north of where the objects flight path had been was a jet airliner much lower est 30,000 feet leaving a large contrail. The objects apeared to be light blue and silver and the sun glistened off them. My location is 18 miles south of Lake George NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was amazing to see a narrow swath of clear sky showing through the clouds as several jets passed overhead, and burned away a clear path. This alone was a phenomenon that I had never witnessed in 54 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, as I was watching is facination, I saw what looked like a shadow moving through the cloud bank from north to south.  The shadow was the shape of a &#34;flying wing&#34; .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I desparately tried to get my friend to see what I was seeing, but was unsuccessful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the object appeared as if a shadow, it could not have been, insomuch as, it was approx. 5 degrees from the vertical, and the sun was less than 5 degrees from the horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what the object was, but it was there, and it will remain unforgettable!<n>

As I pulled out I noticed a very bright object in the eastern sky. At first, because of its location directly above the sun, the object appeared to resemble a bright ball of light in the sky.  But after a few seconds the object started to move to the northeast revealing its true shape, which resembled a cigar. The object was tilted at a 45 degree angle as it moved through the sky. I can only guess the altitude or distance it was from us, but from what we saw it was a very big object.  It continued to move east/northeast and eventually disappeared. I did not literally see it disappear or shoot off towards the eastern sky, I discribe it this way because I turned my head to yell at my wife, who was in the garage, to look at the UFO and as I turned back to look at the object it was gone. There was also a plane in eastern sky, but it was far off in the distance.  My 12 year old daughter also witnessed the entire event.<n>

When We looked again some ten minutes later, it had moved about a foot at arms length. (too far to move for a planet in the short timeframe)  Wife dismisssed it...Until fifteen minutes later, we both saw that it had disappeared!  Ten minutes past that, as I drove her to work, we saw contrails of two VERY fast moving jets converging on the EXACT spot where the light had been. They crossed this same patch of sky over and over again in an &#34;x&#34; pattern seemingly searching for the object(approx fifteen minutes).  When I returned home, I got binoculars to observe, and could only make out the contrails (puffy, and definately corkscrewed) converging again and again on this spot.(approx 30 minutes)..Then to my surprise, The light then reappeared (I could make out that it was round with shadow)!  Both jets made tight turns and converged on the spot again....and as they were a foot away at arms length the light blinked off! as the planes crossed each other, I saw the light reappear to the south about two feet away at arms length!..Again, the Jets executed tight turns and converged on the same spot, only to have the light dissappear again. this occured two more times, and then the light disappeared totally.... I witnessed the short, jagged contrail-producing jets criscross that patch of sky over and over again until 10:30.  I saw a multitude of commercially identifiable planes (S.West and American) fly under the area in question producing no trails...Did anyone else witness this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness over the telephone, and found him to be quite credible and serious-minded.

It was a clear starry night.  I noticed off in the distance to the north a glowing light.  It wasn&#39;t very high, maybe 1000 feet or less.  I kept watching because the light it omitted was different from any aircraft, but it looked like a candle under a white bag.  The shape was strange.  It appeared to have the shape of an old fashioned radio.  It was domed, but not saucer like.  The entire craft glowed, but you could clearly see what looked like burners (lights) on the bottom.  It could not have been an airplane, because it was moving very slow, but too fast to be a hot air balloon.  It just lumbered by then slowly veered to the right, then back to the left.  Then it seemed to just hover for a bit.  It then took on it original course and disappeared into the horizon.  I had a total viewing time of about 10 minutes.  I have no idea what it was.  I tried to take video of the event, but it was too dark and by the time I had the camera working it was too far away.  I saw it through my binoculars.  Strange!<n>

I looked up and she pointed to this very fast moving dark object moving North.  We could just barely see that it was chevron in shape, maybe 2 or 3,ooo feet up.  It had a barely discernable faint glow on the back of it, but seemed shiny with no lights on it at all.  It was moving steadily at maybe 5oo mph, if my guess on its&#39; altitude is correct.  We watched it until it&#39;s shape seemed to blend into the night sky.  It made absolutely no noise.  My first thought was that it could be a stealth bomber, but if it was, it would have aircraft lights on it, required by the FAA.  This object was almost completely blacked out.  This object also was chevron or boomberang shaped and was seen directly overhead.  A stealth bomber is more triangular shaped when viewed from above or below.  This object made no noise.  A stealth bomber still makes a little noise at minimal throttle and when the air is cold, sound travels further.  It was cold that evening.  We were very lucky we even spotted it.  It was camouflaged so well with the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of five interesting reports from same witness.  PD))<n>

I saw that they were slow so I ran home to get my camera. When I got back they were much further apart but had sepperated into two groups of 3. Itook several shots of each until I had no film left in my camera. When I went home no-one would believe me. I hope you do! If you dont then contact me, as I have the photos to prove it!<n>

I was walking North West through the town of Dun Laoghaire, which is a suburb of Dublin, to catch a DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit). A movement in the sky caught my attention. I saw a barely discernable oval  of light moving in the North Eastern sky. The source of the light appeared to be behind the cloud. Then I noticed a second, identical oval of light. They looked like two dim searchlights and they moved around each other in large circular patterns, giving the impression that they were dancing performing a dance. In size they appeared to be like two small moons, but much, much dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were so dim that I wondered were my eyes playing tricks on me. I watched them until I entered the station. Down on the platform I looked to see if they were still moving around in the North Eastern corner of the sky, they were. As I&#39;m a little short sighted I thought I had better get a second opinion. Pointing Northwest I asked a man standing on the platform if he could see the lights. He said he did and made some comment on UFOs and left it at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My train arrived 5 minutes later. The journey to my station took about 7 minutes. My wife was waiting for me with the car. I looked North East. They were still there, still moving in that fluid circular pattern and in constant relationship to one another. I asked my wife could she see them.

I had been just looking through beyond the balcony, sliding glass door, while in the living room of the apartment, and I noticed an egg-shaped, probably flat, silver object.  It had black trim on the top and the bottom, and it appeared to have a round black area in the center of it.  It moved in a direction from north to south.  It was probably no larger than 5 feet from top to bottom.  It moved steadily in a perfect horizontal line without going up or down.  It made no noise.  It must have hovered flown no higher than 25 feet above the ground.  After it passed the line of sight of my balcony window, I then noticed that five wild geese flew down from the opposite direction to the grassy area across from the parking lot below the apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST SOME KIDS FOOLING AROUND BUT MY DOGS BROKE LOOSE AND RAN TOWARD THEM. THIS WAS STRANGE! MY PETS ARE USUALLY CALM AND GENTLE. I RAN AFTER THEM THINKING THEY WERE HEADED TO THE CROWD STRANGELY THEY PASSED RIGHT THROUGH THEM AND TO WHAT LOOKED SORT OF LIKE A DISK. I RAN TO THE CROWD AND ASKED A YOUNG MAN ABOUT 13 WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HE EXPLAINED &#34;I&#39;M NOT SURE.&#34; SUDDENLY A BLINDING LIGHT FLASHED AS I TOUCHED THE CRAFT. I WOKE UP THINKING IT WAS A DREAM WHEN I FELT A COLD SINSATION ON MY BACK. I WAS ON SOME KIND OF HARD METAL TABLE WITH STRANGE CREATURES WITH HEADS SHAPED LIKE SIDEWASE WATERMELONS. THEIR EYES WERE LIKE BUGS AND SKING WAS GREYISH GREEN. THEY HAD STRANGE UTENCILS THAT POKED ME CAUSING MY SKIN TO BURN. I TRIED TO SCREAM BUT I WAS SO TERIFIED THAT I COULD NOT SPEAK AT ALL. ABOUT AN HOUR LATER I WAS REMOVED FROM THE CRAFT OUT ONTO THE SAME FIELD JUST DIFFERENT LOCATION. I WATCHED AS CRAFT WENT UP AND SHOT AWAY. IT WAS ABOT MIDNIGHT. I HEARD A BARK AND FOUND MY DOG. MY OTHER DOG COULD NOT BE FOUND. I DID NOT FIND MY OTHER DOG UNTIL A WEEK LATER. I DIDN&#39;T TELL THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME. I TOLD MY SON AND HUSBAND AND MY SON CAME TO THIS WEBSITE. HE SHOWED ME AND I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT THE CREATURES MAY HAVE BEEN EXTRATERESTIALS.<n>

I am currently living with my 31 yr.old boyfriend and our 6 month old baby girl.On the date and at the time specified I was on my way to an 8:00 appointment at the welfare office.I was on State highway 10 headed East from the small town of            North Judson ,IN to State highway 35 about 8 mins.My boyfriends mother was driving me I was in the passengers side of the truck .I looked out the passenger side window .I saw two lights beside each other like a pair of eyes which I&#39;ll call objects A and B.I&#39;m not sure which one went over and which one went under  but they switched places pretty fast  then took off in opposite directions B headed East along the side of  highway and A headed West.After a short distance I couldn&#39;t  see A any longer. I probably could have still seen it if I had looked out the rear window but I didn&#39;t.I watched object B instead.I didn&#39;t  tell my boyfriends mom I don&#39;t know why not but I didn&#39;t.Object B was not now going as fast as it previously had when  switching places with object  A .I now had to look  slightly backwards from the passenger window to see Object B.The time had come to turn left or North on to highway 35.I had now lost visual contact  with object B. After traveling on 35 for about 7 more minutes I entered the small city of Knox,In.I turned right or East  down a side road we were supposed to make another right south but we missed our turn so we made the next right turned around in a parking lot,got back onto the side road and turned left or South then made another left or East into the welfare office parking lot the back of the office faces North and the front South we parked in the lot and I went inside.I looked out  the window and seen what could&#39;ve been object B headed South I watched &#39;til  it was really small.I turned away convinced of my first  craft sighting.Thanks.Two<n>

My best guess is mid Jan. 2003.  I leave for work at 5:10am every workday and was traveling east down Valley Ridge Blvd.  Just a few blocks before reaching I-35,in the southeast,I saw 2 brilliant green orbs with a green teardrop trailing each one heading straight down.  They were not together.... one was lagging behind and to the right(west) of the other one and was slightly smaller. They didnt fizzle out,,, they stayed the same intensity until going below my line of sight. At first I thought, &#34;Wow!!! That was 2 of the strangest meteors I&#39;ve ever seen!&#34;  But then as I drove on I got to thinking of the few meteors I&#39;ve seen in the past and they were always pinpoints of light with a skinny trail mostly bluish white in color.  I&#39;ve seen some green meteors but they were pinpoints of light with a skinny green trail but these were large... almost like what I&#39;d call &#34;gas balls&#34;.  I finally convinced myself that it was probably the reflection of the green traffic lights at the intersection that I had just passed because that was the exact color of the objects, but I&#39;ve gone through that same intersection every workday at near the same time and no reflection looks like what I saw. When I arrived at work I asked if anyone else had seen the green lights but nobody had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Satellite has since has disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3:00AM I couldn’t sleep and was looking out the window.  I noticed a distant bright star in the sky I assumed was a satellite.  Suddenly I could see about a dozen small red globes of light appear to leave the satellite and head toward the earth.  It looked like something from a video game.  This startled me so my attention was fixed on the object.  As I watched I observed multiple red globes of light going to and from the satellite toward the earth and back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching this phenomenon for period of a couple of hours I confirmed this was indeed a stationary object and therefore a satellite.  In spite of the red globes I was tired and dismissed the object and went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night it appeared again and the same red globes went to and from the object as before.  I woke my wife up to make sure I wasn’t crazy and she watched the red globes going to and from the object toward the earth.  We were both amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the third night I watched this object again and the red globes traveling to and fro.  On the forth night the object was gone and never reappeared.  That’s when I wasn’t so sure what I observed was ordinary because stationary satellites always remain in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction was in the North Eastern sky.  It could be a military experiment or some other perfectly explainable occurrence.  I don’t know what I observed so I felt it was worth reporting to your database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did roll video but nothing appeared likely because my camera was a very old model and had no night capability.  I still have the 8mm tape of the attempt somewhere in my drawer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an extremely skeptical person but this experience certainly has provoked some second thoughts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They are at an alititude just a little higher than commercial aircraft.  They move in a controlled manner almost &#34;jetting&#34; from one position to the next.  I have inquired with Burbank authorities and they have no information or will admit to inquiries from other curious people.  I have also noticed abnormal planes being flown around the same time (very late at night).  Usually dark in color with very different lights, unlike the commercial aircraft which has multiple blinking lights.  These almost seem to be military or something simular.<n>

1/14/03 20:00|Lorain|OH|Light|15 minutes|Crazy light beams in west cleveland area|2/5/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27088.html|176|ndxe200301| Crazy light beams in west cleveland area<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home west on city streets coming from the golf range in Avon Lake, noticed white pillar of concentrated light reaching from horizon line into clouds.  It looked like a normal searchlight used for advertising but it was stationary, so I naturally didn&#39;t think much of it.  When I got home I called my friend and asked him to look outside and he said he noticed it too, so being a curious skywatcher he went outside while I was on the phone with him, then all hell broke loose.  More beams appeared in the west spaced further from the original beam.  Then the weirdest thing I ever saw appeared in the opposite direction, roughly northeast, another concentrated beam of light from the horizon to the clouds appeared, but this pillar was a fiery orange glow, it faded into view out of nowhere, shimmered up and down for a few seconds then left.  My friend, my mother and I all started flipping out on the phone wondering what all this was.  My friend said some beams also appeared in the southern sky.  A few other people noticed it but nothing really appeared on the news, so what the hell was it.  I have no answers.  Its possible that it was the aurora borealis but I never saw that so brilliantly and form singular lines of concentrated light stretching from horizon to clouds.  Now these definetely were not any UFO craft but they were some very unearthly looking beams of light.  Unless some crazy artists were coordinating some light sculpture in the west cleveland suburbs, I&#39;d say we have a mystery on our hands.<n>
1/14/03 20:00|Peru|IN|Light|15 min.|big luminous yellow light in sky that fades and then produces 3 more that blink and fade out|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27504.html|177|ndxe200301| big luminous yellow light in sky that fades and then produces 3 more that blink and fade out<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will try my best to tell this as i  can recollect. I left my home in Wabash, Indiana at  approximately 8:00 p.m. en route to Kokomo,In. to see my girlfriend. I was on bypass 24 east around the area of the city Peru gazing up at the sky  in front and to the sides of  the vehicle. Plenty of stars were out and i always notice venus, which i know is commonly mistaken for ufo&#39;s. Well, after about 20 minutes i notice to the upper left corner (drivers side) a luminous bright yellow light of significant size glowing and just hovering there like i&#39;ve never seen before. I would guess it to be just a little above a radio tower in it&#39;s reference to height in the sky.This yellow light had definately captured my attention to the fullest. Ok, so trying to drive and keep my eye on it without accident, it faded out for maybe a minute before glowing again. It did this a couple of times for reasons i don&#39;t know before 3 more of the same size lights appeared to  what would be the right of  whatever it was. These other 3 yellow lights (which  were all in the same size)  luminated in what i would describe in junction to the original light as going up in a quarter moon fashion. They stayed on only briefly before giving  what i&#39;m calling a blink in order from the first yellow to the fourth yellow and then it was done. I did turn left on county road 550 to try and get closer if not locate it after it faded but had no results. I have to admit that i am a believer in the ufo phenomenon and when i witnessed this it really made me nervous! It is really hard to say exactly where it was, but i do know that it was close to the Grissom Air Force Reserve Base in Bunker Hill, Indiana (roughly about 10 miles from where i was at the time) to make me wonder if it was montoring activity if any  going on there. I did notice a reasonalbe amount of airplanes around so i knew i could dismiss the fact that it wasn&#39;t a plane. The planes were much smaller and appeared to be higher.  After i reached my destination i told my encounter to my girlfr! iend wit h her knowing my interst in this she could tell that i was shaken . I never reported this to any law enforcement, media or the base, but now i wish i would have. I don&#39;t imagine they could have giving me any answers because there are a  lot of skeptics, but i need someone to know that understands just what so many people are witnessing on a astonishing basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We have not talked to anyone else who saw these objects at this same time.  My husband has seen similar objects before in this same area.  This was my first sighting, and it was the most remarkable, awe inspiring thing I have ever seen and hope to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were very bright lights that seemed to be round and of numerous beautiful colors: pink, blue, yellow, white, purple, green.  They were not all lit at the same time.  One would go off and one or more others would come on.  After the light went off at each sight, we could see small, dim white lights flowting around that area.  Then there would be a break of 5 to 10 minutes and the round, colored objects would appear again in a different spot in the sky.  The most dramatic display was a line of six in a row.  They would take turns going on and off and the most lit at one time was three.  We could see the shadow of those that were off when the others would light.  This went on for maybe 10-20 seconds before they all disappeared.  All would be dark and then it would start over with one or two lighting at one time in a different area. We viewed them from about 19:00-20:00 hours.  Then there was a half hour before we saw two more.  That was the last we saw of them. They seemed to dart around, moving very fast from one location to another. Shortly after we saw the first two or three we also noticed 5 airplanes seeming to be following them.  We saw other planes but they didn&#39;t seem to be interested in these objects.  The five planes however seemed to try and stay with or near the objects.

What was unusual was that there were no coloured (ie. green/red) lights you&#39;d associate with all light/small aircraft. This craft followed an &#39;arc&#39; of approx 90 degrees, covering approx 1 mile. The lights disappeared suddenly, strange considering their intensity. The was no low cloud cover, therefore i do not think it was lights being project on/through a cloud base.<n>

The jet and noise were gone in about 10 seconds; but, the tube was silent, big and slow (faster than any blimp but much slower than a plane like a cessna 172). It was not a blimp because it didn&#39;t have a pod beneath or fins or engines and it was much slimmer than any blimp. It was shiny as a mirror and I didn&#39;t see any wings. I began to scream &#34;look, a spacecraft!&#34; over and over. Three girls about six ran over and I believe they saw it as I was headed to a neighbors house who came out to see what all the fuss was about but it had passed behind some trees. When it passed between two trees, it was about rice grain size and to far to see well. I guess it passed about a quarter mile east of me and was about the size of two semi-trailers.<n>

They were completley staionery and seemed too large to be any type of aircraft.  The 3 events only lasted for around 30 seconds to a minute and the objects were then gone.  This happened at very busy times and it would be intresting to know if other people have seen anything.  Or are we just losing the plot?<n>

I saw it out on the horizon, and got my brother up, he saw it too.  It was wizzing very fast and had lights all around the side.  It was dark and there were many stars out.  I went to look at my brother and looked back at the UFO and it was gone, dissapered and there was a slight trail going srait up.  I felt dizzy before and when i saw it, but my nausea left when the UFO did.<n>
1/14/03 04:30|West Bend|WI||45 minutes|There was a humming noise vibrating through our house for 45 minutes and we now believe it could only have came from above.|3/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27158.html|186|ndxe200301| There was a humming noise vibrating through our house for 45 minutes and we now believe it could only have came from above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife woke me at 4:30 AM on January 14, 2003 and asked me what the noise was. I got up and checked the entire house including the basement and didn&#39;t find anything inside. My wife suggested I open the window and we found that the noise was coming from outside. I looked at my neighbors&#39; houses and to my surprise because of the volume of the noise, their lights were off. I couldn&#39;t see anything (I never thought of looking up because quite frankly I never believed in such things) and went back to bed and told my wife that it must be someone&#39;s house alarm. I quickly ruled that out because the noise wasn&#39;t a loud screaming noise but a steady humming noise that did go up and down slightly. When I was going through the house the noise was just as loud in the basement as it was on the second floor, leading me to think it was vibrating through the house. I also had a very strange feeling as if I was being watched but I didn&#39;t have a clue why. Finally, at about 5:15 AM when we lay in bed listening, it suddenly got quieter and then forceful and seemed to drift away. We never thought it was a UFO (and we still aren&#39;t sure) until after we asked a few neighbors and found that they didn&#39;t hear anything. I kick myself for not looking up because right now I can&#39;t think of any place else it could have come from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many communities have reported such seemingly unexplained hums, including Monterey, CA; Taos, NM; and Seattle, WA.  It is not known what causes the effect, but many have studied the phenomenon.  The U. S. Navy, at one time, had an underground grid installed in Wisconsin, reportedly used for communicating withsubmerged submarines, using a very low-frequency (&#34;long wave&#34;) electormagnetic transmission.  The project was called &#34;Project Sanguine,&#34; as I recall.  That may explain the source of the hum reported by the witness, but that is a wild guess.  PD)<n>

I noticed vertical lights in the sky that seemed to be projecting light from the sky to the ground.  On my journey home I must have seen about 40 - 50 of these lights.  some of those lights where alone and others where paired up in 3 - 4 lights equidistance of one another.  whats stranger is that these lights couldnt have been commercial advertizment because they could be scene for a distance of 10 - 20 miles away and where in areas like forest preseves and even as far as into lake michigan.  I called a few friends in different areas and they all confirmed the lights, as well as some callers did to a popular music station that i was listening to at the time.  at about 10:00 central time after arriving at my house i took out my digital camera and took a few pictures at the same time i saw military aircraft flying around. Today I didnt hear anything on the news about the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness, who elects to remain semi-anonymous,  implies a nighttime sighting.

1/13/03 19:00|Eden/San Angelo (Between)|TX|Oval|Sighting lasted about two|Oval-shaped craft with no lights and no noise seen in West Texas|2/25/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27415.html|188|ndxe200301| Oval-shaped craft with no lights and no noise seen in West Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to get back to school in San Angelo via U.S. 87 N, and had just passed the town of Eden, Texas.  Being out in the country, the only lights there were were my headlights and mere lights in distant parts of the country that provided no real light on the road, simply dots amongst the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never driven this road at night before out of fear that I would hit a deer, but left Houston (my hometown) from Christmas break a little later in the day.  So, I was driving with my body leaned forward, slumped over the wheel, watching the road intensely for any deer or other &#34;wildlife&#34; on the side of the road.  Suddenly, around 7 pm Central time (19:00 hrs), I saw this silver, metallic oval hovering above the road.  I do not remember seeing any lights on the craft, but I did observing what seemed to be a two-part craft with a small part in between the two parts (see diagram).  And then, I drove right under the craft, and I remember looking up, seeing this craft disappear from the view provided from my windshield.  The craft appeared to be the same width as my truck (a little over three feet).  I am not sure whether the craft simply hovered as I drove underneath it, but I do remember thinking about how close it was to my vehicle -- appearing to be a few feet above my truck when I passed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to look in my rear-view and side windows, but, it was so dark out there that I couldn&#39;t see anything when I looked back.  I drove back to San Angelo and wrote everything down.  I believe in the possibility of UFOs, but I have been hesitant to report this because I wouldn&#39;t normally do anything like this.  But, I do believe that I saw what I saw.  I do have 20/20 vision and my windshield was clean from all obstructions and smears/dirt.  I do not suffer from any mental or physical disorders.  I work for a student newspaper back at my university, and have been trained to detail and observe events, which I think has helped in this report.   At any rate, that is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP #1 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr.Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your response.  To answer your questions, the trip usually takes seven hours from Houston to San Angelo, and my arrival to San Angelo 30 minutes after the event took place put my in town at about seven hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, it is funny you should mention the operation of the truck after the event, because when I got back into town, several days later, the alternator went out on me suddenly.  The alternator was changed out over the holiday, so, the job was less than a month old.  The new battery I had put in over<n> <n><n> the holiday was also totally &#34;un-charged&#34; and I had to get a new one.  I check to make sure I didn&#39;t leave any lights on or what have you, but I did think it was strange that my vehicle began having some problems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not experience any flashbacks however, but emotionally, I was a little tense at the moment I saw the object and for a few minutes shortly after, only because I can tell you that my overactive imagination and viewing of one too many sci-fi movies sort of scared me into thinking I might be<n> <n><n> abducted out there in the dark countryside and no one would ever know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, this isn&#39;t the first time I have experienced a UFO before.  My grandparents have a beach house in Galveston, Texas, and some nights during the spring and summer when I am there, I get on the roof of the beach house and peer into space, just looking.  On one occasion, I saw three triangular shaped space craft, grey-silver in appearance, flying in a triangular pattern maybe 30 feet above me.  They had faint white lights on them, but were totally silent.  Then, a second time, I saw another triangle-shaped craft that had brighter white lights on it.  I had taken a police flashlight that my Dad has in his boat and was pointing it into the great dark sky, and soon after, I noticed the craft zoom around in the distance and just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really don&#39;t have any accurate dates on these, but, they were quite a  sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I have been able to help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END #1))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP #2))<n> <n><n> Mr.Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was absolutly certain that there was no reflection, and I give you permission to include the followup message with the report.  Thank you for taking the time to investigate my case -- I really appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END #2))<n>

When we start traveling north it stays even with my suburban.  When we stop at the Y, it stops, we work out and come out and its still there, about an hour later, then we went to eat at Perkins, it followed us then stopped when we did.   Went in to eat and came out and it was still there.  Went to Wal Mart, it followed us, then went south towards home and it followed us.  When we got to the house it went back in the sky a bit. then just stayed.  Been listening for someone else to spot it, or even something on the radio.  Nothing.

Big as night! A Huge, non-reflective, black triangle object! Just floating above the Pillager Water Tower. Hanging there humming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe 100 feet or so above the tower. It had 3 star-like, lights! 1 on each point of the triangle. I was stunned! I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes! Couldn&#39;t believe this was happening to me! The freakiest feeling I&#39;ve ever encountered. Ever! Then, as I saw a small plane approaching directly from the northwest, the Triangle began to depart. As if it knew it was visible. The low-end hum began to speed up as the Triangle slowly made it&#39;s way off. It seemed to just float away in the strangest manner! This thing was like 3 city blocks long! Never ever seen anything that big move that slow with that much power! As it sped up, a circular, multicolored light in the center of the triangle began to light up &amp; spin. Then, it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we peered up we saw three fireballs, orangish in color, moving into various formations: vertical , triangular, and horizontal patterns. They did not move any  farther or closer during the four minutes that we saw them. They stayed in the same posistion in the western sky moving around in these semi-controlled patterns, and the night was clear as a bell (no clouds reflecting anything).They were 2-4 times brighter than the brightest star. Then, suddenly, they aligned so that we could only see one light. One of them appeared to drop quickly from the sky like a bottle rocket being shot downward, leaving a trail of sparks, then another, and the third just disappeared. Before all this ended I grabbed my video camera and managed to get about 30 seconds to one minute of tape. It certainly backs up my descrioption of the event, although the color off the fireball is absent. I am also aware that Vandenburg airforce base is in the direction we were looking, about 90 miles west/northwest of our location, and I have seen rockets launched from there numerous times. This was defintely not consistent with those. I have lived in  the Burbank/Glendale area for 32 years and never seen anything like this.  Unlike the other accounts this occurred very early Sunday morning.<n>

I believe the date was Jan 10, 2003 - might have been the week before.  4 of us were sitting in a house over looking the Gorge waterway in Victoria.  2 of us were facing the window.  Out of nowehere came a VERY bright illuminescent comet-like object moving fairly slowly downward toward the treeline.  What I saw was a blueish colour and what the other person saw was more red.  It came down, paused at the treeline, then disappeared.  It was NOT a firework or space junk.  The way it moved was too irrational.  We have never seen nor experienced anything like this previously so we prompty called the Marine-Air-Rescue department.  The person answering the phone had numerous other calls and had never heard of this kind of thing either.  He had worked there for 30 years and couldn&#39;t explain it.  He said there was no passing satellites or aircraft at the time.  He also said there were reports from Esquimalt, Oak Bay, and even over in Delta of the same thing.  Some reported the object(s) ascending as well.  I still have no idea or explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I would also like answeres as to what is really going on out there.I would be grateful and appreciate it if my story was entered into your reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mayby there other people have also had simmiler experiences.Latley I have been seeing objects in the skys that are not supposed to be there. This happens often,especially in the late hours till the next morning.Id like to share one of my experiances with people who will take me seriously.One night about12:30pm , I went out into my garden because i couldn&#39;t sleep. I was sitting with my dogs when i saw movement in the sky i also felt there was another presance somewhere,I looked up. I saw coming from the east of the sky object moving slowly heading towards the southern part of the sky then going west.Firstly I thought them to be stars or satellights but then stars dont move left right up or down or change shape from big to small ,neither do satellights change colour or flicker.They were moving slowly about eight of them. When they reached the west direction in the sky they became totally still.Im not sure if they were in our skys or i saw them from space near earth i dont know how far unless they were very high up in the sky They were travelling in the formation of the star sign orion when they stoped some of the objects began expanding in shape and colour brightness and started zigzaging in there position in the sky Except for four which remained still and decreased in terms of size to a small stars.These four were in the formation of the belt of orion. Thats the three . The one object in the middle of the belt started to expand and emited a very bright light and then pulsated.After that they all broke up there formation of orion and seperated into different directions then dissapeared Id like to know what does their behaviour mean, and what is the significance of orion and why they made that formation giving special awarness to the belt if orion.I would like to know what star is in the middle of orions belt and the little one next to the belt.Is there a meaning to that part of the galaxy where orion is situated.Please inform me about these questions i have asked and also as to what is happening in the skys.I would appreciate it also if any one has seen the same thing or somthing simlir please email me at ((e-address deleted))<n>

Hollywood Area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the third sighting of these exact same type of flying objects.  They appear on friday nights in the sky over Burbank/North Hollywood Area.  The first sighting was one flying object on 11/29/02 by 3 people. Two objects were seen on December 12/20/02 by 2 people.  Three objects were seen on 1/10/03 by 2 people.  In all situations the yellowish/orange objects would fly from east to west in a controlled manner.  Eventually the objects would stop, flash, and disappear.  I work close to the airport in that area and have a good idea of elevation.  I can say that they are a little higher than commercial aircraft.  On 1/10/03 I called the burbank polic dept. to ask if there had been inquiries or if they knew of activity in the area and they had no data for any of the dates I mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The sighting does not seem consistent with advertising lights, but we observe that the three sightings all occurred on Friday nights.  That suggests to us that they might be part of a recurring event, probably human related.  PD))<n>

My girlfriend and I were outside burning brush.  We were looking up at the stars and I was pointing out different constelations to her when we saw it.  It was behind the clouds and sitting perfectly still for about 3 seconds off to the west.  Then in an instant it shot across the sky to the north.  It did not seem to accelerate it just went from sitting still to speeding across the sky.  She then asked me if I had just seen it and we both had and then went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness means a date in 2004.

Before I got there, she saw it by the moon (to our far left), about the size of a star and then it started to move North and down it enlarged. It moved quite a distance in a small amount of time, I came to the balcony and watched, by now it was directly in front of us. It continued to move to our right, suddenly stopping and dropping a white light. THe white light came down and made a burst of white light. The light then it continued to fall and another burst of white light came from the ball. It did this several times. The object in the sky then continued off to our right and straight up fading until it dissapeared. The object had a orange-red ball of light in the midst of it and you could see a dark outline disk type shape around the orange-red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly say that I&#39;ve had doubts before, but after seeing that, it was truly creepy. We are wondering if anyone saw this and if anyone could maybe know what possibly the white light that it dropped could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no plane, helicopter or satelite, seen it all, and it was none of that. It made no noise and was extrememly creepy.<n>

The shape of object seemed long due to the pulsing lights along the side of the craft. We turned off on SC highway 19 to the south and stopped just a short ways down the road. I observed this object for around 30 minutes in a stationary position. After approx. 30 min&#39;s the object moved toward the north very slowly. One small aircraft was around as if their were watching it, but not getting to close. At least it seem that way due to the path the smaller Airplane was flying.<n>

Not a balloon!|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27373.html|215|ndxe200301| Oval orange glowing object hovers over Three Rivers Park, shoots laser-beam to ground. Not a balloon!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the sliding glass doors to tell my dog to stop barking. It was dark out, and I saw an orange glowing object up in the air, about a hand width above the distant tree line, over Three Rivers Park. It was glowing as if from within, and I could amke out a slighlty hazy flashing red light on my side of the view, and a white or pale greenish-blue one just on the far side of the object. There was a stopped vehicle with headlights on, that had pulled off the road, facing this object. I figured this driver saw this, too. I was cooking, so I had to tend to the stove, and then returned to see the thing still there. It was perfectly silent, I got my dog to stop barking for a minute, I opened the door, and heard no sound at all. He started barking again, and as I watched this object, it just disappeared! My dog stopped barking when it disappeared. My boyfriend had been in his office, and I had said nothing to him about this. I went to the TV to see if there was something on the news, meanwhile I heard my boyfriend say, &#34;What&#39;s that thing out there?&#34; Then he said, &#34;This thing out there was up in the sky and it just shot a white laser-like beam of light down to the ground, then disappeared!&#34; He described the same object that I had seen. I went to the door, and saw thatt he car was gone, or at least his headlights were off. I had checked the news after that, and there was nothing about that. I have not gone to the park to see if it left any signs in the snow, and don&#39;t want to, really, thugh someone should, I guess. After the object had disappeared, I noticed the normal air traffic had returned. Planes usually appear as tiny pinpricks of light, as do stars, but this was as big as a thumbnail held out full stretch.<n>

I went to the window and opened it to get a breath of fresh air. I was shocked to see in the distance a hovering light, that was pulsating colors. It looked like somebody took a flaslight and shut it off and on repeatedly, but very quickly. I saw white, the mail color with different hues of color such as red and yellow. I watched this for about 7 minutes. The Light did not move at all, it seemed to be perfectly stationary. I would of expected some movementin a 7 minute time frame. Near the end of this event, the light became very bright and them dimmed out with a reddish hue. Then it simply vanished, sorta &#34;winking&#34; out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Based on the description by the witness, we wonder whether the light might have been the landing light on an approaching airliner, or perhaps a celestial body, which became obscured by high-level overcast.

About 5 seconds later I saw the same &#34;thing&#34; but now in the north-eastern part of the sky at about the same degree.  Whatever it was produced no sound nor did it blink.

It was moving extremly fast and seemed to stop on a dime and make right angle turns without slowing down or changing altitude. after observing this four about a minute it seemed to let out other objects also with lights but these objects were smaller in size then the original one there were three objects now. It was very odd to see it fly there were about 60 lights on all three of them like 20 on each they were blinking very fast and were power full to look at.It did not make any noise as it flew across the night sky but im am pretty sure that there was five minutes of unexplained time loss.<n>

It was twinkling like a helicopter or an airplane at night, however it would move side to side, then up and down quite rapidly, and at other times was quite stationary. We dicided it must be a helicopter seen from a great distance, circling as if searching. At no time did it vary from the same general spot in the sky, it simply would change direction, noticably, therefore NOT a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Must to my surprise, I went out again after sleeping until about 3:00 AM PST, and IT WAS STILL THERE, with the same behavior. It is now almost 6:00 AM, and it is still doing the same thing! It has not changed from the same general direction in the sky, which you would expect if it was a star, (over time with the Earth revolving) but is still sometimes stationery and at other times, rapidly moving side to side, and occasionally slightly up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has now been approximately 9 hours, which would be quite strange for a helicopter to be doing this for so long!

After a few minutes, it appeared to drop straight down, and the tail become longer and brighter.  At one point, the object stopped, and the tail disappeared while the object just hovered for a minute or two, before resuming the drop and the tail resumed.  It was just like pictures of a comet, however, this was at pre-dusk with lots of light  and weather was clear and no clouds were in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise, no planes in area, or jets from military base located 110 miles southwest of this location.  There was no mention in local news, newspaper, radio, or t.v., etc. There was no background interference as this was in the sky above the horizon (no trees, wires, homes, etc) and no other visible object(s) in the sky in the area of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the sighting could possibly be ascribed to the illuminated contrail behind a high-flying jet aircraft.

The object was stationary, best described as star like.  I watched it intensely for 5 seconds, there was no indication of movement. Altitude of the object I estimate at 35,000 to 40,000 feet. I was in the passenger seat of a vehicle driven by my wife and didn&#39;t make any comments to her as she drove. I lost sight of the object in some trees near the side of the road. As my view became unobstructed, I could no longer locate the object. I then mentioned what I had seen. 09:40 The next day on our daily walk I glanced up to the same segment of the sky to see another star like object of the same size and altitude. And in the same approximate location of the previous afternoon. I called my wife&#39;s attention to the stationary object and she saw it for 2 of the 3 seconds I was aware of it before it was obscured by clouds.<n>

The light was far enough behind the wing that I doubt the cabin crew saw it.  We were flying at 18,000 feet.  The flashing light paced our aircraft in steady northward direction.  I can only describe the flashing as what the tail of a sparkler looks like or a roman candle.  I noticed that the flashing would illuminate trees, so it was that close to the ground.  It appeared that the light was traveling through trees occasionally.  The light would flare-up and then it would go dark for 1-5 seconds and then appear again.  The flashing light would only occurred in dark spots on the ground as if it was intentionally bypassing areas of man-made illumination.  I turned asked a fellow passenger behing me if he saw the light and he replied in the affirmative.  When the flashing light reached the south side of Wichita it then turned to the west and I lost sight of it.  It appeared that the light deliberately avoided flying into Wichita.  I did not see an object, only the flashing light.<n>

It was like an airport becan that was rotating with red, green, and white lights. When the red and green lights were visible there was a white light that appeared to be under the object. When rotating to white, the object became brighter. It seemed to be stationary for a period appx 45 minutes and then began to move in a northern direction. We observed this object for quite some time as it moved away. It then dissapeared.<n>

I thought the object was a very bright star. I got my binoculars and it is a sphere shaped object, with blue and red lights moving around it. Sometimes it looks like the object is turning over and over like it is having problems. Then the lights will come shooting out from it so very very bright. There seems to be an unusual amount of regular airplanes flying by and around it. It is in the path we always see planes coming from Cincinnati to Louisville. But I have never seen anything like this. It is hovering and not moving. It only looks like at times it will get smaller then get big in the same spot like it is trying to leave the atmosphere. This is amazing. We live in the country and there are no city lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at a celestial body, probably the star, Sirius.  PD))<n>

We walked into his breezeway and heard the sound of a low flying airplane so we went out and looked up. We saw what appeared to be an airplane except it had a light sitting on something about 10 feet from the fuslage.It had three lights one in the front and back also they were red white and blue. You may think so what you saw a plane with its landing gear down and if I would have looked down right after I saw it I would have agreed but I kept looking. The plane was flying toward me when it stopped hovered went a little higher and BACKED UP!!!!. It di this numerous times and we got my friends mom and she saw it too. After it did it a lot it was rather high and then it dropped sudenly and hovered where it started then it flew away. I thought I was crazy but the next day I was at school and aI told a friend I saw something weird (thats all I said) and he gave me the same description saying he saw it too! along with his dad. I am 15 and am not crazy but could this really be an alien space craft? I need more information.<n>

As I watched it come closer, I noticed that it seemed to have many lights in a &#34;clump&#34;, with other lights below it; a little hard to explain. I also noticed that it was moving in a starting and stopping pattern, rather than smooth.  It did stay on the same course.

My friend was driving and I told him to pull over quick so I could watch what I believed was a UFO.  At a stop sign he looked at it and thought it could be a handglider.  I don&#39;t think so though because it didn&#39;t seem to move and I could clearly see just a metal cylinder or flattened oval-shape.  My friend kept driving and seemed uninterested, which upset me a little because this is the first ufo I&#39;ve seen during the day that seemed unexplainable.  As we continued to drive I watched it more and it appeared to bank a little without changing position in the sky.  I looked a little more ovalish or disc-like at this point.  A few seconds later, the car went downhill on the highway into a valley and I lost sight of the ufo.  As we came out of the valley I continued to look for it but I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  The whole sighting lasted a little over half a minute.  I have no idea what it was, but it definitely wasn&#39;t an airplane because I clearly saw no wings.<n>

The object made no noise that i could hear, and this is Arkansas its pretty quite out here at night. I then i came to a complete stop.

I finished, and opened the door to see what it was. The rest of my family was asleep, so I searched around. It sounded as if it was coming from the laundry room, and I went in there and the window was open - it was coming from outside. I put on my slippers and a sweatshirt and opened my door to go outside, and it immediately got louder. I walked across my front yard and into the street and looked up. The sky was blurry in some parts, and it seemed only inches from my face. Then, I saw something move. It would turn on like a bright light, then fade and appear somewhere else. I blinked because I thought I was hallucinating. I watched, and it did it again. Then, I saw that it wasn&#39;t just &#34;appearing somewhere else&#34;, there were several of these &#34;lights&#34;. The sighing got louder and blew through my ears like wind, but I couldn&#39;t feel it anywhere except inside my h! ead. It vibrated through my head and was warm; which was strange since the night was cold. Then, as one, the lights faded, and I could feel the warm sighing sound receding from my head. I blinked again, and the sky looked different, as if someone had turned me around and all the stars were backwards. I went back in after what felt like 10 minutes, and was shocked - it was already 2:00am.<n>

I noticed an extremely bright light where my dog was barking. I ran towards my dog which was about 50 yards away and I noticed an oval moving higher and higher into the sky. By the time caught up to my dog the oval shapped object was hovering around 100 feet about us. It was moving back and forth for a few minutes then zipped out of sight. I have never seen anything like this in my life.<n>

I want outside at approximayely 4:45 AM and seen this bright light in the sky thinking its a star. But it also appeared it had red lights by it. I picked up the palm leaves and noticed that it moved then stopped again aand thought what is it? So I got a digital camera and started to take a couple of picures as it moved again then stopped again. Upon dowloading the pictures on my computer I noticed that 1 picture didn&#39;t show a light on the object and I am trying to figure it out, and a couple of pictures shows a circular blue and white light in the center of the object. Can you please look at the pictures and explain what it is?<n>

The lights were red, yellow, and green in color.  The movement of the object was most peculiar because it moved quickly and not in a straight line.  It would move left, then stop, then up, then stop, then right, stop, further right, sudden movement to the left, down, left... there was no particular pattern to the movement, it just didn&#39;t look like the movement of an airplane or a helicopter.  Myself and one other person watched the object for about half an hour before it disappeared behind a roof line and we could no longer see it.  There was no noise, but it may have been quite far away; it was difficult to tell the distance from our home at night.  Both observers are college educated, but neither of us are experts in aircraft identification.  Would like to know if what we saw was really that strange, or an optical illusion, or what!<n>

Then we turned around and at first saw a triangular shaped craft, I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes because the shape couldn&#39;t be an animal I thought but a bit later I KNEW it wasn&#39;t an animal because there were three smaller crafts coming out of the big one. The smaller ones was shaped like small balls and were flashing in diffent colours. Then after a while the balls spread out at different directiones but the big one was still there. Then we biked home like there were fire in our backs. After a while one of us looked back, and then there was nothing in the sky at all. We were all chocked about the event that accoured that evening and now we have decided to wright to you people about this because there&#39;s no one who believes us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

As i continued driving i noticed the light did not appearto move in any direction, but was very large in comparision to the stars/planets (a size of a penny to the stars, which i would put as the size of a pin point).  I drove several blocks and noticed it was moving in a slow, north/north-east direction, as i drove several more blocks it was now about one block to my south-west direction, about 100-150 feet above the houses in the area.  I was at an intersection of a stop light turning south (towards object) with another car, who was also stariung at th eobject.  At this close range i could see a definate shape,it was a &#34;X or cross&#34; shape with one set of &#34;wings&#34; larger then the other.  One set glowed red under while the smallers set was white.  At the tip of each &#34;wing&#34; was a white light.  The other car was watching with me for about 45 seconds and then drove quickly away.  I continued to watch the object which was almost stopped about 1/2 block directly in front of my car, still about 150 feet above the houses.  I stopped to watch it, it hovered for roughly 1 minute and proceeded directly east at a medium speed.  It seemed to be watching or looking at particular items.<n>

I said a tower.  He said, no they are moving but very slowly.  There were three at the time.  As we passed two, the third was hovering above a house and I still said it was a tower.  So he pulled the car to the side of I71 north and we sat there.  We then witnessed this aircraft turn and fly away slowly and then circle back around.  Then we saw more come from a distance. They started out looking like a bright light.  Once they got closer, we could clearly see two big white lights that were close together.  We watched as they just circled around very slowly in about a 2 mile radius.  We could see smaller lights as they turned around and a red non-flashing light in the back.  Some would hover for several minutes.  They could turn 180 degrees in the hovering position.  Then one came towards our car as it circled this area.  I rolled down my window, it was only 800-1000 feet up, I could hear it.  It sounded like a very quiet slow moving jet.  Although, to low and to slow for a jet.  My contacts are not clear enough to get a good view of the details, it just looked like the main body part of the aircraft was also slightly illuminated.  However, my husband has 20/15 vision.  After a total of 15 minutes, we drove on and continued to se another 6 aircrafts (?)in the next 10 miles.  All were slowly flying south.  Towards the area where we were watching the others.  One of the six flew right above our car.  This time, I held the wheel while my husband was watching out the window.  I got a totally clear view of the bottom of one.  Again, it was only about 800 feet above.  It&#39;s hard to describe the picture he drew.  It is triangular with delta like wings.  There were three lights accross the bottom with a red one in the middle.  ( this is looking straight up from underneath)He also said the main part of the body was kind of lit up.  I called my local Meteorologist and he called the national weather servic! e in Wil limington (which is real close by).  They said that Wright Patterson airforce base does alot of flight patterns around there.  And also Airbourne Express has a terminal nearby.  These were not jets. If it was military, would there really be 13 and flying around the same area?  Does the military make a quiet, slow moving, hovering aircraft??  Very wierd, yet very exciting!<n>

I thought it was a US air craft at the begining but it was not, becouse there was no winds at all only a shape of rectangle only flying, no light, no sound at all, the problem i could not see more details becouse it was so dark and the moon was in the other side, so i saw the reflection on the object only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I told him maybe it was his imagination until  03/10/03, when I was out back with the dogs and I was looking up and all of a sudden, I saw the same thing.  It completely caught me off guard.  It happened so fast that I didn&#39;t have time to call my husband. On approximately 10/04/03 my husband saw a bright white light that moved from east to west and disappeared.  The speed it was going was not a plane, nor was it a falling star.  On  10/15/03 my husband was outside and yelled for me to come out, so I ran out and he saw a light traveling so quickly coming from the south to north.  All of a sudden it stopped, became very bright and went upward and disappeared.

The weather was clear and cold. The atmosphere was very stable and the starlight was very steady ( the &#34;seeing&#34; was &#34;good&#34;). I had gotten into that sort of meditative state that some pipe smokers may be able to relate to, puffing away on a Christmas present of &#34;Sweet Killarney&#34; tobacco from Ireland. I wasn&#39;t thinking anything in particular - just relaxing, periodically looking up at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard the faint rumble of a jet airliner above, which is common around here, as I live beneath the flight path of airliners on their way into the Vancouver, B.C. International Airport, about 50 miles distant. Absently mindedly, I looked up...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the airliner, with its landing lights on, traveling the same course that airlines always travel over my house - towards the northwest. But -- and from this point on it is difficult to describe my feelings -- there was something else there, moving in an almost due-west direction. The immediate feeling was a sense of unreality, and a kind of boggled amazement, at what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brain took a few seconds to process what I was seeing. It was a brilliant, vivid orange light on a westerly heading, moving at a tangent to the airliner&#39;s northwesterly heading. The object was several orders of brightness greater than Venus at her brightest (Venus =~-4.0), but it is difficult for me to assign a visual magnitude to this, as I have no basis for estimating point sources of brightness greater than Venus, since Venus is the singly most brilliant (apparent) point source in the night sky. &#34;Brighter than -4.0&#34; is the best I can do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On first sighting, the apparent separation of the anomaly and the airliner was perhaps 5 degrees, with steadily increasing separation thereafter...however, I did not focus on the airliner...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up, and stood stock still staring at the object. It was like my brain was trying to make sense of it...because, in addition to the brilliant orange light, there was something above it, moving with it - attached, unattached...? I can&#39;t say. This &#34;something&#34; moving with the light had a startling appearance - cigar shaped, fully 1/2 degree in length, and it was rotating slowly in a clockwise direction, so that I was looking at its axis of rotation, around its center, like looking head on at a slowly rotating airplane propeller. This rotating object was sort of...ghostly in appearance...it had a faint orange luminosity, yet parts of it seemed dark, and the orange luminosity seemed to shift around as it rotated. It was situated a couple of degrees above the bright orange light, but the two anomalies were moving perfectly in tandem, as if connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind, almost unbidden, started flashing through possibilities. The first thing that flashed through my mind was reentering space debris. But that was not it - I have seen the reentry of a spent Russian booster, which, while spectacular, was nothing like this...with the solitary bright light, and the rotating object above that, this was just too &#34;mechanical&#34; seeming. Not chaotic and fragmenting like a reentering piece of space junk. Furthermore, it was traveling on a due- west course (as opposed to the characteristic due-east path of man-made spacecraft ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second thought that raced through my mind was that it might be an aircraft, at altitude, which had experienced a catastrophic failure of some sort. For a moment, I thought this was what I was seeing: a fuselage in pieces, burning, tumbling down out of the night sky. The immediate gut level reaction was curious - a brief feeling of relief that it was finally identified, followed by the sick feeling that would accompany the viewing of an aircraft falling out of the sky on fire. Momentarily, however, both my impromptu hypotheses were banished because, about 3 degrees directly above Alpha Pegasi, the bright light abruptly stopped [30 seconds from first sighting], and when it stopped I could no longer see the rotating object, but the brilliant light remained, orange in color, and sharp (not diffuse, but rather, starlike). It remained stationary for [approximately 15 seconds], and then it began to backtrack along its original course, moving very slowly. The rotating object was no longer visible - only the light. However, as I continued to observe it in this ascending course, I saw that it was manifesting a left-to-right, right-to-left swaying motion, perhaps a degree or two in either direction, that called to mind the image of a LEAF FALLING UPWARDS. I began to feel very strange -- almost fearful -- as I realized that the left-to-right, right-to-left stops and starts were very precise and mechanical...zip-zip-zip. It reminded me of the way a hummingbird flies. At this point I realized I was trembling (not from the cold) and I heard my voice say &#34;Jesus Christ...&#34; [ falling leaf motion manifested for 15-20 seconds]<n> <n><n> <n><n> [~1 minute into sighting]<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the object began to move in a more conventional manner, slowly following an arcing course towards Cassiopeia. Briefly the object passed behind the top of a tall fir tree, where I could see it off and on through the branches. At this point, I suddenly decided to run (literally RAN) for my binoculars. It took about [20 seconds] to get them and get back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [~1 minute 20 seconds into sighting]<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned, the object was still there, moving along towards Cassiopeia. I raised the binoculars (10 x 50mm) to my eyes and got the object into focus. Now, it appeared to be a solitary, cigar shaped object, I would estimate between .25 deg&lt;[length]&lt;.50 deg, and inclined so that the bright light, which was on the left end, was lower than the diffusely glowing right end. The object was still in motion, and as I watched it through binoculars, the right end swung further upwards, so that the &#34;cigar&#34; was now perpendicular with respect to the horizon. As in the case of the rotating object that had previously been visible, the diffuse light seemed to shift around on the object as it changed its orientation. At this point, the object was located about 10-12 degrees beneath Beta Casseiopeia, and still moving, slowly.[25 seconds of binocular observation].<n> <n><n> <n><n> [~1 minute 45 seconds into sighting]<n> <n><n> <n><n> Abruptly, I decided to call my girlfriend and tell her what I was seeing - I popped through the patio door into the kitchen, grabbed the handset, and hopped back out onto the patio. This only took a few seconds, and I did not dial immediately, but continued watching the object move (without binoculars, now, although they were hanging around my neck). The object had reached, roughly, the center of the constellation of Cepheus when suddenly, in a downwards direction, perpendicular to the horizon, it emitted, very rapidly, a solitary white starlike object of about 2nd magnitude that descended about 10 degrees and winked out. As it emitted this starlike object the bright &#34;mother&#34; appeared to fade slightly, and then it brightened once again to its former luminosity. A few seconds passed, and it suddenly emitted another starlike object, identical to the first, which also descended about 10 degrees and winked out. As it emitted this object, the light seemed to flicker (it reminded me of the way a fluorescent lamp flutters when you first turn it on)and then it simply disappeared from view. It was simply gone. [final phase of observation 30-45 seconds]<n> <n><n> <n><n> [~2 minutes 30 seconds, total observing time, ± 15 seconds]<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my girlfriend, immediately got a time check from her, and yammered excitedly to her about it. She was very interested, but calm, and, knowing my involvement with ufology, told me I should write a report immediately (which I was going to do, anyway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I carefully reconstructed what had happened, judging various elements of the account by recreating where I had been standing at various points throughout the observation, which stars the object had passed in front of, and testing that against where the object had been situated above/behind the sillhouettes of nearby trees. I timed how long it took me to run in the house and grab the binoculars from a drawer in my bedroom, and run back outside, discarding the lens-caps willy-nilly as I went. And so on. In this manner, I worked out the approximate lengths of different phases of the account, and then established a range for the duration of the account, to allow for errors in my estimation of how long the total time of the observation was (3 min.&gt;[duration]&gt;2 min.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After doing this, I stepped outside for a moment, found my abandoned pipe, and relit it, looking up at the sky. A minute or two had passed, when at zenith I saw a &#34;star&#34; of second magnitude blink into existence for about 2 seconds, and blink back out. No movement was apparent. It occured to me this might have been an iridium flare, but I have no such certainty - I will need to look into that possibility. I found it strange enough after the earlier event to once again call my girlfriend and tell her about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have created &#34;snapshot&#34; starmaps, showing the direction I was looking, my long./lat., and the appropriate date and time. For this purpose I utilized &#34;Your Sky&#34; online software. I also created computer graphical &#34;sketches&#34; utilizing Adobe Photostudio and MS Paint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> BACK<n>

I came up my road (there&#39;s a hill on my street) and I see this triangular formation of three (3) extremely bright, round lights up in the sky about 200 feet up and a mile or so away.  I jumped out of my car, ran in to tell my mother and she ran out and we both stood in our back yard staring at the lights.  They hovered in the sky without moving for about 2 minutes.  After about 2 mins, the lower &#34;UFO&#34; in the triangle drifted up and to the right towards one of the other &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34;...once it got close, the upper right &#34;UFO&#34; flew off out of sight at an incredible speed.  The &#34;UFO&#34; on the other side did the same after that.  The one &#34;UFO&#34; was left hovering in the sky, the bright light kind of twinkling.  The single UFO came and went off and on for the next hour, making random zig-zag floating actions in the sky.  My father came home later the night and saw it too, he said &#34;Oh my God!!! I thought you guys were joking..&#34; - The weird thing is that it was sooooo windy that night, and the whole entire sky had a sort of pale amber tint to it.  Our gate in the back yard kept slamming shut and my mom told me that earlier in the day she had heard a very loud noise around where the lights were coming from.  The pets were acting weird.  The objects were not moving at all times, so they were definetely not airplanes...but they were close enough that if they were helicopters we would have definetely heard them.  Plus, any type of aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen is not capable of dissapearing out of sight in the amount of time that these did.  Very spooky, something strange is definetely going on over Charlotte, NC.  This is no hoax, we have pictures and video.<n>

However, the light(let&#39;s say they were slightly glowing) were changing their brightness and then I thought it might because of cloud or fog but I could also see many of stars so I was pretty sure there were none of them(cloud or fog) at that moment.

I was looking up at the sky when I noticed a circular, silver, metallic, shiny object, no bigger than a football (soccer), moving in a steady motion, almost as if it was on a track. It was no higher than a lamppost, so I had a very good view of it. It looked as if it was lighting up, but it was daytime, and the sun was out, so it could have been the sunrays. It gradually picked up speed and then just disappeared into thin air. It appeared to be too small for any human to be inside it, and you would think it would be a toy of some kind, but it looked too detailed, and of course when it disappeared, it certainly wasn’t anything human like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My co-worker saw a bright yellow flash in the sky and two lights off the west coast of San Diego. He said to me, &#34;Hey check this out.&#34;  When I looked up, I saw two lights and a third that had a short comets tail on it. The third one appeared alittle hazy.  It became more clear and appeared to be chasing the other two lights.  They were moving in a snake-like motion across the sky toward the south. They were no where near any flight patterns in San Diego.  As they moved across the sky, the first light had four lights moving on it in a clockwise direction. The others continued to follow it. After a couple minutes we couldn&#39;t see it any more, because the sun came up.<n>

It didn&#39;t have an orbit, it would move really fast, then stop moving, it would move in the shape of a horse-shoe, and spiral around, it couldn&#39;t have been a plane because it was going to fast and was too high, planes also do not manouver in the way we saw it.  All four of us saw it, we watched it for about 30 min, and it moved like nothing we had ever seen, in the sky, then it started going straight moving very fast, and gradually became dimmer. It flashed every so often either brighter or different colors such as green, red, blue.  It eventually faded away and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore, after about 45 min.<n>

The light was so bright though that it kinda freaked us out. It followed the street we were on for 2 blocks then quickly (with a bright falsh) took off to the left over a tree line. At the next street to the left we turned but the thing was out of our vision. We finished our date early, both due to splitting headaches and nose bleeds.

The object was moving from west to east at a steady pace then behind this object appeared three additional bright white light objects that would be the size of an egg held at arms lenght.  The light from these objects was as if it was revolving.  There was no color, just white light. then there were two other groups of the objects that appeared out of the western sky and flew east out of my sight.  No sound was made and the distance in the sky seemed to be about 1500 feet high.  They were close.  I counted 15 objects, the flight pattern seemed to be in a straight line.  I live two miles from the Westminster Airport and I&#39;m used to seeing all types of flying craft, but at 46 years of age I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. I called my husband, who is a police officer for the State of Maryland and he tried to contact the local airport at 2100 hrs, but it was closed.  We watched the news to see if anyone else reported the lights in the sky but to no avail.<n>

What attracted me was that 2 of them were on a diagonal collision course directly in front of us. They came very very close to colliding. They were a whitish-beige color. The one furthest to our right had a metallic edge to it. I videotaped the event through our front windshield. We were not able to stop and pull over. Upon viewing the tape, the objects appear to be rotating north/south as they moved across the sky.<n>

I also noticed a very bright object high in the sky.  It was so bright that it looked like a very large star, except that it also appeared somewhat elongated, and this was in full daylight.  It was moving very slowly high in the sky so I decided to quickly grab my binoculars from my truck.  Using my binoculars I was totally surprised to see that there were actually a total of 10 to 11 circle shaped objects within the background of the brighter and larger object.  These other objects were also moving with the bright object in a formation-like manner (triangular and diamond shaped formation).  I could see these smaller objects only with the binoculars and were not at all visible with the naked eye.  These smaller objects appeared like white faded spots around the bright object and they did not reflect much light.  My fifty-six year old sister also saw the objects with me.<n>

We saw at least 15 objects that seemed like meteors fall in the area of the sky around the light.  The light would move up and down, left to right, come closer and farther away and it would move in small tight circles.  Light from the object seemed to reach the ground.  It seemed as if the object might have been over towards Shreveport, Louisiana and Barksdale AFB but I could not be for sure.<n>

I  found it hard to understand the witness due to their excitement over what she just observed. I asked her if she would slow down and repeat the information again to me. The woman explained that her and a passenger were driving along the highway against the Rosswood Mountain Range when they both watched three large circular white objects hovering near the peak of the range. The driver stopped the truck and they both watched the objects as they slowly descended down the mountain. She explained there is a small hill which sits in front of the mountain. The objects dropped down behind the smaller hill and both witnesses lost sight of them. She said they sat watching for a while just in case what ever it was they saw showed up once again. But that was it, what ever it was the folks saw, was gone. I asked approx: how long they observed the lights for. She said it must have been close to 3 minutes. I asked if she could determine the distance between each of the lights. From their vantage point, and a &#34;rough&#34; guess, she determined the lights may have been approx: 1/4 of a km a part, but she stressed that this was only a guess. I was also told that the lights were at a equal distance between each other, or at least so it seemed, the witness said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I will be paying these folks a visit after the winter is over as I still have a few others to visit along the route between Terrace and Prince Rupert<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Brian Vike, independent UFO investigator in northern British Columbia, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

1/3/03 03:00|Norwood|MA|Other|5 minutes|Sighting and message from an alien commander|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52254.html|290|ndxe200301| Sighting and message from an alien commander<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t sleep and went to my back door. I was wide awake as if it was day. I opened the door and looked at the sky. There were no clouds and Venus and the moon were visible. I was staring at Venus when a bright light appeared just above it. It was brighter than Venus and moved over next to moon. When the UFO came to a stop, I recieved a telepathic message from the ship. My mind seemed to &#34;warp&#34; from my body straight to the UFO. I could see everything along the way, including the sheer size of the UFO. The UFO had three engines, and dozens of side guns. What I saw was a warship, hiding behind our moon by the time my mind reached it. My mind entered its bridge and came to a stop. A tall lizard-like alien stepped out in front of me. It was wearing boots, a cape, and a kind of uniform. It had a number of badge-like items attatched to it&#39;s uniform, just like a Marine officer wears badges. It spoke in it&#39;s own language to me, while it held a device. My guess is the device translated what it spoke for me to understand. However, the only words translated were the last two. They were &#34;not afraid.&#34; It nodded to me and walked back to the bridge. My mind began to leave the warship, while it began to turn away from the moon. The warship created a small wormhole, flew into it, and was gone. My mind returned to my body, and I closed the door. I went back to bed suddenly tired. Over the past three years, I have experienced telepathic messages from the same alien. These messages are actually part of the same message told to me three years ago. The messages include information on alien scouts on Earth exploring certain parts of the planet. Another part of the message said that they want Earth to be an ally with them. They are exploring our planet to spot possible defensive positions against another &#34;alien threat&#34; to both them and us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It travelled from left to right about one third of the way across the windscreen and turned away from us at ninety degrees and travelled about half way down the windscreen, it did a little left to right wiggle and disappeared. I think it would have been about five kilometres away , it was a clear night on a country road, it appeared and disappeared with nothing blocking our view and the whole event took place in less then five seconds. When I saw it I said nothing to my wife because I have never seen anything like that and didn&#39;t know what it was but I was spooked when my wife said &#34;what the f##k was that&#34; with a stunned look on her face.<n>

Not really believing him I went in and looked thinking he was foolish as well as my 15 yr. old foster son . We saw at first a bright light and then as we watched it , it began to change colors in a circler motion .The lights went around the craft changing from white , to green to red and blue .  It hovered for the longest time and then it began to come a little closer . I got the binaculars and looked and I could see the shape . It was shape in a disk shape or like what you would see in the alien shows . The coolest part was that we were able to see what appeared to be windows all along the top half of the craft. The U.F.O Stayed around for about 1 1/2 hrs .  We saw it again on 01/03/03 and my 21 yr. old daughter saw it to , we have been watching for it tonight but haven&#39;t seen anything as of yet .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were looking at a celestial body.

At first we (my kids and I) thought it was an airplane, but I have never seen a plane fly that low over the freeway before, nor with such blinding lights. I could barely look at the lights, also instead of lights on a (Plane&#39;s) wings, we saw no wings but 3-5 lights in a horizontal row with a red light above the white lights. The object got frighteningly close -- to the point where my oldest daughter and I became very scared. It passed over head and away from my line of vision (I was driving). Afterwards we both said we had NEVER seen anything so huge, bright or close. We also realized that there had been no noise.<n>

Driving on the Merit PKWY /RT 15 (between 6:45pm &amp; 7pm) driving from Woodbridge Conn. to Middletown Conn. In the sky (between the 1st exits for Wallingford area &amp; exits for Meriden) I saw 3 very strange flashes of light. The 1st flash was light blue with random pattern,,,sort of like faint lighting.About a minute and half later, there was a stronger flash in the same area of the sky but this time it was a light green. Then approx 2-3 mins.later there was another much stronger &amp; brighter green flash of light. The flashes where either in or above the clouds so except for the colors it may have seemed like lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I&#39;ve traveled this road for ten years, every Monday-Friday and never seen anything like it. Really was quite unnerving. Did anyone else seen this occurence or has anyone seen this before?<n>

Hovering very slowly. heading east, then west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near dusk, but the sky was still bright blue. I saw two black, triangles hovering in a very slow flight pattern. They did not fly like our planes or birds. I watched for 10 minutes as they headed from the east to the west and then slowly, back toward the west again. They moved closer together, progressively and appeared to be about 45,000 feet, or possibly higher. Several jumbo jets passed by at maybe 15-20,000 feet during my observation, and these objects were clearly not flying like the planes, nor did they look anything like any kinds of planes I have ever seen. I am a private pilot and am familiar with flight patterns through the skies in this area.  I have also observed many birds of prey (hawks,and others, in this area and these objects were not like this animals. This is the first time I have ever observed anything like this. I have always been extremely skeptical about UFO&#39;s and have not really thought they were anything but mistaken identities. However, these objects were clearly some kind of object that I could not identify. I am wondering if anyone else observed them today.<n>

I saw lights out of the corner of my eye that caught my attention. The object had blue, green, red and yellow lights that were very vivid colors and blinking. It left very abruptly, then the electric went off until 4:00am. I was again woken by our microwave beeping when the power came on. I looked out the window again and saw another object but a different shape and only blue and red lights flashing very fast. I saw it only for 30 seconds or so then it left. The power again went off the came back on a few moments later. I closed the blinds after that. I check with the local authorities the following day and they said several transformers had blow due to a power surge at the local substation. This is just too weird.<n>

At first I thought they were birds, but they seemed awfully high. As I watched, the 3 objects formed a perfect triangle and the one below didn&#39;t move closer or farther from the 3, but they all moved slowly to the east. Then the 3 formed a more elongated triangle with the 4th staying below them. The three then formed a perfectly straight line. They all seemed to be moving more quickly to the east and becoming dimmer. The 3 top objects again formed a perfect triangle with the 4th one in its same position below as they all faded out of sight. It was a very clear and sunny afternoon with little wind (I didn&#39;t pay attention to wind direction at the time). If birds can fly like this, please tell me how and what kind!<n>

The first was approximately 3 months prior to this one. I thought this one was interesting because it was only 30 seconds or less and i appeared to be crashing to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the same shape and color as the previous sighting, but this time it was much closer and quite a bit larger.  I was driving down a back road going home from a friends house and as we neared the end of the road a large bright ball/sphere of multi colored light just appeared on my side (driver side) of the vehicle.  I could see it was multi colored like the first ones I saw months before, but this one seemed as though it was crashing to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it neared the tree tops it completely disappeared. I mean it was like it had never even been there.  I can recall my hair standing on end and I&#39;m not easily scared or influenced by &#34;paranormal&#34; happenings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting occured within 20 miles of the first.  Oh, I should mention the car radio went hystarical!  All other information can be obtained through contact.<n>

The object was seen around Schoolhouse road. The witness was up on the second floor of an apartment building and watched an almost rectangular shaped craft with lights on the bottom move rather slowly by. It frightened him as he had no idea what this object was. He went quickly  into the livingroom from the patio to be with his two children. He said he had no plans to go looking to see what this object was. The object was traveling very low off the ground, at approx: 100 feet and no sound was heard coming from it. Event lasted approx: 6 seconds.<n>

It was completely stationary and remained so for at least five minutes. This was not a cloud. Although it was small it was a clearly defined object. I don&#39;t think many people had even seen it- you had to look very carefully.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is that my husband has seen the exact same thing about 3 years ago in Seattle. He was looking out of his bedroom window when he noticed a white object high in the clear blue sky.  It hung motionless. He grabbed his  video camera and zoomed in. It appeared to be a white circular shaped object After a couple of minutes  it seemed to change into a series of 5 smaller discs, which rotated in a circular formation and moved ever so slowly , (still stopping and hanging in space once in awhile,) out of the range of the camera. (He still has this film but has never sent it in anywhere.) When I first watched it I was in total disbelief. I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband had kind of passed it off as just a weird unexplained singular event, but  yesterday when both of us witnessed the same thing his previous experience seemed to have more credibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re very curious about what we witnessed. Does this sound like some kind of satellite? Wouldn&#39;t it be moving across the sky steadily, and are satellites so visible during the day?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the information I can provide is that from the Richmond District of San Francisco (about a half mile<n> <n><n> north of Golden Gate Park) it was north/ northeast.  We were standing at about sea level and its elevation we cannot estimate, although it was extremely high in the sky, more than a mile at the very least. My husband actually says he saw it about 20 minutes earlier when he stepped outside the restaurant we were eating in. Then when we stepped out, he pointed it out to me. So it was there for at least half an hour, not merely five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father is an airline captain in Seattle as well (he flies for World Airways) and says he has never<n> <n><n> seen anything like what we described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for sending along your report!

Every person that I played the messages for (about 12) got chills and freaked out. It sounded like an open mouth exhale followed by strange clicking sound.  Definately animal not a machine breathing in (click, click, click) then exhaling as if it was pronouncing a long &#34;h&#34; sound.   At one point it screemed a very erie sound as if it was in pain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I played this very long message for our airport shuttle driver and he asked me to call him and leave a copy on his voice mail.

And second the message lasted the entire 5 min that my voice mail held, and then a second 5 min.  A prankster wouldn&#39;t continue that long, without somekind of slip up sounding human.  This was definately NOT human!  It was consistant, but not repetitive.

Disapeared when military craft aproached.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27626.html|311|ndxe200301| Large white sphere observed East of Yuma for about 50 minutes.  Disapeared when military craft aproached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> January first, 2003. Driving on rout 8 from West to East, having passed Yuma about 15 to 20 miles behind, we noticed a bright white ovoid object to the North, above the mountain range.  I mentioned the fact to my family; my wife and two teenage daughters, and we started to speculate what it could be.  We quickly discarded that the object could be a plane, blimp, weather balloon or cloud.  What was odd was the apparent size of the object and the fact that it was stationary, floating or hovering in the sky. I stopped on several occasions during the next half hour to photograph the object.  Traveling at an average of 80 miles an hour, we were able to see the object for over 50 miles, and still distinguish it clearly. The shape looked a little different from this latter angle, a shade appeared in the middle of the object that looked more cigar shaped than previous. We thought that it could be two ovoid shapes together or a peanut shaped object (see photos).   At approximately 10:10 AM two military craft were coming in from East to west over the highway. I assumed that they were military because of the fact that they were leaving vapor trails, and were flying side by side, a formation civilian planes do not oftenly practice. At seeing these planes, I asked my girls to see what the UFO would do and they mentioned that it had disappeared.  Because the mountain range was low in comparison to the height of the object, the fact that we were on a straight away, and the fact that we had observed the object moments before, we concluded that in fact it did disappear and was not obscured by the scenery.<n>

The colors changed from white to red to green in that sequence.  The object hovered in one spot for approximatly 30 seconds and then began to move in random directions.  While moving, the object would change it&#39;s rate of speed constantly and then stop suddenly.  It seemed to be higher than any helicopter could fly and with the random, sharp movements in made.....I don&#39;t believe this could be an airplain either.  It also moved in a small circular motion followed by a slighty larger circle.  When I got to my house I continued to watch it and found one other object that appeared to have the same light pattern on it.  The second light was small.  It seemed to move in the same formations as the original almost as if the two where comunicating.  I was too tired to continue to watch, so my observation stopped at approximatly 6:30 am January 1, 2003.  I hadn&#39;t had anything to drink and I was on no type of medication or taking drugs.  THIS WAS REAL<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at celestial bodies.  PD))<n>

I just layed there frozen following it with my eyes.

I NOTICED STRAIGHT AHEAD (SOUTH) A LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO BE GETTING LARGER, AND SEEMED TO BE MOVING CLOSER. I GOT SCARED, AND QUICKLY SHUT THE DOOR. THINKING THAT I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN WHAT I SAW, I REOPENED THE DOOR, AND SAW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GETTING BRIGHTER AND CHANGING COLORS FROM A YELLOWISH REDDISH LIGHT TO A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT.  IT WAS MOVING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION, AND JUST WHEN I THOUGHT IT WOULD GET CLOSER, IT TURNED HEADING WEST, AND THAT&#39;S WHEN I NOTICED THE VERY DARK OBJECT THAT I COULD JUST MAKE OUT THE SHAPE AS BEING DISC SHAPED. IT WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY, AND DIDN&#39;T MAKE A SOUND.  I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE IT WAS A BLIMP, BUT EVEN BLIMPS MAKE A SOUND WHEN IT GETS NEAR, AND THIS THING DIDN&#39;T.  I STOOD AND WATCHED THIS &#39;THING&#39; UNTIL I LOST SIGHT OF IT OVER THE TREE TOPS. I WATCHED THE NEWS, AND LISTENED TO THE RADIO BUT NEVER DID I HEAR OF A SIGHTING, OR PEOPLE SEEING SOMETHING STRANGE. MAYBE PEOPLE WERE STILL CELEBRATING NEW YEAR&#39;S EVE TO NOTICE. I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS AN UNITED STATES AIR FORCE BASE LESS THAN A MILE AWAY!<n>
1/1/03 01:30|Mocksville|NC|Unknown|1 min|UFO and alien sighting|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61012.html|318|ndxe200301| UFO and alien sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly this is not a hoax.  Back in 2003 when my wife and I lived in Mocksville I believe I had an encounter with aliens.  I remembered seeing two very strange looking creatures standing at the foot of my bed!  I closed my eyes and reopened them and they were gone.  I thought maybe I had still been dreaming so I went back to sleep, but it took awhile as I was a little freaked out.  The next morning I got about 7:00 AM to get my shower before I left for work.  When I got in the shower and the water ran down my leg I noticed a burning feeling on the back of my left leg.  When I turned my leg around to see what it was I had a perfect 2&#34; X 2&#34; square of hair missing on my leg and it was a little red???  I&#39;m not sure what exactly happened that night, but needless to say it freaked me totally out.  My wife is the only other person I have told about this, because I figured people would think I&#39;m crazy.  About a year later I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom.  While using the bathroom I noticed a white light zipping across the sky.  As I began to stare at it, the object completely stopped.  About 30 seconds later it took off again so fast I almost lost track of it.  I got my wife up and showed it to her.  Neither of us had any idea what in the world it could be since there are no aircrafts that I know of that can move like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I stopped along the road because I wanted to get a better look at this gigantic large but it took only a second to realize it wasn&#39;t a large plane.  It was enormous disk shaped flying object with three levels of lights around the center that changed color every few seconds from yellow than to green,than to purple,than red. It could travel within seconds multi directions.  It made a soft humming sound as it came over the city of Mcallen.  I looked around to see if any other cars were out so they could also be witnesses but since it was a nite of party there wasn&#39;t another person in sight.  It hovered over a tall building downtown called the towel for a minute or so than disappeared.  I went as fast as I could home and told  my husband.<n>

I had asked my son (age 15) and his friend to help me unload the truck.  I casually glanced to look for Orion which I tend to do.  I immediately noticed 6 stars that I didn&#39;t recognize. They were orangish yellow in color and they were moving.  I also observed that they were in a pattern of a very thin #4.  I called to my son and his friend and told them to look. I then called my wife who was 2 doors down wishing a neighbor Happy New year.  The cratf appeared to be traveling in a NW direction from the SW.  They were very high(could&#39;ve been 100-200 miles).  We all noticed that they began to turn to the SW.  The turn was abrupt and they fomed another pattern similar to the Big Dipper.  They continued to extend  starting to form a single line and then one by one seemed to shoot straight up out of sight.  I did also notice that one or two seemed to have smaller lights shooting out from them and then disappearing.<n>

We watched them fly at high speeds.  Periodically they would slow down almost to a stop, then resume flying very fast again.  All of a sudden they all stopped, and slowly their bright light (resembling stars almost) faded out.  This was all in a matter of 3 to 5 minuts that we all observed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have watched the news since witnessing this and there has been no word on anything.  In speaking with other friends (that were not with us that evening), they had also witnessed the sighting.<n>

We all went outside to bang some pots and pans and shoot off our party poppers. During the celebration I looked up at a very clear sky and noticed two orange/red orbs glowing and moving very very slow across the sky one was in front of the other. (This wasn&#39;t the first time I had seen something like this, about 5 weeks ago my sister and I saw one just like it in the sky heading east across the sky)The orbs were traveling this time from the east heading west. As before when I watched the ball move across the sky sparks or fire of some sort, kind of like a sparkler, trailed off from the fireball. The shapes took a turn and started heading off to the north the they both burn out within five seconds of each other.<n>
