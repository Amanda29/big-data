Once it made it to 2500 ft. it suddenly reversed back to close to its original position so fast that it was a bright blur to the eyes and vanished.

10/15/69 21:00|Exeter (near)|NH|Cigar|30 min|I was returning from the first Vietnam Moratorium (that is how I fix the date accurately) in Boston with some friends in an old VW bus.|5/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36716.html|8|ndxe196910| I was returning from the first Vietnam Moratorium (that is how I fix the date accurately) in Boston with some friends in an old VW bus. The VW was starting to act up(I don&#39;t suspect any UFO effects - just a typical college junker VW) so we exited I-95 and got onto a side road south of exeter and portsmouth, NH.As we started up a hill with the VW it started to die and did so part way up the hill. Well there was a light on at a house about 150 yards up the road (the only house around) and so we walked up to the house and asked to use the phone. I called my roommate and asked for him to pick us up. We went back to the VW and sat there waiting and looking out the window at the night sky. After a few minutes I saw some lights (pretty much tiny discs to points of light positioned to the right side of our vehicle) in the sky that were moving in a way I had never seen. They would move in different directions and in different ways. A typical move would be to move in a straight line and then take a 90 degree turn without slowing down. I am familiar with aircraft movement since I lived near Pease air base and was used to seeing the high speed f-111&#39;s that were stationed there. These lights were in the 30 to 80 degree range off the horizon and were moving at times at speeds like a jet fighter and at other times they would be still in the air. One even was still in the sky and then just took off at speed , went up in the sky and disappeared. One time several moved to a single point in the sky but there always seemed to be 6 or 8 or maybe more craft visible at any time.There came a time when I caught sight of a Cigar shaped craft moving slowly through my field of vision and across the road we had come up to our present  position. The craft continued to moveacross the road and settled down over what seemed to be a field on the other side of the road and by this time I was 50 to 75 yards down the road from the VW and on the left side of the road. I was somewhat excited when it settled down and was furth! er conflicted when lights came on and blinked around the craft. I say around the craft because a light would blink from right to left and as it reached the left of the craft it would disappear and shortly thereafter it would reappear blinking at the right edge of the craft.I say the plural lights since I believe there were many lights with only one coming on at a time. And there were other lights that stayed on that appeared to be windows above the centerline where the blinking lights were located. I had mixed emotions at this point - wonder and fear. I turned and ran over to my friends up the road - they nwere still watching other lights- and told them there was something they have to see. We headed back to where we could see the cigar and it was gone. Some traffic came by- one stoppedto see if we needed help and after that all craft were gone. The whole experience from first sighting was probably about20 - 30 minutes and the cigar sighting I had was in the 2-4 minute range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The exact day of the month I can not recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look up at the sky as I was riding and saw what I first thought was the moon, but then noticed it seemed brighter and orange-ish in color…and was featureless. (no dark spots or “man in the moon”)  Almost immediately  it grew until it filled the entire sky, then disappeared completely. The effect was like the moon was falling and I remember ducking! I stopped riding and continued to watch the sky, wondering what I had seen. Suddenly it was back…in the same position as the first time, only a green-ish color this time. Again it quickly grew until it filled the whole sky, then disappeared again just like before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a bit scared at this point (I was 14 at the time) and rode home quickly, telling my mother what I had seen as soon as I got in the house. About 10 minutes later a report came over the radio (local AM station) saying that “strange lights you may have seen in the sky” were “atmospheric testing”. At that time you accepted what you heard on radio or TV as fact, so case closed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in life I often wondered what sort of “atmospheric testing” it could have been and why I had never heard anything more about it. I have since searched the internet extensively and can find no mention of any type of testing that could produce this sort of phenomena,  I was tempted to make this report after reading a very similar report dated 2/20/70 in Ft. Dix, NJ, which is only about 60 miles from my sighting location in Wilmington, DE. The NJ report says “date approximate” so I wonder if their sighting could have actually been 4 months earlier, as I’m fairly certain of the month and year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to hear if anyone else witnessed this as the Ft Dix report is the only other mention of this I can find anywhere!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Movement appeared to be from South to North at a speed I would now estimate at no more than 55 knots. I calculate the speed by using other more common references such as identifiable aircraft I have seen in the same vicinity on other days. The object I observed and the object / crafts unusual attitude is something I have never seen repeated with any modern aircraft past or present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of object: Cigar shaped (ends pointed), dimensional measurements estimated as follows – Length 250’, 30’ girth, color a dark gray, almost black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Detail of sighting: On the day of the UFO sighting, 3 friends and I where playing football in my parent’s backyard, I was the first to notice the object. My friends where more interested in playing football rather then studying the anomaly which I alerted them all to … I can remember one of my friends stating after looking at the object that it must be an aircraft banking and thus no visible empennage or wings. I continued to watch more intently after the friend’s suggestion and waiting for what seemed to be about 2 minuets as to view the craft turn and expose some identifiable surface. However I did not notice any change in the flight path of the object nor view any recognizable aircraft surfaces. In fact the angel of the object and its assent seemed so unusual I thought perhaps the object was a blimp, but I concluded that was not logical seeing its shape, speed, lack of identifiable markings, attitude and size. After about a total of 3-1/2 minutes I turned to my friends again to explain to them my thoughts and when I turned back the object was gone. The last point I saw the object put it in the clear of clouds and its disappearance in just an instant still amazes me even today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I saw the report from millington on this date and I remember something very similar.  Myself, my brother, 2 cousins and a friend were sleeping out in the back yard and were looking at a bright clear night sky.  I was about 11 years old.  I first saw a triangular formation of 9 crafts, red in color moving from south to north.  No blinking lights noted.  Was constant color of red.  To traverse the whole sky took about 1 hour.  As we watched, the formation looked like a rack of balls on a pool table missing the 1 ball at the front.  From nowhere, a single craft started moving toward the formation of 9.  That formation stopped, then one left that formation to join up with the single.  It looked like they were going to collide.  They did not.  These two, joined the others, and became a complete formation with the one joining at the front to complete it and continue across the sky.  We watched till they traversed across the whole sky to the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A note on my experience, I am ex USAF.  I have been in the aircraft industry for over 20 years professionally and still employed in the aircraft industry.  Am very familiar with all aircraft and flight dynamics.  I have studied flight since I was about 10 years old.  I know how aircraft act along with rotor craft.  This formation was way too high for that and NO sound was noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I was 8, my older brother and I nightly analyzed the sky for 2.5 weeks as a result of frequently-reported UFO sightings. I saw an inverted-V formation of 8 lights - 4 down on each side, indistinguishable from stars, quickly invert to a V-shape and then, in about 1 second, traverse from the directly-South sky to the directly-West sky. A perfect 45-degree hemisphere shift in 1 second. I was able to point this V-shaped configuration out to others for two nights following my sighting. The Lt. Genl.&#39;s report, which inspired mine, are similar except that the star-like formation he reported was in an inverted-V in the west, shifted to a V-shape, then traversed 45 degrees south, in about 1 second, &#34;indistinguishable from the stars&#34;. That&#39;s 22 years that these &#34;monitors&#34; have been doing whatever they are doing. And I agree with the Lt.

It felt as if we were being observed, at first I thought it was a star, but it didn&#39;t twinkle or flicker. Then after watching it for a few minutes and commenting on it, it began to move in what was a zig zag pattern upward in to the sky and then all of a sudden it disappeared and what was left as it disappeared was a silowette of a oval like shape as a faint outline before it completey dissappeared from site. It moves very fast in a ziz zag pattern or zzzzzz pattern. The color was a white light.<n>
