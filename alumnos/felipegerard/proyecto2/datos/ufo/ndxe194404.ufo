It did not seem to move. It glowed which over thhe years puzzled me. Then several years ago I read that they can emit light. The sun was out and it was a perfectly clear early summer day. I paid particular attention to the brightness. It closely matched the appearance of several new from the factory B-29&#39;s, uxcept for the planes showed the riveted parts, etc. I womdered how the sun could make it shine as the sun was a lot farther away. I am sure that many hundreds of our people on the base saw it, too. We speculated that it might be a Jap baloon as we knew some had come over the Pacific NW. That evening at mess in the Officer&#39;s Club we talked about it. Some said a P-63 had been sent up to investigate, but that it was just as far away at 30,000 ft. as from the ground??  Also, Jupiter was mentioned. If that was true, I have seen that planet only once in my life.  This sighting has troubled me for 61 years now. I have a more detailed write-up in my records. I am a Registered Professional Engineer with over 40 years experience and perfect credentials. ((name deleted)). Kingwood, Texas 77339 Former ((rank deleted)) Air Corps.<n>
