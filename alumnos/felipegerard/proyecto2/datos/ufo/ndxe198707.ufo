Has always been considered a creepy location /  make out area / and actually is very sceneic.  I was with a friend named ((name deleted)).  His father worked at UNCA as a debunker.  I had 2 other UFO encounters and we were at this location discussing paranormal subjects.  We both were about 20 years old. We had been there a little over an hour, and the ironic thing was ((name deleted)) was telling me that he did not believe in ghosts and UFOs and was giving me a speech about rational thinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suffer from an abnormal epileptic condition, and have noted when i see UFO i feel a tingling sensation that is in the epileptic family of sensation for me.  I told ((name deleted)) this and he said we were going to sit there till i admited this was none rational thinking.  This converation was nearing 9pm.  By about 9:15 was getting dark, cold, and starting to get hungry.  I still felt the sensation, but wanted to leave as was not dressed to be on a Mt after dark.  I was just about to admit to him was being irrational when i felt the sensation grow very intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting on large rocks and over ((name deleted)) shoulder i could see what appeared to be a falling star falling from directly overhead, and should quickly vansih behind a Mt we were facing.  ((name deleted)) saw it and said...  that is just.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> He paused as right before the object should have vanished it stopped above the tree line.  It was not very bright, and would say the Mt. across from us was maybe 2 to 3 miles away across the Beaver Dam area of N. Asheville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) stared at the object and was speechless.  It slowly bloomed to be much brighter.  It was mainly intense white in color, but was so bright it appeared blue at the edges on the light.  The light appeared more in rays than round coming from it and seemed to pulse with energy.  I was now tingling all over with the electrical sensation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object danced up above the tree lines and did shapes, then would drop below the mt area.  But near instantly would come back up in another area of the mt.  This went on for a period of about a min.  My friend was speaking random curses such as &#34;well ((deleted)) I cannot be seeing seeing this ((deleted)) thing&#34;  Even, My dad is going to dis-own me if i tell him this!  Suddenly the object pulled up above the MT.  and speed up and away from us in a burst of speed and simple went out of visible site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend ((name deleted)) looked at me and asked me if i was still feeling funny... and i answered him... even stronger now then before and started getting very frightened as right when i said this we heard sticks snap in every direction around us.  The car was about 75 feet up the hill from us and almost instantly hearing what sounded like hundreds of footsteps we made a mad dash for his Honda.  We did not take time to even open the doors... we were absolutely scared out of our wits.  ((name deleted)) dropped his keys trying to start the car.  Finally he was able to get it started and we drove down this very poorly made dirt road far faster than was safe.  After getting off the hill we came to an Ingle&#39;s grocery store that is about 3 miles away on the main road and went in simply to be near other people as we were so freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sooner after went back to my home where a large group of our friends were visiting that night.  We all told the story to everyone there and we both were stil scared out of our wits.  I was trying to figure out if i sense the thing coming - or if i actually attracted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not talked to ((name deleted)) since in my mid 20&#39;s.... but am sure he would still collaborate the details of this story.  Have had 4 UFO experiences in my life.. and feel as a result they increase ESP and just cause changes in awareness.  ((name deleted)) reported after this night seeing a UFO again during a lake campout and suddenly having odd ESP and paranormal activities that became consistant for him also.  If there is any desire to get him to file a report i can give you info so as to be able to contact him if you deemed it valuable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will await the corroborating report from the other witness.  Source of this report describes self as having an engineering degree.  PD))<n>
7/29/87 01:30|Edmonton (Canada)|AB|Triangle|3 minutes|large black triangular shape had three lights red, white and blue, hovered a few minutes, no sound…|5/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81186.html|2|ndxe198707| large black triangular shape had three lights red, white and blue, hovered a few minutes, no sound...<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 29, 1987, I saw a UFO at Pigeon Lake (Ma-me-o Beach), Alberta, Canada.  The sky was clear with no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family (husband, daughter, daughter’s friend, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, brother’s friend and I) were vacationing at Ma-Me-O Beach.  We had a cabin on the beach with a firepit in the yard.  About 1:30 AM, my husband, his brother, his brother’s friend and I were sitting around the firepit talking.  Suddenly my brother-in-law said, &#34;Look at that!,&#34; and pointed up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the lake, at very high altitude, was a large black triangular shape silhouetted against the sky.  It had three lights at the widest point of the triangle, red, white and blue.  They did not blink.  At the speed of a regular plane it went to the middle of the lake, stopped and hovered for what seemed like a few minutes.  It raised itself up and down, and then took off at an incredibly high rate of speed.  It disappeared in a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about it, trying to decide what it was.  My husband is well read on aircraft, and couldn’t match it to any he knew.  Years later we thought it might have been a Stealth bomber on a test run, but the light configuration, manoeuvrability and speed did not match.  Also, what we saw was much larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never forgotten the incident, and it remains clear in my mind to this day.  I still wonder what it was.<n>
7/28/87 15:00|Tucson|AZ|Flash|4 weeks|I am apparently being watched, because my family is from Roswell, NM. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71851.html|3|ndxe198707| I am apparently being watched, because my family is from Roswell NM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never knew anybody was taking official reports.  Sorry for the delay, I heard about you last week.  I&#39;ve been telling this story to anybody with an interest.  There&#39;s more than one encounter, I&#39;ll start with the first one and keep adding.  I&#39;m 62, this happened when I was 40, and it continued to happen.  My last encounter was 1991 and I sort of avoid being caught in this again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family is from Roswell NM.  My grandfather&#39;s sister ((name deleted)) and her husband had a ranch there in the early 1900s.  My dad&#39;s family lived in Las Vegas NM.   My grandfather worked on the railroad there.  He died in an accident, and my father was 12, he went to live with his Aunt in Roswell.  He knew all the native American teenagers.  They all grew up together.  They took the horses to the mesas and camped out a lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad used to visit every summer, he loved the desert, only he wouldn&#39;t drive at night.  The night desert spooked him.  My dad couldn&#39;t wear a watch, the hands would spin.  We sort of accepted that as a crazy thing, never paid much attention to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were crossing the desert with my dad in 1954, I had an incident.  I was about 10.  We got to Gallup NM, and I bolted from the car and ran - My dad couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong.  I was hysterical.  I remember it to this day.  There was a time gap, something like that - I couldn&#39;t account for missing time.  After my dad calmed me down, we got a hotel and stayed the night.  I&#39;m telling you this, because in 1991, the exact same thing happened when I got near Gallup NM.  Only that time, my son was with me - and he remembers it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got picked up in 1991 - we drove up a ramp or something, or thru a vortex, that looked exactly like Gallup NM - only the people weren&#39;t acting right.  They were acting - my son remembers passing the same landmark twice - and now he&#39;s 26, and he still remembers it.  We never talk about it, its pretty upsetting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 1991 incident was like the final time - I kept getting picked - they were following me around - I was so used to it, I would just play dumb and hope that the time frame would move along - they&#39;re still watching me, but I have asked them please do not interfere with me or my family - I&#39;m getting a little too old for this- we need to be as normal as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back to 1987 - We were living in Los Angeles in 1984.  I had a strange feeling, like I was supposed to move to Tucson.  My cousin lived there, so we went to visit.  After we got home, I sold everything and we moved to Tucson.  Just pulled up and moved.  I got a job at the University of ARizona assisting the Dean.  I have a BA in Fine Arts, and I was a legal secretary for 20 years.  I&#39;m also a music teacher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I understand mathematical principles and science, and was majoring in math, but I got bad headaches.  The math calculations would spin so fast, it gave me a headache.  So I switched to music.  I can hear music in my head - which really helps if you compose.  It&#39;s a fairly common skill among musicians.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But somehow, this ability to hear and pick up sound, was meant for more than music.  I started picking up sound when I got to Tucson.  I could hear things and I would ask people, do you hear that?  They couldn&#39;t hear anything.  I heard a high pitched signal, like a transmitter.  My son can hear these high pitched signals too.  In fact, he used to hold his ears shut with his hands and refuse to go into places he could hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either it was subliminal broadcasting, or I was listening to something else.  Tucson is a pretty strange place you understand, pretty close to the largest copper deposit in America - copper will pick signals up, I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the University for about 2 years, on and off, and I had a job working for an attorney.  In July 1987, I started picking up stronger signals at the university.  Like something was under the university property.  I worked in a basement laboratory for a professor.  I finally had to quit, I got dizzy and I couldn&#39;t concentrate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I quit, I started hearing the same signals in my apartment - and it got really strong.  I started freaking out - I lost my cool - and since my family has always been a little strange in the first place - I decided to would have a chat with whoever was signaling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, out loud &#34;Look, whoever you are, I&#39;m a rational person, I don&#39;t talk to people who aren&#39;t there, who I can&#39;t see, so if you need to talk to me, you need to be really really clear, and it has to be something I can&#39;t miss.&#34;  So I tossed it out there - and apparently they heard me.  Because a few days later, I was losing sleep and becoming increasingly disoriented.   I fell asleep in the afternoon with the window open - and the next thing I know - a massive gust of wind came thru the window and slammed all the doors - and I could not open my eyes.  I could see without my eyes being open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on some planet and the temperature was below zero - everything was frozen solid - I could hear the sound of breaking glass, or high pitched bells, people talking - and I was unable to move.  I am highly analytical and I started making mental notes - trying to see on the sides -  And just like that, I was out of it.  I literally packed up my kids and told them to get in the car - and I started driving south on Interstate 19 south of Tucson.  I was shaking really bad.  All I knew is I wanted to get out of the apartment - I couldn&#39;t breathe and I was shaking really bad  A storm started rising up from the South, and started moving in - I got off the highway at Valencia - and turned left.  I was shaking so bad, I had to stop the car.  I told the kids to get out, while I calmed down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somebody was standing right behind me - that I couldn&#39;t see, blowing on my neck.  I had the kids with me, and I was terrified.  We started walking, and we went a few blocks, and ended up in front of a bank.  It started raining, the kids were wondering what was going on.  I told them, go in the bank and sit down, I&#39;ll stay out here for a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the kids went in the bank, and I was standing there - the bank saw we were in distress and called the police.  The police came, talked to me, and I had to make something up - like I was tired -  Right about then, I looked like a lunatic.  My kids were really upset.  They called my husband at work - he works as a mathematician and engineer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the police were standing there, the storm rolled in, two of the policemen touched me, and man, a huge bolt of lightening smacked me - and I saw the sun explode - and I thought - well, I must be dead.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> The police looked at me, grabbed me again, and somebody took over my body and literally threw the police on the ground.  I guess touching is a no-no.  Then this voice goes &#34;do exactly as I tell you, we need to get you out of here&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess I was on the &#34;wrong side&#34;  The police started acting really stangely.  A woman came out of the bank, and she stared at the police and said &#34;she&#39;s fine you need to go now&#34; - and they got in the car and left.  When did you ever see that happen.  Then she said &#34;come inside, do you need a glass of water?&#34;  All of a sudden, it all turned, now everybody wanted to get me a glass of water.  My husband showed up, he stared at me and the kids - and he tried to escort us home.  It just got crazier and crazier after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somebody started driving the car, and the kids and I had to go for a ride.  I wasn&#39;t &#34;me&#34; anymore - I was somebody else.  Whoever it was, beamed down here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a day of driving around, and running out of gas in the desert, the police found us again - and man I had some explaining to do after that.  My husband was furious.  I had to sit there and take it - and pretend I was nuts - I wasn&#39;t nuts.   I was trying to observe.  He was trying to show me something.  He explained things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I said, &#34;well why are you telling me all this stuff, I&#39;m nobody.&#34;  the answer was pretty much I had to wait about 25 years, and then there was a pretty good possibility that the information would end with me unless people were willing to listen.  Other than look like a nut, that&#39;s how it all started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The police transported me to a mental facility - and I had to sit there for 4 weeks looking like a nut case.  I went along with the whole thing.  While I was there, I had a little radio with a headset.  When I changed the batteries, the batteries drained in my hand.  That hasn&#39;t happened again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 1987, nothing happened again until 1991 - I was driving across I-40, approaching Gallup NM, and the road just ended, there was another flash, and the road was back - only I was not in Gallup NM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stop there all the time, whenever I drive to NM.  Chief Yellowhorse sits on the property - it&#39;s a sacred site.  I usually stop and go in, maybe get a drink and buy some jewelry - but most things are unspoken -  The university offered me an office position with the Mars project - but I turned it down and went back to Los Angeles.  If I knew what was going on, I could be much more straightforward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was in Los Angeles, I saw the black triangle craft with the red lights, just once.  It hovered over the San Fernando Valley - I think long enough for me to see it - then it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other thing that was pretty spectacular, was a light show over Mesa Arizona around 1991 - it was a series of dots and dashes in blasts of color, that streamed across the sky and went directly over our apartment.  I got my husband and the neighbors, and we all stood there and watched.  It came from the direction of the airport, and the next day, the paper ran a story that somebody was fooling around with lights - and not to pay any attention to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a lot to say, there&#39;s more, but that gives you a general idea of what happened.  I had problems going to Santa Fe NM a couple of years ago.  I told them, again,  &#34;I am not going to tolerate a repeat performance, so if you don&#39;t mind, I need you to back off!&#34;  And they respect my wishes, if you can believe that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sort of have an understanding.  They&#39;re here if I need them to be here for any reason, which is sort of comforting, but I really don&#39;t want to go thru anything like that ever again unless it&#39;s part of scientific research and there&#39;s plenty of documentation and researchers on board.  I&#39;m more than happy to walk any research team thru this, I&#39;m just not going to chase them down.  They need to ask me and respect the territory.  I refuse to be treated like a nut job -  I just saw your Characteristics secion.  Yes, my car engine stopped and forced me to walk for miles in the desert.  Also, in 1987, on that date, (I am positive of the date)  tucson lost all electricity at the date and hour - all the electricity went out for about 15 minutes in an electrical storm - you would have to check the newspapers - but I&#39;m sure that was the day -  The voice kept saying &#34;I&#39;m turning off the power&#34; - apparently they can&#39;t get in unless the power is out -  There was also a lot of extremely loud &#34;car&#34; type horns - deep ones - blasting signals - it all happened so fast - and then the voice goes &#34;how&#39;s this?&#34;  He&#39;s a real sarcastic alien with a really great sense of humor - it&#39;s like &#34;jokes on me&#34; - It&#39;s like, human beings think they are so smart, and that just isn&#39;t the case.  We are really really stupid.  I came to terms with my stupidity years ago, and I guess that&#39;s appealing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m positive they were watching my dad and then me - this is a family thing - I am not even sure if we&#39;re from this planet - I&#39;m starting to have my doubts seriously - this family is very very strange -  You won&#39;t be able to meet my oldest brother - but he looked exactly like an alien drawing - he was super tall and very thin and bony - he even scared me a little - He passed away a few years ago.  I guess our family was out in Roswell when that craft went down in 1947 - I was born in 1946 in California - at least that&#39;s what they tell me.  My birth certificate is from a hospital that doesn&#39;t exist anymore - and there are no photos of my mom being pregnant - she and I never got along much - it was mostly dad and myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, if that isn&#39;t the strangest story you got in a long time, at least you were entertained.  I also see that you want to know if I agree to talk to an investigator.  Yes, you can do that, but don&#39;t do it over a phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Email is better.  I can&#39;t talk by phone to anybody and depend on the conversation being confidential.  My ex husband works at the National Security Agency in Washington.  He monitors my phone calls - he hates me because I threw him out 30 years ago.  That&#39;s a whole other story.   I wish aliens would pick him up and keep him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much love.

They appeared to be in a rectangle form object. It was moving slow to the south/southeast. The lights didnt flash or blink. The space inbetween the circles of light were dark. I tend to think about this alot because thats when there were reports of large herds of cattle missing. There were no sounds and i couldnt tell the distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of three seemingly credible reports submitted by the same source.  PD))<n>

7/22/87 10:15|Seattle|WA|Triangle|about 2 minutes|Saw a triangular light formation on an aerial object with a light pulsing in the middle pass directly overhead on the Puget Sound|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38009.html|6|ndxe198707| Saw a triangular light formation on an aerial object with a light pulsing in the middle pass directly overhead on the Puget Sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place in Washington state on a state ferry going from Vashon Island to Fauntleroy in West Seattle. THe sighting took place at about 10:15PM on Thursday, July 8th. About 30 minutes before the sighting, waiting in line in the car for the ferry, I noticed a helicopter moving in from the NE to the SE. I saw it and then it moved behind us and I could hear it for some time. A little bit later I was on the ferry in the car, which was parked at the very front of the ferry. I saw one helicopter who had 5 or so uncolored lights on. I also saw another object, that I could not discern as a helicopter or plane. It was too far away for me to tell its shape, but I could tell it was pointed. I thought it might be a small airplane. The unidentified object was directly in front of the ferry, and the helicopter was a ways to the left, moving to circle the area. The helicopter and unidentified object appeared to be at about the same height, and around the same speed, though the helicopter was farther away (I am terrible at estimating distances and altitude and speed.) The helicopter&#39;s lights, after a few seconds, changed to one uncolored light and one red/blue light (it appeared to be two lights cloase to each other, but I am nto sure) that alternated in blinking between uncolored and red/blue. This was the lighting all helicopters I saw from that point on were using. The unidentified object remained the same in terms of lighting. I looked at the object closely, as it passed directly over the ferry. I saw that the lights were all uncolored, shaped in an equilateral triangle, with one light in the center appearing to pulsate. I saw this from directly under the object as it passed over the ferry. Then the object mobed behind us and the ferry itself obstructed my ability to see it. The helicopter also moved out of sight as it moved to the left of the ferry where I was unable to see it. However, a few minutes later one helicopter came over the hill directly in front of me, and another came in! from the right where it had been invisible to me before due to the ferry obstructing my vision. I estimate that in all there were 3 or 4, possibly even 5 helicopters that appeared to be circling the area around Vashon Island. The craft I saw did not exhibit physically remarkable flight characteristics, except possibly for air-speed which I am not capable of effectively judging and so have no idea. The craft simply moved in a straight line and maintained the same speed and altitude. Like I said I guess it was traveling a little faster than the helicopters in the area, but it is hard for me to tell. Once I got off the ferry I saw another helicopter which was likely one of the ones I had seen earlier coming around in the circle. As surprising as it may sound I did not attempt to look back across the water at the object and choppers after I got off the ferry. I am not certain why.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/21/87 23:00|New York City (Brooklyn)|NY|Oval|60 Minutes|above-city sighting of oval-shaped U.F.O. during meteor shower|10/15/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25481.html|7|ndxe198707| above-city sighting of oval-shaped U.F.O. during meteor shower<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please confirm the date entered above is the second to last Tuesday in the month of July. I was on the roof of my mother&#39;s apartment building, located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. That&#39;s right, Brooklyn, New York just a few miles outside of the Big Apple itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If memory serves, I believe I was locked out of our top floor apartment, having misplaced my keys. So I had to wait for my mother to return from having dinner with my father from Chinatown on the roof of my mother&#39;s tenement building. I recall it being a very nice night, kind of on the cool side, with low clouds at approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet of altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aside from the low, scattered clouds, the night sky was clear as a bell, and much of the stars were highly visible that night. What particularly had my utmost attention that night, was the elevated degree of meteorological activity that was taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay, so here I go. I witnessed an unusually low-flying &#34;shooting star&#34; decend toward the east, when to my amazement I noticed, just a second (or two) later, a oval-shaped object emitting a soft-white glow behind it as if it were in pursuit. In the next few minutes (perhaps for as much as the next 15-30 minutes or so) there were quite a number more of low-flying meteorites. One was of sufficient size, or perhaps it streaked low enough that I could actually hear it wisking through the atmosphere. The sound was brief, lasting approximately a second or so. From different directions in the night sky, I observed the same unidentified oval-shaped object fly in pursuit of several falling meteorites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time much of this increased meteorolgical activity was over, my mother had returned. I called her and told her to come up to the roof quickly. I then told her what I had been seeing, upon which she stayed with me for a while to gain the chance of possibly witnessing what I had seen for herself. Within a few minutes, another meteorite streaked in the distance to the east, after which both my mother and I witnessed the U.F.O. in pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the U.F.O. &#34;disappeared&#34; and ended its low altitude airshow, it flew towards both my mom and I on our left as we faced east. (Something makes me recall there being two this time, but I can not recall for sure.) It flew level and then took a 30 to 45 degree ascent into a cloud bank and disappeared for what I thought was for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on that evening, at approximately 00:30 hours, my brother had come up to the roof after having heard what was going on to catch a glimpse and mostly to poke fun. He was with me, when we both witnessed a distant point-of-light, that caught our eyes. From its distance and apparent height, it could have been a plane at high altitude or a star by appearance. Except, this &#34;star&#34; started moving irregularly across the sky and changed its relative position by a great distance. It is my belief that this object was very high up in the sky or possibly even outside our planet&#39;s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother dismissed what we both saw as OUR eyes playing tricks on us. On some level, I wish I could have done the same. I am glad for my mother having witnessed the U.F.O. flying at low altitude with me, as I needed someone to affirm that I was actually witnessing these crafts, right here, above the metropolis of New York.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I could estimate the size of the craft to some degree of accuracy. In the night sky and at a distance, it is a bit difficult to get an idea as to an object&#39;s relative size without some common frame of reference. What I can say is that the U.F.O. conducted manuvuers that only a fighter jet would be capable of performing. Its movements were swift and precise, but not necessarily beyond the means of a fighter jet. However, the U.F.O. performed all of the above flying activity at what appeared to be supersonic speeds. Not only did I not hear a sonic boom, I did not hear the craft produce an audible sound of any kind. Nor did I notice even a neglible loss of speed when it finally made its ascent into the cloud bank from which it did not reappear.<n>

I believe it was mid-day around 11 or noon.  Just outside Gypsum, past the high school, there was a small farm with a ranch house and barn on the left hand side of the road (we were headed East.)  While driving, we noticed a strange metallic oval/sphere that was hovering over the farmhouse.  It was about 20 – 30 feet above the house and seemed to be floating.  The metal of the object did not have any reflection and was hard to make out any detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not large, perhaps the size of a small car (VW bug).  The main thing that was odd was the way it moved.  It made no noise, and the object’s movements didn’t make sense or seem to apply to the laws of gravity and physics.  It floated, and then hovered above the farm house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, suddenly, the object shot up into the sky extremely fast.  Its speed was faster than anything had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, my husband and I looked at each other with stunned faces and said, “What was that?”  And then for some reason, we discounted it and never talked about it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had completely forgotten about this occurrence until a few years ago.  I have no idea why I didn’t report the incident or tell anyone else what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, without a doubt – I believe that it was something not natural or normal – definitely a UFO.<n>

My story is hardly the fodder from which films are made of, I was not abducted, nor did I have any implants or anything of that sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I will tell this anyways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It feels good to do so...  It was the summer of 1987. This was the year I graduated High School. I do not recall the exact date. This takes place in Missouri, about an hour and a half South East of Kansas City (+/-). Whiteman Air Force Base, now the home of the B-2 bomber, was at the time a missile base. It is about 30 to 45 minutes away from where this happened. To this day there are countless old missile silos scattered throughout this countryside, though they have been dismantled as far as I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine, as well as one of my uncles decided to go to a place outside of our hometown of Windsor, known as &#34;Windsor Crossing.&#34; Windsor Crossing is about fifteen minutes from Windsor, at the edge of Truman Lake, which in reality is the outer edge of the Ozarks. It is a much larger drink of water than what the word &#34;lake&#34; implies. At Windsor Crossing is a campground, as well as a dock to put boats out onto the lake, and a &#34;beach.&#34; Our plan for the evening was to go to the beach and go for a late night swim. Given the humid summers that Missouri experiences, this seemed like a great idea at the time. My two companions rode along with me, and I parked my car away from the beach as it was forbidden (dare I say &#34;Illegal&#34;) to go swimming there after dark-for our own safety of course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After our swim, all three of us went up onto the beach and lay down on the sand. The night was cool as I remember it. The sky was clear and dark blue, punctured by the pinhole-sized stars that littered the night too numerous to count. It was a very beautiful evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the three of us laid there on that beach talking, the conversation ultimately resolved itself to silence. Several moments passed. Then as always seems to be the case, when it is a beautiful night, the stars out, etc, somebody has to speak up about space, parallel universes, and things of that ilk. The guy that came along with my uncle and I was saddled with the nickname &#34;C((name deleted)).&#34; The reason behind this is simply because of his haircut. I won’t bore you with the details. Anyway, ((nickname deleted)) was the one guilty of breaking the silence with &#34;Wouldn’t it be cool if we saw a UFO?&#34; This was immediately greeted with a reprimand by none other than myself. I sat up in the sand and forcefully declared that no such thing existed, and that it was downright stupid for him to even bring it up. It was a beautiful, clear summer night. That was the reality of the moment. It seemed ridiculous to contaminate such a nice midnight swim with silly speculations of another race from outer space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> C((nickname deleted)) snorted something under his breath that vaguely resembled an apology. After several minutes, we all toweled the sand off of ourselves, got dressed and made way to my Toyota Celica (1978 GT. Moon roof.  Damn fine car. And I don’t like Japanese cars.) Windsor crossing is on Y highway between Windsor and a little speck of a town called &#34;Tightwad. Tightwad is only two minutes up the road past Windsor Crossing. This is significant as my girlfriend all during high school lived there. This meant I spent a great deal of time on that highway, naturally. So I was very familiar with all the details of that road. Where all the houses where. Where all of the lights where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And where lights should not be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were moving down Y towards Windsor, we came to the only stop on that highway. A stop sign at a 4-way in the middle of nowhere. We passed it. As our conversation continued (to this day I have no recollection what it was about), I noticed way out in the distance what looked like an amber light over a field (there are lots of fields in Missouri.). It did not register with me as I was immersed in a conversation of so much importance that I cannot recollect what in the heck it was about. So I filed the light waaaaaay in the back of my mental Rolodex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our conversation continued.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drew closer to the light, at this point it was still about a mile or so away, it demanded my attention again. It had suddenly dawned on me that there was no house in that area, save for one farm on the other side of Y highway. It could not be a lamppost; I would have seen it from all of my excursions to my girlfriend’s house in Tightwad. Cows of course, have no need for a lamppost out in the middle of a field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light now had my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I interrupted the conversation between my uncle T((name deleted)) and C((name deleted)) and drew their attention to the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As best I can remember, from that point on we were silent till we drew closer to the light. I pulled my car over to the right side of the road and all three of us got out to take a look at what was over the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what happened to the best of my recollection:  An amber light hung suspended over the field not quite two stories high. To give you an idea of what the light looked like to me, imagine looking at a streetlight through a foggy windshield. It had streaks that came out from the main source, but not sharply, they were not long streaks, just stationary. The light made no sound. Behind it was a single row of trees. I will describe the setting to give you an idea of the distance as best as I can recall it. Y highway is a lone country road out in the middle of nowhere. It is mostly used by the few that live down that road, and the summer traffic going to the lake. At well past midnight, we were the only ones on this road. This small road has no streetlights. So it is dark, save for the house light in the distance, or the occasional traffic lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where we were parked at the side of this two-way road, you could walk across it, cross a ditch and come to a fence. You could easily climb the four or five foot fence, take about thirty steps past it, and you would be beneath this thing. You could throw a rock and easily hit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three of us stood there and said nothing. We just looked at this light. It made no sound. It moved not an inch. It just hung there. An amber light with soft streaks emanating from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the part that I struggle to understand, much less explain to others: I do not know how this happened, nor do I recall seeing it happen at all. One second I/we were looking at this light floating over a field, and the next thing I know is that the light is no longer there, but what rested in it’s place was what we all know as that familiar cigar shape. Its outline could easily be made out against the clear blue night sky, punctured with millions of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This cigar shape seemed to me to be about the length of two or three full-sized cars. Around it was blocks of colors. Green, yellow and blue. These colors did not move. The cigar shape did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I tried to gather information about what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was near a row of tall trees, yet the leaves on the trees rustled only when a soft summer breeze passed. It made no sound. Not a hum that I could hear. Nothing. I could make out the blades of grass in the moonlight. They rustled not a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over at T((name deleted)), and he was silent. I looked over at my friend C((name deleted)), and he was silent too. My attention turned back to the cigar shape that hovered silently, effortlessly, over this field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea of how long we stood there and looked at it. I was not scared, quite to the contrary, I felt very peaceful. If I felt anything, it was the urge to run across the road, jump the fence, and run up and try to touch it. But I did not. As the tree of us stood there, I recall us saying things to one another, yet I cannot remember what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes, the cigar shape slowly rose up, over the treetops and lowered itself behind them, as if it was trying to hide from us! It was only one row of trees, so we could still easily make out the lights on its side, as well as the cigar shape. After what seemed like a short amount of time there, it again lifted up over the trees and went away from us. We jumped into my Celica (Damn fine car.), and sped down the highway following it. Ultimately, it stopped over a field. We parked the car on a curve that ran along side a hill that looked down on this field. At this point I was convinced that what we were seeing was indeed not a helicopter, or some kind of airplane. From beneath this (what I will now call a-) UFO shone a bright, concentrated white light. The light’s edges softened outward from its center. This light swept over the filed in patterns I did not recognize or find any logic to. It looked very random to me. After a few moments of this, at the blink of an eye, it was very high up in the sky and way out in the distance (and without even the slightest sound). Those lights around it now seemed to be rotating around it. Eventually, it was over the horizon. It would dip below the tree line, and then would pop back up again. It did this a couple of more times before it disappeared, never to be seen by us again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The conversation back to Windsor was dominated naturally, by what the three of us had become witnesses to. I dropped off my Uncle and my friend, but did not go home. Instead, I found myself driving around my hometown of 3,000 people just trying to process what was going around in my head. I eventually came to the parking lot of a grocery I worked at during high school and came across one of my co-workers there. I pulled up to his car. His window was rolled down and I could see his face. It was an expressionless mask, his eyes were hollow, and his skin as white as a sheet of paper. The first thing out of my mouth was-&#34;D((name deleted)), you won’t believe what I just saw!&#34;  D((name deleted)) interrupted me and said, &#34;I know what you just saw. It was a UFO.&#34;  His voice trembled, and there was very much a tone of concern to it. He had tried but failed to hide his fright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were on that hill on Y highway watching this thing bounce above and below the horizon…as it turns out, it was over another small town that is called Calhoun. D((name deleted)) girlfriend lived there. According to him, he and his girlfriend were sitting on the porch of her house, which has an awning over it, when he said he felt what amounted to a low rumble. A strong low hum. This caught my interest, as I did not hear any noise whatsoever from the UFO when I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of them sat there and from over her house this thing gently sailed over. They watched this, every bit of it as it stopped over her front yard, right in front of them. Then it went up high, above the tree line, and then back down, and then back up. According to D((name deleted)), it did this a few times before it ultimately shot up into the air and disappeared. This seems to match what we had witnessed on that highway, watching this thing go above the horizon, within our view, and then dip below our view a few times before ultimately disappearing. The UFO was described to me by D((name deleted)) as being saucer shaped, and metallic silver. This was all I could get out of him. He was visibly shaken and went home. I rode around town for several more minutes and did not see him again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home and looked at the clock and saw that it was about 3 am. I do not believe I lost any time as I can honestly believe that the incidents, including the time I spent driving aimlessly around town, realistically could have burned a couple of hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next time I ran into D((name deleted)), he was able to chat about it briefly, but he made it obvious that he wanted to put the whole experience behind him. In a small farming community, you could be the laughingstock of the whole town if you went around proclaiming to have seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well there you go. All 2,206 words of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never believed in anything if I could not reach out and touch it. This rule especially applied to UFO’s. My companions and I were not drunk, nor where we on any kind of drugs. We were just three guys on our way home from a swim.  That night, fifteen years ago, I saw something that I know with every fiber of my existence, answered my question of &#34;Is there life out there?&#34; Well I am now here to tell you that I believe that there is. And now that I have thought about it for years, and finally shared it with you. I am now saddled with an even bigger question: Why are they here?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They estimated it&#39;s size to be comparable to a typical 737 type passenger jet airliner and it was at a consistantly continuous altitude of several thousand feet above the ground (close to the same height as a airliner usually is in that area). They both insist that it could not be a reflection because they actually pulled to the right hand shoulder of the road and watched the thing go by. They say that no other vehicles were passing by in either direction when they were stopped. Unfortunately in addition to having no other witnesses to their account they do not have any phy! sical evidence of it either (photo&#39;s or anything else). There location where they pulled over was just in between the camp Kilmer U.S. Army reserve center and a small strip mall. All those years ago that part of Stelton road was not as developed as it is today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mothers occupation is a homemaker and my aunt works as a real estate agent along with doing sales for a book publisher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

I was 18 years old.  The trip was a circular route on the Moose River system, near the town of Jackman, and was of two weeks duration.  Twice during the trip our group (there were 8 or 9 of us- I can&#39;t remember exactly, it was a long time ago) was overflown by fighter aircraft flying very low and very fast.  Each such flight consisted of two-plane elements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the final day of the trip we camped on the shore of Attean Lake.  Looking now at a Google map, I believe we were camped on the North shore of the lake, very close to the railbed.  Each night of the field trip consisted of exercises designed to enhance our (the participants&#39;) understanding of the area&#39;s ecology and/ or fieldcraft skills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the last night, we did two exercises:  a hike to the summit of the hilltop past the railbed, overlooking the lake, and following that, each participant was to write down his or her overall impressions, and what we learned from the trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To sum up the trip, each participant was to find a place of our own, separate from the other participants so that each summation would be the genuine thoughts of the person writing it down.  Then, following dinner back at the campsite, each participant would read what they had written to the others:  this was so the group leaders could evaluate the success of the trip, and so the participants could add to each others&#39; knowledge base.  I remember walking about a half mile down the beach and finding a convenient log to sit on as I reflected on the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where it gets interesting, but it only became interesting to me about ten years ago (important to remember here that the trip took place in 1987) as I was sifting through some old photos I had taken on the trip.  In the same bag as the photos were the notes I had written on that last night of the trip, detailing my impressions- and it occurred to me that we had never completed the exercise.  We had each taken our notes, but we had NOT done the group reading and assessment of them, as we were supposed to have done.  I wondered why, and thought about it hard- and here are the memories to the best of my recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had finished writing my notes, and was walking back down the beach towards the campsite.  There was a little sandy point adjacent to the campsite, and as I came around it, I noticed the moon out over the lake- it was intensely full and bright, though the evening was early with plenty of daylight left.  As I rounded the point, I could see the rest of the group sitting around the fire (I am not sure if all the participants were present at this time- one or two may still have been off on their own), looking out at the lake.  I looked out again too, and I distinctly remember how striking the moon was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I carried with me an Olympus OM-1 camera- I had taken several rolls of film with me and got plenty of great photos of moose, other wildlife and landscapes.  This was a 35-mm camera with a manual light meter- you had to adjust the camera&#39;s settings using the light meter to get good photos.  I unslung the camera and aimed it at the moon, and flipped on the light meter.  It instantly registered overexposure.  I fiddled with every adjustment and could achieve nothing except overexposure.  I remember no conversation with other group members at this time, though I did look at them several times as I played with the camera- they were all looking at the moon.  Finally, I removed the batteries from the camera and again aimed it at the moon, and somehow it was still registering overexposure.  I remember that I was standing in the water up to my knees at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next clear memory I have is of waking up in my tent sometime much later that night when a train went past on the tracks above the campsite.  It was raining hard.  I have no recollection whatsoever of any moment between standing in the water to waking up in my tent.  I can only allude to &#34;missing time&#34; for reference to this time frame and I do not know what transpired therein.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, we packed up the campsite- there was uncooked food (beans) still in the pans, filled with rainwater.  Nothing about the previous night was discussed on the paddle back to the landing, though I do remember all the group members being extremely tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might not have remembered any of this had I not been looking through  those old photos, but I believe it significant that the anomalies- the fact that we didn&#39;t discuss our impressions of the trip, nor did we discuss the events of that night- struck me immediately once I found the notes.  I remember the names of some of the group leaders but have not maintained any contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote to the USAF to ask them why the fighter jets might have been in the area in that time frame, and received a reply from a Public Information Officer (a Major, I believe), who told me that such flights were common, and were likely routine training flights, originating from any of a number of bases, including Pease in Massachusetts or Loring, Maine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date during the summer of 1987 is approximate.  I spoke via telephone with the witness, and he struck me as being an exceptionally serious-minded individual.  He works as a public employee, although I should not reveal what the nature of his work is, or even where he works.  We are going to attempt to locate the other witnesses.  PD))<n>

Looking upwards, about of our houses&#39; roof, suddenly an object did occur. My wife and yself watched as this seemingly rectangled object, pitch black,  no sounds, crept by over us, it were going so slow that one would of thought gravity should of caused something to come down. // This soundless object has 3 white lights + 3 red. Of terms of width, when further in view forward &gt;&gt;&gt; my left hands little finger and forefinger, while as pulled together while hand exstended, measured its rear two red lights.

It was about 40-60 feet above the ground about 1/2 mile away from me.  It flew (silently and slowly) from the left to the right.  The craft had a central &#34;belt&#34; around it&#39;s diameter.  This &#34;belt&#34; of the craft rotated like a ring on a person&#39;s finger, while the craft just moved from left to right in the night&#39;s sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ring or belt had circular lights on it that were lined up (like diamonds in a channel set anniversary band).  They were of different colors, green, red, blue, orange, yellow.  They didn&#39;t flash, just rotated as the band that they were attached to rotated.  I slapped my face, and yes, I was awake. The UFO just flew off out of my sight.  I have spoken to one other person who has seen a very similar craft in Indiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The service road runs along the base of a ridgeline that extends west of Lookout Mtn.   The Triangular craft appeared from the east coming over the ridgeline. It blocked out the entire night sky (clear night) above my head and I would guess was flying at somewhere between 700-1000 ft. It had 3 lights, one at each corner in Green, Red and White.  It made no sound, basically hovering above the ridge for at least 3-5 minutes. It then banked slightly, turned due west and slowly made its way towards Hunstville. I watched it for at 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know what to think, it was too weird to deal with locally so I kept it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did note that the direction it went off in houses the Military&#39;s Redstone Arsenal.<n>

We went into the lounge at Interlaken Inn and reported to our friends. They too had ran outside to watch it. It flew over at abt 1000 ft. and made no sound. The nite was clear &amp; many small planes were flying. The lights were very white and steady. This was the second time I&#39;ve seen it.<n>

My grandmother was also in the kitchen, standing at the sink washing dishes, and her daughter (my aunt) was just off the side using the phone and looking out the sliding glass back door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly my aunt let out a terrifying scream and was pointing upward at something just outside that door.  My grandmother leaned over and was looking out the window in front of her and terror struck her face as she ran to that door.  They were both just standing there, with their mouths and eyes wide open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frantically I was asking, &#34;What’s wrong?  What’s going on?,&#34; but I couldn’t see &#34;up&#34; from behind them.   I knew something was terrible from the frightened looks of their faces.  Finally my aunt mumbled, &#34;It’s a UFO,&#34; and I wanted to see too, but I was too scared to look then.  They began talking about the bright white lights surrounding this &#34;UFO,&#34; and how close it was.  And just as quickly as it came, it was gone.   By the time I got to the door there was nothing to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many questions later revealed that they believed it was a UFO because of its circular shape and the lights all around the exterior.  It was unlike anything that was normally flying in the sky.  They said it came real close to the earth; that it was just above the roof of the house and hovered in that one spot for maybe 10 seconds and then shot off like a bullet into the unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While reminiscing years later, I brought up that night during a family gathering.  My grandmother and aunt both had no recollection of the event whatsoever.  It hadn’t been that long ago and they both had excellent memory.   I had thought maybe they were joking with me, but they really didn’t know what I was talking about and declared innocence when I asked them if they were just playing a joke on me when I was a kid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still ask them occasionally if they remember and always get an unsuccessful response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My memory of that night is quite vivid; I could never forget the sound of her screaming, and the looks of shock in their eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I got out of the car to use the bathroom behind the car, when I saw &#34;Car lights&#34; shining on me,and then I thought a car &#34;couldn&#39;t&#34; be coming up from behind because it was only woods behind me, as I turned around I saw it. I can&#39;t possibly explain the feeling I had when I looked up, theres really no way to describe it, above the trees behind me (in the air) was this huge thing, I can only describe it as being shaped like a boomerang, except the middle part wasn&#39;t empty like on a boomerang, and it was covered all the way around the edges with differant colored lights, it seemed like it was a hundered miles away, but at the same time it was like I could almost reach out and touch it. The really strange thing was it made absolutely no sound at all, and it seemed to barely be moving, well of course I finaly came to my senses enough to tell the two with me, to hurry and get out and look and see this, well they did, we all just stood in awe, then decided to jump back in the car, and take off, when we pulled onto the road we stopped and looked again, but it was gone. There are alot of sightings around Perry county, but with the town of Richton being so small, alot of people are scared to talk about it, not me !! I believe (my theory) is there is so many sightings because of Richton sitting on such a huge salt dome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My sighting was of an unexplainable, nighttime aerial phenomenon that took place in 1987, San Juan Capistrano, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived in a large house at the time, not far from the ocean, and while sitting in the living room facing a very large picture window that faced a sparsely lit, dark expanse of hills and custom homes, a streak of yellow light shot from somewhere overhead and angled downward, across the frame of view afforded by the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The “beam” of light was essentially a brilliant ribbon of considerable size, flat rather than vertical, utterly silent, that shot across the sky and ended with a sudden, but not particularly bright flash. Rather than the shower of sparks and arcing trails of debris that one would have expected from such a display, the event was more notable for its lack of detail or fancy after-effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The explosive spikes of light that radiated from the center of the explosion, if it was indeed an explosion at all, showed no signs of gravitational arcs, as if residual remnants were falling to earth. After viewing many modern videos of meteors, bolides, and returning space junk, the light event I witnessed bore no resemblance whatsoever to any of the aforementioned displays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an amateur astronomer, and a consummate skeptic, I have always believed the phenomenon I witnessed to be some type of high-altitude bolide, a midair, exploding meteor with its own unique characteristics separate from more typical meteors and meteorite strikes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I further supposed that no two bolides should be identical in how they might appear to different observers, thus the lack on my part of any immediate need to report anything. Over the years, however, and especially recently, it has grown apparent that such a sighting as I experienced, should be recorded regardless of how unimportant I may believe it to be, or not to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One last description of the seeming physicality of this “object” as it streaked across a very dark sky, is the peculiar fact that, as said before, it possessed no detail. I mean this quite literally. The ribbon, as I call it, was entirely uniform in structure, in color, brightness and shape, with no irregularities as would be expected by a completely natural event. It was as if a stripe of solid yellow, similar to a painted highway lane marker, zoomed across my field of view, then came to an abrupt stop as it “popped” and faded into the darkness. It all happened very fast. The stripe also bore its own perspective, meaning I could tell that it was nearest when directly overhead, and that as it trailed off, grew narrow, like train tracks leading off into the distance. Thus the object traveled some distance further before terminating or destructing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the strangest thing I have ever seen, and has never been repeated. For what it’s worth, please add this odd little anecdotal tale to the pile, where it can find some meaning, perhaps, for those who truly care about such things.<n>

There I had a very exceptional situation.  Actually with something who is known under the grey aliens in cases in literature. Before this specially night I did not knewn anything about this theme!   The experience have been at July, 14 th at 1:30 a.m. in my guestroom.  Short time after I went to bed the situation has happend. I wasn´t sleep for sure, the lamp in the room was switched off and it felt a little bit moonlight into the room.  The situation continued between 30 to 60 seconds I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I laid on my back, was wake, my eyes were closed and I thought about the time I had been in CA. Suddenly, in that moment I noticed something is wrong in this room.  I had a feeling somebody or more than one person came into the room, but I locked the door before I went to bed.  So I tried opening my eyes and in that moment I heard a very quiet sound like from an engine or something like that. Exacty in that moment I noticed I was unable opening my eyes or moving my body arbitrarily.  So that unknown person or what ever have been now in my guestroom, was able to have an effect on my neural functions, I will say specially on the motor activities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still tried opening my eyes with all power I got, and however then I was able to open them. I saw somebody standing next to my bed was looking on the middle of my body. Maybe the heigh of that what I saw was about 150 to 170 cm. The figure was analogical like human being. I will say it wasn´t looking usually human being like me and you, it was really very different. It was standing on two legs upright like a human. The head was a great one and I couldn´t see any hairs. I saw into a face resembling a human, but also very different from all what we know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn´t a usual human, but for simpleness I will call it human from now on. So the human had two eyes, but much more greater than our eyes are being and they glow yellow. Where we have got a nose there I saw a longish elevation, who was located from brow area to chin. Downwards it became bigger. On it I saw horizontal subdevisions. The whole face was so much strangeness I only able explaining what I mean exactly in my paintings, specially the new one. The &#34;nose&#34; strictly was not a breathing mask or something like that. The head and the face seemed white-blue. I saw the body and head was encased by a transparently blue-white aura or something like that. I only can suppose what this human weared on body. It seemed like a metallic suit like an one-piece. I am not sure if I saw ears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this human looked at my body with head down. I don´t know exactly how many seconds passed by, but I appreciate between 10 or 20. After that time I wasn´t able opening my eyes continuing although I wanted to and I was weak. So they closed and I was thinking to the housekeeper and also nurse (for the grandmother living next to my door). The housekeeper, Cora, laid in the hall on the floor on a mattress, directly before my guestroom-door. Actually the grandmother was ill and needed Coras´ help again and again in that night, so Cora decided sleeping in hall, because her own room had been on the contrary end of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to cry, but I could not use my voice. So I hoped maybe Cora will remark something, but she did not... In this moment I thought how strange this situation is and I felt so much terrified I can not explain. I really needed all my power to go through this situation at all. Otherwise I noticed the human wasn´t doing anything bad to me, &#34;only&#34; was looking on my body and I was still alive. I know this human was still in my guestroom and also I heard the quiet noise. So I tried opening my eyes again and I was able to do it again. In that moment I saw this human changed position about 90 degrees and was not looking anymore to my body, rather was looking to the guestroom-door. It seemed that he had knewn what I was thinking, in particular I thought to Cora, laid exactly before this door. After some seconds I had no power anymore for opening my eyes and had to close them again. After that suddenly I didn´t hear the noise anymore and also I was able to move myself and open my ! eyes again like nothing have been happend before. So as soon as possible I switched on the lamp, wrote on a paper what has been going on and opend the door. I waked up Cora for asking her if she noticed anything, but she did not she said. My condition was the same like before and I was still ok.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I stood up and went into the garden before the house for looking if there is anything. But I can´t see anything strange, went back in the house fast. I coudn´t sleep in that night anymore. At 3 o´clock a.m. my stepbrother Lucho came home from work and I told him what happened. He was listening to me and told me an experience about something he saw two years ago. Actually Lucho was standing before the house, was looking into the sky and saw an UFO. He went into the house to his mother and told that to her. So the both went out again for looking and there was no more to see. So the mother told him he should stopp telling things like that. This he told me in that night. Then we thought about the way this human was coming into the guestroom, but we/I still don´t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will repeat: before this night I never have knewn about greys or bedroom visitors or something like that.

Walked all the way to the road which took about 20 minutes, and turned around to walk back to camp. About halfway back I feel like something was watching me, I scanned the field then the sky and there it was. It looked just like the older ufo footage of the saucer type ones, it was silver in color but the bottom was dark. It was to the south of us and a guess would be 1,500-3,000 feet, object was at least 20-40 feet round in diameter.  It was a perfect still day with no clouds, all blue. It had a mirage effect to it, like when your on a road when its steaming hot out and you get that wavey heat effect when you look in the distance, I could sense a type of energy coming from it.  From the time we first saw it until the time we walked back to camp, it did not move or make a sound. Bear in mind this is a very wooded area but about 5 minutes into the walk the woods clear and there is nothing but sky and fields forever. The ufo was not in the sky when we were walking toward the road, so I know it was moving and stopped sometime after we turned around to walk back.  We walked and then ran back to camp after we had observed it for about 20 minutes, this was a mistake. We got back and told a counselor and we ran with him to the clearing and it was gone, and I knew it would be, one of us should have stayed with it until we got another person to see it, or at least one of us would have seen it move, who believes two teenagers. This is the only time I have seen a ufo in person and I regret not waiting it out. I was 15 then 33 now and I will always remember this because I know it was real, I have a camcorder on hand at all times now since the mid-90s and have never seen one again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/10/87 22:05|Rockford|IL|Triangle|40 seconds|It about five after ten on a clear wind calm night. A friend and I were in a natural area on the property of a local hospital listening|3/6/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16646.html|31|ndxe198707| It about five after ten on a clear wind calm night. A friend and I were in a natural area on the property of a local hospital listening for owls. Suddenly a craft flew almost straight over head going towards the hospital. Thirty seconds later an identical craft flew over in the same flight path. The only reason we saw them was because the hospital parking lot lights lit up the under side of the crafts. The parking lot was on the other side of a tree line. We were on the other side of the tree line in an open prairie. The crafts were triangular in shape and were wider than long. I`d estimate they were 15 feet wide by 10 feet long. They were a light grayish brown with a very dark strip that bordered close to the entire back end. They were traveling 10 mph and were around 80 feet off the ground. The crafts flew in a straght line and made no noise. They had no lights that we could see.<n>
7/7/87 23:30|Salina|KS|Sphere|3 minute's|Orb's flying threw the trailer house.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38198.html|32|ndxe198707| Orb&#39;s flying threw the trailer house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was sometime in the year of 1987 maybe? I was living in a trailer house in Salina, Ks in a small trailer court on the southeast cornner of the intersection of Cloud and Broadway street&#39;s. The trailer set lenght way&#39;s north and south on the lot, with the front or front room\kitchen to the north. The layout of the trailer was the front north the first room is the kitchen, then the living room, two small bedroom&#39;s the bathroom then the master bedroom on the south end. There was a hallway that ran from the living room down the east side of the trailer to the master bedroom. With two outside doorway&#39;s, one from the livingroom to the front porch just off the kichen and the second back door down the hall across from the bathroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probley around 11 or 11:30 at night and I had just gone to the back bedroom to to to sleep. I hadent been in bed for very long when I heard a very loud bang or exsplosion (ever put a cherrybomb in a metal trash can?) right out the south bedroom window not but a few feet from my head. I was just starting to setup in bed to go out to see who was messing around. And right when I got ready to swing my feet from the bed to get up I noticed something on the east wall of the hall some four feet down from the back door. There was a spot on the wall glowing kind of orange in color and as I sat frozen in bed watching this spot it slowly grew bigger around and came outward from the wall in a glowing dome of light on the dark brown wood paneling of the wall, and ever so slowly it grew bigger and then a more solid core of this thing started to come threw until it emerged completly into a glowing orb of redish\orange light. And as it was floating across the hall some two feet above the floor then started to go threw the wall between the hall and bedroom I saw another spot start to form on the outside hall wall this time a greenish\yellow in color and it slowly grew in size and came into the house into the hallway and as it was coming into the hall the first redish one was slowly going threw the other wall into the second bedroom. Then the greenish one moved across the hall to go into the wall and into the bedroom after the first one. The doorway of the bedroom was open and as I lay there half out of bed frozen in wonder at what I was seeing and watch one then the other of these ball&#39;s of light come into the house and float aross the hall and go threw the wall into the bedroom I could see the light grow brighter and bigger as they came threw the wall from outside and the full brightness and size of them while they where in direct veiw in the hallway and as they kind of dimmed down as they moved threw the bedroom wall and as the first one was going threw the bedroom wall a notice as the full brightness of it th! at was in the hallway dimmed down and as part of it&#39;s light no longer came from the hall but slowly started coming out of the open doorway of the bedroom until the light from the first one came more and more from the doorway and less from the hall and all the while the first one&#39;s light changed from the hall to coming out of the doorway the second one was coming threw the outside wall into the hall until by the time the light from the first was coming from just the door way and now the second one was now fully in the hall in all of it&#39;s brightness and size and then it too slowly went across the hall to start to go threw the bedroom wall into the second bedroom fallowing the path of the first and it&#39;s light slowly changed from just coming from the hall to slowly starting to come out of the doorway until it too was  in the bedroom with the first one and I could no longer see eaither one of them but only there light coming out of the doorway and I could see the angle of the light change as they move across the bedroom until the redish\orange light of the first one slowly started to dimm and then the light of it went out completly and then the second greenish\yellow one slowly dimmed down to go out after the first one. I set there as I had the entire time half setting up in bed  in the darkness now that the light from the orb&#39;s had gone. Then I got out of bed and pulled on my jean&#39;s and went out the back doorway and around the south end of the trailer to the west yard to try to see where the ball&#39;s of light had gone to but I could see no sign of  them, there was another trailer that set to the west of mine and I looked at the window&#39;s  to see if I could see the light of the orb&#39;s coming from them thinking that maybe they had gone into it as they had mine but I could see no sign of them.  After looking around and up into the night sky for a few minute&#39;s I gave up and went back in and went back to bed and fell quickly asleep as if nothing much had happened at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lenght of time of this sighting is about 2 to 3 minute&#39;s? The orb&#39;s\ball&#39;s of light about two to three feet in diameter of the outer corona of light coming out from the more solid inter core of the center wich was about a foot across. I had seen ball&#39;s of light or orb&#39;s like this before in a bigger group flying across some feild&#39;s and wich I have also made a report on. And to the best I am able to tell they are of the same type of craft\probe or whatever they are. And they had a feeling about them that they where somehow alive or at least controled by some intelegant being? And one thing that has alway&#39;s puzzeled me is how while it was all going on how in wonder and amazement I felt and then how after it was over I could just forget about it all and go to sleep as if nothing had happened at all. It was only year&#39;s latter when I thought about it any at all that I wished that I would of thought to get out of bed and touched one of them to see what would happen and to know for shure that they where real by touching them, but then maybe that would&#39;nt have been such a smart thing to do? And after thinking about this sighting and other one&#39;s I have had I have only question&#39;s with no answer&#39;s and many question&#39;s to ask with knowone to ask them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I saw a large light coming from the horizon on my right.   The light was moving so fast the blinks were elongated.  This blinking occurred about 5-6 times between one horizon to the next in about 8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this now because I have never heard any report of elongated blinks.  When I look at a plane at night it seems to be small and move much slower as it blinks.  This was like a much larger version of this moving so fast the &#34;blinks&#34; would stretch and then shrink.  It even went over a low thin cloud mass and I saw the blinking right through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if anyone else had &#34;seen that&#34; and one of the ladies said &#34;I did&#34;.  She nodded her head when I explained what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later found out that many UFO sightings were being seen during that time of the year at that location.<n>
7/4/87 22:00|Frankford|MO|Light|1 hour|An acrobatic light show in a star lite sky.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34465.html|36|ndxe198707| An acrobatic light show in a star lite sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First noticed by a younger companion during a camping trip.  The light moved in a tight, wobbling fasion then would straighten out its path for a distance and stop.  It would then fade from view.  The location of the object was straight up.  There was no moon to be seen.  After a few seconds, the light would gradually re-appear in a different location then where it had disappeared and move across the sky in it&#39;s illregular fasion.  Occasionally it would do perfect 90 degree turns without stopping.  The lights of an aircraft flying at commercial jet height was spoted by us and at that time the light did another 90 degree turn and excellerated at an amazing rate and seemed to be intercepting the aircraft we spotted.  It stopped short of the aircraft and again faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching the actions of this object gave us all the impression it was coming into our atmosphere too hot and had to exit.  That might explain the difference in location of appearence when it would fade out.  No one on this camping trip really had an active interest in U.F.O.&#39;s or had seen anything they believed to be one.  During the event, one member became pretty disturbed as he didn&#39;t believe in such things before that night but the actions of this object seemed to defy common laws of flight so he couldn&#39;t explain it away.  I, personally, had never seen anything before or anything like that since.  It was really interesting and even now, I look when the thought hits me but... no repeat performances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/1/87 20:30|Niagara Falls (Canada)|ON|Other|2 evenings|The summer of 1987 was the time the stars themselves came out to dance!|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33210.html|38|ndxe198707| The summer of 1987 was the time the stars themselves came out to dance!<n> <n><n> <n><n> During what I recall as being a warm summer&#39;s night back in 1987, I chanced to gaze straight up into the clear (moonless?) sky as I sat chatting with my landlady on her back porch steps. Although there was a noteable diffusion of light across my field of vision due to nearby city streetlamps, the view of the night sky was such that countless stars could still be clearly identified. To my surprise, however, the field of motionless stars I expected to see was instead replaced by a field of &#39;moving&#39; stars, meandering slowly about in a fashion much like tadpoles in a small pond. These objects replaced the stars, they did not obscure them. That is to say, I could not observe anything at all in my field of vision of the sky except the objects. There must have been 30 or more in that particular area of the sky. They had the same shape, size, color and brightness as the stars I fully expected to see. They did not exhibit any visible trails or emit any audible sound. I pointed out the phenomenon to my landlady and she observed them as well as I. We had the luxery of being able to watch the event for as long as we pleased: the objects were still moving when we retired inside for the night which was about an hour later. The next evening was almost identical in terms of viewing conditions. As I sat next to my landlady in the same location as the night before and roughly about the same time, we both observed a repeat performance of the event. A short while later, two friends came by to visit and observed the phenomenon with us. It scared me very much and I can only imagine the reaction of the witnesses with me, although they did not appear to be outwardly that concerned. To this day I cannot explain the event to my satisfaction. For those were the nights the stars themselves came out to dance!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/87 20:00|Lost Park (near Jefferson)|CO|Sphere|dusk till dawn|Bright red spheres with slow random movements in  the same area of  the sky reoccurring numerous evenings.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05598.html|39|ndxe198707| Bright red spheres with slow random movements in  the same area of  the sky reoccurring numerous evenings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have posted two other reports that happened in the summers before  the experiences described here. These happened in the mid to late 1980’s in Lost Park near Jefferson Colorado. We camped in the area for quite a few years on a regular basis. We moved our campsite to the Lost Park area from the Tarryall reservoir area. Lost park is about 10 miles or so from the reservoir. We found a road that went up and around to the top of a small hill and were camping there for 5 or 6 weekends in a row. The first time we saw them a friend of mine was looking at what we thought was a campfire on a ridge about 1\2 of a mile away with my telescope. The telescope was a 900 power at maximum magnification. As soon as he got the scope focused in on the campfire he said the fire went out! Then about a minute later the sphere that we thought was the fire went up in the sky! As we watched it in awe it went up and joined two other lights. The next several weekends as soon as it got dark there were three UFO’S in the same general place in the sky. They would move slowly around in the same area sometimes close to each other sometimes further apart. At times one of them would be down low enough to be below us from our vantage point. Their behavior was always the same every time we saw them (i.e.: slow and deliberate and random). They were bright red spheres and always three of them. This occurred for 5 or 6 weekends both Friday and Saturday nights, enough that we got tired of watching them. They were about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away (approx). We were crossing a forest service sign to go up to the hilltop. It was the kind they put right in the middle of the road and it was plastic so you could just drive over it and it would spring back up when it came out from under your vehicle. The last time we went there the forest service had put a permanent sign up that you couldn’t just drive over. So we moved our camp to where we thought we would be right under the objects but we never saw them again. I have camped in the area for years and never seen the three UFO’S again. These trips were usually at least 4 people sometimes more. Depending on who went as we went in a group of close friends. These reports are all old because we didn’t know who to report them to and we didn’t think the police or forest service would do anything about it or even believe us. Thank you.<n>

This object passed directly overhead, diagonally, back to front, horizon to horizon.  It was at low altitude, maybe 3,000 feet.  It was cylindrical, traveling horizontally.  It was absolutely silent, looking as if suspended from above.  The sides were covered uniformly with pipes, conduits and other mechanical devices, similar to the spaceships in Star Wars.  The ends however, were flat, circular, and appeared polished.  The whole thing was some type of dark metal. The object was narrower in the center and wider at the ends, like an hourglass, but less so.  The sun was low in the sky, to the left of the object, so the direction of travel would have been northwest. There were two small airplanes of the civil aviation type in the sky at the time. These were not fat away, maybe a mile or two directly in front of us.  I could hear the sound of their engines clearly.  The object passed between us and the airplanes, diagonally. That made it easier to estimate the size, altitude, etc. and to be certain it was silent, or very quiet.  The size was similar to a large airliner.  People in the airplanes would certainly have seen it. I doubt I was misidentifying some conventional object.  I have no seen anything like it, before or sense.

Coming home from my job at Pizza H** in Monroe, I was approching Marshville city limits when I saw an object over the trees. People I am almost 35 years old and of sound mind! This object was moving at about a 1/2 mile per hour. I was wandering why the whole town was not at a stand-still. If anyone else noticed it, they sure didnt show interest. I was compelled to check this thing out. I didnt know all of the road names, but I knew how to get around town, so I moved closer, took a right and there it was coming over the trees to my left, directly above at (11:00 sight). Maybe 4 stories above the ground, no sound. O.K. this thing was an egg shape on its side, covered in various colored lights. The lights were like the jumbo christmas lights not the small ones. I found myself 3 streets down the road, about a 1/4 mile out of the town light, still in my car. I looked out my window to find the object and it was high above me to the left and shot out faster than anything my mind could comprehend. Now for the strange part... I put my car in drive(it was still running)recognized the street I was on and made my way home, thinking less and less of what happened. Everyone in my home was asleep so I did not wake them, so I went to bed. Woke up a little while later sitting up turned around with my face looking down at my pillow-blood pouring and I mean pouring out of my nose. My mother came in to help me and I mentioned none of this to her, Fear that she would think I was using drugs, at that time in my life I did smoke mary jane. Now the more time went on the less I would think about this, until about 5 years later when I would connect the dots. I hate Alien abduction stories, people that are made pregnant by Aliens or what have you, but this was real! I live a somewhat normal life, but I know What happened in Marshville N.C. that night, I am a firm believer in the fact that something happened to me, and my memory was tampered with.  Thank you for letting me get this off my chest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/87 00:30|Thomaston|GA|Circle|30 minutes|MUFON/GEORGIA FOLLOW-UP REPORT:  Low hovering 'ovoid' circle of lights|4/26/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12677.html|43|ndxe198707| Low hovering &#39;ovoid&#39; circle of lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> This investigation was a joint MUFON of Georgia and ISUR (International Society for UFO Research) project.  The investigation and interview was conducted on 17May97 by this writer, Tom Sheets, then Chief MUFON Field Investigator for Georgia and ISUR FI. A supplementary visit to the witness and area was made on 7July97. The witness was found to be a professional educator, female, 56 YOA, residing in Upson County Georgia.  Witness holds a degree in Education from Emory University in Atlanta, with various other educational certifications and advanced qualifications for teaching science subjects.  Witness was found to be highly intelligent, observant and seemed to react to stressful situations in a calm objective manner. Her home appeared to be well managed and immaculately decorated. Witness indicated her personal interests ran to historical reading and various sewing projects.  Evidence in the home indicated same. The witness stated that she observed the below described event during the summer of 1987, but had not discussed it outside of the family.  Her elderly mother, now deceased, was also a witness to this event. The witness stated that on an unknown night during the summer of 1987 she went out to look around the neighborhood for her cat which had not returned home as it usually did. About 12:30AM, she drove back into her driveway and parked at the end, adjacent to her house.  As she walked toward the rear of her vehicle, she noticed an ovoid circle of lights hovering over a utility/security light/transformer pole which is 75 feet SE of her driveway, in the side yard. The pole is 29 feet high.  She added that the ovoid circle had about 50-100 or possibly more orangish-red lights around the edge. Witness estimated that the size was about that of a child&#39;s portable wading pool, about 6+ or so feet in diameter.  She stood at the rear of her vehicle watching and noticed no sound and no other discernable effects.  Within a few minutes, the circle rose up a little higher and slowly moved a few yards away, over and then down behind some adjacent trees.  She could still see it thru the trees. Within a short time, the circle returned to it&#39;s position over the pole for about 20 minutes.  She stated that she had the impression that the lights surrounded some solid structure that she was unable to see.  Finally the circle of lights rose up into the sky quickly and flew off to the east at what the witness said was an incredibly fast burst of speed, vanishing in the distance.  When asked, the witness indicated that if she had blinked her eyes while it flew off, she may have missed the departure, it was traveling that fast. She further described the lights on the circle as appearing to be about the size of a quarter, and with a continuous glow.  No EM effects were noticed in the house or with the security light. At one point during this event, the witness ran inside the house briefly to alert her mother who became frightened and began locking windows and doors.  Her mother strongly protested when the witness went back outside. Local authorities could provide no information concerning similar cases from that time period.  The witness also polled her neighbors the next day, finding no other witnesses.  She added that the weather was clear and warm on that particular night, with no appreciable wind that she recalled. This writer found the terrain in the community to be mostly flat and rural, with Georgia pines predominating. An examination of the woods adjacent the utility pole on 7July97 during a follow-up visit found the normally expected number of stumps and dead pines in the same vicinity with healthy trees. The witness related that within a few years of this event she developed serious cancer, with major surgeries allowing her to survive. Her eyes also became weaker, and she was fitted with reading glasses.  She did not attribute any of that to the event described. During the whole of this investigation, the witness seemed completely truthful and forthright, and it was obvious that she was relating the truth.  In fact she was one of the most credible witnesses this FI has encountered.  All indications pointed to her being a highly respected and productive member of the Upson County community. Complete copies of this investigation were filed with MUFON HQ and ISUR. Tom Sheets, FSA Scot, State Director MUFONGA-ISUR Board<n>
