We were traveling on 95 south to las vegas nv from Tonopah nv.  It kept following us going south. Then it split into three crafts, and then the lights went off.  Then it kept following us as just one, and would sometimes light up.  Then it split into 4 crafts, and lights up, and then back to one.  Then one last time into five crafts and back to one.  It easily followed us up till we were at Beautty, NV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I flashed my lights at it in a 3,4,5 method.  The one craft lit up.  We then seen it move over us.  Just when we were about to enter Beautty, NV, the truck became lit up by a yellow neon dim light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can assure you I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I am not saying it is alien, but I am not able to indentify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself I am a real estate investor and business owner.  My 95 year old military AF veteran father was in the car and seen it, along with my son at 25 who works on our family business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling in a F 350 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not drink, do drugs, or take medicine of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can assure you I am not trying to waste your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening upon arriving at my home in Las Vegas, I told my business partner and friend, a military veteran of 20 years by the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of my family heard like a loud whisper that night. I did not sleep very well at all as I kept watch over everyone.<n>

They were not blinking but they had movement, like changing colors from red to orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a plane in the distance which flew over the triangle.   Once the plane came alined with the ufos it disappears within the triangle, then reappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the triangle moved towards the clouds more lights from the east started to move towards the path of the tiangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for about 5 minutes watching them move in formation towards the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total their was at least ten lights I saw in the sky.<n>

Lights appeared close to my location in downtown Anchorage.  They rose straight up, moved in a northerly direction, circled, turned and moved southwest.  The light only appeared to be on the forward side for as they turned the light faded and a dim cylinder shape could be seen probably due to the reflection of city lights suggesting that they were not very high.  They showed no navigation lights common on airplanes or helicopters.  There was too much city noise to hear if the objects made any noise themselves.  One object moved off to the east.  The event lasted about 10 minutes.<n>
1/31/14 22:00|Conestoga|PA|Formation|4 minutes|Orange lights moving slowly across the sky in formation|2/7/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106835.html|6|ndxe201401| Orange lights moving slowly across the sky in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> Number of objects and time are approximate.  My 14 year old son crashed through the front door after coming from a neighbor&#39;s house, yelling &#34;Mom, come quick, you have to see this!&#34;  I went outside with him and saw around seven orange lights in a straight line slowly moving across the sky.  More of them appeared from the western horizon.  They seemed to be in groups.  The first set was in a straight line.  The second set was formed more like a triangle.  The next set was another straight line.  The last one to rise was actually red, not orange.  One of them completely disappeared (from the triangle formation), which made me think they could have been some sort of fireballs; however, they moved very slowly and did not have fireball tails.  It was too late to have neighbors come out but we got my 13 year old son to come out and see them as well.  The phones on our cameras couldn&#39;t capture them and we had no charged cameras or camcorders available.  I kept searching (am still searching) the local news but have not seen any reports on this.<n>

After about 30 second of viewing it, it was almost overhead.  Then some parts broke away and burned out.  The orange fire looking piece continued moving from north toward the south about the speed of a small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued to move along it started to dim.  It seemed to start to dim so much that it was ending its light.  But, we got into our car and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw this as we were coming out of a restaurant in State College, PA, and going to our car in the parking lot.  Thought it was a kind of flare, but it appeared to be very high and was moving at a slow speed across the sky.  Speed of a small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers are: Psychologist in full time practice, and Urban Planner Real Estate Broker, Expert Witness for Real Estate Issues.  Engineer.<n>

I looked out and saw them too, so we went to the back door to get a better look.  We opened the door and listened to see if they made sound, which they didn&#39;t.  They were in the sky to the north of us moving east.  We ran out front to try and get a better look.  When we got to the front there was only one brighter light.  The neighbour was outside walking his dog so we asked if he saw it too.  He didn&#39;t see the 3 lights but he did see the one brighter light.  My father and I ran to the end of the street where there was a park and no houses to block our view.  The light seemed to fade in and out until it faded out and didn&#39;t come back on.  We went home and my mother, who was taking a bath at the time of the sighting, told us she saw the whole thing from the bathroom window.  She said the triangle of 3 lights flew away and then a larger brighter light followed them.  She said the l! arger light vibrated up and down, stopped moving, and kept flying in mid air.<n>

From the corner of my eye, I saw what looked like multiple airplanes in the sky.  I then looked towards them and saw three lights in the shape of a triangle, spinning counterclockwise. I took out my headphones expecting to hear a noise like airplanes or something but heard nothing.  I couldn&#39;t make out whether or not it was one object or three separate objects but, they were all in sync, hovering.  There were no cars on the road.  I was the only person in sight. So, instinctively, I ran back home as fast as I possibly could.  I looked back a second time before i made it down the stairs to my complex to see if i was really seeing this and I saw the middle of the object start to light up as if it were getting ready to move.  It looked like something in a movie.  I told my mom what i had saw and she told me to stay inside.  I wanted to go back outside to see if it was still there but, she said not to.<n>

I take my right turn and grab my phone while keeping an eye on what these objects could be.  Front St runs parallel with the Willamette river and along waterfront Park and Marion Street bridge spanning across the river to West Salem.  I started up my video recorder on my phone and was approaching the overhang of the bridge so I discounted the idea that these objects weren&#39;t attached to the bridge.  After coming from under the bridge that was when I was able to get a clear and unobstructed view.  These objects were solid red in color and never changed to any other color, just a constant red, I counted at least 10 of these objects all within a loose cluster, they weren&#39;t too far from one another and they appeared to be in what I can remember was a zig zag formation, like the letter &#34;Z&#34;.  At that time I ! was approaching a stop light and was basically right under the formation of these objects.  I was stopped in my vehicle and studying these objects and as I was looking directly at them the upper part of these objects broke formation and slowly started towards the south with the bottom half heading in all different directions, so five broke south and the other five went in random directions.  What shocked me the most was when I witnessed these things break formation none of them made any sounds whatsoever.  I went back to the video I had recorded after I got back to my place of employment and watched it frame by frame and  was able to capture a few screenshots of my siting.<n>

First one appeared to be a hang-glider, but too high never descended.  A silver-gray Stealth fighter jet shape, but fluid.  One &#34;cloud&#34; looked like a huge flock of birds, a spotty &#34;wall&#34;.  It slightly brightened a large area of cloud before going out of sight behind the clouds.  Then something circular and black, but cloudy, then streamed away rapidly, leaving a black &#34;jet&#34; stream, not linear.  Two, small, black smoke-like &#34;clouds&#34; streamed down, then ascended back into the clouds.  All of this was difficult to visualize with the heavy clouds.  I have NEVER witnessed anything like this and I grew up in the midwest.<n>

To give you an idea of how loud it was, I have a service connected disability from the Marine Corps which is &#34;hearing loss&#34; and I did not have my hearing aids in my ears during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stepped outside I noticed that it was directly over my head!  However, it was very cloudy and whatever it was, was just above the low cloud cover.  I hurried inside to get my camera expecting it to appear under the clouds at any moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for another 4 or 5 minutes listening to it and trying to decide whether or not to call the Sheriff&#39;s Department since they took my summer sighting so lightly.  I decided to wake my wife and as I was walking toward the door I noticed it getting quieter so I stopped and listened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly got quieter and quieter until it was gone. I suppose whatever it was ascended straight up because the sound stayed directly over my head...  I also noticed my two Labrador dogs and my cats were alert and observing the sound also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the morning around 7-8am three U.S. Blackhawk helecopters flew over.  I wouldn&#39;t think that to be strange if we ever see military helecopters around here, but we don&#39;t...  We are over a hundred miles from any military base and never see any military aircraft in this area.  I am in the country and surrounded only by farm crops and Old Order Amish folks. There is nothing out here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this was, but something with a very low and very loud hum hovered over my property for about 7 or 9 minutes on Friday morning at approximately 3:45 AM.<n>

I couldn&#39;t get a good sighting of it with my Nikon DSLR 200mm lens.  I used binoculars and barely make it out.  However it seemed to have some sort of &#39;retractable&#39; end that can only be described to be similar to a tail.  It would move this &#39;tail&#39; one way and go in that direction while other times go in the other direction, so the propulsion is unknown.  The &#39;tail&#39; had several flashing red lights, the other end was somewhat triangular shaped with many flashing lights.  Lights ranged form flashing clear bright white to a slight tint of green and also red.  The lights were soo bright (even being so far away) that while looking inside my binoculars the flashes would be very distinctive in my lenses.<n>

The closer we got to the lights we began to realize that the lights were rowed and stationary in the sky, not moving at all.  There was no sound.  We seen this in an area with no light towers.  The object appeared to be larger than a football feild in length and width.  After a few seconds of looking at it, the lights seemed to seperate in a way.  They became still again, almost as if moving into another formation entirely.  After a few more seconds they began moving and what seemed to be disappearing into the sky until there was a single light left and then that light was gone as well.  The object seemed massive and had no sound to it at all.  It was confusing when the lights separated because they seemed to be in perfect lines when we first seen it in the sky.<n>

Sometimes quick zags and bolts across to the other side of their area of flight.  Sometimes it looked like they would collide, but didn&#39;t.  It reminded me of the way orientals fly those kites on the short strings where they look like they are dancing.  Anyway, they continued to do this in the sky for about 25 minutes.  I actually had to follow it down the driveway a bit to keep them in range.  (We live on a farm on a long driveway)  There was no noise, and it was actually quite beautiful.  Then one just went POOF and disappeared.  The other continued to fly for a minute and then POOF!  That one disappeared too.  I AM NOW A BELIEVER!!!!  I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES!!!!!  And... a car driving down the road also saw them.  They stopped in the road, and put their flashers on, and watched for! a while.  I wish I had my camera on me at the time!<n>

The smaller lights disappeared and then the larger lights began to fade in and out until they were realigned as a straight line (SW - NE) with the second ball a bit lower than the rest but still evenly positioned from first and third ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the fourth ball began get really bright (looked momentarily like a fire ball igniting) and then changed to a blue color.

1/30/14 20:30|Maryville|TN|Chevron|5 minutes|Two bright red lights appeared from the west on a clear cold Thursday night just a couple of miles from my home.|2/7/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106801.html|34|ndxe201401| Two bright red lights appeared from the west on a clear cold Thursday night just a couple of miles from my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south on US Hwy 411 about 8 miles north of the town of Maryville at about 8:30 pm when something caught my eye in the sky.  Two bright red lights were just above the tree tops ahead and a little to the west of me.  As I watched, they moved slowly from west to east pretty much maintaining level.  I was traveling at about 40 mph and the road makes a slow arc to the east there and then a quick reverse S west and back due south.  This put me almost directly behind the lights overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights had disappeared behind the trees for a couple of seconds as I negotiated the curves going over a rise and into a dip before the road leveled out still heading south.  The lights were moving south, too, but faster than I was moving.  The sky was very dark, but I could just make out what appeared to be a dark boomerang shape with large red lights on each end.  The shadowy shape was much thicker in the middle, where the sweep back of the shape originated, and tapered as it got to the ends.  The lights were large, round, and intensely bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closer they got the brighter they appeared.  At the closest point to me, I would estimate the craft was about 100-120 yards long.  If it was that long, it would be 30-50 ft thick at the center.  As it continued south, I would estimate it to be couple of hundred feet off the ground as tree tops would obscure it as I would go into dips in the 2 lane highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of it when I made a right turn and dropped into a dip.  When I came out of the dip, I was able to catch sight of it only for a couple more seconds.  As close as the lights were together then, I would guess it to be about three miles away and still just a few hundred feet off the ground.  Another dip and I didn’t see it again.<n>

Incredibly, I thought to grab my phone and take photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I realized it wasn’t making any noise (I witnessed one about 16 years ago in Kingston, NH, and that made no noise either – never reported that)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got 3 photos I had to move because cars were coming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was home about a minute later and ran in to tell my husband and we ran outside and he only got to witness the object/lights moving through the trees behind our house – but again no lights flashing a! nd no sound, moving slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will email photo.<n>

Normally I see various green bushes in the field, however this time one in particular caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stopped to look directly at it it looked as if it was a normal bush.  However when I caught the correct angle it started to shine a brighter green and took a disk shape.  After looking at it quite sometime, I went to go invenstigate.  The moment I opened my door I heard a sound like that of clinking chains,followed by that of a wind-up eletrical whirring.  The bush disappeared, a saucer took shape and as I stared at it there was a brilliant green flash that blinded me for about 5 mins afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I regained my vision the bush was gone, leaving no trace of having ever been there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no way of knowing whether this is a serious report.

We took the next exit and headed towards where we saw them,  Over the West Greenwich Dunes.  We had lost them in the trees after taking the exit and by the time we reached the area they were previously above, they were gone.

It was stationary &amp; at least the size of a Benadryl antihistamine tablet.  Crooked like it was hovering above the Mid Cape Highway/Route 6, westbound.  I know this wasn&#39;t the planet that is big &amp; visible because that was to my left and bright white.  This thing was flashing &amp; Amber colored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know others saw it because people were putting their break lights on.  This was not a plane because it stayed stationary.  Because of the snowstorm yesterday, there was no area on the side of the road to pull over for photos, and I also couldn&#39;t be late to watch grandchildren.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was viewable to me for 10 of the 15 minutes my drive took.

As I am driving I call my fiancé to tell her I am off of work and I am heading home.  Well when the phone started to ring I was just starring into the sky up to the left out of my windshield.  Then as soon as she said hello this bright light zoomed down and made the sky bright and it seemed like lighting hit the ground but it was white then purple then bluish.  After that I just figured it was a shooting star or comet.  Though I have seen many of those this looked nothing like that.  We&#39;ll on down the road I started seening this light thinking it was a star I looked closely at it and realized it was changing colors.  So I watched it till I got home.  Then I sat in my truck and parked it in my driveway where I could still see the light.  As I sat and watched it it didn&#39;t move and yet it grew larger and then shrunk while becoming larger it changed colors from white to blue to purple and orange.  So I have no idea what I saw.  I just wanted to know if anyone else saw what I saw that night.<n>

As I watched I saw what looked like a firetruck or ambulance drive straight past my window at a very fast speed.  The only problem is that there is no road that goes past my apartment.  I glanced out and saw multiple red lights over the hill.  They switched direction then went back up the hill only to disappear.  Then the sound was gone<n>

I walked out into my back yard around 11pm to get some firewood for the overnight, and saw a low flying craft coming from the South, just a few hundred yards away right above the treetops.  It caught my attention because it was so low and had far too many lights for an airplane, as I could see around six or so bright white lights across the leading edge.  I soon noticed it had “points” of light coming out the bottom, so I put a hand over one eye to check that it wasn’t just blurred vision from the cold night air as it came into full view, unobstructed by the trees, and it was not blurred vision –I checked both eyes as it slowly approached.  As it drew nearer, passing due North, East of my position, the bright lights were also visible down the side of the craft, just as they had been from my view of the leading edge, and the “points of light” appeared to be multi-colored cones of light, three or four of them, coming from the bottom of the craft like a cone, with the point downward.  I continued to watch it pass at a few hundred yards away in the pitch black sky, and believe it was a saucer shape with large bright white lights surrounding the outer edge, the “points of light” pointing from the flat bottom center of the craft at a length of ten or twelve feet toward the ground.  From the rear of the craft I could see flashing lights in various places on the craft –none of which behaved like airplane lights, nor were they properly colored –just white lights. I believe it to have been a typical “flying saucer shape” like two tea cup saucers stacked together, possibly with a spacer in between, where the large bright white lights would have been.  I would estimate it to have been about thirty feet across. It flew absolutely silently.  Moved much too fast to be a blimp, but seemed to merely float in the sky, silently, slower than an airplane, but crossed my field of vision inside of thirty seconds, covering probably a mile or so before my view became obscured by buildings and trees in my  own yard.  This thing was close by, and not the first unusual craft I have seen appear to come from these woods over the many years of living here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDA FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.

In the second photo (taken 12 seconds later) they’re gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo, and we are unable to identify the objects.  They do not look to us to be discs, and they don&#39;t appear to have the precise nature one would expect if the objects were alien craft.  However, they do not look to us to be consistent with birds in flight, either.  PD))<n>

One of the orbs traveled towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving near my home with my small children at 5:45pm.  A dark winter night, but the sky was clear.  Two small yellowish-red balls in the sky.  I was facing east.  I could see two airplanes in the sky at the same time.  Both the planes and the reddish balls seemed far away but the planes were higher and further away than the balls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know what they were,  but the color was unusual so I stopped my car.  They were not travelling in straight lines...but not really zig-zagging either.  One of the balls stayed far away from me.  It traveled from left to right right in front of me and appeared to travel several miles in just a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the reddish balls came straight toward me.  It took me about 30 seconds to realize that it was actually traveling towards me.  I was shocked to realize how close it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped about 2 houses away from me and went behind a tall pine tree.  I could see it through the branches.  It was small, but certainly visible enough to get my attention.  It wasn&#39;t losing altitude.  It was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my car around and got out of there.<n>

It was bright orange/yellow admits a greyish sky.  The sun was setting and it matched the same colours, but this object was much higher then the sun set.  I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it.  As I got closer it look almost like a rocket ship going straight up with a huge smoke trail behind it.  The top tip shined like a star once I was close.  The clouds eventually rolled over it and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. From far away I though it was maybe a con.  Trail from a plane but it was so short.  The object didn&#39;t move an inch.  It got larger as I approached it and looked more like a perfect triangle cloud with sun reflecting on it but the object was high in the atmosphere apart from grey clouds rolling in.  The sun reflected off of it as if the surface was relatively smooth.  Others must have seen this as it is a busy road and the object stuck out like a soar thumb.  Could not take my eyes off of it. It! was awe inspiring<n>

The white lights were bright and solid, the red ones flickered.  The aircraft didn&#39;t move fast, just slow and steady across the sky, appeared to come from over by 465 W and headed over the closed St. Francis Hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was no jet airplane or helicopter because it glowed.  It was flying at about the 2,000 foot level.  It was no meteorite because it was moving slow across the early morning sky.<n>

I am 59 years old, and a 36 year veteran Police officer in the Dallas TX. area.  In the Military in the 1970&#39;s I was in search radar, both air and surface, and am trained in aircraft recognition and performance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in the Dallas metro area, but live about 140 miles NE of Dallas near the small town of Omaha Tx.  My house is 8 miles from any town, and its very dark at night, the sky is alive with stars, and the Milky Way blazes across the sky at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the listed date and time, I walked out of my house to get something out of my car,  which was parked in front of my barn about 150 feet from my house.  As is my usual habit, I looked up at the sky.  As soon as I looked towards Polaris, I saw 3 lights traveling in a straight line formation, or follow the leader formation.  Since they were only lights, I could not tell the altitude.  From my perspective they were about half the size of a pencil eraser, and again from my perspective, they were approximately 1 foot apart from each other.  The lights were brighter than the stars and were brilliant white.  It is very quiet at my place , and I often hear airliners flying at 30+ thousand feet as they pass over my house as a low roar.  These lights produced no sound at all that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot estimate the speed at which the lights were traveling since I don&#39;t have an altitude to base it on.  However they traversed the sky from North to South till out of sight in about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe these were satellites.  I know what objects in orbit look like as they pass overhead.  These lights were traveling too fast. 3<n>

It caught my attention because it was much lower than all of the other stas and was also ALOT brighter.  It had kind of an orange glow to it.  It was pretty low right over the houses too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I noticed it this thing lit up BRIGHT.  It looked similar to when you see the fireworks on 4th of July when they set those one off that just make a huge flash followed by that really loud deep boom only there was no boom.  It just flashed big and bright then too off at warp speed.  It litteraly went up and to the South East direction and out of sight in less than a second.  It did leave a strange kind of trail when it left that left a streak across the sky that lasted a second or too but dissapeared quickly.  I noticed also that after the flash there was what looked almost like gold sparks falling from the spot the object left from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within minutes of the occurance several military type jets and a helicopter were circling the area where the object was.<n>

About an hour later, like I said, I followed my fiance outside to see 11 Bright beams of light coming up from the ground and straight up into the atmosphere.  One very strong large beam and ten smaller, then one separate large beam of light and smoky stuff about six yards in front of us forming and dissipating into the sky.  The others were seemingly very far away, but still very unusual, and had a definite hazy quality about the air that surrounded them.  They were very straight in nature, they were not conical.  Each end appeared the same width.  Though, as I said before, there was one larger, thicker, brighter, one.  I did consider that it could be weather-related.  I&#39;ve lived in three states where it snowed, and I have never seen anything like this.  There was snow on the ground, but nothing coming down at that time.  Seemed very &#34;rapture-like&#34; in nature.  Almost cliche.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They remained in the sky until we stopped checking on them or later, which was sometime around 3am.  So over 6.5 hrs...  Sadly we could not get a photograph, as the lighting and distance were not suitable.  The lights ran NW to NE.  One witness was NE of us, but closer to the lights in relation.  He reported seeing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional artist and if you would like a copy of the rendering, please email me at ((e-address deleted)).<n>

I at first said it must be a red light from the new cell tower or a small aircraft coming in to the tiny airport up the road approx. 6 miles.  I am a skeptic.  If I can&#39;t see, touch, taste, hear or smell it-I&#39;m not convinced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red ball that I began to observe behaved very smoothly, coming from the northeast directly towards our house, it did not move in a direct path though, it was as if it was hovering to the right, then the left.  I became convinced that this was something odd and unlike anything I had ever seen- pertaining to airplane lights, etc.  I ran downstairs to get my camera and night binoculars for my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached my last point of observation again from the upstairs deck, the red ball was now hovering over the southerly sky, heading slowly west- just above the tree line.  I did take some pictures and they are quite clear in depicting the very redness and roundness of this object.  I am an avid photographer- I know what man-made lights look like in a photo- they glare and have light or white centers, no matter the color of the light.  This was red through and through, it did not send rays of light out like a man made light does- this was like an orb and it did hum, while hovering just over our hoop house.  It disappeared from sight as I tried unsuccessfully to take a video too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are farmers, my husband a retired mill worker.  He is the believer in UFO&#39;s, I am not.  I do not know what I saw- only, it was not man made, or I should say- to my experience, research- this was like no light that I am aware of.  I do have pictures that testify to this object&#39;s shape and color that we watched for several minutes.  We live in a heavily forested, barely populated area- with three large lakes surrounding us.<n>

The whole time I was asking questions and for responses and it stayed there until I fell asleep and at some points when I was talking my vision would start screwing up it wasn&#39;t natural and I&#39;ve never had any thing like that happen before.

I only noticed it because there is construction going on across from the stop sign, but they have massive lights there, it reflected from the bottom of the craft.  Once out of reflective range I still saw it and followed it with my eyes.  It is so hard to explain, it was going so slow but it was going fast at the same time.  It had to be less than 1.5 - 2.5 k feet up.  It was absolutely super quiet. I didn&#39;t see heat source, I didn&#39;t hear mechanical movements or propellers. It was my first, I yelled, I see you!  I NEVER saw night or &#34;flight&#34; lights, it just blended into the sky, I hope I&#39;ve explained it well enough for others to understand,  I am a sober mined late 30&#39;s man whom knows the difference from commercia! l planes.  Unless , as my mind must be open minded to a possibility it could be a drone, but I say NO, it just was so quiet, and I know this again I had my head out the window when it all happened, I was spitting out the window.<n>

After about 15 seconds I realized I was almost stopped in the road and drove to a parking lot maybe a quarter mile up the road, exited my vehicle and took a picture and short video.  Only being a few blocks from home in jumped back in my truck and raced home to show my wife.  When we went outside, the ascending lights were no longer there, only three white lights in the shape of a triangle traveling away from us.  I never heard a sound, and it seemed the ascending objects were moving very slow like a ballon, but in the 90 seconds it took my to drive home and grab my wife, the objects were no longer many, but one.<n>

As I was waiting at the bus stop, I looked up and noticed a small white light that was moving.  I thought it was a star or that the movement of the wind/clouds was making it appear that the star was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I looked around and noticed that there were dozens of these lights all moving in the same direction.  At least one light was further up in the sky and appeared smaller yet it kept up the same slow speed as all the other white lights that were stretched across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the lights were moving in the same direction and at the same slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was really weird.<n>

I could also see the stars and there were no clouds in that direction which was SE according to my car compass.  it took as much space in the sky as if you held a quarter about a foot from your face.<n>

I stood still and watched for about 3-5 seconds before it seemed to slowly &#34;cloak&#34; itself and then it was gone.  It did not make a sound at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran up my back stairs and called out for my fiance&#39; since I was scared out of my mind.  We also had to deal with our neighbors barking dog from 1:30- 2:30 AM and my young child who woke up from the insane barking.  I thought that I could explain it away thinking well maybe I just saw a plane etc but I know that is not what I saw and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep until 3AM being comforted by my fiance&#39;.<n>

I sat down in my chair and was playing on my phone.  I then saw a weird light shining brighter then the street lights.  I looked up and there was oval shaped object about 30 or 40 ft.  Above my home, more so over the street then my home.  It was huge, maybe 60ft. in diameter.  It had lights around the edges of it and a larger, brighter light in the center of it.  It  stayed there for a few seconds and then was gone just as quick as it appeared.  When I came back inside, my lights were flickering and my TV was off completely and it was on when I went outside<n>

Something made me look up, and I saw a bright ball of green light.  The light was on my upper right side.  The ball of green light was not small, but very huge-like the moon size in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I caught this ball of light, I saw it literally shoot down, very fast, towards the ground of the city.  I didn&#39;t see anything afterwards.  It lasted only a few seconds, but it certainly was incredible.<n>

I had my phone on me so I called my wife who was in the house and told her to get outside.  She was standing by the garage and I was walking back towards the house (about 90 feet).  My neighbor was also outside.  It appeared to be moving towards the ground, vertically towards the area where we live, then prior to it disappearing it moved back towards the sky.  It was bright and disk shaped, no sounds were present. It stayed in one place for a few seconds and then would move erratically in a chaotic pattern, but with no recognizable signature to identify it by any means.  It was not an aircraft, because immediately as this was happening we heard two jets (aircraft of jet-like origin) moving towards the object.  We tried to video tape this with the camera phone but it was too dark, and would not be sufficient for what we saw.  After we heard the jets coming towards the area of the object, it shot ac! ross the sky and disappeared.  The jets continued to make loud noise, but soon after were gone as well.<n>

The craft then flew west directly over my vehicle and the road. Several other vehicles traveling on Tramway stopped because of this craft.  The craft then changed to a south easterly direction and flew towards Kirtland AFB.<n>

It was at a very high altitude.  The light was brighter than any stars in the area and it moved slowly.  It also would come to a complete stop and hover.  When it was moving, a bright light would appear on to extend from the light.  It would move in the opposite direction from the side of the light extended out from.  I suspect I was observing some sort of thruster being utilized when I observed this.  However, I was not close enough to make that determination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light came to a stop and hovered for about 5 minutes.  It then rapidly began gaining altitude until it was no longer visible.  I videotaped a few minutes of the phenomena however the video is of poor quality.  The total time I observed it was approx. 10 minutes and light did not return while I was out in the area once it gained altitude and was out of sight.<n>

We were on our way back to our home in Whitefield, NH, and had driven up Route 93 north through the Franconia Notch and then exited off Exit 36 towards Twin Mountain/Whitefield NH.  We drove along Route 3 towards Whitefield (approx 16 miles) without anything abnormal. After entering Whitefield on Route 3 we had crossed into the town by passing the town sign between Twin and Whitefield and proceeded up the hill towards Colby Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we crested the hill and started to turn right onto Colby Road I pointed out three good size orange spheres that appeared to be moving fairly slow on the driver’s side.  I asked her what she thought they were?  She didn’t know but I said “could they be helicopters on a night mission?  She was not sure but I rolled down my driver’s side window, slowed and came to a stop at the top of the hill entrance for Colby Road and tried to listen.  I did not hear any sound that sounded like a helicopter and only heard the wind. There were no other cars on the road and it was dark but you could see stars. I slowed down so I could try to watch them as I started down the hill on Colby.  For the 1-2 min period I sat there in my vehicle, they appeared to be moving but fairly slow and seem close enough to not be aircraft. If I had to guess I would say they were at least 1000-2000 feet up and above the farm fields near the hill. It is possible others saw this in the area but I do not know. I told her “lets speed down the hill” to see if I can get in the open and get a better view. We drove down while watching to the drivers side and I thought I caught a quick glimpse through the trees but was not sure. I eventually approached near Rexford’s construction which was more open with almost no trees and looked and slowed down but saw nothing. That is all. Hopefully someone else reports this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 orange spheres seen near Rt 3 in Whitefield NH<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just filed a report and needed to add on to it. I forgot to describe the spheres.  They were all flying in approx a diagonal line at roughly the same altitude.  They all appeared to move together in unison so in this sense I believed they were in some sort of formation.  The sphere&#39;s had a strong orange glow with yellowish at the middle area and there appeared to be an orange aura around them also.  I could not make out any distinct shapes on the sphere.  There was no sound from them as far as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

They were about a half-mile away from my home and told me to go outside quickly and look at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and while facing north, I could see three orange orbs going in a straight line across the sky slowly from West to East.  My sister was yelling “what are they?” and as I watched, I had no idea what I was looking at.  I could hear no sound and could not judge any kind of distance.  One of the orange orbs was out ahead of the other two I would say about double the distance that the second two were apart from each other.  We talked on the phone for a minute or two as the objects disappeared into the eastern sky.  About a minute after that, two more orbs appeared following the same path, and my sister and her husband arrived at my house as I pointed out the new orbs.  My nephew was called out of the house to see these two and the four of us watched as they too disappeared into the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:51 a single orb appeared on the same track as the other five, we watched it slowly move across the sky to the east, and it too disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe the light from these orbs as fire -like in that it was the color of fire and fluctuated like a bright flame, but did not trail behind like you would expect if a flame was moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living in Florida I have often witnessed Space Shuttle Launches and other Rocket Launches from Cape Canaveral from my yard but nothing like what I saw tonight.  Tonight’s lights seemed much closer and brighter than any thing I had seen before.<n>

I was star gazing and it crossed my POV about 5 minutes in doing a fly by lasting about 35-40 seconds.  It made NO sounds, and had NO lights.  It moved in a perfect straight line.  It was the width of 2 moons so it must have been a very giant low flying craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have it on Google Maps checked where I was standing at: 33*42&#39; 17.43&#34;N 117*47&#39; 1.18&#34;W  -Craft was flying mostly East to West towards the ocean/Newport Beach.  Through my research I found about 2 weeks earlier a popular Newport Beach triangular formation o flights the same dimension as the craft I saw is going viral on Youtube, but filmed in the day time.  My theory is it must have some cloaking device considering it matched the color of the sky perfect.  It look just like a black outline and flew in such a perfect straight line into the horizon, almost like someone dragging an icon across a monitor perfectly straight.<n>

As I hurriedly turned south onto Blount Street from Peace Street, I spotted a very bright object in the eastern sky, roughly above Oakwood Cemetery.  It seemed to be stationary and diamond-shaped.  It was about the size of my pinky thumbnail held at arms length.  The top half was extremely shiny, almost mirror-like, while the bottom half glowed brilliant amber.  The sun was rising behind it at the time and I couldn&#39;t tell if the sunrise was reflecting off of it or the glow came from the object itself.  If it was reflecting sunlight at that time of day, the object must have been very large and very high in the sky.  My sense was that it was reflecting sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my attention to the road and back and lost sight of it in that brief time.  Had I not already been late that morning I would&#39;ve gone looking for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second unexplained object I&#39;ve seen over Raleigh in four months.  A report of a similar object seen over Raleigh two days prior prompted me to file this one.<n>

It was clear skies.  I am very familiar with the area and there are no tall towers which would produce light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impressions were this was a plane.  However, the object did not appear to be moving, rather hovering and the shape was unusual and the lights very bright and peculiar.  I slowed my vehicle as I got to the object and got a good look.  Now I could see detail and was very sorry I didn&#39;t have a camera as I would have snapped a photo showing a clearly shaped black triangle with three lights at the corners, blue and red and white.  The object was standing still mid-air about 100 yards above me and almost directly overhead.  There was no sound and the lights were slowly blinking, although dimming off and on would be a better description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was stopped, outside my car and looking up at the object.  I was the sole vehicle in the area at that specific time.  The object was pulsing back and forth between a sort of luminous, transparency and solid, black as if it was materializing and de-materializing at the pulse rate of about once every two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple minutes, I became a little nervous being alone and with the object so close. I got in my car and left.  The detail against clear skies left no doubt this was a UFO.  I&#39;m curious if this is actually belonging to military with borrowed alien technology.  I base this on the common sense fact that ET&#39;s would not necessarily need lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a no-nonsense type of guy and the fact is, had I had my camera it likely would have produced the most clear and detailed photo of a UFO in history.  It was THAT distinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m in my mid-50&#39;s.  This is the third UFO I&#39;ve witnessed but not since the mid 1970&#39;s and never this close or with such clarity and detail.<n>

Just a little while ago. . . I noticed it was really dark and no moon out, dry, and crystal clear sky.  I looked from the back yard due west and saw something hovering emitting a rainbow of colors. It was somewhat static but seemed to hover in a random elliptical motion/manner.  I watched it for about 10 minutes and ran inside to get my sister she came out and then her fiancée we all stood there trying to figure what it was and confirmed it was not a satellite, balloon, helicopter, drone or anything known.  I wanted witnesses and confirm I wasn&#39;t crazy or seeing things. We all we perfectly sober for the record.  We could not debunk it.  I went back inside and got my binoculars (40x) and  my sister fiancée and I took turns looking at it.  We concluded it was exactly due west, very bright and was gradually either moving away slowly and/or downward.  We figure it was 50 to 100 miles away or so and from what we could tell it was triangular with three light source that seemed to be emitting from the points we think.  We figure it had to be massive because it was seemingly had to be since it was so far away and still seemed rather big.  As it either descended or flew off slowly it went out of view because the roof tops obstructed our line-of-sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It fit the exact description my last landlord/friend described seeing a handful of times in the same area and about the same approximate time.  One night he said it came right over the house very low then shot off.  He said he went out cause all the neighbors dogs were going crazy. He went outside and everything went quiet.  He looked up and it was right over the house and it was bright, dead silent and huge!  He said the next-door neighbor came outside too to find out what the dogs were barking at and she saw it.  He asked if she saw it to confirm he wasn&#39;t crazy, and she said “Yeah!”  I never confirmed it with her, but I know who she is and their addresses.  At the time I was skeptical.  Now I totally believe him after this event!  If this was a hoax I have no idea how anyone could have made a vehicle do what it did or make so bright.  Kinda like a disco-tech hovering in the sky.  It kinda reminded me of a police car strobe light rack but it was spinning all different random colors.  I hoped it would just zip away into space so I could rule out a hoax.  Seemed legit to me!!!  Definitely an Unidentified Flying Object!<n>

At first I thought it was an aircraft, but the light emanating from the object didn’t flash in any recognizable pattern as one would expect from an airplane; my next thought was that it was a satellite because the flashes it was emitting were full spectrum, it seemed to be emanating all the colors one might expect to see in a rainbow, but this is where it started getting weird, the object started moving in a back and forth pattern very rapidly for a few moments; something I&#39;ve never seen conventional aircraft or satellite do.  It would remain in place for a few minutes, moving in a whiplash back-and-forth movement, then it started to wander lazily in random directions, moving in a westerly direction over the span of about one-and-a-half hours before it disappeared from view.  I reported the lights to a ne! ighbor who also confirmed the lights and the same movement patterns I described.  We could not discern any shape, we could only see the flashing/flickering lights; we both described the light as brilliant, agreeing it was far too bright to be a star or a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an end-note: I’ve never seen anything remotely like this in my life, and I’m in my 30s.<n>

Still driving trhead, the object was now on the right of us.  My fiancee then attempted to to video the object, however thre phone died.  My fiancee rolled the window down and stuck his grad out of the window to see it better.  It was then that he saw the shape of the object, which was a triangle, and he saw the red and Blue lights.  Again, the object was not moving, it was just hovering around in the sky approximately 500 yards in the air.<n>
1/24/14 22:05|Levittown|NY|Unknown||Three sets of lights seen over nassau county New York.|1/30/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106617.html|139|ndxe201401| Three sets of lights seen over nassau county New York<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:05 Eastern time on the night of Friday, January 24th, 2014, I observed three (3) sets of three (3) red lights in the sky approximately one (1) to one and a half (1.5) miles East of my home.  Each individual red light was approximately twice the size of a usual star in the sky. Each set of three (3) lights was in a triangular configuration, one (1) light centered above (2) other lights.  Each set of lights was approximately twenty (20) to thirty (30) yards away from the next, and situated linearly from each other as if on the rim of a disc-shaped object, or down the side of a cylindrical or cigar-shaped object.  I could not actually see the shape of the object itself, I am approximating it&#39;s shape from the positions of the sets of lights.  My house faces North, and I was in my back yard facing East when I noticed the lights.  The object slowly moved in a North-by-Northeast direction, for less that twenty (20) seconds before it was blocked from my view by trees and houses.  My best estimate is that from the objects position when I first noticed it. It was approximately one (1) to one and a half (1.5) miles East of me, and approximately eight (8) to ten (10) inches above estimated horizon.

We were just past exit 29 heading north on interstate 67.  The object was moving at a very slow pace.  My wife saw it first and pointed it out to me immediately.  I promptly pulled to the shoulder of the interstate so I could exit the vehicle and observe it better.  We watched the object for aprox 15 min before it just disappeared.<n>

My camera did catch a gassie Clouds substance around objects.  the funny thing to me was seeing these objects with pulsating fire in the midst i wonder what kind of material can float and have fire in it as a wheater balloon does it seems to me that gasses would have to controled some how other wise burned up quickly.  No these strobed Through the air.  With fire.   I estimated objects 1000 ft to 2000 above moving 5-10 mph  5 ft in diameter.<n>

The light sometimes appeared as two separate points, almost like green spots moving side by side, and at other times appeared as a single point emitting white light not unlike a star.  The light moved alternately in circular, saccadic, and up and down patterns.  The light moved much faster and in trajectory patterns that did not resemble that of familiar aircraft.  The phenomenon was observed to the west in the sky from our vantage point, and the distance was difficult to determine.  Near the end of the sighting the object appeared to descend toward ground level.<n>

Brinion and heading west over I-5 Freeway.  There was 12-14 of them and they were bright and orange in color.  The sky was VERY clear and you can see every star and they were bigger and brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over, as did another car to get a better look and called my ex-husband who was in the Navy to step outside his house and look.  He did so and could only see about 5-6 by that time as when they lined up at a certain altitude, not perfectly straight but like ducks flying together until most were up there and then they started to gather around each other when the ones farthest to the left began to take off and dim out quickly.  One by one, they did this till all caught up from over the mountain and left…<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived here for years and never seen such a thing, wasn’t lanterns they moved like helicopters but faster and no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call it into the local Police department for them to log.<n>

I arrived at home, got out of my car, and observed these orange colored lights.  At first I thought it was a constellation, but the lights shined brighter than any star.  Also at this time we were in an inversion, so we hadn&#39;t seen the moon, stars or sun for well over a week.  My next thought was maybe helicopter formation.  Well with a cloud ceiling of maybe 1000 ft., I should have been able to hear them, nor did they have any flashing beacons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hurried to the door, and called for my wife as a witness.  When she came out there were maybe eight lights remaining.  They took about three seconds apiece to fade with about five seconds inbetween as they all slowly disappeared.  It reminded us of a similar incident we witnessed from home on July 3 2013.  Four lights in a diamond pattern due north at  about 10:30.  They appeared stationary then slowly faded as I mentioned above.<n>

First time, I thought it was a star, then realized it was a little too low, too bright, and was moving, floating alongside my car.  When I stopped, it came to a stop in front of me.  When I made a right turn, and stopped and looked in front of me, there it was again.  I would return to the spot I saw it the first time, and it was gone; then return to the spot it was the second time and it was gone.  Sometimes I saw it vaporize like a cigarette ash, an orange/brown fading light, in an arc that fades.  Sometimes, I see in the place it was before it disappeared, and not moving, appx 4 lights, 2 red and 2 white.  So...it looks like a star that moves ... then changes to appear like an airplane that doesn&#39;t move.  Once, it flew directly over me when I was standing outdoors, no sound.  This started appx june 2013.  The star was in the same place nightly, usually appeared before dusk, and slowly sunk below the horizon around 10 pm.  I noticed it t! he first time when it first &#39;followed&#39; my car and stopped in front of me when I stopped in june 2013.  It was in the north west sky, same spot, until recently.  I noticed around end of december it wasnt there anymore.  Then, a few days ago, as I was driving, there it was in a different direction.  I turned right into a parking lot and got out, looked up, and saw, in front of me, again, as if it was changing direction to stay in front of me, what was 2 red and 2 white lights, hovering, not moving, as if it had morphed into an airplane camoflage, then faded away.  It hasn&#39;t been in the NW sky since end of december 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sounds like same thing Ive read in several other posts ... has there been an explanation posted anywhere?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was heading east northeast depending on the direction of the road (ranch road 12) heading toward town.  I saw the object out of the corner of my eye on this road.  I turned onto  the main road through town (Hopkins) and was heading toward downtown.  After the road straightened out (I was looking toward the north, north east)  I got a look at the object it had four lights all had a brightness comparable to a car&#39;s head light although were more like those found on an old Jeep. (Like a flood light.)  The objects lights where in this pattern O-O-O-O although rounded.  The object did not have any of the running lights commonly found on an aircraft . The object also seemed to have more mass behind the lights, as if the some of the light coming off of the four lights, showed the out line of the craft.  It appeared to be round.  Its shape could be compared to a mentos candy chew with four lights  on the front. Its course was crossing mine, it appeared to be coming from the east, northeast headed west, southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got to my destination (a friend&#39;s house) I lost sight of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be lower than commercial aircraft although not as low as many other aircraft that fly in the area like hospital helicopters. Commercial aircraft are often at altitude when they pass over either from San Antonio or Austin. There are other atypical aircraft that sometimes fly over the area most of them are private planes headed towards the city&#39;s municipal airport. Its on the northeast side of town. Most aircraft that land there head west to east. Other aircraft that fly around the area are antique world war two era. But these can be heard as most are propeller driven. And usually do not come around until the city holds the air show at the Airport. The show is usually in late spring. But the planes can be heard flying at various times. The object in question had no audible sound. And it did not follow any known flight paths of any other aircraft typically seen in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will supply a picture and map in a few days. It will be sent to the address below and mey take longer to get there. However I will send a copy of the the above text and needed info.<n>

Out of nowhere, bright white streak of light fell from the sky.  It was a perfect white line of burning white light heading straight towards the ground.  It left no smoke trail, there was no burst or noise before, during or after it appeared, and no real noticeable &#34;head&#34; on the streak of light.  As it  got closer, I could see that it had a yellow round section on each side of the bright white line at the lead.  It was no shooting star nor like any meteor I&#39;ve ever seen and it seemed so close.  Everyone on the highway immediately started breaking, as though we were all instinctively reacting and preparing for it to crash land on the highway &amp; cause a massive pile up.  Then, just when it seemed to be only about 50ft overhead and moving FAST towards us all, it vanished without a trace.  As quickly as it appeared, it was gone.  It started &amp; ended in 7 seconds, tops.<n>

It stayed on the same horizontal plane moving faster than a jet airliner, making no discernable sound.  After about 10 to 15 secinds it simply vanished, disappeared.  About 30 seconds later came an identical sphere, on the same trajectory as the first, disappearing after 10 to 15 seconds.  This same sequence occurred with four additional, identical, orbs.  About 1 minute later 4 identical orbs appeared at once, each on a steady horizontal plane, but at differing heights, disappearing after about 10 to 15 seconds, as the first 6 did.  The sky was clear as a bell, the orbs quite large and extremely visible.  Both my companion and I witnessed these.  Their distance from us, difficult to gage, was maybe 30 to 100 miles?<n>

I also would like to report a possible UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about twelve years of age I was sitting on my grandparents roof experimenting with cigarettes.  At that time back in 1996 my grandparents home was surrounded by hay fields and about 150 yards from a rural residential road on the Wind River Indian Reservation.  I happened to look up out into the hay field and right where a irrigation ditch is I had seen a green and red and white light changing colors.  I could tell it was only about five feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had thought it was another kid out in the field with one of those toy flashlights that change color.  I do not remember climbing down off the roof nor do I remember going to bed. (this was about 10:00 pm)  Through out my teenage and in my early twenties I had never given the sighting another thought. when I was a teenager my grandmother had given me the book &#39;&#39;Intruders&#39;&#39; by respected Budd Hopkins.  The book had sat in my bedroom closet for years collecting dust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not read the book until the summer of 2013 and I started remembering the strange lights I had seen out in the hay field.  I am a Native American and as you probably know my heritage is  strongly influenced by the supernatural and paranormal.  After reading Intruders I was thinking &#39;&#39;what would a little kid be doing way out in the hay field at night&#39;&#39; then I theorized that maybe it was a alcoholic walking through the field with one of those toy flashlights&#39;&#39; because there has been a lot of alcoholics in my community who would walk out in the fields to someone&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with a Native American shaman and had described what I had seen.  I did not go to him for help we are friends and we was talking about the talk show &#39;&#39;coast to coast&#39;&#39; the medicine mad had told me that he thought that it was not a human nor was it an evil spirit roaming around that it very well could have been something from not of this world. I truly believe that it was something extra terrestrial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another incident that I would like to share is that when I was twenty six I had a very strange dream that seemed real. I felt like I was awake and conscious but at the same time it was a dream. In this strange state of mind I had seen several green orbs floating around me. something or somebody was speaking to me but I could not hear a voice nor could I speak. The information I had received was in my head. I know there is a word for it but I can not think of it right now. I think the word I am looking for is telepathy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these green orbs were floating around me I was told that if I do not do this one certain thing that I would be killed. I strongly believe that extra terrestrials were communicating with me. I don&#39;t know how exactly but I feel in my heart and with all my soul that they were in fact ET&#39;s. I have thought this through a lot and am very confused as to why would they threatened me like that? I sometimes think that mayby they were not being malicious but giving me a warning and trying to help me because at that time I was in a very dangerous situation where my life was actually in danger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Native American Culture we do have stories of &#39;&#39;star people&#39;&#39; coming to earth and visiting with tribal elders. These &#39;&#39;star people&#39;&#39; are not out to hurt or destroy humans. I strongly believe that aliens are real but I just cannot accept the thought that I was abducted.....here is my UFO sighting....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was laying in bed with my curtains open and there is a big pine tree outside my window. I had seen a blinking white or silver light through the tree branches and thought it was a star. I got up about twenty minutes later and had noticed that the light was gone. I was looking out the window and had noticed the same light hovering over the Wind River Mountains on the Wind River Indian Reservation. I thought to myself that cant be a star why did it move like that? I thought it was an airplane then I realized if it was in fact an airplane then it would be moving but it was just sitting there blinking it was mostly white/silver and as I peered at it longer and concentrated on it. I could see it change to a faint red color and it was just sitting there blinking. I know now that it was not a star no an airplane and the only conclusion I could think of was that it must have been a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There have been reported sightings on this Reservation of bigfoot but never has anybody reported seeing a UFO. I personally think  that by becoming interested in aliens and reading Intruders and listening to coast to coast that somehow I attracted ET&#39;s . I have never seen a &#39;&#39;grey&#39;&#39; only the strange lights as a child and the green orbs in my dream. I am a recovering alcoholic and marijuana addict. I have been clean and sober for three years so I know what I saw the other night was not an hallucination. I was in a very normal state of mind. Anyway the strange blinking lights I had seen was just sitting there not moving. The lights were right above the Wind River Mountains on the Wind River Indian reservation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading my story and please take into consideration my sighting of a possible UFO. God bless!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It flashed at mostly 8 second intervals.  By this I mean the light was visible for less than a second and 8 seconds later it would reappear.  Some of the intervals were longer by a couple seconds.  The light would move but not in any straight line but randomly  around one piece of the night sky.  It stayed  within a couple degrees of one spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definitely was not a plane or helicopter.  It could have been a weather balloon, I guess.  The light disappeared after my wife and I watched it for 10 minutes.  It could have been flashing before we saw it for some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a retired professional as is my wife.  We&#39;ve never filed a report here before.  I do not drink or take drugs and have had no hallucionary experiences.<n>

Possible abduction<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 9:30 PM. I was alone at home, reading a book in my bedroom.  My kids slept in their bedroom in the basement.  The lights were all off, except my reading  light on my headboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was focused on my book when I saw something from the corner of the eye. I immediately felt chills.  Looking, I saw that there was nothing.  So I continued my reading  for a few minutes until a flash of white light lighted my whole bedroom.  Then I saw three white spheres the size of a basketball floating in the air at the height of  the ceiling.  I felt terrified.  The spheres move synchronously in spirals around the room.  Spheres of light emitted a hum.  Spheres illuminated the room.  With a yank,  the spheres have stopped moving and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart was beating too fast.  I looked at my phone and it was 10:34 PM.  Reassured, I told myself that I had probably dreamed of this observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I instinctively looked out the window.  What I saw completely hurt me.  There was a total of two beings standing, looking at me through my window. They were about 4  feet tall, big heads, big slanted black eyes, no nose, only nostrils.  They looked at me with a terrible stare.  I could feel anger towards me.  I was sweating cold  water.  I was terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, they disappeared in a matter of seconds.  I felt reassured for a second, until something cold grabbed my legs and my arms at the  same time.  I couldn&#39;t move, they were holding me tight.  I could feel something cold inside my skull, as if someone was touching parts of my brain.  It was a really scaring experience.  A really uncomfortable feeling.  Everything went black and I passed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up next morning at 09h52, with a terrible headache.  Something happened last night. I will never be the same again.<n>

He called me and my husband out and we observed 10-20 more of these lights moving from the east to west across the sky.  They did not have tails nor left a trail like a meteor would have and they did not appear to be dropping, just going across the whole sky until we could no longer see them.  These lights were gold/yellowish like the stars look like with the natural eye and were not close together like they were on an airplane or some other type of aircraft.  There was no noise heard and no auras or haze around the lights.<n>
1/23/14 22:00|Miami|FL|Fireball|1+ minute|Red "plasma" ball of light traveling south to north over the Everglades, complete with tail/corona.|1/30/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106641.html|167|ndxe201401| Red &amp;quot;plasma&amp;quot; ball of light traveling south to north over the Everglades, complete with tail/corona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: Miami, Florida (western suburbs, away from major light sources located eastward)  (Note:  This is the 2nd time in four months I have seen the EXACT same phenomenon in my location. I will include details of this event post-script. This was not a chinese lantern, as well.)   I was sitting outside with a friend of mine.  I glanced at the sky (Which I do out of habit), and my eyes focused on a single red dot of light.  Instantly recognizing this as the same object I saw four months prior, I stood up and pointed it out to my friend. We stood in awe as the following happened:  (Note:  This event lasted over one minute)  The object moved smoothly northward from over the Everglades (west from my location, about 5 miles from my house).  As we watched, we noticed a whiteish-reddish tail emanating from the object, flowing smoothly away from it.  The tail diminished, but given a closer look I noticed a corona of white vapor surrounding the red ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dot of light and its tail resembled glowing red plasma.  The object, from my limited perspective, seemed like it was moving as quickly as an airplane would from 30,000 ft up.  I suspect the object was actually located between 50-70,000 ft high, and probably moving much quicker than any airplane.  Despite this, it flowed smoothly from south to north over the Everglades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 45 seconds, the ball of light dimmed... then reappeared three seconds later. It dimmed once more, then came back, now with a strong reddish tail flowing from it (at this point it was parallel to me if I faced toward the west).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe 10-15 seconds later, my friend and I noticed the ball of light seemed to contain a small explosion, again very flowy and plasma-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this final &#34;explosion&#34; of light, the object dimmed, then suddenly disappeared, now located to the north of me (i noticed the light when it was WELL south of my location).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the sky, but nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Post-script: This has happened to me before.  Same location, but this time the light was travelling from north to south over the EASTERN sky (from my perspective, I can surmise it was flying over the ocean, outside the mainland Miami-Downtown area). Again it lasted over a minute, it had a tail (this tail was much more prominent and strange than the most recent event.  Very deep blood red, flowing well away from the ball of red light, creating what seemed like a Comet&#39;s coma/tail.)  The tail would diminish occasionally, the light would dim almost completely, flash bright again, dim, flash, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have studied meteors before in an attempt to explain this to myself.  I believe with 150% certainty, NEITHER of these objects were a meteor or aircraft of any kind.  There also seem to be many other reports of similar objects/events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I write this in an attempt to perhaps get some answers or even a little logical explanation as to what this MIGHT be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: Miami has very heavy air traffic, with various types of commercial, private, military and helicopter aircraft flying at any given time.  During BOTH instances, other aircraft were in full view (I live near Miami International Airport.  Planes do holding patterns or final-descent approaches near my house).  This object did not resemble ANY aircraft or &#34;chinese lantern&#34;   The first time, I had no witnesses.  This second time, I have a legitimate witness that watched this happen with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

My girlfriend and I were saying goodbye out in my drive way and that&#39;s when I saw a bright orangish red light rise from behind my neighbors roof.  It was very bright and I could not see any detail if the object.  It rose up to what appeared as about 10 feet above the home.  It slowly moved right then stopped and remained still for a good minute.  Just as we went to record what was happened it began drifting away and then sped off away from us and became a little orange dot then eventually disappeared.  There was no noise associated with this object.<n>

It sounded nothing like a plane or helicopter.  After hearing the sound we both looked up and seen 7 unidentified flying objects flying perfectly in a straight line.  All 7 crafts had 3 red lights in the shape of a triangle.  The crafts were also flying very slow.  I would say they were about 3,000 feet above.  Watched them passed over for about 2 minutes.

Tiny but bright quickly flashing sparkles.  Yet Sparkled back to their moving positions which was fast.  Not fireworks but something moving across sky.  Quick flashing eastward in unison.  Then they disappeared and I then saw lower orangeish brighter lit flashes in the sky where they had been and they lasted for about a minute and moved east as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I doubt Chinese candles as they were quick sparkles and I also know what Chinese candles look like.

As they made their way north they made several irregular deviations in their flight path.  As they became closer (15-20 seconds), they broke formation and began rotating around each other in very close proximity.  Every so often they would move back into formation for a few seconds and then begin the rotation again.   We continued to speculate that they were aircraft and witnessed the sun reflecting off flat sides as they spun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We monitored them until they left our field of view, which was no more than 60 seconds of total visibility.  During that time, they must have traveled approximately 6 miles before turning skyward with a heading of north northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best description I can think of is the following:  Three similar sized shapes approximately ten to fifteen feet in length with at least several flat sides, which explains the sun reflection of their sides as they rotated about.  They also did not appear to ever be more than twenty feet apart the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their flight path was very irregular and they moved between sixty and one hundred knots and maintained an elevation that was fairly consistent at about twelve hundred feet until the end where they shot skyward.<n>

1/23/14 00:05|Tabernacle|NJ|Unknown|3-4 minutes|Object in eastern sky in south New Jersey.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106599.html|189|ndxe201401| Object in eastern sky in south New Jersey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 22 2014 at 2359 hrs.  I was loading my wood stove and on completing this I sat down to enjoy the fire when I looked out the bay window facing and easterly direction and saw something that was like a star but it was not.  That night we had a cloud cover moving in around midnight and I did not see any stars out.  This object was not moving at this time. I saw one red light at the bottom which my first thought was that it was a military craft. The light glowed like an aviation light.  The light would be bright and then drop to a lesser brightness but would never go out.  The object had three white lights one was to the right of the red light and one to the left.  These where evenly spaced from the red light and on the same level.  The third one was vertical of the red one and was spaced as the same as the ones right and left.  These white lights never changed their brightness stayed the same the whole time.  I was trying to understand the object not jumping to any conclusions. Then it moved from its location by dropping to the right at a 20 degrees angle.  Next, it changed its angle to complete to 45 degrees.  Finally, it went to a horizontal movement to the right. When this was completed, it went back to its location in same movement.  This thing stopped me from thinking it was something military.  The speed in which it traveled was very fast.  In a split second it traveled to its new location and the same speed back. This object as it appeared from the distance from where I was standing with a measuring scale was about 1/8 of an inch.  The length of its movement was about ¾ of an inch. The lights never changed its configuration, nor did the object rotate, or pitch.  The object in about ten seconds did this movement again which was a copy of its first.  I think in about 20 seconds it made this move the same as the last two, except it was to the left and it was the same.  The lights never changed, nor did the start location, but then! as clouds moved in I think caused the brightness to drop off.  Then the brightness came back to a full brightness.  Next, I only saw the top light because I think the clouds covered the bottom.  Finally, I think it was covered with clouds.  I sat there for an hour hoping it would be seen again, but it never did.  The total time that I saw this object was three to four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Then the white &#34;star&#34; next to it began to move left, and the blinking red light followed, never coming nearer or farther to the white light.  The two lights traveled very slowly across the sky until they appeared to stop, about a minute later.  Then the white light flashed once, then was just gone, while the blinking red light continued to move, eventually out of my sight.<n>

Not a Shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight 01-22-2014 around 9:15 pm I was facing North on my way back into the house with my dog, I looked up into the sky around the area of Cassiopeia, I noticed a red light (about as big as the stars around it) which at first I thought was a high altitude jet.  It was moving southward and as it passed between the upper portion of this star constellation, it kind of dimmed, came back and went out.  Not really a fade but in between a fade and being turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say it was a meteor but I have seen hundreds of those and this thing was not going at meteor speed like a shooting star (meteor).  It was moving smoothly though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of when I was a kid and we could see the space station making its orbit. However, that didn&#39;t disappear, it went over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know jets etc, and there were actually two other high altitude jets in the sky as well. Different areas of the sky but were obviously jets because of the other lights blinking on the them, white and green as well as red. This thing was not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Suddenly this star moves in an Z-Pattern and just disappears! I had to blink and do all sorts of things to make sure I was really seeing this.  Basically, this object looked more like solid light like planet,  it was just small bright circle disguised as a star/planet!<n>

Then I thought maybe they were flares being used by the military as the lights appeared close to the Goldwater bombing range.  These lights were stationary the entire time.  The lights remained at a constant height, stayed the same distance apart with one slightly higher than the other.  After about a half hour both lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what to think as they stayed in one spot, bright like a lantern, oval in shape and orange in color.

Put binoculars on, saw irregular changing shape with highly reflective surface.  Not a weather balloon, not a party balloon, not a bird, not an aircraft. No lateral motion.  Kept changing shape, reflection threw off blues and reds yellows as though diffraction on surface of it.  Quickly shrank in size to full disappearance.  Once it started to dim it faded to full disappearance in about 5 seconds. Gone.  About 30 seconds appearance. No dark silhouette until just before full vanish, at that instance it was a tiny round grey dot alternating with very tiny dim reflective flashes, then gone.  No navigation lights at any time. No birds in area riding thermals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 16:57 - Looking south in same direction for possible re-sighting of reflective object:  Dark grey object becomes visible as though emerging from water vapor in background.  Easily resolvable angular resolution which was unusual considering the fade-in.  Moving east to west. Looked a little like jet plane in traffic, looked about the right size and with lateral motion, but had no vertical stabilizer, no distinct wing shape. Would place it as about 1500-2000 ft altitude if in traffic pattern but in less than 5 seconds faded into a complete vanish as though going through a water vapor visibility limit. Impossible for a commercial jet in local traffic to do this at that close proximity from this observer. Same object as at 16:45? Don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 17:19 - Reflective specular object reappears, not as bright, smaller point reflection as though further away again towards the south.  No apparent motion.  iPhone camera will not register it, probably too dim against sky and camera knocks down aperture.  Dims out quickly.  About 10 seconds appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 17:20 - Repeat of same sighting profile as in 17:19.  No more sightings for 30 minutes after.

It freaked me out to the point of me yelling to my bubbly on the phone &#34;what the hell was that????&#34;   He said &#34; what was what?&#34;  And I replied, &#34;Did you just feel the ground shake??&#34; ( he is also a pool guy in the Boca Raton area in South Florida, 35 min drive from where I was)  &#34;he replied no I didn&#39;t&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then hung up with him and my customer came outside and said &#34; what happened??  What was that??&#34; I said &#34; did you hear that BOOM?? She said &#34;no&#34; I felt my floor shake. And saw you where here and thought something went wrong with my pool equipment&#34; I replied to her &#34; I felt the earth shake and heard a BOOM, but I was no where near her equipment&#34; not only that but afterwards I checked to see if it indeed it was the equipment ( pimp, motor, heater, pipes) anything...  And NOTHING was broken or out of place, everything was working perfectly. I know that lately reports like this have been coming out of this area and I never thought I would be saying that it&#39;s 100% real, whatever this BOOM is, it is incredibly powerful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking this report.  And for all you do in this field.<n>

It sounded like the sonic boom from an aircraft.  The windows in the front room of the house also shook like they can with loud thunder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall looking around quickly to see if anyone else was out to corroborate or if there was anything unusual in the area or in the sky when a second later I felt the ground beneath me shake.  It was a short rumble that lasted about one second.  I thought it was an earthquake because the ground definitely shook.  First the boom then the shaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around and saw nothing unusual and waited several minutes to see if it would happen again or if something else was going to happen but nothing did.  I was surprised that neighbors who were home did not come out to look around because it was that impressive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local fellow who reported a similar event on this same day and time was in Miramar which is a good ten miles southwest from where I live.  Amazing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that they are dredging a tunnel in the port of Miami.  A neighbor said that because the ground in this area is solid coral rock it might be possible for the shock wave to travel this far, 25 miles!  I really don&#39;t know about that but I suppose it is possible.  What is odd is that the boom seemed to definitely be an above ground event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not known earthquakes to be preceded by a loud boom.  I would really like to know what happened.  If you have any information on this event please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

My wife was still inside at the time.  The sky was clear. As I looked to the south  I saw an object that I will say looked like a little pure white marble moving horizontally at about 30 degrees above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a small airplane but staring at it revealed nothing betraying shape (fuselage, wings, tail)- none of these.  It seemed like a round sphere, pure white and not reflecting flashes of sunlight as planes often do, just a dull white color.  It moved along at an absolutely steady rate parallel to the horizon.  No sound came from it nor was there any trail visible behind it. I watched it proceed  smoothly  along  for about  ten to twenty seconds and then ran over to the door and yelled for my wife to come and see.  By the time she and I got to the vantage point it had disappeared. I thought immediately, “Ok, cloud cover.”  Then I realized, th! e sky was clear.  I don’t know if it vanished, flew away, winked out or what.  All I know is that in the ten seconds it took me to go to the door, yell and return it had gone.  (And it could not have gone into the clouds because there were none.)  I have often seen satellites flying overhead at night and this was about the right shape, size and behavior for one of those…so it you can see satellites in the day time maybe it was a satellite.  My impression was that whatever this was was flying at about eight to twelve thousand feet at a distance of about one to three miles from my vantage point.  I do not feel I can estimate its speed except to say that it was proceeding about as fast as a small plane would.  No erratic movement.<n>

They were too far apart to make up one gigantic object, so I would say they were 5 individual crafts either moving slowly or hoovering in one spot.  They seemed to be observing and had no sudden movements.  They made a noise that wasn&#39;t quite like an aircraft, but a strange hum as I opened the window. I also saw another car with two people stopped and look at the objects.  As I began driving and got onto another street, I saw another car parked observing the objects.  The red circular lights went from five, to three, to one, then vanished completely 2 minutes after I encountered them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I continued to flash the object for about 20 seconds then the orb&#39;s intensity decreased significantly for about 5-10 seconds and then vanished completely in plain sight.  About 1 minute later I could hear a helicopter and to my astonishment the helicopter was following the same path/direction the orb did and continued on this path to exactly where the orb disappeared and did a u-turn and followed the same path back until it was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later the helicopter returned and it flew around the area seemingly looking for something.  This continued for about 10 minutes until it flew away again in the same but opposite direction where the orb appeared from originally.<n>

The lights to started moving around up and down but at the same time a bit tilted (to clarify the lights looked as to be connected to each other, not separate objects).  Almost as in an airplane doing maneuvers but sideways…  It is a bit hard to explain and that is why it caught my eye, I was almost in a trance trying to figure out what was going on.  The object then stopped in mid air for about thirty seconds and hovered there.  It then began to light up fully in white lights and got very bright for thirty more seconds and steadily moved the opposite direction until it was out of sight.  The object was disk shaped when it was fully lit but I could not see the shape previous to that..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were on a walk when it happened, I can’t remember the exact time but it was around 8-9pm on January 21st.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not hear a sound the entire time the object was in view which was another reason I thought it to be strange seeing as it was close enough to where we should have heard something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second reporting in the past two months (my last being orange orbs) as well as I have heard two other cases from friends and family seeing orange orbs and a craft like object in Oakley within the same time period…<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know an explanation to these incidences as they seem to be occurring regularly within the past couple of months..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They looked like those stars that shine blue, red and white.  The one on the left was higher than the one on the right.  I ran into the house and grabbed my binoculars.  The one on the right was higher in the sky, they were moving very slowly.  I watched some more and the one on the left started heading south at a fast rate of speed.  The other one was slowly lowering and then took off in the same direction, also very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on a mountain and this is one of many weird things I&#39;ve seen in the sky, along with the commercial jets and other conventional aircraft.<n>

I thought it looked &#34;wrong&#34;, as it appeared to be vertical in the sky rather than running horizontally as you would expect from an airplane moving through the sky. I grabbed  my field glasses and was able to focus in on the object, a sphere shaped gray rock with what looked like ice crystals on the surface.  The contrail was actually a twin tailed gaseous substance coming off the backside of the object.  These tails appeared to swirl and &#34;boil&#34;.  The object was moving so slowly and was so low in the sky that all three of us were able to track it as it moved across the sky sharing the field glasses between us.  It changed trajectory twice. The first was a change in altitude and the second was when it turned towards us and we could see it head on.  This view showed a round ball of roiling fire.  We watched it until we couldn&#39;t anymore.  This object appeared as what one would think an art! ist rendition of a comet would look like as it moved through space.  Except it wasn&#39;t outer space. It was thousands of feet lower than a passenger jet that was flying overhead and just to the north at the same time as the object in the sky.  Because of the incredible detail we saw with field glasses and the extremely slow movement across the sky, we are having a time trying to wrap our brains around what we witnessed.<n>

He&#39;s not used to computers, so he asked me to post this.  He described seeing orange shooting lights in the sky.  At first, he thought perhaps there was a fire, but after a while, he realized it was not coming from a fire. He cannot explain what the source of it was.  I did a search on the internet asking what it could have been, and this website was the first website that came up.<n>
1/21/14 06:50|Montana City|MT|Changing|3 minutes|A bright, white, scintillating, pencil-shaped light over the Elkhorn Mountains observed for 3 minutes.|1/30/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106655.html|220|ndxe201401| A bright, white, scintillating, pencil-shaped light over the Elkhorn Mountains observed for 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These 2 sightings took place on Tuesday, January 21 between 6:45 and 7:00 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, who lives in an apartment directly below us, glanced out of a window and her attention was immediately drawn to a very bright, white, rectilinear, scintillating light over the Elkhorn Mountains southeast of Helena, Montana.  This was before sunrise and she could clearly see this light about 10 degrees above the silhouette of the mountains.  Atmosphere was crystal clear, no clouds, no fog.  No red or green lights were noted. Estimated altitude of the light would be approximately 8500 feet, approximately 130 degrees from her point of observation, and 10 miles distant from her position (per Google Earth).  She estimated the width of the light to be that of a “pencil eraser”, and the light appeared to be about 3 inches long from her perspective.  She walked to the window and watched this linear, scintillating light move horizontally and slowly to her right (toward the south and toward Casey Peak) for approximately 3 minutes, and then it simply disappeared. She may have lost sight of the light as it moved behind tree trunks near her which could have obstructed her view.  She had no idea what she was seeing, and told me that evening that she &#34;thought she had seen a UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday morning I mentioned to my wife that mom thought she had seen a UFO.  My wife said that she had also seen an unusual light that same Tuesday morning at that same time, although her description was different from my mother’s in several respects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife meditates in front of a large window with an excellent view of the Elkhorn Mountains most mornings between 6:40 – 7:00 AM.  She was seated almost directly above my mother but on the second floor of our home.  While meditating on Tuesday morning, January 21, at approximately 6:50 AM she opened her eyes and observed a single, stationary, dime-size, very bright white light also about 10 degrees above the mountains which she said quickly expanded in diameter to the size of a nickel, and then just vanished.  This light was much larger and much brighter than the pinpoint-size house lights and street lights that we see at half of the distance that this light appeared to be.  Her sighting lasted approximately 15 seconds.  She, too, had no idea what she had seen but she knew that this light was very unusual.  She had never seen any light like this before despite having sat in the same place looking out of the same window at the same time most mornings for the past 5 years.  Both my mother and my wife are convinced that whatever it was that they saw was not the planet Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Salt Lake City ATC which monitors Helena’s airspace above 12,000 feet, and they reported primary radar returns from an Airbus flying at 37,000 feet 40 miles NW of Helena, and a Cessna flying 50 miles NE of Helena on January 21 between 6:45 and 7:00 AM.  Both of these aircraft are wrong direction, wrong distance. SLC ATC reported no other transponder signals from any other aircraft.  I spoke with a man in the Helena Regional Airport tower (Steve) who was on duty that morning and he denied seeing what my mother or my wife described seeing.  However, he stated that at that time he was very likely looking out to the North of the tower and so likely would not have witnessed these events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No photos or video were obtained.<n>
1/21/14 06:00|Thousand Oaks|CA|Light|20 seconds|Unidentified, red and blue lights seen moving together at a high rate of speed and in random directions in Thousand Oaks, CA.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106551.html|221|ndxe201401| Unidentified, red and blue lights seen moving together at a high rate of speed and in random directions in Thousand Oaks, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident I witnessed took place in Thousand Oaks, CA (SE Ventura County) at approximately 0600 – 0615 hours on Tuesday, January 21, 2014.  The weather was cool with a light breeze.  The sky was mostly overcast with some stars visible.  It was still dark.  The moon had set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location was in a shopping center parking lot on Janss Road and N. Moorpark Road, located about 2 miles north of US-101 freeway and about ¾ of a mile west of the CA-23 freeway which runs north and south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 0600 hours, I happened to look up into the eastern sky and saw two lights, one blue and one red, very close together, not moving.  The lights appeared at first glance to be what I thought was a hovering helicopter, from 500-1000 feet off the ground.  The angle of the lights to me was about 60 degrees.  The two lights were bright, clear and distinct.  I would describe them like an LED.  There was only a tiny separation between the two, but it was distinct.  They were separate, but very close together.  I would describe the size of the objects about the size of the planet Venus or maybe a tiny bit smaller.  I could not see any type of aircraft or fuselage or body that they were attached to because of the darkness of the sky.  If I held my thumb up to the sky to cover the object, it would cover the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I was at work at the time, doing security for a construction crew,  I had to get about my business and giving the stationary lights one last glance, I resumed doing my job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later, I happened to glance up to the eastern sky once again, wondering if the two lights I saw were still there.  Indeed they were, but they were moving horizontally across the sky from south to north fairly rapidly at about a 65 degree angle to me.  Then, the lights immediately began to do all sorts of strange things that you would not associate with normal aircraft.  They dove down like a roller coaster and then swooped back up in a sharp climb.  The drop was to about 30 degrees and then back up.  This repeated – down, up, down, up –sharp and fast.  There were other quick motions that I’ve never seen any aircraft do – quick changes of direction on sharp angles, for example.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, all of the movement of the paired lights was done at a high rate of speed.   The object(s) then rose to about 60 degrees and took another sharp, high speed dive and went below my field of vision – the buildings of the shopping center not allowing me to see to the horizon -- and did not return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall, I would describe the general motion of the object(s) or lights if you will, as almost entirely random in direction, moving as I said at a high rate of speed.  Total duration of this portion of the sighting was about 20 seconds.  I had a smartphone with me, but I was too transfixed by the incredible movements of the objects to get it out and start to record it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, during the entire time of the sighting, I heard no noise from the direction of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that this might be a model aircraft, but not hearing any noise at all – along with the lights – eliminated that possibility.  IN FACT, there was a hobby shop in the shopping center that featured remote-piloted model aircraft and I went into the shop and asked the owner of the shop if he knew anyone who’d fly these craft at night.   He said he didn’t know of anyone who would.  Second, I asked him if it was common to put lights on the craft.  He said the craft he sold didn’t have lights attached.  So with these questions and the noise factor, I think I eliminated the possibility that it was a model aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, aircraft do not have red and blue lights.  Or lights that don’t flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously, the object wasn’t a normal airplane with capabilities as we commonly associate with them nor was it a helicopter either.  Because of the description of the flight of the paired lights and that I was not able to see a body, fuselage or anything else that the lights were physically attached to, moving in the manner that they did,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided that I had seen what could be described as a UFO and made this report.<n>

I am an avid night sky watcher (meteor showers, planet conjunctions, satellites spotting, comets, I.S.S. passings, etc.), so I am quite familiar with &#34;normal&#34; night sky sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of January 20th 2014, I saw something I&#39;ve never seen before.  As I was walking out the back door of my workplace to smoke a cigarette at 11:25pm EST, I first noticed the moon about 25 degrees off the horizon straight in front of me. It was the first clear night we&#39;ve had in at least a week.  As I was looking at the moon a bright light traveling northeast caught my eye.  This light was traveling pretty much in the same location from my vantage point as the moon so it was easy to see.  My first initial thought was that this bright light was the I.S.S., so I ran to my truck 10 feet away and grabbed my binoculars to look at it.  I put my elbows up on my truck so I was steady and found this bright light through my binoculars.  What I saw as one solid bright white light with naked eye turned out to be a triangle shaped UFO, with 3 lights. I could not believe what I was seeing.  I watched it for 30-40 seconds as it traveled away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The details of this object: the front light of the triangle was a huge solid white light. It did not change color or blink.  The back 2 light were the same size but were flashing at random it seems from, white/red/blue.  The elevation was probably a little higher than normal helicopter traffic.  Although, since it was dark it was hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this thing clear as can be through those lenses. I&#39;m not particularly happy I saw, everyone I&#39;ve told has laughed at me, thought I was joking around, or just don&#39;t believe me.  But, I stand by my story, I know what I saw.<n>

Moments later it would reappear in the opposite side of the tree line and accelerate rapidly across the southern sky and disappear.  I also witnessed the same object on approximately 1/13/14, repeated rising and dropping, only to disappear.  On each occasion went outside, no engine noise to be heard.<n>

He stated that it went low right over the house and when I arrived outside I saw it was reddish yellow in color.  Nothing distinctive in shape, other than round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother also witnessed it and we called out to each other what are we seeing and yes fireball like object in South Eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It headed S.E.and faded out of our line of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and my mother went back inside our home and again,my brother called  and we witnessed a second fireball like object, and did the same as first, it faded out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother then called my aunt that lives near Stinsonfield Airport on the Southern part of Bexar County.  She too witnessed the 2 objects and stated over the phone that they were now side by side.<n>
1/20/14 20:00|Wappapello|MO|Light|~3+ hours|Bright orange Lights/Fireballs.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107522.html|233|ndxe201401| Bright orange Lights/Fireballs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much like the events that I have read about the other sightings of lights, or fireballs, these lights that we had anticipated watching were suppose to be methane gas bubbles rising from the earth/swamp near Lake Wappapello.  These lights lit up within five feet near the edge of a wooded area and approximately five to ten feet from one another.  There were three that began as multicolored, red, blue, orange and white.  The first one danced out into a nearby field and faded dimly after lighting up bright orange.  Minutes later the other two repeated nearly the same actions only to fade out and completely disappear.  The first light lit back up-approximately ten feet from the ground-back to a beautiful bright orange, and danced around in the field for what seemed like minutes.  We ruled out the possibility of these lights being methane gas (bubbles) because they never ascended more than fifteen feet off of the ground below it.  The light blinked back out once more, li! t back up bright orange and with almost lightning speed flew out into the road in front of us a mile to a mile and a half away.  It stopped and sat there hovered over the roadway for some time and then sped off quickly to our right out into what appeared to be another field.  As we hurried away the light appeared again down a dirt road to out right, but seemed as if it were following us. It then danced out beside our vehicle once more, (bouncing almost gracefully) into the empty field, keeping up with our speed of a minimum of 40 mph to finally dim and disappear one last time.  We observed these lights for what felt like an hour.  We arrived at the area just after dark around 6:30-7:00 pm the night of the 20th. We headed straight home (a 45 minute drive), not paying attention to the time until around 1:00 am the next morning when we were nearly home.  We seemed to have lost time during this event.<n>

They were in a triangle formation.  There was another light that was out to the side a short distance from the triangle.  It was bright white and gone almost as fast as we saw it.  The white light and one of the orange lights disappeared as quick as if someone turned off a light switch.  The second lightt slowly faded away as did the third light about 10 seconds after the second.  My fiance tried to take a picture but his camera wouldnt focus for some reason...which is odd because he has a very nice camera on his phone.<n>

Two bright lights, slowly traveling across the sky, but no flashing light.  They seemed to be more like headlights of a car.  I kept my eyes on the lights as it soared closer to the road I was driving on.  Right when we would have crossed paths, the lights faded out quickly and was no where in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was a plane that shut the lights off, I would have seen the silhouette of it.  There was just a enough sunlight in the sky to allow me to see if there was indeed an object (like a plane) containing these lights.  The problem is, the lights simply disappeared and there was no object behind the lights. . .<n>

For orientation, my position would have put the Statue of Liberty to the southwest at approximately my 8:00.  From my perspective (about 15 feet elevated from ground level) the helicopters were at 30-40 degrees off horizon.  I thought the behavior of the helicopters odd, and wanted to video it, but managed only to get a series of photographs them (on a Droid Razr phone).  In reviewing the photos, I found one photo shows what appeared to be a cylindrical object, at a slight cant, reflecting light with a glassy aspect, in the vicinity of the helicopters.

I asked &#34;Yo, Don what are you trippin on?&#34;  He replied that he was watching a plane pass up in the sky when he noticed a fixed object (not moving) in the background of passing plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I at first thought ok your full of crap but I will look.  As my eyes stared and adjusted to the daylight it took a moment aprox. 2-3min before sure enough plain as day with the naked eye I could see what to me looked like maybe a high altitude weather ballon or possibly a planet being able to be viewed during the day if that where possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For at least 5 min I stared at the said object with my friend.  He asked if I had binoculars handy and I did.  I then walked to my trailer and was able to zoom into the object for a better look, what I saw I can only say I dont know what it was but what I thought would be a white object was actually one very bright light then turning to two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It in my estimate was higher than any commercial airliner and seemed to not move except at one point it seeemed to drop closer to us.  What was even more bizarre was that higher above the said object there to me appeared to be a circular shadow.  We viewed the primary object plain as day for aprox 15-20 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the experience was near over my friend was looking through the binoculars and I with the naked eye.  To me in a fraction of a second it vanished.  Now although the circular shadow was not visible to the naked eye I did see it faintly before the light was gone.  Like I said, to me looked it had the appearance of a far distant planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not think at all what I saw was light coming from something.  As I viewed the one light became two lights.  Looking through binoculars my friend saw the said object split into three and vanished I can say I for one did not see that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was  Jan. 20th 2014 at 4:43pm.  El Cajon, California<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,  Sorry it has taken me a bit to get back to you, consequently I have been a bit busy lately. As for your question I can say in great confidence that over 17 years as a sport boat captain I know good and bad quality when it comes to binoculars I had a pair of expensive Minolta binoculars I used that day with a special rubber end cover that blocks out even the smallest amount of light that may enter through the sides when viewing. The reason I know the light changed from one to two then three was to me it looked to be pivoting or slowly spinning around in it&#39;s stationary spot. So what my grasp of it is that whatever it was it was rotating in a way that aloud me to see it like a car rounding a turn and you see the first headlight and as it completes the turn the second headlight comes into your view. I hope this analogy helps you a bit.  Like I mentioned before I have seen a lot of stuff in my time yet I can&#39;t for the life of me explain exactly what it was. I do appreciate you listening since nobody else does. I am an upstanding citizen with a perfect driving record I have never been known to be a fabricator of crazy stories I look at everything with an unbiased mind my reputation with friends is my honesty and trust I have built with many.  I look forward to any questions or insight you may have for me.  Thank you again and have a great day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

At first there were 6 lights and they were in a line, moving, but not moving in a straight line. they looked like they were almost dancing around. the size of these lights was much bigger than the stars, much more visible. i pulled over on the side of the road, and 2 more lights came out of the end making it now 8 lights. just jumping around almost in this almost straight line shaped formation. one second i looked at my phone to see the time and i looked back up and they were completely gone...no where in sight. to be honest i got the fuck out of there because i was, and like i said still am very startled about it..<n>

It was an opaque dark gray to black undulating bubble, like a soap bubble, and at the side opposing each other were two hoola hoop type rings, standing vertical with multi coloured lights spinning around in the canter of the hoops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other structures to see, the rings we not attached to the bubble and the bubble was undulating just like a real soap bubble,  You could say it also looked like a dark cloud undulating between to rings.<n>

However these weren&#39;t red, they changed from yellow to orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 10 seconds after the triangle formation, the remaining lights seemed to extinguish at slightly different times.<n>

When I reached  back of the driveway it was gone.  There was no prints in the snow from any animal or human or at all! I proceeded inside to ask my husband if our son had just came home.  He said no and asked who just went running through the yard.  He saw it too! It was whitish grey in colour the size of a teenager.  As soon as I pulled into the driveway it was like I startled it and it took off running, but left no prints in the snow!!  My cat went outside after and was acting strange running around in circles and being very hyper..not usually like that.<n>

They moved slowly west, and disappeared one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, just like gigantic Roman Candles, three more red spheres shot up in an instant, and stopped at what appeared to be around 4 or 5,000 feet. They also hovered in random patterns and disappeared.  This same action continued for at least 5 minutes.  I recorded as much as I could on my phone.  Did anyone else see this?<n>

The camera used is a Sony NEX6 16mp with a 50mm lens that has a crop factor of 1.5X.  Thus the lens is really 75mm. I shot the picture with an apeture of f8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below are highlights of my observation:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  A previous shot taken at 17:05:50 does not have the object; neither does a shot right after at 17:06:01...so it appears the object covered almost 3/4 through the view in 4 seconds or less and disappeared from the view in 7 seconds or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  The object in sight seems to be much larger than the boat shown in the picture to bottom left of the rainbow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  I did not hear any loud jet/helicopter sound, noise nor see it while taking pictures. I only noticed afterward while reviewing the pictures that night (last night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  I took the shots on the ridge above the famous Hanauma Bay, Oahu Hawaii. The area on Google Map is Portlock Hawaii.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.

It was 4:47AM and I went outside to our picnic table and was looking around the sky and noticed this light in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was not a star or planet, as I&#39;m a amateur astronomer.  I watched the light which was white in color and then noticed it slowly disappeared, it then came back for about 15-20 seconds and disappeared.  At that point I ran back into my home and got my video camera and tripod.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I videotaped the object and for about 27 minutes.  During this time the object I believe may have landed, but I&#39;m not sure.  I do know that there was something on the ground that was flashing in a consistent manner, it was something that was not there when I first started looking at the sky as there was nothing flashing before I noticed the light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never experienced anything like this before, but I do go out there nightly because this area off highway 87 has strange things in the sky so I make it a point to try and find something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One important thing of note is that I copied this video to post on YouTube.com, but what&#39;s strange is that the audio is choppy.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with this camera, but if you watch the video at the end you can see a daylight shot which I took at 7AM in which my dog is in it and you can hear me speak normally.  I think that the object I was video taping was actually interfering with the camera.  Here is the YouTube link:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XVmSmEzi8RI<n>

I had driven my automobile out of  Kirksville, Missouri, going east in the Northeast part of state.  I have driven this stretch of highway hundreds of times so am familiar with the rather flat landscape straight back in to town now coming west back into town about 4 to 5 miles, with clear view ahead with very little traffic so hardly any distraction of oncoming headlight to deal with.  This is a very rural part of State.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m driving noticing   some red lights coming toward me way off ahead of me in the sky.  I didn’t really think too much about it since on occasion there is a helicopter or small airplane [like Lifeflight or private airplane seen sometimes].  So I kept thinking okay as It gets closer I will know and recognize what these lights are,  It was getting close so I glanced up at it through my windshield and side glass and realized suddenly that I didn’t know what this craft was, so I slowed vehicle to a crawl and then off on the shoulder of highway rolled my window down, now with my head out the window to get a better view, it<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sirs or whom this might concern, was almost  directly over me just a little to the right and moving east, there was a clear view of what appeared to be something that had a honeycomb shaped  intricate like metal  frame structure with about 6 or seven main beams running from the center out to perimeter while it appeared that the honeycomb shaped reinforcement appeared to be somewhat more recessed then the main beams.  On the main beams were red lights spaced out along the main beams but’ bright enough that the bottom of this thing was very visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now what sent me in to a state of temporary shock [almost froze with disbelieve as to what I was watching] it suddenly occurred what was missing was any sound, this was huge and moving silently practically over me and I was peering straight up, looking at the bottom of this thing!  The red light which to the best of my knowledge were like 4 to 5 spaced along each of the main outward beams and it seems some were blinking very slow like fading and then becoming bright again in some sort of sequence.  I sat there for about 5 minutes watching this move off to the east, still moving at a very slow rate of speed [too slow to register as anything that I had ever seen before] I don’t know if this sounds familiar or not but I know what I saw and waited to see if any news of anyone in the area reporting of seeing such a thing in the sky that night, have not heard a word or report of anyone else having seen it,  I guess if anyone else saw it they night know who to tell either!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

January 18, 2014 at 2150 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife first witnessed the object from our deck, just outside the laundry room where I was folding clothes.  She called for me to come outside quick.  She pointed at the sky and I looked almost directly overhead and saw what looked like a meteor or something falling from the sky on fire.  It looked like a Bright fire bal, but it never diminished and kept moving at a constant speed from north to south across the sky.  After about 8 to 10 seconds another silent bright orange round object came overhead going in the exact same direction at the same speed as the first.  After another 8 to 10 seconds a third object just like the others followed behind the others.  They had to be several miles apart, but appeared to be forming a triangle shape as they moved away from us to the south.  After a 10 to 12 second interval a fourth object followed the same path then another for a total of five objects.   They were all visible for a good 30 to 40 seconds before they disappeared behind a tree line.  The entire event lasted between a minute and a half to 2 minutes.  Everyone in the house was able to see them (2 children 3 adults).  They didn’t appear to be at a very high altitude (between 5 and 10 thousand feet).<n>

She grabbed my arm and asked, if I see that, looked up skeptical and focused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  The ship or whatever it was, was slowly flying hidden right out in the open.  Somehow it used a cloaking device that showed the stars and sky above it was underneath it.  This thing was the size over a football field, like an aircraft carrier flying in the wide open sky undetected.  A silhouette of this thing in the sky.  If my girlfriend wouldn&#39;t of been staring at the stars, I&#39;d missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I missed the front details, but I seen the sides and the rear of it.  It kind of was shaped like a broken knife blade.  The rear was triangular and had 3 big rings appearing to be a propulsion system.  Flew over slowly about 10 minutes until it flew out of sight. It was troubling seeing something so massive being hidden in our country our world.  No stories of anything, almost.....my girl and i seen through their invisible cloak.  I have no idea what they are doing, why the secrecy?  Are they just observing and friendly or hostile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been secretly watched throughout time, but not always secrectly.  Ancient gods &amp; angels I believe was aliens.  This UFO was massive and flew over a city pretty much undetected.<n>

Helo on its tale, then craft disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 19:15, I observed a horizontal bar with two large circular white lights coming out of the North, near Newark Airport heading south. Immediately struck with the irregular lights (non-standard Commercial Aviation lights) which are typical for this heavy commercial airspace.  Just 2 very large white round lights at end of the ‘bar’ which was black and had no other lights or markings.  When first observed, I estimate this craft was over South west of Newark Air/Linden NJ.  This craft was ascending at a fast speed. Faster than normal ascending speed of Commercial air craft.  As the craft come closer to my position, I could see the outline of a black triangle shape, but did not see the same large round white light on the tail of the triangle.  As I tried to view the tail, suddenly a Helicopter appeared directly behind it traveling and escalating in the same direction.  This Helo had red law enforcement lights.  Also noted, the direction of this craft was opposite of what Newark Commercial Flights were using this evening.  Flights were taking off in the South East then banking either west or north.  This craft was coming out of the North at a low altitude.  Such a flight plan is never used at Newark and dangerous to other ascending flights.  As this triangle began to approach my position/home, I could see the vast width, craft was pure black with no apparent cabin, no sound.  This width exceeded any commercial airliner I have ever seen.  Flying low about 100-200 feet above with just the two white lights at each end of the triangle point.  The Helo remained on its tail.  Then the triangle completely disappeared just before the craft flew over my home.  I ran outside and looked in the sky 360 degrees and could not see this Triangle.  However the Helo remained on the original course of the triangle, went over my home and continued South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen such large white lights on a aviation craft before.  Hard to estimate or calculate the size of the lights.<n>

Strong sulfur smell at Walmart, enough to cover mouth/nose.  Other people in parking lot didn&#39;t seem to notice. Start driving home.  We noticed this craft, some what round, other person thought it was a helicopter for a little while until it moved fast! It was probably 70ft in the air then headed away from our car and over this huge hill that was a good 2 minute drive away in a few seconds.  The actual ufo was brightly colored.  It had orange, red, white and green.  I remember orange the most.  No lights blinked.  I tried to record it on my phone but I couldn&#39;t get any resolution to actually see the craft.  So we get home and maybe 1 minute later a helicopter zooms by, I heard the first one and while I was looking up any local ufo sightings.  I then heard a second helicopter and ran out front to see where it was heading.  The second helicopter was solid black with some dull green lights on the bottom.  Turns out!  Both copters were heading the same direction as the colorful craft,  I mean directly where the colorful thing went.  The black helicopter was only 40-50ft above my head when I saw it.  I&#39;m thinking military as far as style goes.  I couldn&#39;t tell what the other copter looked like.<n>

The speed at which it moved and change direction indicated that it was not an airplane or helicopter.  It was moving north to south then dipped quickly out of sight.  It made no noise and reappeared moving slowly, the bright green light turned to red then to a white light, it then quickly dipped down again out of sight.  I have a science background and am very analytical, but I can&#39;t explain what it was that I was seeing.<n>

As i&#39;m filing this report at 1:30 am there is still one bright light hovering around over 235 and west st.  It&#39;s just above the cloud cover but is so bright it remains visible even when clouds pass under it.  We live by Mid Continent so i see planes take off and land all the time at night so I&#39;m positive these are not any kind of aircraft I have seen before.  They moved around and stopped regularly.  Looked like bright white stars but it became obvious that these were not stars when they started to move.  There were no planes in the sky at all at the time I witnessed these lights.  I have always been a skeptic but this was easily convincing.<n>

1/17/14 21:15|Muscat (Sultanate of Oman)||Cigar|10-15 seconds|Individually technologically explainable, except speed and collectively improbable.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106530.html|306|ndxe201401| Individually technologically explainable, except speed and collectively improbable<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday the 17th of January, 2014, at approximately 21.15 hours I was sat on the step at the front door of my home in Muscat, the Sultanate of Oman and witnessed two unidentified flying objects to the north-west over an area known locally as Seeb.  The first object had a line of seven bright greenish-white lights.  The object hovered for a moment before descending vertically, it then elevated vertically before moving south-west at extraordinary high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later a second object was clearly visible in the same location with a line of seven bright lights, this time reddish-white in colour.  This object hovered maintaining its altitude for a few moments before moving north at extraordinary high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impressions were that the two objects had emerged from a larger airborne vehicle, that was not illuminated and not visible.  As the lights of both objects were equally spaced and of the same intensity of brightness, I concluded that they were on a level surface not round.  If the lights had been on anything other than a level surface the lights would not have appeared equally spaced and not of the same intensity of brightness as they would have been angled in different directions.  The speed at which the two objects moved did not give the impression of acceleration, but that they both moved from stationary to terminal velocity instantaneously.  The extraordinary high speed at which the objects moved from stationary to terminal velocity, was such that it is improbable that a life form could withstand the exceptional gravitational forces exerted.  I therefore concluded that the objects were remotely controlled.  Finally it was a quiet evening and whilst I live in close proximity to Muscat International airport there was no sound emitted from the two objects and no other aircraft or helicopters in the vicinity at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The practice of using larger airborne vehicles to transport smaller airborne vehicles has been in use for decades by NASA in moving space shuttles between landing and launch sites.  The technology for an airborne object to descend and elevate vertically has existed since the inception of helicopters, likewise the technology for fixed wing aircraft, such as the Harrier vertical take-off and landing has also existed for decades.  The technology to control an airborne object remotely has existed for decades in the form of remote controlled model aircraft.  More recently pilotless drones operating in Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Yemen, but controlled from a location in the United States of America, illustrates how technology has advanced.  The speed and manoeuvrability of modern fighter jets illustrates that material and airframe design technology exists that will withstand extreme gravitational forces without compromising the structural integrity or functionality of the aircraft.  Individually all of the phenomena witnessed are explainable, except for the extraordinary high speed at which they moved from rest, without appearing to accelerate and without emitting any sound.  I am not aware of any method of propulsion that will propel a stationary airborne object to terminal velocity, instantaneously and more significantly, silently.<n>

It was bright enough that I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane or a star.  It floated there for about a minute before slowly moving across the sky towards RDU.  It didn&#39;t get smaller or bigger. And kept steady speed while moving.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane before A.  Planes don&#39;t float in mid-air, B. planes and helicopters don&#39;t have lights that stay on at all times.

The object started to cross in front of me over the freeway when I noticed a puff of smoke and it disappeared.  I continued to look for the object when I noticed another one going along the i10 freeway also, following the same path as the other, and as it crossed the freeway in front of me,  I saw a puff of smoke again and the object disappeared as the other one.  Their was another car load of people looking up in the same area and pointing toward the area the object disappeared so I know it&#39;s been seen by others.  I have never seen anything like it.<n>

1/17/14 06:45|Maricopa|AZ|Sphere|30 minutes|2 bright pulsating stars and three orange orbs.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106394.html|319|ndxe201401| 2 bright pulsating stars and three orange orbs<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this classifies as one sighting or multiple sightings so I will enter everything in this report.  On today&#39;s date Jan 17, 2014.  I left with my son to drop him off at his high school at 6:50AM Arizona time.  We live in a small town about 20 miles south of Phoenix.  As I was heading east on my street I noticed what appeared to be an extremely bright and larger then normal star at about 30 degrees off my horizon.  It appeared to be pulsating. I take my son each morning to school at this time so it was different from what I normally see.  The sun was still about 30 minutes from rising so still dark out.  As I was driving on highway 347 going south to his school I noticed a second really bright large star to the east. It appeared to be about 30 degrees off the horizon as well.  I could see both bright stars.   The one I saw earlier was at a bearing of about 45 degrees and looked like it was towards the superstition mountains which as the crow flies would be about 40 miles from me.  The other bright star light was about at a bearing of 105 degrees.  I dropped my son off at the back of his school by the gym which is the west side of the school and went out to the street that run east.  I know longer saw the second bright star that was at a bearing of 105 degrees but I could still see the first star that was at a bearing of 45 degrees.  It was still pulsating between bright and slightly less bright.  As I am sitting about 5 cars back at the light on W. Honeycutt Ave. and highway 347 by his school facing due east watching this star it suddenly got really bright for about a second then it just completely disappeared.  This was at about 7:11 AM according to my Jeep clock.  I was searching the skies to see if it had moved and when I was looking at the area where the second star had been to see if it might have come back instead I saw what appeared to be three orange orbs at about the same bearing 105 degrees where the bright star light was a! few minutes earlier.  Two were at about the same height of aro! und 20 d egrees off the horizon and one was about 2 degrees lower.  At this point I wanted to try and get a picture of them so I drove to an open farmers field about a mile south of where I was and parked by a school bus whose driver was waiting I suppose to start his middle school run.  I was on the eastside of highway 347 on the southside of Ferrel road looking at the three orange orbs that appeared to be 15-20 miles away at a bearing of 105 degrees.  I took about four pictures with my iphone but the distance was too far away for me to see them on my phone.  The orbs appeared to me slowly going south as I was using a telephone pole i the distance to see it was moving towards it.  This was about 7:13am Arizona time.  I don&#39;t know if the school bus driver saw the orange orbs as he was facing due east on the side of the road but he left after a few minutes.  As far as distance from me to the orange orbs I am guessing about 15 miles as it appeared to be somewhere by the city of Casa Grande an! d maybe the I-10 area.  It seems like highway 84 going east to Casa Grande would have taken you right into the orbs from my perspective.  After the last orb went out about 10 seconds later in the same area I saw a dark colored plane.  I couldn&#39;t tell what type it was and assume it was a plane.  It flew about as slow as a Cessna in a southern direction and then just disappeared after about 10 seconds. I don&#39;t know if that was just due to changing direction and angle thus not being able to see it anymore or if it actually just disappeared.  Was very strange.I know from now on when I take my son to school I am going to make sure I have my hand held video camera with me as then I could have zoomed in on the objects.  I am listing myself as the only witness but my son saw both stars as well as we commented on how bright they were compared to normal.  He did not see the orange orbs.  I am going to send the pictures I took on my iphone to my brother as he might be able to enhance the pictures better to see if you can see anything.  I couldn&#39;t see the! orbs on them due to dusk was occurring at the time of the orbs so they were right in the middle of dusk and a great distance away.  I haven&#39;t looked at the video I took yet as I have to download it from my phone.  If anything is worth posting I will make an additional report and add it.  Thanks.<n>

Saw a Light in the Sky that looked like any other Star up there, but it was moving West to East, coming my  way...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was way up there, High in the Atmosphere or possibly Outside of the Atmosphere, same size as any Star...<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about a 60 Degree angle this thing slowed down and began moving irradically, almost like Fly that is walking on a Window Pane...  At one point in time it dimmed down to where you couldn&#39;t even see it, but I kept my Eyes on that same place in the sky, and it finally Brightened up and began  moving again…  Moving a little forward, then a little to the Left, and a little to the Right, and then maybe Stopping again???<n> <n><n> <n><n> And it wasn&#39;t a Helicopter, because as I said, this thing was at the Very edge of the Atmosphere , or &#34;out in space&#34;!  It would move Forward, then Stop...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Move to the Left and then to the Right, go Up and then Down or Forward, and then Brighten up and Dim down... Very weird and Irradic behavior...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 7 to 10 Minutes, and it was about Shooting Time for Ducks, so I took my Eyes off of it to watch for Ducks, and when I tried to find it again in the Sky, I couldn&#39;t see it anymore...<n> <n><n> <n><n> * This thing was NOT an Airplane !... It could move any Direction (Up, Down, and Sideways)... If a Helicopter or Hover-Craft could fly outside the Atmosphere, and had a Bright White Light on it, that&#39;s what it would look like... &#34;Like a STAR that could Fly&#34;... I&#39;ve been Duck Hunting for over 50 Years, and I&#39;ve always watched the Heavens, thinking I&#39;d see something up there that I couldn&#39;t Explain one day, and it has Happened !!!  I&#39;ve never seen anything like that it in my Life !<n>

Then when I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was I ran to get my friend who was in the backroom.  I yelled for her to come and look at the objects.  She thought I was playing, but little did she know I was serious!  So she came and looked at the objects and we were scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I quickly came up with the idea to video the strange objects hovering over some trees across the street from the house.  Almost two minutes while recording, one of the flying objects flew away very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a minute later, the other one followed.  My friend and i just stood in awe.  We were satisfied with the video.  And that led me here!!<n>

There was no center light, but there was a dark, cloud-like misting that could be seen when the lights were bright.  We only saw them for a few seconds, and could not find them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My peripheral vision caught a light source higher and slightly north.  My initial thought was that it was Jupiter.  However, when I viewed it through the binocs, it turned out to be one of the mysterious red, blue, green flashing light objects that my husband and I have been seeing frequently since we moved from CT to PA 5 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time was different though.  Around the outside of the multi-colored flashing light area, smaller bright white pinpoints of light would flash for 1 to 2 seconds at randomly dispersed places and distances, but never too far away, from the central lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not discern any shape.  I wanted to use my telescope and quickly opened a more advantageous window shade.  It was gone, leaving only the perfectly round white light of Jupiter further to the south and, of coarse, the moon.  It seems every time I try to get out my scope, it goes away.<n>

The were evenly spaced and moving at the exact same speed.  The second light looked like it could have been a commercial craft, but that doesn&#39;t explain the one in front of it and the three behind it.  For a sense of scale, if the second craft was the size of a commercial aircraft, then they were each about a football field apart.  All of the other lights were too small to be a commercial craft.  They did blink red.<n>

I always look to the stars.  I noticed a bright orange &#34;star&#34; or a planet south west to a bright blue star that i look at every night.  Then i realized it was twinkling, planets don&#39;t twinkle (to my knowledge).  So i kept watching it, seemed to get brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i put out my cigarette I looked back again to notice it was now almost parallel to the blue star.  I tell my boys to come look, at this point it was very obvious it was moving, looked to be moving straight upand getting faster, passed the star and went into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No strobe lights like aircraft would have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And best way to describe color is fire orange.<n>

Some where a pulsing red light, somewhere pulsing green light, and some where a less bright white pulsing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all took off in different drections some faster then others.

The initial formation when we saw them was like the big dipper, with a hooked tail on the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, while driving, I thought it was the big dipper, but it was too low.  They slowly moved away from each other and disappeared.  There were no blinking lights, or white lights eminating from the yellow/orange lights.  It was a clear night with good visibility and when the lights moved away from each other, the light just faded away.

Then the lights one by one turned to red and they moved in formation to the West and went lower in altitude and hovered in a horizontal line formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were hovering very low, and I rolled down the window and they were close enough that I could see the bottom of a triangular craft each with one bright white light and a red light.  They were very quiet, but I could hear a dull vibration sound that seemed to be coming from the objects.  The objects moved away after a few minutes and began to synchronize red lights one after another.  In about 2 minutes they moved away and out of sight.<n>

W|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106419.html|340|ndxe201401| My mother and I were traveling South on Bicentennial, when we got to the stoplight of Dove and Bicentennial at approximately 18:15.  We got a red light, so naturally I was looking at the sunset in the WSW when something caught my eye.  I saw a teardrop-shaped object just above and to the right of where the sun was setting.  We turned right on Dove Street and were heading West to the intersection of N 23rd St.  I was able to see the object from when we turned right on Dove, up until the intersection of N 23rd St when I lost it behind the buildings and tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a meteor falling, but I wasn&#39;t quite sure. It was a fairly big streak, and was glowing orange. I assumed the sunset was making the object appear orange in color. It almost resembled a fireball. It was moving fast, and I thought that maybe it was a plane flying into Mexico; but I haven&#39;t been able to find flight records for 01/16/2014 to indicate a flight route that far West. I also couldn&#39;t see a metallic gleam that would resemble a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I tried to call the non-emergency line of the police department to inquire about the object, but we couldn&#39;t get through.  I didnt get to catch the local news, but I do follow them online and there were no online reports of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know there are daily flights from other cities up North (Austin, San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas). However, I&#39;ve always seen them fly straight above McAllen, or just off the center to the right. I&#39;ve never seen one flying near the horizon, but I could always be wrong. I was very curious about it, because it seemed be coming in slow and then picked up speed. Whatever it was, I assume it was heading towards Mexico.  I also couldn&#39;t find any information online about any meteors falling in my area of Texas, or Northern Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came across your website online, and decided to submit my sighting to you.  If you can please help me figure out what it was that my mother and I saw, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much for your time!  Have a great day!<n>

After about five seconds, it flashed a brilliant white (I initially thought it exploded) and climbed to the north at very high rate of speed, being visible for only another 15 seconds.  As it moved away, the light began to appear more bluish green with distance.<n>

I became aware of what I believe was a white light flashing onto my body; since car headlights sometimes reflect into the house and there was a car on the road outside, I thought that&#39;s what the light was.  However, this light was flashing, and when the car had gone, the light remained, flashing.  The duration of this was just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My memory of the transition from the white light to the colored lights isn&#39;t clear, but the white light seemed to be gone; I now noticed a red/blue flashing light.  My first thought was that a State trooper had stopped a driver at the bottom of the hill on which my house sits; however, when I sat up, I realized that the road was empty, and the lights were in the distance - above the ridgeline.  I watched for a few seconds, and the lights just appeared to go out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must preface my description by stating that I am very nearsighted and, of course, was not wearing glasses or contacts in bed.  Anything I see without vision correction is blurred, appearing larger than it actually is.  That being said, the lights still appeared quite large.  They were in approximately the same position, for me, as the rising sun.  I&#39;ve seen the sun rise without my contacts, and these lights appeared larger than the sun.  What I saw was a large, circular light display, apparently composed of many smaller lights.  The flashed in unison from red to blue and back; that is what made me think of flashing police lights.  I live on a hill with a fair view to the East, and it occurred to me that a police car stopped with flashing lights on the distant hill might be seen from my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the morning, with my contacts in, I lay in bed in the same position; it then seemed unlikely that I&#39;d seen flashing police lights.  The lights I saw really appear to have been in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About me: I am a 68-year-old woman, college educated.  I have never made a report such as this before.  I have tried to find another explanation for the lights I saw, but I cannot; they are a mystery to me.<n>

I have a love for star gazing and we often look for planets and constellations went we are outside with our dogs at night.  This is exactly what we were doing on the night of January 15, 2014.  We live near a small airport and are accustomed to seeing them flying at all hours.  (Also, my brother is in the airforce so I feel very confident in what different aircrafts look like).  But what we saw was so unlike any plane I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first just saw a very bright light on the horizon, moving slowly upward. I had already found the north star so I knew it wasn&#39;t that.  I thought maybe it could be a launching of a space craft in FL, but decided in North Georgia we were probably too far to see it with a naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it we noticed it wasn&#39;t going up, it was moving in our direction. When it got closer we realized the bright light was a spotlight in the very front of the aircraft and could see the beam spanning out in front of it.  When it flew overhead, it made no noise, and was flying helicopter low.  (We can hear the planes when they fly over us even though they are much higher in the sky.)  The underneath of the aircraft is what really shook us. It looked like a carnival ride.  There were so many lights.  The whole underside was filled with them.  Some where white, and they didn&#39;t blink or change, but the other ones did. One minute they were red then blue, or orange, or green.  In no particular pattern! or variation.  They changed at different times, with no set time in between.  The white lights were always white, but the colored lights changed so drastically and were never in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so bizarre.  Our phones were in the house and we even talked about one of us running in to get to get one so that we could try to film it, but neither of us wanted to miss it. It was extraordinary.  The whole thing was probably around 15 or 20 minutes.  It was flying very slow and every low for how big it was.  It was V-shaped, almost like a fighter jet, but not quite.  The aircraft itself was had to make out the exact shape because it was black against the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never had a UFO encounter before and didn&#39;t really know what to do about it, if anything.  I am definitely not saying it&#39;s aliens!  I want that to be very clear.  (There is no real evidence that they even exist and without hard evidence I am still skeptical.)  I&#39;m just saying that I could not identify it and it was like nothing I have ever seen or heard of.  I still think about it often and every now and then I will do some googleing to see if I can find a known, man made aircraft that it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is actually how I came across this website (http://patch.com/georgia/barrow/ufos-sighted-near-winder) of people in my area who saw what sounds to be the same thing - a relief for me because I know how crazy it sounds.  And I also found your website in my latest googleing fiasco, so I thought I would tell you all my story to see if maybe you would be able to help answer what my husband and I saw that night and put our minds at ease.<n>

1/15/14 20:30|Dacula/Auburn|GA|Unknown|7 minutes|Long string of red pulsating sequential lights moving in a northerly direction.|1/16/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106339.html|353|ndxe201401| Long string of red pulsating sequential lights moving in a northerly direction<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home down a dark back road.  For some reason I looked up to my left and I saw a HUGE formation of red lights in a long line.  There were at least 10-15 lights in a row dimly pulsating but sequentially.  When I spotted it I immediately said &#34;what the HELL is that&#34; and I never say hell in front of my kids.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately I thought...&#34;wait, it has to be a string of lights over a  production plant or something&#34; because there were several in the area.  Or maybe part of a tower even though they were horizontal.  So I thought maybe they were on the top of a very tall fence or strung across something.  It looked pretty close and low like maybe a half mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went down a hill, it went behind the trees and when I popped up it had moved.  This continued and I continued watching it move steadily across in front of me and eventually continue on to my right. I was travelling due West and it went from south to north so now I knew it was not stationary lights.  During this time, I could see it in relation to several planes flying overhead and could tell it was much further out then they were, therefore, further than I had thought in the first place.  It wasn&#39;t in outer space.  It as within the radar airspace, but higher than a fixed engine would fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving so I couldn&#39;t count the lights and study it for long periods of time.  I had to keep looking at the road so I wouldn&#39;t wreck and I didn&#39;t want to pull over on a narrow shoulder on this dark road.  I noticed that it looked like it was in fog because the lights were hazy and would look as if they would just dim out any minute as they were pulsating so I thought the sky must be hazy but after I got to where I could no longer see it,.  Looked up and noticed that all the planes and stars were very bright.  The sky was crystal clear with a very bright moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was either a formation of many crafts or it was one HUGE craft that had lights outlining it.  I got the impression that it was probably a massive craft with lights on it because there was also a light in front of it and also because the lights stayed in such a perfect straight line.  It moved very very slowly and if it was so far away that it looked hazy and slow, then that means it was far bigger than I thought.  Just one light was the size of the planes in the sky maybe little smaller so if you can imagine at least 10-15 red lights lined up in a row, that is one big UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even if I had taken a picture, it wouldn’t have turned out because the lights were so dim, not at all bright like the planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 46 and have never seen anything like this. It was totally unfamiliar and unusual.<n>

As I was pulling into my driveway I looked in the southwestern sky and noticed what appeared to be two versions of the planet Mars low in the horizon directly over the tree line.  At first I thought they were planets or stars but their color and proximity to one another was noticeably odd.  I exited my vehicle and as I watching the objects another light appeared directly beside them.  Then another, while the additional lights were appearing I noticed the lights were moving in a linear pattern to the South.  As I noticed the pattern and direction of the lights I went inside and had my wife come outside to see the lights.  By this time there were at least eight reddish colored lights in a linear pattern moving in the same direction.  The formation appeared to be evenly spaced and remained linear.  I estimate there were twelve lights before they disappeared out of view.  They did not! disappear all at once, it was more like a passing object with the first lights leaving our line of sight due to their low appearance in the sky and the topography of the land.  As the sighting came to an end I thought I noticed a shape to a craft, almost as if the lights belonged to one large object.  However, I am not certain that this was the case.<n>

I asked my wife to get the night vision video equipment. I went outside and looked to the north.  The moon was full. Little or no wind. Clear for the most part.  I witnessed an orange sphere that de materialized from sight.  My wife came out and we were both looking north.  I began video taping the event and scanning the northern sky.  We then noticed some bright flashing lights to the north.  Three at first.  Then right behind the three flashing lights, we spotted an orange sphere. It was followed by a smaller red light or sphere.  That was followed by another flashing light.  The flashing lights were noticeably smaller than the larger orange and slightly smaller red spheres.  They were proceeding slowly to the west.  The duration of the event was about 10 and a half minutes of video.  Straight line path.  They flew behind some clouds but I continued the video until they became visible again.  The distance was pretty far, but the o! range sphere was about the size of an aspirin. Clearly round.  Very excited to have it on video at last. We lost sight of the objects due to trees to our west.  If these lights were fixed, the craft was easily in excess of 5 miles in length.  Also, there has been a good amount of military aircraft in the skies this evening. More than usual. The video is about 11 minutes in length, but please watch the whole thing.  It goes behind a cloud for about a minute and a half.  Also, if the six lights are one object, we are talking about an object over 5 miles in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a video link to You Tube that I uploaded today:  http://youtu.be/rNvgg-qPCxw<n>

The object was fairly large and was too long to be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The full moon is out tonight and the whole string of lights would have been approximatly 4-5 full moons wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not going particularly fast.  I saw it along with my boyfriend.  We watched until it disappeared behind the treeline.  No sound was observed, but it appeared to be pretty far away and was roughly in the flight pattern of BHM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was perhaps 2 or 3 cars from the light, waiting on the light to change.  Across 280 I saw what I first assumed was an aircraft moving slowly through the sky…until it stopped moving.  At that point I assumed it was a helicopter, but it moved back in the opposite direction, stopped, then moved forward again.  It was hovering back and forth in a way that is strange, even for a helicopter.  It had a light that pulsed, changed from red to green, (did not blink in a familiar, aircraft pattern).  The pulsing was random.  There may have been a white light as well.  All lights were tightly clustered together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not discern a shape. Just the lights, but I was parked at the traffic light for a good 45 seconds to 1 minute watching it hover above the trees across the busy road (someone else had to have seen it - it was rush hour).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When traffic began to move, I pulled off of the road and looked back  so I could continue to observe it, which I did for another minute or so.  It slowly began to descend below the tree line where I lost sight of it. Total time observing: approximately  1.5- 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My theory is that it was some sort of robotic drone that an engineering student may have been testing from an empty parking lot in Mountain Brook Office Park.  That’s the only “rational” explanation that makes any sense to me at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tend to have a critical eye and I do not jump to conclusions.

While I was watching the helicopter, the sky was clear and blue but I noticed that there was a bright whitish light it looked like an orb with a beam of light or tail coming down from it and when it moved it had a silver metallic shine to it but it didn&#39;t seem to be moving like a normal object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at it for a moment and thought &#34;that is cool someone released a balloon maybe?&#34;  But as I was thinking this a dozen or maybe more white orbs started to appear-they were dimmer than the first one I spotted but were just appearing like a light switch was turning them on one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw this all thoughts of balloons left my head.  I watched these things switch on for about 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got scared and did not see anyone in the parking lot to talk to about what it was so I quickly went inside to make my purchase and clear my head.  I thought when I went back out I could decipher what I was seeing more clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent about a minute inside and when I came back out they had all just disappeared.   My hands were shaking when I got into my car and I quickly tried to google any type of celebration or memorial where balloons were being released but I could not find anything significant happening in our area today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter that was flying by at the time was white with either a black or dark blue bottom like a police helicopter.  I did not see any name on the side of it.  Could it have been dropping something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m just curious if anyone else saw this and new what it was.

My girlfriend is training to become a pilot and remarked that having only the single colored light made it appear to not be a fixed wing aircraft of any sort since it did not have the white strobe light and constant green light that most aircraft possess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be moving slowly in a north-south direction, though at times it appeared to slow to a stop and even slightly adjust course before moving forward once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time this was happening, an emergency helicopter passed overhead (in the opposite direction the UFO was moving) traveling at its normal operating altitude.  This gave us some perspective as to the relative distance the unknown object was both above us and in a distance.  We would estimate the object was in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 feet in altitude, and perhaps some three to six miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching the object as it continued its’ north-south vector for some minute and a half.  Then the object stopped moving forward and hesitated briefly.  I watched as the light appeared to slowly turn on its’ axis so as the bright light was no longer shining in our direction, but now facing due east.  I could still see the light enough to tell that it was now moving forward in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it began traveling in that direction it disappeared within two to three seconds, fading from sight very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I contacted the local airport and was put through to the flight control supervisor on duty.

We thought it to be a meteor but yet found it a little quaint since it sure seemed different than a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then while walking saw another same type of light which then moved over one building and then taking a slight turn (Which was seen) went over a forest and went out of my line of sight but it sure continued moving ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After exactly 10 minutes another same orange light came out from the same place and moved in a path closer to me and my friend ( at one point it as over us) but it took a sharp turn and went in the exact same place where the previous ones went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In another 10 mins we same a triangular craft which had golden-ish lights flashing on 3 directions and again leading to same place where these lights went,<n>

From a distance it was thought to be the lights of a tower of some kind. It had two bright green lights facing downward and one red flashing light.  Getting closer to the object revealed that it was moving.  Once the object was directly above, it seemed to have a long triangular shape to it like the shape of a single wing.  The object was at a very low altitude and had a choppy sound like rotor blades but was not loud like a helicopter.  The size was maybe fifteen to twenty feet in length and appeared to be black in color.  The object was watched for approximately three to five minutes do to the witness driving to his place of employment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness has previously lived next to the Fort Hood Army base for approximately twenty years and witnessed various types of aircraft and never saw one that was similar to this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A possible explanation might be a drone of some sort.  However, a search conducted of drone photos did not reveal anything similar to the object that was observed on this date.<n>

I would akin this to look like an impact flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was drizzling that morning and there was rain in the area but there wasn&#39;t any lightning at all and there wasn&#39;t any thunder after this flash or at all this morning.  I have seen lightning before with no thunder but this was not that.  If I were gonna make an educated guess this looked liked something had entered earth&#39;s atmosphere and impacted but again there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the flash was yellowish in color not like your usual white lightning which also led me to conclude this was not lightning.  I know others had to have seen I t but traffic continued as normal but left me wondering what it could have been.<n>

I was standing on the ground, in my driveway, in a residential area, not in a vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, and the moon was nearly full.  The objects appeared to be stationary in a triangular formation above and on either side of the moon (looking westward).    The UFO in the East was positioned by itself and at a further observed distance from the others.  None of the objects moved initially nor made any detectable sound during approximately 30 minutes of observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately 30 minutes, one of the objects did disappear, silently, from above the tree line and was not observable from my vantage point.

It was very high again a thousand feet maybe several thousand feet going east to west at 10pm and flew west to east after midnight.  The first pass I got one photograph, the second pass I got out there faster and got several pictures.  This has become an annual event and it apparently makes several passes about 1 hour apart, something I had thought previously that I had heard it, but was not sure.  It is interesting that today, I had forgotten the event, and fell asleep at 4pm or just after, I was exhausted and had a dream I was watching a ufo, fly over me....  Was this a message?  I believe contact is coming, they are definitely trying to tell me something, at least I certainly hope ! so, because this makes incident number 16 and 17 I believe since the near landing in 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There us also growing photographic evidence, the digital camera is great!

No sound or running lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange light in skies over Tinley Park.  Light moved from North to south at a seemingly slow rate of speed.  No sound what so ever came from the light.  I am writing this as I have just come inside and trying to remember everything.  Lots of plane activity in skies.  Passed between what I think was Venus and the very bright moon.  Skies are very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NO running lights were visible which is what caught my attention.  I saw a very bright light coming across the sky.  It passed directly over and in front of me.  Almost looked like there were two afterburners on back side but again, no sound at all.  It never changed pace. Thought I would see running lights from the back but nothing.  I followed it until I could no longer see the light. 2-3 mins I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had two dogs out side and no reaction from them as far as I could tell. I first thought the object was very high in the sky because I couldn&#39;t see the running lights.  As it passed over me, I got the feeling it was much lower than I first thought.  I was looking to see if I could make out any kind of wing or fuselage but I could not.  It was clearly a craft of some kind as there was a discernable distance between the initial single light and the back &#34;after burner&#34;lights.  Once past me the single light was gone/blocked and the &#34;after burner&#34; lights appeared.  No flame from them...that was just my impression of what I saw.  Saw 2 lights on back.  These seemed like a softer glowing orange.  The Single light was a brighter yellow/whiteish light.  I went outside at 6:50pm to let my dogs out.<n>

They caught our attention, so we drove in the direction of them, and were on a north/south street (Jackson). There we saw three, bright, round orange balls above us in the sky, moving from south to north.  They looked like they were about the height that a helicopter would fly.  They were a solid, bright orange, with no flickering, and made no sound.  They flew parallel to each other, came lower, then flew apart, went higher, then back together – we thought they might collide, but then they suddenly changed directions and flew off very fast.  One went northwest, one went northeast, and it looked like the third one just went higher in the sky.  There were a lot of trees, so we lost sight of the ones that went northwest and northeast, and the one that went higher in the sky disappeared from our view as w! ell.  We did stop our vehicle and get out, and as the “objects” flew, they were totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 7:05 p.m., and the whole viewing lasted only a couple of minutes.  We didn’t get any photos or videos – we were actually too awe struck watching and trying to figure out what they were, and by the time I was in a position to take a video, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we continued around several blocks to Outer Drive, and headed east.  Over the trees along the south side of Outer Belt Drive, we saw one more bright orange light. It appeared to be somewhat higher than the others we had seen and was moving very fast in a straight line from south to north – I would say it was moving faster than you would see a plane fly.  We didn’t stop that time, as there was no safe place to pull over on the road in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed anything remotely close to this.  I searched online and saw a several videos posted by people who have experienced similar sightings in other parts of the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m positive it was not a plane or helicopter or meteor -- it was something very out of the ordinary.  Drones? UFO’s?  Hard to tell…<n>

What I am sure of is that it was not a normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I are driving back from the gym to see 3 bright lights in the sky.  Also in the sky at varied distances were a multitude of helicopters and aircraft, these 3 lights were much larger and brighter than any other light in the sky.  They were twinkling much as a star would.  But again much larger and brighter than any other star in sight.  They were equally spaced apart all at different altitudes, forming a slanted line if the dots were connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove closer (still far in the distance) the lowest of the lights descended to the horizon line.  As we continued to drive and get a better view, the two lights that remained higher projected smaller lights from them.  The highest one projected a small light that hovered above it, while the second remaining light projected a light that seemed to shoot to the higher light much as a shooting star would.  It is fair to say that my view of the second projected light was obscured.  But I saw the first projection with no obscurity.<n>

Looking toward a swamp in the direction of Lake Congamond, I observed a very bright twinkling light well above ground level and well below the bowl of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was framed between tree branches.  There was a large cracking sound before I noticed the light.

I came into my kitchen a little after 3:00 am to smoke a cigarette.  I was immediately amazed at how bright the moon was, and how clear the sky was.  I was looking out the window through only a screen, and immediately noticed a twinkling light in the low western sky.  I immediately thought it was extremely bright for a star.  It was twinkling blue and white, with the intensity of lighting or magnesium being burned.  After about a minute, the object seemed to break into a tightly bundled grouping of about 5 lights, in almost a cross shape.  And then the object began to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately dropped my cigarette, and opened the screen on the window to get a better look.  The object started SLOWLY creeping west towards Feeding Hills and Southwick.  So whoever filed that Southwick report on here, I just want to say thank you.  And I&#39;m with you, we definitely saw a UFO, and it was truly amazing!!  And I have pictures of it.  Albeit very crude ones, but when you zoom in on these pics, the object is a saucer shape, there is no question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then began to emit orange lights, as well as white and blue.  It was making strange vertical movements, meaning straight up and down in the sky profile.  This incident took place at 3:10 am, it was very cold out.  There was absolutely no noise, and the object moved slower than any plane could possibly fly.  I watched the object until 3:28 until it completely disappeared behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not gonna report this, but have been monitoring this website the last couple of days to see if somebody else had saw it.  So again, whoever you are, thank you so much for filing that Southwick report.  You have no idea how happy I am that I&#39;m not alone.<n>

I went into my back yard around 11:10 on 1/13/2014 to stargaze with my 10x50 binoculars.  I looked around the whole sky with the naked eye to see how clear it was out; there were almost no clouds out.  So I looked at the moon and the constellation Orion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I took the binoculars down and I looked up I noticed a very bright pulsing red/orange circular light on the upper horizon.  Automatically I knew that it wasn’t there before, my heart started beating like it was going to jump out of my chest.  I looked through my binoculars at it, the object was far away but I could tell it was circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept staring at it, it looked as if it was bobbing up and down.  Then I thought I saw a white beam/light almost flickering under it and then out the side of the object I saw three white objects shoot out to the right and then directly up and then they were out of my vision.  The smaller objects were pea size in comparison to the main bright red/orange object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not too long after that the main object started moving away from its original position.  As it got farther away from me it got dimmer and dimmer, eventually in an instant it was gone and I stood there in awe of what I saw and then went inside very much scarred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog was with me out there and she didn’t react in any way but the object could have been too far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve always wanted to see something like this for myself and finally I have.  My family now thinks I’m crazy but I KNOW what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I will go outside and check again but I doubt I’ll see anything again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Was way too big to be a star and gold shimmering in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband and he came to see it also.  I went outside with the binoculars and when it saw me watching, it started to move and then left traveling east, flying horizontally, quickly enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was beautiful.  Gold shimmering lights in the shape of an upside-down teardrop or a rounded leaf.<n>

It was oval or like an elongated egg.  One end was fat the other was noticeably smaller.  I had a flashlight and flashed at it but it just keep move and went over the top of the trees.  I dont know what it was but it was very pretty.  It was very cool to see.<n>

The city is a best guess based off of the time of the sighting and my guess as to our place in our flight trajectory.  I was sitting in a window seat, row 10 of the plane.  I was looking out the window at some of the city lights and suddenly a white orb showed up, at approximately the same altitude of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point, it looked to be slightly in front of the plane and a short distance away on the left side of the plane (the side I was sitting on).  It was hard to gauge the distance being that it was partly cloudy and flying at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to observe the light/orb for about 30-40 minutes.  The object would move farther away and then back, which was observable by seeing it fly through the clouds and then back into the open nearer the plane.  Every so often, it would make quick movements moving up and down, like almost mocking the plane and yet flying with us at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to take a picture of the object, but my phone was in my carry-on bag in the overhead bin and being an evening flight, a vast majority of the passengers were sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew away and disappeared approximately 15 minutes before our landing in Chicago.<n>

We were on our way home from Colville, WA to our home in Inchelium, WA.  We were traveling south along the Columbia River on the Inchelium Kettle Falls Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After our previous experience, I was searching the night sky for other objects.  At around 9:05pm I noticed a white object zigging and zagging in the night sky.  I asked my daughter to pull over.  We watched the object for about a minute at which point I grab my phone and began to record it.  I tried to capture what I could but had a hard time finding it in the view of the camera screen so I shut it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it zigged and zagged, it moved in a circular motion before leveling out and flying north along the Columbia River.  As it flew by in silence, we noticed that it had the silhouette of a triangle with a bright light at the point of the triangle and smaller and dimmer lights along the two legs (4 lights on each side) of the triangle but the base of it had no lights it was just black.  It was well above the tree line and above the mountaintops.  The only reference that I can make to the entire size of it was that it was about four full moons put together in a triangular shape.  At this point, my 10-year-old son was getting frightened so we drove off heading for home.<n>

I viewed it at a 45-50 degree angle, giving it an approx distance of 0.5 nm south of my house and heading westbound over downtown Hartwell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 5-10 seconds of seeing it, it either rotated clockwise or the lights separated and went in different directions.  After this it disappeared from view.  The whole time it was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions were clear at the time with little to no wind.<n>

Several (15) balls of light came up from the horizon, made an arc movement into the sky, and proceeded to quickly move towards Lake Erie.  Within about 30 seconds, each light would be over the lake and they disappeared as they moved towards Canada.  They were crossing paths of planes on approach to Cleveland Hopkins that were also out over Lake Erie. They were moving much faster than the planes, seemed to be above the planes that were coming in to land, and they had no flashing lights like the planes (just a red ball of light).  Weirdest thing I&#39;ve ever seen, no explanation other than they were definitely not satellites, meteors, planes, or lanterns (I&#39;ve seen all of these before).<n>

It was simply an orange ball flying through the sky and traveling at a fairly high rate of speed.

She said she didn&#39;t actually see a craft/machine, just the lights in a square/rectangle formation. Her description of the object was a box with about 20 lights-red/green/yellow/white all flashing intermittently.  The object did not fly but shuffled forward/back/up/down while moving in a northeast direction (towards Selfridge ANG base?).  Shortly after seeing the object she said a red non-flashing light dropped out of the center of the lighted square and maneuvered around until it disappeared near the ground. Just after that happened she said a very large low flying jet flying northwest to south with a giant tear dropped shaped very bright belly light appeared on the scene. She emphasized the size of the jet and said the belly light extended to beyond the wing leading edge to past the trailing edge.  If it was a 747 size aircraft that would mean a light of over 30 feet in length.  As soon as the aircraft appeared, the lighted square disappeared/went dark-don&#39;t know.<n>

One was smaller than the other two and flickered out quickly.  The remaining two continued moving in straight line, single file, silently.  A second one flickered and went out, but the third one continued to cover nearly 3/4 of the sky before it also burned out.  My son filmed it on his iPhone, but the image does not do justice to the brilliance of the color and brightness of these orbs.  I have no idea.  Perhaps it was a meteor, but they moved so much more slowly than any meteor I have ever witnessed.  Their speed was more like that of a typical airplane, but these lights did not behave at all like airplane lights.  They really looked like fireballs.  There were planes in the sky whose pilots must have witnessed this event.<n>

We looked and the object appeared to have a vapor trail that was bright orange so at first we believed it to be a plane.  As we continued to drive we noticed the craft was no moving enough to make a noticeable difference and the light trail was much shorter than what is typically seen behind an airplane.  We soon cleared the tree cover and noticed 3 objects to the direct north all flying diagonally in different directions at different altitudes.  When we made a more southern turn we noticed 2 more streaks of orange light parallel to one another almost in a direct southwest direction.  As we neared Georgetown we noticed one more streak above the Toyota plant but it seemed to be noticeable farther away.  By the time we got home we could no longer see any of the streaks they just seemed to have faded away.  The closest lights had what looked like ! a triangular vehicle in front of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw a fireball fly across the sky.  I&#39;m not sure how close it was, but it was close enough where I could see pieces and sparks fly off of it.  A tree branch obstructed my view as it continued through the sky, so I ran past the tree.  Even though this only took a few seconds, the fireball was gone.  There were no buildings or anything in the way to block my view after I got around that tree, so I&#39;m not sure where it went.  From where I was, I could see sparks and what looked like smaller pieces come off of it so it must have been pretty close.  My dog&#39;s ears perked up, and she sniffed the air and pulled at the leash and jumped up.  I did not hear a noise with it, but she must have either been able to hear it or she saw it as well.<n>

I watched  it, the sky was bright blue and sunny outside.  I watched the whole drive to work and saw it did not fly in a straight line, it was saucer shaped and not a helicopter or airplane.  It was highly reflective, I tried to take picture while on my way to work- I could still see it after I got to work way in the distance because the sun was bouncing off it so brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home and reviewed the picture I took, I noticed a cloud i had only slightly paid attention to before because it was the only cloud in the sky looked peculiar to AND--Next to the cloud in my picture there are two super bright lights with trails behind them.  My picture of the saucer is so off in the distance you can&#39;t really see it bit upon examination the other two lights that I did not see while taking the picture are far more interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a picture immediately after and the cloud is dissipating and the two bright lights are gone<n>

I can&#39;t believe no body saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was broadcasted Nationally so since no one noticed, I decided to record my TV screen with my iphone to catch these objects.  I have even posted the video on youtube.  It is unaltered.  The only altercation I did was to circle the location of these crafts.  They are just hovering over the stadium way high up in the sky. I believe it was not visible to the naked eye for those attending and it can only be seen thru this HDTV, especially that the HDTV is very detail, so I circled it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video is 38 seconds.  So I really don&#39;t know how long these things have been up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the video:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/GSe0PVmsMwQ<n>

No sounds were heard and no trails of any kind were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Originally the craft were traveling in a straight line, then they appeared to &#34;stop&#34; for a short moment and remained motionless until they began to slowly disappear from sight as they then appeared to travel &#34;away&#34; from my line of sight into the vanishing point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the main craft, in perspective, would have been the same as holding a Tylenol capsule out toward the sky at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I was standing in the parking lot of the King Soopers on College road in north Fort Collins.  I was loading groceries into the car and felt compelled to look up and behind me.   There I saw two red circle ball lights in the sky, they were not blinking or moving.  There were no clouds that night, the sky was clear.  Within one minute one light ball faded out, then the second one immediately followed.  They didn&#39;t just turn off, they faded out.  Airplane lights don&#39;t fade out in clear skies.  It was interesting.  There have been two other times in my life I have seen balls of light in the sky like these, but in those other times the lights were more of an orange color, and I saw them in Michigan.  These latest ones were much more in the red scale of light, but same in general physical appearance.<n>

The moment I looked up I happened to see a black boomerang type craft with 5 or 6 dim lights in formation fly over head at a constant velocity or speed, it was moving rather quickly but smoothly through the sky heading South West from Palo Alto.  It did not make any noise at all,  However, I could some how faintly see the black glossy structure of the craft and the lights that were in formation.  I knew immediately it was a craft of some kind because I could see the black glossy structure, the height of the craft and the constant speed at which it was moving.  It was gone out of my sight and view in less than 10 seconds, but it sure did get my attention.<n>

I saw this large round orange ball and at first I thought it may be the full moon, although since the sighting, I&#39;ve learned that we didn&#39;t have a full moon that night.  It was a little larger than a full moon would&#39;ve been, and it was bright orange.  At first the clouds were moving in front of it, and then it started moving to my right across the sky.  Its movement was slow and steady unlike that of a shooting start or meteor.   It was much too large to be an airplane.   When it had moved to my right for some time it slowed and hovered in the sky.  Then it looked as if it rose up into the sky quickly and disappeared.  This disappearance was much quicker than the slow movement across the sky. I didn&#39;t hear any sounds during the event.<n>

We thought at first that it may be search lights used for advertising.  no beams came from these lights from the ground.  They were above the clouds and just looked like glowing light playing tag.  They vanished little by little until one remained and vanished also. have no idea what these were all 3 of us are really wondering.  Tonight i will look out side again and see if they reappear.  These lights were seen from my home and i have never seen them before.  I have in this past year since what i thought a light zipping by but can&#39;t confirm because only a glimpse sighting.  last night they were hanging out for maybe 5 minutes when i first saw and gathered my husband and son to see.  Could you let me know if anyone else had seen these ?  E-MAIL AS PROVIDED BELOW??  thank you !!  yes our cat did respond to this event when he came out to look, he just looked out at them.<n>

They weren&#39;t too close to each other but not too far either.  Airplanes do not travel like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my husband and brother in law to look closely since I had slowed down my speed to 30 mph and had a line of cars behind me.

There was no sound, the speed never changed.  The objects were flying low.  The size of the lights were large compared to lights you see on an airplane.  The lights appeared to glow like a flare.   There was no smoke.  The lights never dimmed out and the wind was southwest.  If the lights you see on an airplane are equivalent to the size of a golf ball these lights were about the size of a soccer ball or a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked at the photos which I had taken earlier and realized something on the side where Mt. Suswa is situated; it is very visible from the road that is on top of the escarpment.  I zoomed the object which is black in color, looks like it’s in a rectangle blue light.  On the clip after playing it in a slow motion, I noticed there was another object, which was not that visible, following the other..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things got more mysterious when I looked at the details of the clip and photos, the time on them did not match the time I was in Mahi Mahiu.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	First photo reads 12.45pm •	Second photo reads 12.52pm •	Third photo reads 12.53pm •	The clip reads 1.00pm  Am afraid on that time I had not even reached Mahi Mahiu.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.

Exactly at 3.10pm I sent a message to my boyfriend telling him I was 40km away from Mahi Mahiu. I still have the message on the phone and I knew the distance because I had seen a sign on the road reading, ‘MMU 40KM’ then sent the message.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  	I reached Mahiu Mahiu around 3.50pm and that’s when I started taking the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.	  Reached Nairobi at around 5.30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have used my phone log to give the times.

The blue beam seemed to be moving, and then the large lit up craft suddenly dissapeared.  The craft remained slightly in sight for about ten minutes, then lit back up to its original brightness, and in a split second flew backwards--it went from being relatively close to the ground to behind the cloud line in less than a second, the object traveled an immense distance in an unreasonable amount of time.  Then the object proceeded to get brighter and dimmer in the sky, get larger and smaller, and appear and reappear.  I got a good look at the bottom of the object in the sky, and it had 5 points, somewhat resembling a starfish shape. the whole ordeal took about 30 minutes, and I live in Florida; I have seen sh! uttles, planes, satalites, and choppers, this was unlike anything I have ever seen, it really didn&#39;t look like something human kind was capable of inventing.<n>

It was actually quite beautiful.  Just never seen anything like that!<n>

I see plenty of planes flying into John Wayne Airport and plenty of helicopters flying over the peninsula.  These were neither types of craft.  There were no blinking lights whatsoever.  They we&#39;re flying a little higher than helicopters fly and hovered for the most part.  I saw two groups of two.  The first set hovered for a while then one disappeared while the other remained.  After about 4 minutes, it headed up and to the north out of site.  The second set was basically the same in that they hovered and stayed still for about 4 minutes.  One of them went up higher into the sky after about 2 minutes and while it was visible to the naked eye, my phone video recorder could no longer pick it up.  The 2nd one disappeared after about 4 - 5 minutes.  At one point I put down my iPhone and zeroed in with binoculars that I have.  I could not make out any type of metal or material on the craft.  It seemed to be comprised of multiple lights of the same size and luminosity.  This is the 3rd time I&#39;ve spotted these craft over the same area of sky outside my window.  I have never seen them any where else.<n>

What made me notice it was the color - a bright, glowing aqua blue.  There was no wind or any breeze, yet it moved quickly across the sky, and in less than a minute it was overhead.  I had a tablet computer with me and by the time I snapped a picture of the mass, it was already past my house and heading east.  It was not the moon or city lights that caused the bright glow.  The glow was gone within two minutes. I&#39;ve been looking for reports of Aurora Borealis sightings in southern Arizona, but so far none have come up.  I&#39;m hoping that someone else in AZ saw this and got better pictures.  It resembled Aurora Borealis to some extent but had a misty, amorphous quality to it.  It moved away too quickly to be a solar flare, in my opinion.<n>

Inside the golf course borderline to my house in Placentia, California.  When I spotted this UFO for second time (first sighting Jan-01-2014, after this event,  I wanted to have my HD camera, handy and fully charged..)  The UFO was coming and going over the trees and houses in a searching-like fashion way then disappeared for 30 minutes to reappeared about 6:00 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, was really dark and I was walking while recording, (that&#39;s the reason of the constant shaking) trying to obtain a good angle for my shots.  I could hear a humming noise coming from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the first reappearence at 5:30, I could distinguish a rectangular structure with two cylinders on each side from which I was able to see these very intense round red and green lights with no gloss or brightness at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Underneath were four round white lights, also very intense with no brightness.  What really called my attention is that no part of the structure or the cylinders is seen in the video.  Only a multicolor ball of light instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the link to the video:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C53OYAST9CI<n>

No lights, no sound emitted, no exhaust trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SIZE:  From Venus-size to slightly larger as it approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> COLOR:  Yellowish white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DATE:  1/10/2014  EVENT DESCRIPTION: While out walking, I looked around at the pre-dawn sky and notice 2 bright objects to the west at about 35 degrees above the horizon.  They were both equally bright in magnitude (the two brightest objects in the sky at the time) and almost parallel to each other in reference to the horizon line (Rocky Mountains, Wet Mountain Range).  I thought it peculiar that they were both so bright, thinking one to be Venus and one to be a planet.  I soon dismissed this notion as no other planet or star is comparable to Venus in magnitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes, I checked the sky again and found that the objet to the south had moved to the 10 o’clock position above the object to the north.  At this point, I stopped and watched the object move in an easterly direction and turn to a new heading of north by northeast at about 45 degrees above the horizon line near Pike’s Peak.  Wind was out of the north at 15 to 20 mph.  I watched until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object’s speed is hard to calculate.  The best way to descibe it is that it moved at a “leisurely” pace with no apparent variation in speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Elevation of object approximately 15 to 20,000 ft.  My position was about 6,500ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other object remained motionless during this time and visual contact of it was lost while looking at the moving object as the sky brightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to find out where Venus was in the pre-dawn sky in an attempt to account for the second “stationary” object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will attest to this event by oath or affidavit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for this opportunity and I would like to let you know that your work is greatly appreciated.<n>

This is the third UFO I have seen so far, and all three in the last four months (speaking in terms of linear time).  I walked out of my house in the morning to get my cannabis which I had left in my car.  (I had not consumed any yet)  Being a winter morning, the sun had not come out yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I love to gaze at the stars and have been doing so since I was a child almost daily,  Sometimes for hours.  (Present age 28) I know the constellations and have and can distinguish stars from planets, plus I have taken some astronomy courses in college and stargazing has been a lifelong hobby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a single round, reddish yellowish, greenish light in the sky which moved very rapidly and stood still, then moved again then stood still.  Then moved at a constant speed, then came to a complete stop and vanished slowly into the heavens, out of my sight.  It did not share any qualities that an airplane exhibits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airplane’s light flickers at a constant tempo and the movement is constant and CAN NOT come to a complete stop in the middle of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had a compass I would say the UFO came to halt at a perfect North.  I did not have a compass so I am basing my observations on the stars’ and the sun’s movements.  Make of this experience whatever resonates with your vibrations.<n>

The orb would dart down and shoot back up, what seemed like 200ft, in extremely fast and disoriented movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it shifted positions it would change from a bright blue to an intense white.  I confused it at first to be a firework like a rocket/roman candle but it left no trail and did not look pyrotechnic in anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second guess was it was a drone like a quad-copter but it moved way too fast for a propeller driven drone.  It could have been military if it used tiny jets instead of propellers but it made no sound, so that rules out the possibility.  As it danced in the sky it would dip below the tree line, and would remain out of sight for up to 5 seconds, till it shot back up to at least 200-300ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I lost sight of it, I saw it shoot in and out of the tree line at least 3 times before it shot a beam towards the ground. It looked like a white spot light that pointed at the ground below it and then swung it towards my direction for a split second.  (I didn&#39;t like that lol)  Accelerated towards the tree line again and moved West towards the ocean on a horizontal flight path till it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then walked into my apartment complex to find my neighbor running out of his house looking in the direction I had previously looking in.

They were quite a distance away, yet they were as large as the light on a helicopter that flew over my head at around the same time (the helicopter had nothing to do with the sighting, its just a size comparison).  The lights were a minimum of 10 miles away, so they were large and bright enough to clearly see.  They were mostly stationary and they formed a non-equilateral triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The right-most light then started to head to the right (west) and it went out after about 10 seconds.  The middle light did the same thing about 30 seconds later.  The third light remained stationary in the sky for about 2 minutes, and then it faded out, but as it did, another bright orange light appeared to the left of it.  The fourth and final light remained stationary in the sky for another f! ew minutes, and then it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an iPhone 5 video of the event that I&#39;d like to upload, but it may take me a few days.<n>

Altitude unknown but guess is 60,000 plus  I am almost positive this was no satellite as I did some research and could not find any in this orbit at the time I viewed object.  My guess is it was 4X brighter than the ISS, Sure looked suspect thats why I filed this report.<n>

Fixated on the speeding jet, I noticed a sphere shaped shiny object tailing it,  Within a few seconds of noticing the object, it took a 45° angle, and disappeared into the cloud cover above.<n>
1/9/14 16:07|Metairie|LA|Triangle|10 seconds|High flying jet that has no contrails.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106160.html|486|ndxe201401| a high flying jet that has no contrails<n> <n><n> <n><n> Special report-date:  Friday, 9 January, 2014; time: 4:07 P.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw what appeared to be a jet aircraft at cruising altitude, flying east to west.  Altitude at better than 30,000 feet.  No exhaust contrails to be seen streaming from behind the aircraft.  Visual speed appeared to be greater than what would be expected of a conventional jet at that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some ten seconds after visually watching a very high flying jet, the aircraft rises to a brilliant speck, then disappears completely from visual view in a cloudless blue sky!  Aircraft configuration similar to most high flying jets, but with some visual differences.  No noise from the aircraft due to its very high altitude, concomitant with very high altitude jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously, the aircraft is not powered by jet engines, but powered by some other propulsive technology.  Jet aircraft at that altitude always produce streaming exhaust contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a brilliant burst of light, the aircraft completely disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speculation:  The &#34;aircraft&#34; makes a sharp upturn, and goes to space!  This explains why, in a very clear sky, the &#34;aircraft&#34; visually disappears instead of continuing its east-west trajectory.<n>

I took my iPad and poised it directly into the sun where all the chemtrails were.  I took several shots of the trails, and left.  Days later when I looked at the pictures I noticed a distinct glowing orb in the pictures.  It seemed the small orb was tracking me and in the last picture I could see a creatures  face under neath the orb.  Also, in one picture, there is a distinct blue sphere looking object.  I enlarged the object with my iPad and it appears to be a six sided craft, turned somewhat at an angle.  I will post the pictures.  It was spooky because it seemed the orb with the creatures face in it seemed to be tracking and looking at me.  I also noticed a similar orb in a national forest in Utah on the day after Christmas while photographing chemtrails there as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spotted what I thought was a plain in the distant.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it until I looked about 3 minutes later and it&#39;s still hovering over the same spot. So I thought it was a helicopter.  But than a couple seconds later I notice it changing three different colors, green, red and white...  Green was green green, red was red red...  And so on..  It changed a color every second continuously.  I it was hovering for a long time long enought to grab my camera and put a 85mm lense on it..  I snapped some pics but it literally looks like a dot in the sky. So I was soo convince it was some unusual object something and perhaps like a UFO... I then called my friend and told her what I was spotting and how it was changing colors... What aircraft changes colors like this and have it be vibrant even from the distance.. I was prob like 5-7  miles from it.  As I was talking on the phone it th! an stopped changing colors and instead did mini blinking like what you see on a helicopter or a plain when in flies in the dark....than it flew  across the sky and out of sight. Please tell me that someone else spotted this and if so did you get a chance to notice what this object was..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It moved quickly in a matter of a minute it had already moved to the next block did not hear no sound but i did see a quick flash or reflection off the object seemed like it got closer to land as if searching for something then it would go back up.  A weird experience it almost seemed like i was the only one paying attention during everyones morning commute .before reaching home object was still in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Looked up and we saw 3 very bright lights coming from different directions coming together like a triangle the lights were orange big and bright.  Soon as they formed the triangle one went faster higher higher higher till you know longer can see it than the next one went than the next one.  They all disappeared to the left in the same area.<n>

No noise at all.  Two larger than the other three or four.  They hovered for several minutes and then several of them moved off and faded away.

They had a color very similar to street lights (Orange in color rather big) One of the lights faded then the next one until it disappeared.

They flashed for just a couple seconds and then disappeared.  Approximately 4.5 miles up the road 3 of the yellow lights reappeared and were slowly moving in a Northeast direction.  As the lights reappeared, I noticed 2 other aircraft in the sky with the typical red &amp; white lights.  One aircraft was travelling Southwest almost directly above the yellow lights, the other traveling Northeast below the yellow lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/8/14 17:30|Green Lake|WI|Unknown|1 1/2 hours+|3 fading orange lights and small, white, sparkler lights west/southwest of Green Lake, WI.|1/16/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106203.html|503|ndxe201401| 3 fading orange lights and small, white, sparkler lights west/southwest of Green Lake, WI<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was January 8th at about 5:30pm; I was in the parking lot of my apartment building waiting for my boyfriend to unlock our truck door.  I was looking toward the west, hoping to glimpse the last bit of sunset sky, when all of a sudden an orange light gradually appeared (about ½ to ¾ the size of a dime if held out at arm’s length).  It was a faint light that became very bright and then faded out (lasted about 6-8 seconds).  To the left of that (facing west, southwest), the exact same light appeared, in the exact same manner, for the same length of time.  To the left of that (facing south, southwest), about double the distance of the second light to the first, the exact same light appeared, same manner, same length of time.  Immediately after the third orange light disappeared, “small, white, sparkler lights” appeared in the sky, above and within the entire span where the three orange lights had been.  I call these “sparkler lights” because the closest thing I can compare them to is a sparkler; the sparks are bright, yet fade quickly.  These “small, white, sparkler lights” were inconsistent or erratic (no pattern to them) and their density was higher when they initially appeared.  We ran into town to the gas station and drove the long way home to continue monitoring the sky.  As the density of these “small, white, sparkler lights” decreased, they moved greater distances between reappearing in their sparkle/twinkling fashion.  Once home my boyfriend worked in the garage until about 7:30pm, and these “small, white, sparkler lights” had continued even after he called it a night.  The duration of these lights was 1 ½ hours+.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I agree that the orange lights we witnessed were a very similar color to that of street lights, however, they were much brighter and from a spatial stand point, well above the street and could not be mistaken as street lights.  I have no guess as to what the “small, white, sparkler lights” are, as this is our first encounter with lights of this fashion (in person or otherwise).  In my opinion (not speaking for my boyfriend), I think that the 3 separate orange lights were not separate ufo’s, but part of a larger craft, however, a formation was never presented.  This experience was exhilarating, but has left us feeling a little nervous since this all happened right outside our residence and we have only lived here about 5 months.<n>

The whole time, the sound when something breaks the sound barrier was going, extremely loudly.  Afterwards, there were tons of normal planes flying around in the area.<n>
1/8/14 17:12|Fond du Lac|WI|Formation|1.5 minutes|I was taking the dog out to the backyard.

I was standing on the deck which faces due North while waiting for the dog to do his thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I waited, I heard a loud dull roar.  I assumed it was a truck going down the street at first.  I walked around to the other side of the deck to peak around the house.  I didn’t see any trucks.  I stopped and listened more closely and thought maybe it was a train, we have them frequently going through town.  It was clearly not a train, then I looked up and thought that it must be a jet that’s really low, because a commercial jet doesn’t sound like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked around the corner facing due North again, and looking up I saw a flashing light, and said to myself oh, ok, it’s a jet.  Then my peripheral vision caught movement. I saw a cluster of five steady, non blinking white lights moving directly North.  Then three jets which I presumed were F-16s as the closest fighter base in Wisconsin is the 115th Fighter Wing National Guard based out of Truax Field, Madison, WI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jets were clearly trying to catch up to this cluster of five lights, and they were making pretty good time.  The jets had the usual red and white lights for navigation and strobing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw them chase the cluster of 5 lights for about 1min 30 seconds approximately.  Total time of the event lasted about 5 minutes as I heard the jets approaching well before I saw them.  And for those who like geography or don’t know, the nearest towns to Fond du Lac, WI that are due North of us are first, Oshkosh, and Appleton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first official report of a sighting.  I would also like to point out that I am very familiar with aircraft of all type shapes and sizes as I have a number of years in the military with the specific duty of identifying enemy a/c and vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m absolutely certain that these fighter jets were chasing an object or objects and trying to gain on them as the object(s) clearly pulled away from them.  I would estimate their altitude at about 1 km or so.  I checked the current operational ceiling online and it showed 5600 ft.  They may have been lower.  Relative brightness of the cluster of lights would be about -1 magnitude.  Close to the brightness of Jupiter on a clear night.  Each light was this bright, and they were tightly packed together.  No discernible pattern of flight or shape, they may have been independent of each other or one object.  I&#39;m inclined to say they were 5 separate objects however.<n>

The skies were clear and it was just getting dark at 5 PM.  My husband pointed out 2 very bright lights blinking in the sky- separated far enough from each other as not being on a single craft, but flying very close together, one slightly ahead of the other ( from our car it would have been about an “inch apart”.  The lights were out of sync with each other. They moved off to the south almost like in a meteor dive and then 2 lights reappeared in the skies again in front of us. Turning south on 13 we never noticed any more lights.  My husband and I did not think these appeared to be strobes or lights on commercial airlines. We don&#39;t know what they were.<n>

The formation looked like a bird migration (diagonal) but I&#39;ve never seen or heard of birds that glow in the dark.  It appeared as if the one on the rear of the formation started to break from the formation so they slowed down until it realigned and sped right back up.  I watched until I could not see them anymore.  The sighting lasted for about 30-45 seconds.<n>

Its position was strait above. For a moment I thought I was looking at a pulsar before realizing that pulsars don&#39;t strobe as fast as the light I was observing.  I went to my room mates door to show him what I was seeing.  At that moment I observed another flashing light due west of the original light.  My room mate came outside and was surprised at the sighting.  He then brought my attention to the other five remaining lights that were also in a north western position in the sky from the original light I had spotted.  The lights slowly moved north west, disappearing over the cloud cover that was drifting in from the coast.  The whole sighting lasted about five minuets.<n>

I thought they were two planes in formation, but then they appeared to split/evolve (Shot out of the other???) into two to three more identical objects.  The remaining lights were partially obscured by the clouds, but not the first two.  They cast light into the clouds just around them.  They seemed to light up and then go off as they moved southeast.  They moved a large distance very quickly.  They would light up in one location and then jump to another, farther distance away.  The whole family saw them.<n>

Within a few seconds, 2 more identical orange lights appeared to the right of the first 2 in a very slight downward arc. I couldn&#39;t judge distance but it appeared that the lights were possibly 10-15 miles distant.  The lights were striking in appearance in that they were bright and didn&#39;t conform in nature to anything normally seen with conventional airborne objects.  I grabbed a camera close by, opened my garage door and stepped out on my driveway.  The lights had disappeared.  However, approximately 10 miles to the south of that position, an orange light appeared very low in the sky. It disappeared and reappeared within a few seconds in that location.  About 60 seconds later, it appeared about 30 miles NW of that position once again as an orange light near the KITT Peak Observatory area.  Within abou! t 5 minutes of my observation, I observed (and heard) 2 USAF jets in the exact same area of my original sighting.  The jets circled the city of Tucson from what I could tell for about 10 minutes.  There were no further sightings at this point.<n>

The sky was bluish with clouds, and no other stars that I could see. I checked.  There was one aircraft far in the distance that I could see through my front windshield.  To the right of the car, there was another bright pinpoint of light that caught my attention.  It was small and bright, like a star, but a much brighter.  Three seconds later, it shot straight forward in a streak of light.  The light trail was like a shooting star, but much brighter.  The streak, also, ran parallel to the light, instead of descending.  I have never seen anything like that; I don&#39;t know what it was.<n>

We have lived at this address for seven years, and have had our hot tub almost as long, and have spend many hours looking up at the night sky here – we know what we’re looking at in the sky here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an airplane, as I only glimpsed them through branches of a tree on our property.  We live on a flight path to SFO, so we get periodic commercial aviation traffic overhead – near enough to distinguish each wing, and the lights on them.  This was entirely different. Two of the lights were moving rapidly in together, with a third one behind them.  Distance between them was approximately 3-4full moons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were heading south, toward the edge of the trees on our property, by leaning over the south edge of our hot tub we could see them emerge from behind the trees.  As they did, they joined up with another constellation of 7-10 similar objects that appeared to be stationary, at 280deg W.  These objects were oriented in a backwards capital letter “L” pattern, with approximately 3 objects oriented horizontally, sloping upward to the south, and a vertical line of 3-4 more going up.  They occupied a about 3 full moon’s worth of sky vertically, and maybe 2 horizontally.  They appeared to me to be quite uniform in size and color, and were twinkling (or perhaps flashing rapidly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought I was looking at an unusually bright (and severely compacted) version of the constellation Orion – that was the only thing I could think of that looks even remotely like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife and I watched and tried to figure out what we were seeing, the group of objects slowly began to change shape and appeared to move toward the south, where they eventually dimmed – probably fading into the clouds.  They still persisted dimly for some time – maybe another minute or two. We debated whether to go inside and grab a cell phone to take a picture, but this would not have been feasible in the low light conditions.<n>
1/6/14 22:15|Danville|VA|Unknown|15-20 minutes|White Lights no sound.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106120.html|527|ndxe201401| White Lights no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> January 8, 2014  On January 6 at 10:15 P.M. I stepped outside to have a cigarette; as soon as I opened the door I saw bright white lights almost directly above me.  The craft was traveling East at about 400-500 feet and moving at around 40 miles an hour.  The strange thing I immediately noticed was there was no sound coming from the craft.  No Doppler effect from Jet engines, no prop sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had several white lights on steady and one slow flashing light on the back.  I could not see any on the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the air craft I see are high fly jets, moving North to South or further to the East from South to North.  This craft was heading East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do have fighter jets that every once and awhile heading to Smyth Mountain Lake Damn on (from what we have heard) bomber training.  The shake the house and you can hear them for miles after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night I stepped outside again at 9:30 and the craft was there again. This time further away but heading East and at the same altitude.  I watched until it was at the horizon through the trees, then it headed South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t put it together at the time, but the first I saw the craft I cam back inside and told my wife. She has had some health issues lately but, nothing to bad, but it keeps me on edge. About one half hour after telling her, she sat forward in her chair and held her head. I asked her if she was OK.  She told me she felt light headed and her stomach felt queezy.  As she was telling me, my head started feeling light and my stomach felt like I was on a roller coaster.  The symptoms went away with 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night as the lights faded away I was getting ready to go back inside and my lips started to tingle, my head felt a little light and my stomach felt a little strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a believer in UFO’s from other planets, I do believe in government black ops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hardest thing I have a hard time with is that there was no sound at all.  I know it wasn’t a blimp as I’ve heard those before.  It wasn’t a plane or jet. I could make out any shape, besides what looked like a tail of a plane.  The white light had a strange appearance, almost a glow more that light. It didn’t spin or make any strange movments.<n>

It had to have covered several miles as the light flashed from behind several of the hills.

I watched as it moved to the northwest.  It looked exactly like a satellite as it moved into shadow.  My impression was that it must be a satellite, but what caused the light?<n>

I am 57 years old and not a believer in UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 7:00 p.m I was bringing in firewood from my backyard to my house.  It was completely dark.  As I was walking up my driveway, I saw two lights approaching me from due south above my neighbor&#39;s roof line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought they were helicopters with their search lights on. This seemed odd because you always hear a helicopter before you see one.  The lights appeared to be about 500 feet, but ORANGE in color.  There was NO sound!  They were parallel in flight as they approached me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the light on the right moved diagonally and fell in behind the other light.  They then traveled inline until the rear light collided, or was absorbed by the first.  When I turned my head to watch the singular light directly above my head it completely vanished.  This could not have been a Japanese lantern.  I told my wife and next door neighbor what I saw.  Neither believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned earlier, before this occurrence, I never witnessed or believed in UFO&#39;s.  Could this be some kind of military hologram?  I do not live in an area close to any Army or Air Force base.  I am only trying to find a rational explanation for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading my account.<n>

I watched for about 3 or 4 seconds when I noticed a sphere shape silver ball, at my guess from where I was, a football field or so trailing behind it, seemingly at the same speed as the plane.  The silver sphere was obviously tangible.  It was reflecting the sunlight as it was beginning to set and did not seem to be spinning, but could have just been the reflection off the sphere.  It followed the plane for a minute or two, this whole time, i am showing my brother who is driving. He pulled over and we watched it follow the plane for another minute or so as it goes off into a large cloud covering the horizon.  While looking arou! nd for anything else, I notice another plane coming from the same general direction as the last at a slightly different angle.  Once again, this plane was also leaving a cloud trail, and once again there was surely a silver sphere following the plane.  I kept thinking, don&#39;t these planes see these orbs??? they are so close to them!  Neither the silver orbs or the planes were blinking or showing any lights.  All objects were close enough to make direct shape and design out of.  So as this one goes off into the horizon also, the sphere NEVER blinking out of sight, surely a physical object, a fighter jet swoops in, no cloud trail, very fast, coming from more from the side of me, not the same exact direction as the previous planes.  This jet plane had an extremely bright yellowish white light beaming out of the bottom of it. Ive never seen a light this bright on a plane, a fighter plane.  The jet plane soars off into the horizon, the same location the other planes flew in.  I watched t! he skies for another 10 minutes, nothing. another plane flew by several minutes after the sightings, also giving off cloud trails, but no spheres were noticed.<n>

As my dog stopped and sniffed around, I looked up and saw an emerging vapor trail from a jet up in the sky.  I observed the jet for a moment, only to realize a disk-shaped object appeared to be tailing it.  The disk appeared metallic but shined white at times, I assume, from reflecting the sun.  I watched for about 20 seconds as the jet and the object continued in a westerly direction.  The object had no visible vapor trail behind it.  After watching the disk follow the jet, I observed a second jet with a vapor trail closing rapidly in an almost-perpendicular angle towards the first jet and the disk.  As the second jet closed in, it appeared that the disk changed its course by about 25 degrees and continued for about 10 seconds until it was out of sight.  The second jet appeared to continue its path towards the first jet until they! were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I again was walking my dog around the same time, this time towards North Branch Park.  As I crossed the bridge into the park, a white Chinook helicopter appeared and began hovering in the airspace above the park.  Having been in the military, I realized that it was not a military Chinook, nor was it a rescue Chinook since it was white in color.  It was not being used for any type of commercial lifting operation and I could not figure out why a Chinook would be hovering above this park.  I observed the helicopter for a few minutes as it slowly made its way above me and along the same flight path as the jet and the object the previous day.  I watched it for about 10 minutes as it slowly followed the same path until it was nearly out of sight.  I can only speculate if the two incidents were related.<n>

She was looking around and yelled at me what is that on top of the mountain? I looked through my windshield and my drivers side window to my left what we were looking at was a solid white craft appearing to be floating over the top of the ridge line of the mountain by approximately 100-125 feet (THREE TREES STACKED END TO END)and may have been moving slowly north 10-15 mph we watched it for approximately 30 seconds to maybe a minute at the most (I kept on driving) The craft was less than a quarter a mile away when we first seen it,it looked like a big propane cylinder solid very bright white no wings no tail no windows no paint or color solid white!It looked like a big balloon in movement (FLOATING OR HOVERING)  It was approximately 250-300 feet in length and 25-40 feet in height slightly wider or bulged toward the north (rear) end there was  nothing under it or over it, this was against a clear blue sky no sun in our eyes or clouds near by, it was a solid object for sure and was way bigger than a jet plane at any airport.<n>

I was standing in my door way of my mobile home and looking up at the SE direction of the clear blue sky I noticed a large white disk shaped object hovering or floating in the sky at a close distance.  I kept my eyes focused on the craft to look for blinking lights to make sure it wasn&#39;t an airplane but I didn&#39;t see any lights at all, it was just solid white.  I thought it was very unusual and as I kept my eyes focused on the object it just suddenly disappeared. It didn&#39;t fly away like an airplane, the craft or object just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/6/14 03:45|Jackson|MI|Unknown|40 minutes|Object originally thought to be airplane skipped half of the sky while surrounded my columns of light.|1/16/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106237.html|540|ndxe201401| Object originally thought to be airplane skipped half of the sky while surrounded my columns of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am from Horton, Michigan, just south of Jackson, Michigan.  Last weekend I saw something that I will never ever forget. It was the night (or morning rather) of the huge snow storm, January 5, 2014.  I am a security guard and was stationed at Tenneco in Grass Lake, Michigan until 11:00pm.  At 10:40pm my relief called to tell me that he was stuck and was unable to get to work.  I offered to come pull him out with my 4x4 F-150, but I also got stuck.  We made it back to our work and were going to wait it out when I found someone to pull my truck out.  After getting un-stuck,  I got on I-94 via exit 150 heading west towards my house.  I realized that it was 3:45 am (January 6, 2014 at this point) and that Coast to Coast was on, so I turned on the radio and started to listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of driving, and after passing exit 145,  I noticed that I could see what I can only describe as columns of light in the sky.  At first I just saw one, and thought it was a spot light.  But then I notice a couple of others.  It seemed strange and being that I was listening to Coast to Coast, my mind was open to all sorts of possibilities and I paid attention to every detail.  They didn’t seem to start from the sky nor from the ground, they were just there.  The light was not super bright, which is why I did not notice it at first.  There were nine of them, spaced equally apart, the same distance from me, and all the same brightness, surrounding me in a semi-circle.  There may have been some behind me, but I didn’t turn around to look because I was driving in dangerous weather.  Anyways, the columns of light were like perfect cylinders, the same width throughout. I couldn’t tell how far away or how wide they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when it got even stranger.  Since it was still snowing, the sky was rather dark, although I could see a few stars through a couple breaks in the clouds.  I noticed a peculiar star and I realized that it wasn’t a star but a plane, because the light started blinking (as lights on planes do).  I watched it travel across the sky when all of a sudden it seemed to skip the whole horizon.  It started on my right (I saw it through the very right side of the windshield) and I watched it blink about five or six times and then stopped blinking for one or two seconds and all of a sudden was way to left (outside of the driver’s side window) and continued to blink. The whole time this was happening,  I could still see the beams of light.  I could see them for the whole drive home, about 35 minutes, until I turned off of the highway and started driving on back-roads through the country where the trees were blocking my view.<n>

Air traffic had to be shut down and numerous flights have been either redirected to Hamburg and Munich airport or been completely cancelled as air control spotted a UFO on their radar.  The UFO would disappear and reappear on the radar for full three hours, a helicopter was dispatched to investigate the territory but couldn&#39;t detect anything. the UFO was invisible to the naked eye, but was picked up by the radar.  Air control was highly alert and closed the air space as the security responsibles felt threatened by the unknown presence hovering over the aiport.<n>

I went for a walk up the hill from our home on Sunday, January 5, 2014, between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m.  It was still light, but the sun had just gone down behind the mountain top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I headed back down the hill toward home I noticed what looked like a flock of about 12-15 white/gray birds about the size of a seagull.  The odd thing was that each bird looked as though it had a LED headlight on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this is a hilly area we see many hawks that soar and glide through the valley areas.  These birds did not flap their wings, but glided overhead and then down into the valley area below and out of sight.  They were not in formation, but silently flew in a loose flock, soaring left and right together.  I have never seen anything like it before.  It was a puzzle to me what could cause the bright light on each bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today (1-15-14,) I decided to Google &#34;birds with headlights&#34; and was very surprised to see a picture and video of what I saw!  The video was from January 2013 and apparently taken in Guadalajara!  They were calling them UFO&#39;s.  I would be interested to find out more information.<n>
1/5/14 12:00|Spokane|WA|Sphere|15 minutes|Shiny spherical object traveling across sky SE-NW direction, hovers for 10 mins in NW, then leaves in N-S direction.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106538.html|547|ndxe201401| Shiny spherical object traveling across sky SE-NW direction, hovers for 10 mins in NW, then leaves in N-S direction<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my kitchen making lunch and I noticed my neighbors (about 5 of them, one who is retired military) were all outside talking, pointing and looking at the sky, and one of them had binoculars.  So I went out to see what was up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was noon and the sky was absolutely clear of clouds. I observed was a spherical object moving across the sky, coming from the SE, headed in a NW direction. It was moving at a steady speed, slower than a satellite, maybe as fast as an airplane that was REALLY high (so I am guessing around 500-800 miles per hour).  The object appeared to be higher than most aircraft fly around here, but still definitely within the atmosphere.  It was extremely shiny.  It glinted a lot as it reflected the bright noon-time sunshine.  The light it reflected was white, which gave me the impression that the object was silvery and metallic.  It was hard to make out any details other than light, but because it was so evenly reflective, it seemed like it must have had a smooth surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved at a constant speed across much of the sky, about 75 degrees above the NE horizon once directly overhead, all the way from the SE horizon until almost to the NW horizon, in about 5 minutes time, until it stopped and just sat in one spot about 25 degrees above the horizon for about 10 minutes.  It still seemed round and very shiny.  I thought it was a single light, but my husband and my daughter thought they could sometimes see two &#34;lights,&#34; very, very close together.  It glinted a lot, like the object or the surface was moving ever so slightly, even while seemingly standing still.  There was never a time when there was not light reflecting from the object; it just changed in intensity, like a silver beaded windchime blowing in the breeze (but without any visible change in direction).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a bit, the object started to move again, toward the South, at the same speed as before. It soon went behind my neighbor&#39;s trees, from my vantage point, and the object was so far away and it was so bright outside that I couldn&#39;t find it again.  After a bit, the neighbors lost it too and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting, there were no other aircraft in the sky (which is not very common around here, since the Spokane Airport and Fairchild Air Force Base are only about 10 miles away). However, about 10 minutes after the UFO disappeared, I noticed two airplanes in the sky (with an obvious airplane shape to each of them, as opposed to the UFO), and both left distinct contrails. The UFO had left no trails at all, even though it was traveling at jet speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO did not give off any sound that was audible to me, but neither did those two airplanes, so it doesn&#39;t mean the craft didn&#39;t make noise way up high. If I were to guess, I would say this object was larger than a Boeing 747, but not more than twice as large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting, it seemed like there was more airplane traffic than usual, but it may just been because we were looking to the sky more than usual. Again, we live close to an airport and a base, so airplanes are common in our skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that makes this sighting stand out to me is the fact that the object had been moving in a NW direction, stopped and hovered in one spot for several minutes, and then started moving in a S direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No airplane I have ever seen can hover like that, nor does it look round. Drones have wings or arms for rotors, so they should look more irregular than a sphere, and they shouldn&#39;t be as large as this was. No helicopter I have ever seen appears to be silver and round and that large when that high in the air (one would have been a speck). The ISS and satellites do not stop and then change direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never before seen a UFO and I was so shocked by this sighting that I watched, dumbfounded. I was worried I wouldn&#39;t be able to locate it again if I went for my camera, plus I wasn&#39;t sure if my camera would capture more than a glinty speck because the object was so far away. After the fact, I regret that I didn&#39;t dash quickly for my cell phone and get a video of this so as to share it with friends and family.<n>

Upon gazing at Vega i see two oval shaped pale yellowish but pointed ends instead of round.  There was no light of any kind the housing and street lights made the objects visible.  There was also no sound what so ever total silence.  They had mass whether these were entities or a type of flying device i do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both came down at a very fast rate of speed and almost vertical, while both objects were positioned at 45 degree angles dull looking surfaces.  One was ahead of the other by 6 feet as both objects got with in 15 to 20 feet from the top of my next door neighbors home, began to dramatically slow their high rate of speed which tells me these objects were not falling or crashing out of the sky but landing.  They were identical to one another about a foot in length and half a foot across thickness unknown.  After they went lower the house blocking my view i quickly went inside for fear of who knows what the heck is in my next door neighbors backyard right now.  Did not stick around to see if they left or still there or what.<n>

It was flying the opposite direction from me and when I looked back to try to see it again it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As it got closer, the object appeared to be a flaming chevron or bow shape that was glowing and smoldering like a fire.  The object appeared to completely stop when it was directly south of my backyard, then change direction, moving north toward my home, then stopped again, turning 180 degrees in a half circle motion back to the southern horizon until my view was obstructed by a home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not make any engine or propeller noise while I observed it and also seemed to change direction in a controlled and deliberate manner.  Visibility was clear and moon, stars and constellations could be clearly seen.<n>

I saw what looked like a Roman candle rise up into the sky.  I had been looking southeast.  The object did not dissipate into the air, but instead, started to fly north, in the eastern sky.  It looked like a flaming orange stingray.  For a moment I thought it was a plane on fire.  It continued on and finally disappeared behind a building. It seemed to be flying at the same speed as a regular airplane.  A few seconds later, I saw an orange globe flying from south to north.  This one did not rise up from the same spot as the first one.  It went over the building, and immediately after, another one followed.  These two were also flying at airplane speed.  I do not recall if I heard any sounds coming from these objects.<n>

We were standing near 44th Street and Indian School in Phoenix when I saw it approaching from the north.  I at first though it was an airliner going towards Sky Harbor airport but it was to bright and glowing to be an airliner.  It traveled in a straight line at a constant speed towards us then when it was over us it went directly upward between the planet Jupiter &amp; the star Pollux which were both clearly visible right overhead.  I am a pilot and am familiar with many types of aircraft but have never seen one that acted like this one. It was a clear night with no clouds and a partial moon.  The object gave off a fuzzy reddish light and seemed to have an underlying structure with some other smaller lights.  There were other aircraft visible in the distance at the same time and the police helicopter flew nearby about 15 minutes after ! the sighting.  It moved noticeably faster than the jets flying below 10,000 feet in the area and it made no sound.  I was not able to determine the altitude but it appeared larger than the airlines we frequently see flying over.  I got one photo with my iPhone which only showed an elongated light as it was ascending.  I would like to know if any one else witnessed the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As i start pointing my laser at this object i notice that it is moving and not moving in a single direction as you would see with a satellite.  this thing starts moving left, right, side to side almost trying get out of my beam as i point at it, i do this for about 2 mins until i start feeling like i should tell some one but know one at my home was home and nor where any of my neighbors in their backyards .<n> <n><n> <n><n> So what do i do ? well, i thought since i am seeing this and i cant tell know one nor video tape it i get the idea to start circling the object as to attract people to looking at it instead of me pointing a laser directly on it.  i want to add that this idea came because i live along side the 710 fwy and i know for a fact people can see my beam from far so i new i can maybe get some people in traffic to see it and i hopefully was successful with that cause what happen next gave me the chills up and down my spine and i still have the chills as i write this. also i want to add that this isn&#39;t the first time i seen something i cant identify, but it is the first time i ever interacted with one .<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i start circling the object it get more aggressive to moving away from the light as if knowing i am circling it and in doing so giving up its position , i continue to do so and it keeps trying get out of the circle i put it in, i then notice that when ever the beam would be in front of its direction it will quickly move away from it as if it was scared of crossing it as weird as it sounds.  i know this wasn&#39;t a satellite nor a plan cause planes cant move that fast nor in the aggressive manner this object moved.  I then start to notice that this object is positioning itself over my house , pretty much right over me so at this point i am pointing straight up with my neck looking straight up to the point my neck hurts . i got kinda freaked out at that point even more and start thinking about all abduction movies and thinking maybe this thing is position itself over me to know my location, i don&#39;t know but it really freaked me out . now my laser starts dying which emits a le! ss visible beam that can bee seen , at this same time i notice the object starts to also fade but still remains over what looks to me like its directly over me but just in the heavens with the stars pretty much hanging out flying around. my laser then dies and honestly i felt alone at that moment cause i was in complete darkness and it hit me that what i was seeing was real and was interacting with me and my laser beam . i stare at it for a couple mins more , noticing that its not really moving anymore but staying directly above me where it positioned itself in the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my lasers off,i am in darkness, i start getting more freaked out thinking that maybe its gonna get me , beam me up , i just start thinking of all the movies i seen with people interacting with ufo&#39;s which never end well. i wont lie i start feeling fear in me and something telling me go inside the house and recharge my laser. i do so , and decide to report for the first time an experience i have with a ufo that to me is the scariest encounter i have ever had the privilege of seeing . since a kid i have star gazed, i am 29. i have seen many weird things in the skies i cant explain to this day which i am sure allot of people have seen things many times also if they star gaze frequently thru their life . what i saw was real and i really cant explain any more into detail about it but what i explained . i haven&#39;t gone back outside my house yet and do plan to after i finish this sighting description . honestly i am kinda scared to go back out and look at the sky and or see if its s! till in the same spot but i am only because of my curiosity and faith that nothing bad will happen to me .<n> <n><n> <n><n> it looked exactly like a dim star or satellite that moves in a single continues lane that many people i am sure have seen . it didn&#39;t make any different colors it just stayed white like the stars , it moved quick, it moved away from my laser as if it were scared of it or didn&#39;t want to be seen or pointed out. i don&#39;t know what it was but know it wasn&#39;t a plane . i really wish i had someone over tonight to be my witness . i actually bought the laser because i would frequently see things through out my life in the skies, that i just wanted to finally point them out when star gazing and hopefully show other people . sadly i was alone and still am , my report is done and i hope who ever reads this maybe gets the same idea with the laser pointer and or someone saw a green beam pointing along the 710 fwy at an object moving away from my beam in the skies high above the heavens , at 9:00 pm . this is is not a hoax. hopefully some one has seen something similar or interacted with a ! ufo as i have with a high output green laser beam .<n>

It is towards the East from our location and it at first glance looks like a star.  However, it flashes red and blue as well as white, and it moves irratically up , then down, then zigs and zags, yet it stays in the same vicinity of the sky.  We have been watching it for about 10-15 minutes so far.<n>

They appeared individually within fractions of a second of one other coming from the north and heading south.  It appeared as if they all paused for a fraction of a second until all three were directly over the interstate approximately half a mile ahead of me in the horizon.  Once all three were in sight they took off in a slightly different vector but still heading south.  Approximately 3-5 seconds later, two more appeared out of the same direction with the same pause and go route to the south.  From the distance they were from me (approx. half a mile head; unsure of altitude but definitely lower than 500ft) they were about soccer ball size in scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought before really processing the info was fireworks but the angle they appeared over the trees along with the pause, direction change and speed made this very unlikely.  They flew in exacting lines, no arching and there was the obvious pause and go as if they were waiting on their wingman to catch up.  Additionally, the speed at which they appeared and then flashed across the sky from the distance they were from me was too fast for fireworks or even a low flying aircraft.  They were gone across the sky faster than I could turn my head to follow them.<n>

He was so startled he stopped the van and got out to look at what he was seeing.  He said the objects seemed to be following each other as they were going in circles, going straight up into the sky and then down, they also were traveling at a very fast speed and seemed to be traveling from Westwego to almost where I lived which is in Terrytown, La.  I immediately went outside to see if I could see anything but didn&#39;t have a good view of the sky because of trees and other houses in my way.

1/4/14 05:43|Kill Devil Hills|NC|Sphere|2-3 seconds|Orange orb the color of fire lights up, expands in size, then shrinks back to nothingness and disappears, like an explosion in space.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106127.html|579|ndxe201401| Orange orb the color of fire lights up, expands in size, then shrinks back to nothingness and disappears, like an explosion in space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5:40am local time +/-5 minutes, while looking up at the stars before getting into my car to go to work, I saw something a stationary object that looked like a star increase its intensity with an orange glow the color of fire that expanded in size for a few seconds as it got brighter until the star sized object became larger than any planet in the night sky. (Approx 4x the size of Venus on the horizon, but this was almost directly overhead at about 75deg off the horizon towards the NE.  Then it faded back down in size and intensity and disappeared.  It didn&#39;t move from it&#39;s spot in the sky. Just got big and orange and then disappeared.  My immediate thought was that it was  a stationary explosion in space, like a satellite exploded or something.  I didn&#39;t think UFO until later when I heard other people talking about the orange orbs.<n>

Atleast 9 orange globes flying at a high rate of speed in a V formation flying over Greensboro near Muirs Chapel Rd. and W. Market St.  Objects were traveling southward, towards Wendover Ave. and 40 West.  One of the globes was moving side to side, and forward and backward within the V formation but not travel outside of the interior of the formation.  There was no noise, and no blinking lights.  Color was very similar to sodium vapor street lights.  When I first saw it, the object appeared to have a rigid v shape.  As it aproached I was able to see the object moving within the V formation.  I&#39;ve lived around Navy, Airforce, and Marine Corps instalations all my life an have never seen anything like it.  The light from the objects was really soft, there was no &#34;twinkle&#34;.  It was a perfectly clear night without moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

For no particular reason I had been looking at this particular cloud for about 2 minutes when all the sudden an object cone shaped with what looked like red, silver and white colored ropes of light wrapped around it which lit up randomly and not any any constant pattern like you&#39;d see on regular airplanes in flight.  Why I&#39;m convinced this was not anything of earthly origin is because its flight path which wasn&#39;t vertical like all planes, it just went straight up into the night sky, I didn&#39;t hear anything or see any kind of emissions coming from it.  It was visible for a good 20 seconds before it had traveled too far up too see.<n>

It took them a 2 mins of studying them hovering high in the atmosphere flickering, rapidly changing direction and altitude, and trading places in the sky for roughly 5 mins.  Both witnesses took mulitple photographs of the two lights.  It wasn&#39;t until they showed me the pictures of the 2 lights i immediately said theres 5 in the the last couple pictures.  They were taken just a couple mins after spotting them still heading east on Olive blvd.  Now at the intersection of Woodsmill Rd. looking east over the 7-11.  The last photo was taken on olive just before highway 141.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both witnesses have said they are reporting this incident with the full story soon.

I initially thought it was Mars.  I got out of my car to take a closer look and noticed it was moving slowly from north to south then turn to south-west.  The object was larger than typical stars and comparable to venus on a clear night.  The orange orb did not have any blinking lights and did not make a sound.  Either the light disappeared or went behind the clouds.  The phenomenon lasted approximately 5 minutes.   Land marks in my view for reference were my power lines in my back yard.  This is how I know it was moving and turning.  It did not make any abrupt turns or change speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But then it kinda &#39;zoomed&#39; away.  It just became smaller, like it was flying off. It literally happened in seconds, and it shot off so fast I thought it had disappeared.  Only when I thought about it did I realize it had &#39;stretched&#39; (leaving a trail) in a different direction before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its coloring was like lighting.  Pure white in the center and edged with a very striking blue light. When it took off it got a very long tail of the same coloring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t see it for long, but I was kind of surprised by it, honestly.<n>

I had a day off from work and I decided to work on our shed.  We appear to be in the flight path for the IFR approach into San Jose, CA International Airport, so I hear airplanes go over all the time.  We have a smaller airport very close and these smaller airplanes will fly over the house.  All of these flights appear to be at least 2,000 to 8,000 ft AGL.  As the strange noise became more evident I looked up and saw a long, thin, silver cigar looking object moving fast from south to north.  It appeared that it was using the same direction that the larger jets use for the approach into SJC.  I noticed a greenish plum of &#34;smoke&#34; coming from the end of the object.  The object moved quickly and was only in my sights for approximately five seconds.  The noise was like a faint blowing sound.  The object was just faint enough to be seen and there were no clouds in the sky that day.  ! It was a beautiful day.  As a 5k plus hour pilot I have seen strange things before; lightning coming out of the top of clouds, green objects shooting down toward the earth (meteorites), jets traveling very fast toward me and passing me within less than a mile.  I am very sure what I saw.  I have no need to make crazy stuff up.....I did find that someone else had seen something similar to what I saw but am not aware of his location.  It was on the internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your website.<n>

They could have been between Oakland and Hayward, perhaps just east of Oakland Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I observed these lights from a porch in the North Berkeley hills from which we have a good view of the San Francisco Bay due west and to the south though trees block some of the vista.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom light was a few degrees above the landscape.  Above it was a larger and brighter light.  Then a third light west of that one forming a right sided triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the lights pulsate for a few minutes and grow in intensity till they were perhaps twice as bright as the Oakland dockyard lights.  We then descended to the street as my sister was leaving.  From the sidewalk, I observed a white shooting star directly overhead moving northwest towards the North Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned back up to the porch and saw the light formation, which had dimmed. The third, westernmost light moved off.  With binoculars, I was able to make out additional details of the bigger of the two remaining lights.  The main amber light was central, below it was a small red light and on the upper right was a small green light.  All lights were constant with no pulsing.  There was no visible structure behind the lights viewed through the binoculars I set up a Canon 5d2 on a tripod.  I shot RAW stills and video for 2 hrs. with an 85mm and a 200mm lens.  The first pictures were taken around 23:10 pm and the last images around 00:45 am.  My mother observed the lights as well.  The lights were never as luminous during this period as when first spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a number of helicopters and airplanes moving about.  The lights generally hovered over the Oakland area but several times moved west over the San Francisco Bay, just south of the Oakland Bay Bridge.  It seemed as if the lights would move out over the bay when helicopter activity stepped up.  After perhaps a quarter of an hour they moved back. At this point, there was usually just one light.  The second would occasionally reappear, then either move off or fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the lights, when moving back towards Oakland continued east over the Oakland hills and disappeared from view.  The lights usually moved at a leisurely pace, but occasionally very quickly, relative to the planes and helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times, the lights would fade out and then fade up while over Oakland.  They would also periodically move vertically down, then back up again.  They always returned to the same approximate area around Oakland, at slightly different altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon inspection of the RAW images, I have one object over the Bay with more discernible structure but I’m not sure if it is one of the lights or an airplane. You can make out a solid red light on the lower left end, perhaps a thin structure in the middle and a smaller green light at the upper right end. In the video, this light seems to flicker, appears as a tandem light and isn’t as bright as the Oakland lights so it might be a plane.  It seemed to me that the airplanes had a red light on one wing and a green light on the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The problem was, the ‘UFO’ lights would occasionally move behind a tree in the foreground. Planes from SFO would also come from behind the trees, though on different trajectories and I would occasionally end up tracking those.  However, these made jet engine noise, had visible structures, etc. as they got closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle in the RAW stills is moving northeast, then on the next clip, a video, it reverses and heads southwest.  Then a faster moving solid bright light from the north swoops past it and heads back to the Oakland area.  The vehicle in the RAW still continues south with blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Oakland light moved off west again around 00:45am and disappeared behind a tree.  It did not seem to drift over the Bay again south of the Bay Bridge.  I packed up the gear and went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the Oakland lights again the following day, Friday, 01/03/14 at approximately 18:30 along with a friend of mine as we were leaving. I saw it again at 22:00. I did not videotape this time.  They may have appeared on one more night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving south on the I5 freeway on Friday, 01/10/14, around 18:30, between Patterson and Newman, I observed another white shooting star moving southwest.  A piece of debris separated from the main body and trailed off before it dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always had an interest in UFOs but have never observed anything unusual in the sky before.<n>

It was lower than the normal air traffic that typically passes the same area.  At first I thought it was a Chinese lantern.  I stopped my vehicle and watched the orange ball slowly float upwards.  The night was fairly clear and the object seemed to be below the clouds present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute of slow upwards movement the object began to move horizontally to the south.  My view was looking west northwest and tracked the object to the west southwest before the light faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to estimate the speed but it not seem to be faster than the aircraft I typically observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also observed the same object the following night at a different location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of January 4, 2014 I noticed the same orange globe over Pelican Baseball Field. It was around 22:30 and slightly raining.  I was again facing west observing the object. It appeared to be at the western end of the field possibly over the neighborhood west of the field.  Height was undeterminable due to the rainy, overcast condition of the night sky.  The only reference on height was that it was higher than the field lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short time, about 30 seconds to a minute, the orange light made a few erratic movements and then began to head in my direction.  It slowly moved directly at me maintaining its altitude or possibly gaining.  I lost sight of the object as it flew over my vehicle.  I was not able to find it once I started my car and began to head north on Pelican.<n>

When I got there she pointed out an object moving through the clear night sky.  The view was unobstructed, it appeared to omit an orange colour, was clearly either larger or closer than a plane but with no noise like the many other planes we saw tonight &amp; the lights didn&#39;t flash like a plane does either.  It was a strange feeling as I had never seen something like this before &amp; it slowly moved away from us further East over the hills in the direction of Darlington.  My wife said it sped up, stopped &amp; changed directions more than anything else would. 5 minutes later I saw what I thought was another one in another direction &amp; higher up in the sky.  This one was the same colour as the stars but I think it was more likely a satellite as it didn&#39;t change directions plus I know the difference between a satellite &amp; a shooting star as I&#39;ve seen them many times before.<n>

Temperatures will reach below 30 degrees.  As I was checking to make sure the tarp didn&#39;t fly off our truck bed, I spotted a VERY bright light just over the trees.  Light was very similar to a spotlight &amp; moved around like one so I assumed it may have been a low flying helicopter.  I noticed it was not accompanied by any sound nor did it have any blinking lights like normal aircrafts.  It was ENTIRELY too low to be a star.  After starring non-stop at the light for about 10-15 seconds, it disappeared. I continued to watch for anything moving and thats when I saw 2 very dim lights moving very slowly in opposite directions, but directly alined with each other.  These lights appeared to be very far away, not as far as the stars, but further aways then the very bright light I initially spotted. As they got further &amp; further apart, I lost them.  I didn&#39;t see anything after that, but a few airplanes (which I knew were regular aircrafts), but I know that the lights could not have been normal aircrafts.<n>

After about 5 minuets the object moved at a high rate of speed heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard on the police scanner, that the local sheriff&#39;s office has also received a call about the same object and a deputy was dispatched to the area.

As we got back to the main road though, the red and orange orb was back hovering over the mountainside again where it &#34;blinked&#34; off and back on occasionally.  It appeared fairly close but made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about ten minutes before we drove away not wanting to scare the kids who were already a little shaken by it.<n>

Suddenly we were amazed to find a flashing light to the upper left of the moon.  I am not talking about Venus to the lower right. We stared at this light flash red, white, then seem to flare a beam off either at or directly away from the moon, occasionally going out for a second at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes of this we noticed a few jets flying excessively fast, and extremely loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not commercial, and had strange/irrelevant flashing patterns. We watched them cross our visible sky within a minute and one in particular changed directions 3 times .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due north, due east, then due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after this we saw several strange objects, planes or otherwise, all heading due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started looking to the south and saw two, non-blinking perfectly white circles.

It hovered for about a minute and a half maybe longer in silence.  Then the bright green light suddenly dropped in the sky and proceded to descend in a very fast and strange zig zag formation until it dropped out of our line of sight, over by the Encino CA, area.  The track of houses were also disrupting my line of sight, after the strange descent of the green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was scared and my husband who wants to leave this entire thing alone however, was in agreement that this wasn&#39;t a common helicopter light like the one&#39;s we are used to seeing every day and night, being the Van Nuys airport is 3 miles away from where we live.  This time was different!  We have seen everything from the police helicopters, to the infrared helicopters and the sesna! planes and private jet lights as well as the common passenger and cargo planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However this time the direction of this green light or object in the sky was over towards Ventura Blvd. and Busway, which is opposite the direction of The Van Nuys Airport, CA.  I am not sure what it was.  However I felt the need to report it because I want to validate what it was I saw, almost as if I am hopping for an explanation other than that of what my gut is telling me,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

I had walked up to the top of my street (which is approximately a 32° angle uphill), and turned the corner walking to the right and past the first house on the right.  My dog then stopped to use the bathroom in the grass, while I stood there looking north, staring off into the dark between the large clearing of two houses.  (This would be looking in the direction as if I were at the top of my street looking down).  I saw what looked at first to be just airplane lights, red and blue, out of the corner of my eye.  Didn&#39;t think much, until I realized these lights were moving usually fast.  So I turned my attention directly on them, and within a few seconds, saw the lights stop and hover, and then all of a sudden they made a complete &#34;sideways U-turn&#34; and started headed east.  I literally said out loud, &#34;What ((deleted)) is that??!!&#34; (talking to my dog).  Just as quickly, the lights swerved back to the left (west), and flew for just a second until it stopped and hovered again! I proceeded to get my phone camera out to videotape, and as soon as I pulled the video application up, the red light in the sky went out, leaving just this fluorescent blue light, which suddenly dropped straight down, quick as lightning! Like it just fell from the sky.  I focused my camera on where I thought the light had dropped, and caught it on camera shooting straight back up..  it then dropped down once more, which I saw with my eyes, but did NOT catch on camera (even though my camera was focused right on it) and between messing with my phone, I did not see the light come back up.  About a minute later I saw both red and blue lights in the sky again, seeming to fly north until they just disappeared suddenly.  It was the strangest, scariest, yet most exciting experience I&#39;ve ever seen…  I didn&#39;t even think it was real.  I asked my dog, &#34;Did that really just happen!?&#34;  It happened so quick, I literally almost doubted myself.  But there is no doubt about what I saw.  There was definitely SOMETHING there, and it was NOT NORMAL, and NOT an optical illusion...  I cannot explain it to be anything other than a UFO.<n>

They hovered, without making a sound, up the Mississippi River not very high in the sky.  We saw the first one and was in awe of what it might be.  A second then a third followed perfectly separated in distance - all three were identical.  I have never seen anything like this before or since.  I thought it quite odd and came to this site after going out to look at the bright full moon last night- May 15, 2014 and saw 6 odd, very far away bright stars with 5 red lights on their outer edge.  The first three I thought at first were stationed in the sky like a perfect triangle.  I then looked behind me and found 2 more just like the other 3.  They didn&#39;t seam to be moving.  I will be checking that spot again tonight to see if it is out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I walked onto the Common from the NW corner and immediately saw a bright orange light in the sky. At  first, through the trees, I thought it might be a planet and marked its position so I could check on it again when I got to open space. When I did, it had moved and was closer. Being near Logan Airport, I first thought plan or helicopter but there were no blinking lights and it receded to the South South East. At this time I was out on open ground and the first light was out of sight, I saw another single orange light approach from the SW (from my perspective, approaching from the left side of the Hancock tower). It approached at speed, hovered for a minute or two, and then receded to the SSE. At this point there were other people walking through the Common and also looking up, seeing the bright orange light and remarking at it. After the second light was out of sight a third fo! llowed the exact same trajectory in, hovered and receded to the SSE. I decided to go inside, proceeded to tell my wife about the lights and looked out the window to see if there was another out there and there was. I grabbed my binoculars and what I thought I could see was the bright orange light and 2/3rds of whitish eggish shape to the bottom.  This light, like the others, receded to the SSE. I periodically checked out the window the remainder of the evening and saw no other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of other notes: While I was out on the Common, I saw 2 large jetliners take off from Logan and come relatively close to these lights. One of those two times, I thought it was dangerously close,  but it allowed to give a guess at the altitude of the lights, which I would say was between 1,000-2,000 feet.  Also, while I could clearly hear the sound that the jets taking off we&#39;re making, and a helicopter to the North, these lights made no sound that I could hear. While I am aware of Chinese Lanterns, these lights each approached at what I would call &#34;aircraft speeds&#34;, hovered and receded at 90 degree angle from origin at a similar speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live about 5 miles north of downtown Pittsburgh, PA.  I just happened to look up at the sky (there were no stars this night) and saw two orange-red lights slowly moving through the sky side by side.  I thought it was a plane at first.  The two lights then separated from each other and slowly moved apart and then stopped completely and just hovered in the air.  Then, two more orange-red lights appeared right in the area of the original two.  There were now four orange-red lights hovering in the air, not moving at all and all were approximately the same size but, one of the original two lights was the biggest of all four.  Three of the four lights began disappearing and reappearing in roughly the same spot over the next 5 to 10 minutes.  During this time I used my compass on my IPhone and found that the objects were in the southeast sky (I also got some of the lights on video b! ut, it is a bit grainy).  The entire time these objects were disappearing and reappearing, one of the lights, the biggest one of the four, remained illuminated and appeared to slowly grow in size.  Then the large steady orange-red light began dropping smaller orangish balls of light from it.  It dropped about three smaller orange colored lights, which would travel straight down and then disappear after 2 or 3 seconds.  After this occurred, all four of the lights illuminated and moved slowly north, with three of them disappearing again.  The large steady orange-red light traveled out of direction with the other three and headed almost exactly in the direction I was standing at in front of my house.  When it began getting close enough where I could see the object really growing in size and see that there was more to the object than just the orange light, it disappeared.  This same light then reappeared about 30 seconds later, dropped one more orange colored light from it and ! completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this area of the sky for the next 20 minutes and may have briefly seen an orange light but, nothing like what I first witnessed.  I did see several helicopters in this area in the next 20 minutes but, I am not sure if the two are related.<n>

1/1/14 18:46|San Diego|CA|Unknown|45 seconds|Two dark objects less than two miles away, moving east then separating and accelerating north at a miraculous rate of speed.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105893.html|629|ndxe201401| Two dark objects less than two miles away, moving east then separating and accelerating north at a miraculous rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my balcony looking west from Rancho Bernardo California, toward the hills above the neighborhood called Westwood, separating North County East from North County West and the Coast. Something caught my eye as flying toward me below the horizon of the hill. Being after dark, I first thought it was an unusually large bird with white tipped wings, but they began to glide north and moved above the horizon, one object began moving ahead and bit faster than the other. With the light of the horizon I began to get my depth of field and could see the two objects were moving north at an extremely fast rate of speed. They continued to remain between my location and the hills, so their distance was less than two miles away.  Their altitude continued to be much lower than the ceiling for the airplanes in the area. I have never seen a UFO before and there was no possible way these were airplanes or anything of earthly origin. They were not very large, but they were! not extremely small like the orbs occasionally described either. They were moving extremely smoothly and at a rate of speed even as they began to increase altitude, as if there was no resistance and the moved far faster than any aircraft we have and making no sound at all. Being so close, there should have been some sound. The movement was much more like gliding, only at an extremely high rate of speed. Just after the forward craft began to distance its self slightly from the craft in the rear, they both accelerated and disappeared heading north.  The light omitted from these craft was constant and white with no blinking or other coloration.  The craft themselves was dark or shadowy, and impossible to make out.  The lights were dimmer than I would have guessed from descriptions that I have heard of UFO sightings in the past and even compared to other aircraft in the area that were much higher and further away.  Due to the flight path of planes moving south from Los Angeles, th! ere were several airplanes in the area, although none in the direct pa th north, south or west of the craft.  The sighting lasted roughly 20-40 seconds.  I doubt very seriously that I was the only one to see these.<n>

I noticed approximately 6 or more very bright lights in a row moving from north to south. The lights were very high in the sky, at the level of the highest stars I could see. They all blinked separately, yet in close intervals. At one point, one of the lights broke away from the line and traveled back in a northern direction.  It quickly shot back into the line yet followed behind the line a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran down our stairs to the back door to call my wife and daughter.  They quickly came outside and saw what I described above.  The line of lights had moved quite a bit south by now.  As my wife looked closely (her eyes are better than mine), she noticed more than 6 lights.  She said she could see faint lights in an oval or triangular shape behind the brighter lights.  She and my daughter saw the lights moving at a slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The row of lights often changed formation, but ended back in a row eventually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter tried to video the lights with her iphone, but they were too high to film.  We did shoot for a while and you can hear our audio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the lights disappeared in the southern sky, we all confirmed with each other that we had never seen anything like this.  And, we believe it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point we thought it might be the international space station, but the lights moved.<n>

The light was shaped like an egg.  The object  flashed like a strobe light.  The top 2/3 of the shape flashed white while the bottom was flashing red.  The two colors flashed together.  The object hovered.  I observed it for about 10 minutes.  When I turned my head to call someone to see the light in the sky, it was gone.  At that time I went inside very quickly and talked about what was seen.  I posted my sighting on Face Book to see if anyone saw the light in my area.  Someone wrote that others in Bradenton, FL.  Saw lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw this object in the dark sky,  I had a strange feeling go through my body.  I knew there weren&#39;t any lights in our area and it had to be a UFO.  I do not know how long it was hovering in the sky.  Wow!  I never thought that I would see something that could not be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a female teacher.

They were moving diagonally from each other, then the 2 round lights/spheres disappeared and the original ball flew up above us quickly.  After some time hovering above us (above plane altitude) it disappeared out of our atmosphere.  I have some poor footage of the sighting   :(<n>

I watched it for a minute waiting for what I thought was a &#34;firework&#34; to react, but it just stood in the sky.  As we were driving it still stayed in the same spot and we got just about beneath it.  It was low and appeared as if something was on fire. It never made any sound or had any flames dropping as if a plane or helicopter were on fire.  I definitely don&#39;t know of any firework to stay in the air for longer than a minute or so let alone 5 minutes, silently at that.  It stayed in the same spot for about 2-3 minutes, before I mentioned it to the driver. We pulled over to get a better look.  After fumbling for our phones to record and take pictures for a minute or so, it started to fly east like airplane speed and disappeared in the clouds.  It was very low like a helicopter, staying in one spot, and it looked like something was on fire or a fiery ball.<n>

I was a little scared when they didn&#39;t burn out like a firework ember would.  They drifted over the house and &#34;blinked out&#34; right before they hit the tree line behind the house.  They were a glowing orange-red, sphere shaped.  I researched it, and there was no military testing or anything in the area at that time.<n>

We saw a single light, looked like a fireball and we thought it was an aircraft with bright lights as the weather was a bit foggy.  About one minute later we saw another “light” closely following the first.  We went outside onto our porch as this seemed strange as aircrafts do not follow that closely and suprisingly there were no sounds as a low flying aircraft would make.  Then we saw another light following the 2nd.  There were therefore, three of these “fireball” type lights travelling in a horizontal motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the 1st light slowed down and descended toward the ocean or probably some other direction and faded.  The other two continued on, maintained a distance within each other and did the same.  By the time we got our camera out, it was gone.  It is 1.18 am and the fog has cleared at least by 50% and we are now wondering if these unidentified flying objects, “fireballs”, were using the fog as a cover whilst travelling.  Interesting Indeed would not believe unless we saw.  Amazing, there really are things out there.<n>

We had just dropped her off at home and stopped at a store to pick up some champagne to go home and celebrate.  Being New Year’s Eve I feel it is incredibly important to stress that we were sober and hadn’t had anything to drink, not even a sip.   While at a stop light, I looked out my husband’s window, he was driving, and saw these three strange orange lights high in the sky.  I asked my husband if he thought they were airplanes or helicopters but their behaviors were unlike any helicopter of plane we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three orange lights were grouped together but as we watched they spread out and formed a triangle.  My husband told me to take out my phone and record what was happening but I was too shocked and in awe of what we were witnessing.  The triangle of lights then moved as if they were going to align in a straight line pointing down.  Our stop light turned green so I urged my husband to pull into a parking lot.  As we were pulling into the parking lot, two of the lights just disappeared.  The remaining light flickered a couple times, maybe twice before disappearing.  We sat in the car for a few minutes waiting to see if the lights would return but they did not.<n>

They were orange in color like the color of an incent lit.  We observed these objects for about seven minutes.  I even tried to record them on my ipod but it didnt come out to good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes into the sighting the two outer objects began to move up towards the middle one.  I forgot to mention they were in a triangle formation.  Then the outer objects began to disappear behind some clouds, but the object in the middle was still visible and bright.  Then it started to slowly move north, then it to disappeared behind the clouds also. Me and my children were freaked out about what we saw.  We will never forget that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a father of four children, two girls and two boys. My oldest daughter is eleven.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My other daughter is ten.  My two boys are five and one years old.  There is no way that we are lying about this since my children saw the object with me.  I have seen objects in the sky before.  It was just surprising to see the objects with my children present.<n>
1/1/14 00:47|Fort Worth|TX|Oval|2 minutes|Orange ball stationary in sky above neighborhood south of Fort Worth before leaving northbound.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105925.html|654|ndxe201401| Orange ball stationary in sky above neighborhood south of Fort Worth before leaving northbound<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving northbound out of the Carson Ranch estates, north of Crowley and south of Fort Worth TX, my daughter and I observed an orange light or “thing” floating completely motionless above the neighborhood at an altitude of what I perceived to be between 50 and 100 ft.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere. The sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was some kind of flaring firework because people had been setting off fireworks in the area as the New Year began 45 minutes prior.  We were baffled that this “firework” was suspended motionless in the air as we were driving past it.  It was more baffling that, upon further observation, the light appeared to be an illuminated, orange ball hovering in the sky.  It did not appear perfectly round like a sphere; but, rather, it looked more ecliptic or egg shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was to the right, or east, of us by a perceived 200 or 300 meters away.  After looking at it for about 15 or 20 seconds as we were driving by, the object suddenly started moving!  It travelled northward.  Neither my daughter nor I heard any noise emanating from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With my curiosity peaked, I proceeded to “chase” the object and turned eastbound as it continued northbound, east of us.  The object appeared to start accelerating and gaining altitude as I drove under its path of flight.  At this point, I got my phone camera rolling. I turned northbound at the next street.  However, the object was now going too fast to catch up while driving down residential roads.  I stopped my car and continued filming for a few more seconds until it was too far and faint for the camera to pick up anymore.  However, I could still see it with my eyes as it changed its heading from north to northeast.  I could tell that it changed course by using a street light as a reference point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was moving, its illumination had a slow, subtle pulse to it in about 2 or 3 second intervals, from bright to dim then bright again, repeatedly.  The pulsing was very subtle and not immediately obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was NO Chinese lantern!  It had started moving from its initial stationary position much too quickly. It was not windy; 5 mph at the most.  This also had too much range and speed to be a remote controlled helicopter.  If it was a drone or UAV, why would it be illuminated orange as a whole?  And why so low?  I am very curious as to what this object could have been.<n>

We reported this occurrence on your UFO website, and also called it into the hotline.  After that incident we went upstairs to retire to bed when we decided to take one last look out of the bedroom window that overlooks the mountains and saw them again.  Ironically, this sighting occurred exactly 3 hours later down to the minute.  We were able it to capture this on my iphone camera.  The quality isn’t very good, but you can see the fireballs floating and pulsating.  They seemed to be floating up into the air over the mountains one by one.  Then they just vanished into thin air like the last time, one by one the top one going first.  The only difference between this sighting and our earlier sighting is that there were only 3 UFO’s this time, and also they did not go into a perfect straight line, but they were lined up vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We returned home at about 00h30, put the kids to bed and went outside to toast one last drink to 2013.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately we heard an overwhelming rumbling sound, too soft to be thunder, we live too far away from the railway for it to be a speeding train and although it sounded like an aircraft hovering we saw no signs of lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband called a couple of his nearby friends who claimed not to have heard it, I made a post on facebook asking the ppl in my area if they&#39;re experiencing the same thing (which later on a couple of them confirmed) and eventually my husband and our next door neighbor walked down the street to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I went inside, climbed into bed with my 2 kids and felt anxious and somewhat afraid, as if an impending doom is upon us.  Apart from hearing this awful sound I also &#34;felt&#34; it move through my body as I laid in bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience lasted for an hour.<n>

No sound and no other lights were noted.  A minute or two later a third orb was seen.  After that a fourth was seen.<n>

My impression was that they were no more than a mile or less away from me.  At first I couldn&#39;t tell if they were moving. As I proceeded I did perceive they were moving slowly, not in tandem but the same general direction.  They didn&#39;t seem to be joined.  They move towards the southwest, almost paralleling my route.  NO other lights or “navigational lights” were seen.  After about 2 minutes the light farthest west of me disappeared.  Followed by the second one at approximately the same point in the sky a minute later.  I could not determine if they just turned off the lights or flew above the cloud layer or just disappeared. VERY weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about what I had just seen.  A minute or so later I had the urge to look at the same spot where I had first seen them to see if there would be more and much to my shock there were EIGHT more strung out over I would guess a distance between a half to one mile long.  There was no type of &#34;formation&#34; to them, just scattered across the sky.  All exactly the same color and intensity as the prior two.  They followed the same movement as the first two.  Again they didn&#39;t seem to be joined together in any way. I watched them as I continued driving for the next 2-3 min.  I finally got so frustrated that I had pay attention to driving I simply stopped the car in the road got out in the light rain to watch them unimpeded.  I watched for another 2-3 min.  Again my impression, based on the low cloud cover, was they couldn&#39;t have been more that a mile away from me.  Probably placing the one closest to me no more that a half a mile maybe less.  I could hear NO sound coming from them.  I even cupped my hands behind my ears for at least a minute to try and determine if they were engine driven. NO sound.  They then began to “disappear” one at a time just as the prior two had.  WIERD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was exhilarated and could wait to get home and tell my wife. I was very disappointed that I was so close to home but could make it there to rouse my wife to see them in time.  Well one more time as I turned down my street I looked back to the same spot and once again I COULDN&#39;T BELIEVE IT, there in the sky were two more.  Same as the last 10. I raced inside to get my wife up to see them.  She WASN&#39;T happy.  Until she looked out the bedroom window to see them.  We watched them for a couple of minutes till they followed the others to the southwest and finally “disappeared”.  Made no sense to her either.  Now she can&#39;t say I&#39;m crazy.<n>

Less than a minute later, another one followed the same path, but a couple of degrees to the south.  As the second one was rising, a third, very close to the second, followed the same path.  Uncannily, all three had the same size, shape, color, and path.  The second and the third were available for viewing at the same time for the majority of viewable time.  After the third exited the atmosphere, a fourth started to rise.  This one veered in a slightly southern facing arch, then redirected vertically &amp; then disappeared. . . out of the atmosphere- just like the 3 previous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, it is New Year&#39;s Eve.  Yes, we are not all that far from Cape Canaveral.  These were not fireworks, airplanes, or anything we are able to explain.  Did anyone else see this occur?<n>

I went out side to smoke a cigarette when I saw a very bright red object lifting from the south east I believe.  It was a bright red that I have never seen before.  I watched for about 5 min until I thought that it was so strange I needed to get it on video.  I grabbed my camera from my bedroom and it was steady rising I started recording.  The object got above the tree line, stopped and hovered and just blinked out and just seemed to disappear.  I never saw it again!<n>

A car had just skidded off the road into the side of my neighbor&#39;s house not far away.  It was New Year’s Eve and we listened to people in the area setting off fireworks, but none were visible from my street.  We were watching the antics with the police and tow truck for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 12:15 AM, my friend pointed out a bright orb that had just appeared in the sky to the west.  The light cast off of the object was far more intense than any airplanes or helicopters we&#39;ve ever seen in the skies, so we caught it all on our phones&#39; video cameras. The light from the object had a much deeper amber-red hue to it, which really caught our attention. It traveled a long, curved path and passed overhead.  The object then ascended vertically at a higher speed, until it was it was out of sight completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later I spotted a second object (matching the description of the first) suddenly appear in the sky, as if it materialized out of thin air.  It eventually flew straight up into the sky like the first, until it could no longer be seen.  A few minutes later a third one had appeared, hovered, ascended, and went out of sight.  All three objects were slow moving, until they changed courses up to the sky and sped up significantly.  We didn&#39;t know what to make of the whole scene in the sky, and we would have filed a report sooner if we had the first clue how to go about doing so.  At least we got some videos of them!

At its closest, I viewed it through binoculars and could only see a flickering amber light (almost like fire).  There were no blinking lights to indicate it was a commercial aircraft.  The speed was similar to that of a commercial jet, but the light was far too large for a plane at that height. It did not seem to make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

It was somewhat hazy toward the horizons but clear overhead, and it seemed they were slowly moving low and underneath the fog.  I grabbed my girlfriend and we both ran outside to get a better look.  When we looked up there were two more orange lights already hovering almost directly overhead, slightly to the southeast.  One was stationary and the other one seemed to hover slowly around it in an irregular pattern.  They two orbs we oringinaly saw came to a stop just to the south of the other two.  They started to fly around each other in a random pattern.  After a few minute the oringinal two orb seemed too get higher and higher towards the southeast until they slowly faded out of sight.  One of the other ones followed about half a minute later.  The stationary light was last and seemed got go straight up until it! faded away.  I was searching the web and have not seen anything else anywhere about this sighting.

I immediately saw two red spheres in the night sky.  I came in and got my camera and started taking photos.  A third sphere joined the other two.  They remained evenly spaced and in a horizontal line.  I continued taking rapid photos, 15 in all.  The spheres appeared to ‘fade’ one at a time  but looking at the photos with zoom, they were still in the pictures and seemed they had left ‘away’ from me to a greater distance.  The photos are time stamped from 1:12 AM thru 1:16 AM because my camera was still set on Daylight Saving Time.  The photos are very interesting when enlarged.  I don’t have television so I didn’t hear of other reports.  My daughter sent me the activity from your site and so I thought I should report what I had seen and photographed.<n>

They appeared to be moving north in more or less a straight line, but not close together.  I observed them for a few seconds, went to my door, and called my wife to come out.  When I looked back up, two of the lights had disappeared.  My wife and I both saw the remaining two lights for a few seconds.  My wife returned to the house, and I saw one of the lights fade out--the fading out was rapid, and I couldn&#39;t tell if it passed behind some clouds or simply went out. I then went back into the house.  At first I thought they might be some sort of fireworks--it was new years, but they seemed to move slowly and in a very orderly way.  They didn&#39;t blink, and I couldn&#39;t see any other lights--like an aircraft might have, for example.  I&#39;ve never seen any aircraft lights that color.<n>

Orange flying somethings. Not blinking and silent. At first we thought embers.  But they were large like planes.  And then they just disappeared. 2 at first, with one breaking away from the other and heading overhed and then they disappeared.  Then 2 more with one ahead and a little lower a few minutes later.  They both disappeared.  All were coming from the WNW going about East except for the one that turned to the ESE.  My husband tried called the non-emergency number to the 911 center and it said it wasn&#39;t working. We are baffled.<n>

We went outside to shoot off illegal fireworks.  My mom and I were in the yard shooting fireworks and my dad, two grandmothers, grandfather, and uncle were up on the porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes in to shooting off bottle rockets we noticed 3 orange orbs in  a isosceles triangle.  They were south of us and we live in landfall putting it over the Eastwood road area.  We were all staring at it and they just hovered for roughly 30 secs.  While still visible I thought they may be those paper bags with candles that people set off, but they stayed perfectly still and all quickly faded away at the exact same time.  I&#39;ve looked and seen nothing on local news so far.<n>

I opened the door and yelled for my father to come out.  By the time he got outside one of the orange lights was gone, but he witnessed the two that were still glowing and still traveling at the same speed.  The objects continued in a strait line directly over my home.  As they continued to travel north-east another of the lights went out, and the last light continued on the same trajectory until it was out of sight.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  My father and I were both startled by what we saw.  I then decided to call and report what I had seen. I was very surprised to hear that there had been a flood of calls reporting nearly the exact same thing that I had seen all over the U.S. and Canada.  What I found very strange was the precision with which they traveled.  The three lights, or objects, maintained an exact distance from each other as they traveled.  They had to have been controlled. It was very strange.  There was no sound coming from them either.  I tried to get video of the objects, but was only able to record a 2 second clip of them on my cell phone. The quality is not very good, but they are visible.<n>

We were watching the ball drop in NY on TV.  At midnight we watched the broadcasters hugging etc. at midnight.  We could hear a lot of fireworks going off in our neighborhood ever since it got dark so we went to our back deck  (The Wando River is North West with Daniel Island behind it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 5 minutes past midnight.  Our deck is on a march that feeds into the Wando River.  All of our neighbors have decks on the marsh and I would think that a lot of them were on them that night but I haven’t asked them if they saw anything. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw some fireworks that looked like they were coming from across the Wando from the Northeast.  We then just started looking at the sky (we have a wide view from the deck).  We both noticed the “orbs” at the same time.  They were sort of in a circle-ish grouping.  I mean not a perfect circle but floating like a group.  They were kind of bobbing around but they stayed together and they floated at the same altitude.  They were bright round orbs.  At first they looked just bright white but then they seemed to be blinking or pulsing yellowish-orange.  We both spotted them at the same time and said jokingly “aliens”.  But then we both thought it was from the fireworks and would disappear.  But they didn’t disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be going west and seemed to be over the Wando River.  They floated off together and disappeared behind a cloud.  We tried to figure out what they were?  They were too low to be aircraft?  We thought maybe Boeing was testing some new kind of drone or something since there has been so much talk of drones and airspace below 500 feet?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I spend a lot of time outside.  We have been sailing in many places where the view of the sky is awesome and clear.   We have seen falling stars, satellites, planes, etc.  But we have never seen these “orb” things.  I did report this to MUFON because that was what came up when I googled UFO reporting.  I read some of the other MUFON reports and thought it was weird that so many other people were seeing the same type of thing all over the country that night and some of their videos look a lot like what we saw.  I would just like to know what they were? Hope this is helpful<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best regards,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

It had a presence that seemed unusual. My g/f said at the time &#34;it must be a NYE blimp&#34;.  We did not get a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might just be a blimp too, but it wasn&#39;t moving. It was stationary, but kind of hovering like a blimp would, and gently pulsing.  It was much bigger than any star in the sky. We would estimate the size to be about 3x that of Jupiter- easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back in after a couple minutes because it was cold.  Two weeks later when I read an article saying that multiple other witnesses had seen the same red/orange orb(s), I knew that what we&#39;d seen was not a blimp, because throughout the southeast part of the stat! e (it was southeast in the sky) people had seen what I&#39;d seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both in our mid-30&#39;s, we enjoy star-gazing and we were not under the influence of drugs at the time.  This is not my first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have now had 4 legitimate UFO experiences/sightings, with the latest ones being this week, one on the 4th of July, and then again the next night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first sighting was in January 2012 of a huge black triangle which I will now document as well.<n>
1/1/14 00:05|Spokane Valley|WA|Formation|10 minutes|21 Craft with bright red lights flying as a squadron in Spokane Valley.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105962.html|692|ndxe201401| 21 Craft with bright red lights flying as a squadron in Spokane Valley<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 00:05 on 01-01-2014, 5 minutes after midnight, I went out on my front porch to see any New Year&#39;s Day fireworks that were still going off.  My porch faces due south and the residence is at the far southeastern end of the Spokane Valley, about 10 miles from the Idaho border and 4 miles west of the small community of Liberty Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home is located in a small cluster of houses elevated about 400 ft. above the valley floor and this cluster of houses is the last inhabited property with paved streets and street lamps.  All the land to the south is tree-covered, sparsely inhabited hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 32 degrees out and it had rained in the morning so there was a high, light fog/haze in the night sky where if I looked towards the horizon, the haze looked whiter and thicker than when I looked up, but even though the sky was much blacker straight overhead, no stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some fireworks were still going off but there were no nearby Roman candles or star-bursts showing up above the treetops. Then as I stood there looking around, a bright, solid red light came into view from behind a hilltop coming from the South, horizontal to the ground, just under the fog level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an incoming airliner, as under certain weather conditions, airliners often approach the Spokane International Airport by making a low circle around this end of the valley to make their approach.  And, the craft was traveling about the same speed as an incoming jetliner and at the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, as the craft came nearer, I realized the red light was too big and bright to be on a jetliner and there was no green light on the other side of the &#34;plane&#34; nor any white lights on.  The size and brightness of the red light would have to have been the equivalent of every light on the bottom of a jetliner being changed to red lights all on at the same time, creating the impression of one large light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see any shape to the craft and the size of the light seemed to encompass the entire bottom of the craft as I could not see any bigger extension of the ship outside the circumference of the light.  What I was seeing definitely was not a &#34;fireball&#34; or other &#34;natural&#34; phenomenon - it was a huge red light on the underside of a flying craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was trying to figure out what kind of craft it was as it got closer, another identical red light appeared from behind the hill right behind the first light, and then a third red light approached at the same interval as the second one was to the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now all three bright red lights were strung out just under the fog, equidistant apart, flying at a relatively slow, steady speed and coming straight towards me.  By now I knew these were not regular airliners and also, there was no engine sounds.  Then another two red lights appeared together, much closer to each other and behind the first three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time the pair of red lights appeared, the first craft seemed to stop right at the edge of the forested property, as if he didn&#39;t want to venture into the illuminated populated part of the valley.  The point at which the craft stopped was about 3/4&#39;s mile from where I stood.  This first craft started fading from view into the haze right above where he had stopped his approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I saw, he had flown in under the fog horizontal to the ground, reached a certain point beyond which he was not going to travel and instantly switched to rising straight up into the sky, at a 90 degrees angle from where he previously had been traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the second craft did the same thing at the same exact location, and then the third craft, too, as if they had reached an invisible wall.  I got brief glimpses of the red lights as they faded into the fog, so it wasn&#39;t as though the craft just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first three ships ascended into the fog, more identical craft were appearing at the same altitude and speed from behind the hill in the same close-knit but random fashion until I counted 21 craft in all.  And, as each reached the &#34;invisible wall&#34;, it rose into the fog the same way the first craft had done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the last ship of this group faded upward into the fog, I waited a few minutes more to see if something else was going to appear.  When nothing more happened, I ventured down the front sidewalk towards the street to get a better view of the night sky and saw a single identical &#34;red light&#34; craft due West a couple of miles away but still at the same altitude.  I watched it for a few minutes, but I could&#39;t tell if he was moving at all, or if towards me or away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other craft appeared around him and I couldn&#39;t tell if he was one of the original 21 ships I had seen or if he was ship # 22.  The whole episode lasted about 10 minutes and since I was getting quite cold, I went indoors even though the craft in the West was still visible.   This was my very first UFO sighting and until I saw your word choices for &#34;Shape of Craft&#34;, the word that came to my mind was a &#34;squadron&#34; of craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in my mid-60&#39;s, retired from a lifetime of being self-employed in small business with my husband, married for 42 years and a college graduate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was halfway through typing up this report to you when I turned on Wednesday&#39;s Coast to Coast and heard your January 1st report to George Noory about all the red lights and fireballs people were reporting.  I have listened to Coast to Coast for over 25 years, and still remember Art Bell&#39;s first broadcast of &#34;Mel&#39;s Hole&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for the work you and Coast to Coast do to monitor and let us know what is really going on in our world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My hat&#39;s off to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Happy New Year!<n>

We noticed this green/red light in the sky to the east. It looked to be two green lights side by side with a red light that pulsated slowly.  I set up an 8MP camera on a tripod and started recording.  Sometimes it appeared that the green lights were on top with the red at the bottom and sometimes this orientation changed - but the changes were very slow and difficult to notice with the naked eye.  Occasionally, the light would slowly drift to the south and then back to the north, returning approximately to its previous position.  After 8 minutes of recording, the green light turned off leaving only what appeared to be a pair of red lights and the light appeared to slowly descend until it was obscured by the tree line and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20 – 30 seconds later, my wife noticed a red light of similar intensity moving north, but it was obscured by trees and other houses so we could only see little bits until it was out of sight completely. The recording is blurry – as they always are – it’s difficult to focus at an object in the night sky through such a tiny viewfinder.  The object appeared too steady to be a helicopter or any toy I’m familiar with.  There was a light breeze, so I think that would have caused a balloon to move.  No sounds from the object were detectable by me or my wife. I checked today – there are no towers or tall buildings in that direction, just 4 miles of residential neighborhoods and then wilderness for a hundred or so miles after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a really fun thing to see on New Years!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I saw a lot of explosions in the sky, but instead of colorful geometric formations, I kept seeing huge fireballs followed by mushroom clouds.  Apparently aliens were having a war in the atmosphere.  6-7 UFOs shaped like discs and piloted by Grays were shooting lasers and neutron missiles at each other at an altitude of 95,000 feet. It looked like the UFOs were blowing up when they were hit, but their shields protected them.  I saw one Gray eject from his spacecraft after several direct hits, but he parachuted into another craft then took off back into deep space.  The worst part was getting abducted.  A UFO landed in my driveway and the pilot got out and asked for several wooden boxes of uranium.  I told him I had some in my basement, and when he went and looked I snuck onto his spaceship and started going through his things.  He came back and caught me.  Things got really out of hand at this point and I&#39;m too embarrassed to say what happened next.<n>
1/1/14 00:01|Salem|OR|Light|5 minutes|Six yellow-orange lights with reddish halos moving from NE to SW at midnight on New Year's Eve spaced about 45 seconds apart; no sounds|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105886.html|697|ndxe201401| Six yellow-orange lights with reddish halos moving from NE to SW at midnight on New Year&#39;s Eve spaced about 45 seconds apart; no sounds<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I went out on our deck about a half minute past midnight on New Year&#39;s Eve to watch some neighbors&#39; fireworks.  As I lookup up I saw a fairly bright yellow-orange light with a reddish halo around it moving silently from the NE to the SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife also saw it.  We could not determine how high up it was as the sky was clear and there was no frame of reference.  It did not seem to be a plane or helicopter as the light did not blink and there was no sound.  It moved moderately fast covering perhaps a 45 degree arc of sky in about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, a second light came into view over our roofline from the same direction and on the same route as the first.  It was about 45 seconds behind the first.  Watching the first light, it dimmed as it got further from us, then was not seen.  Changing to watch the second, a third light appeared, same time interval, same path.  This occurred six time; six lights.  Several of them seemed to change their course slightly to the south as they moved away.  Because of our roofline, I was not able to observe where any of them originated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought perhaps the lights were some kind of flares suspended from balloons - but they moved too identically for that in my opinion.  Another thought was some type of crafts watching the firework displays for New Years.  However, there were very few fireworks seen; our deck has a good view over the city.  The only other thing I could think of was some kind of night maneuver with our local national guard unit - but I don&#39;t think our small unit has six helicopters.  I have read some other observations of similar light sightings over the past months.<n>

That means I know others saw the event beside us three on that occasion.  My neighbors saw it too and since they had a lot of kids on hand, they weren&#39;t drinking near as much as us.  The neighbors were watching us send up fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TIME: Shortly after midnight, 1 Jan 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CONDITIONS:  Cold, clear sky, moon light. Nominal northerly winds.  (We could judge wind by watching the ashes of our fireworks drift.) Oddly enough, kind of quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OBSERVATION:  Three orbs, orange in color, moving North by North East, moderately low to the horizon.  Distance and height estimates were not possible.  Orbs moved in a trail pattern spaced about 20 seconds between object 1 and 2 and about 30 seconds between objects 2 and 3.  Object 1 appeared to alter course with a smooth turn to a Northeast heading and object 2 appeared to follow this turn exactly upon reaching the same point.   Object three seemed to overshoot the turn and correct its course by turning more to the right (smooth turn) and follow objects 1 and 2.  At no time were all three object visible is the same sky.  No sound was heard.  Orange color and intensity of objects was uniform and did not change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OBSERVERS:  Three retired Soldiers celebrating New Year&#39;s with fireworks and firewater.  All three are experienced in field conditions and have training and experience in estimating distance at night and ground navigation by stars.  All three can tell the difference between a star and a planet.  All three can distinguish helicopters from airplanes and turbine engines from reciprocating engines.  So we know how to shut up, look and listen and, interpret what we sense.<n>

The objects came from the direction of Primm towards Las Vegas.  I would estimate the speed at 300 to 400 mph and the altitude was 8000 feet.  One first crossed the sky and I watched it go up into the sky and disappear.  Approximately three minutes later a second fire ball following the identical flight path repeated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the size of each object to have been 20 feet in diameter. The flames were clear to see.  The whole object was a glow.  The flames were going up, the flames were not training behind.  We were thinking that it was a new fireworks device in the form of a drone because it was flying.  It was not shooting across the sky; it was floating across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been 36.5 hours since we have seen the objects and we are deeply concerned.<n>

All the fireworks were going off in the sky and I noticed that there were three to 4 orange circles/orbs high in the sky in the north direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not get a lot of time to watch them but they were moving around in close proximity to each other.  These lights were much higher than the fireworks.  There were a ton of fireworks going off that night.  From one vantage point from the highway I could see all of Austin and surrounding areas.  There were countless fireworks going off.  I am not sure if the fireworks attracted the orange orbs/circles.<n>

As we proceeded to go outside my friend told me there were lights in the sky and to hurry and come out to see.  What we saw was like nothing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put it down on facebook last night and everyone is starting to chime in and we were not the only ones.....   What we saw was three orange lights in the sky hovering and making formations.  There were some clouds out last night so they went above the canopy and out of the north they came back to the same position.  I family member of mine said he saw them as early as 10:30 at night.<n>

The shapes were spread out but formed a diamond shape. From the diamond shape, they shifted into a lopsided square.  Two of the orbs at the top of the shape, were really close in proximity.  The orbs seemed to be a little misshaped and were slightly discolored (it wasn&#39;t clear if they were blinking, or just discolored).  Then after about two minutes of observing the orbs, they gradually disappeared; as if they just dimmed their lights until the lights were completely out, a couple orbs at a time.  I am in Law Enforcement, and my sister is a student.<n>

The fire works on Pike ended. A few blocks away someone had shot a few fireworks.  I noticed a clusters of about 25 stars lower than the other stars in the sky, above me.  I thought it was beautiful remnants of the fire works because I could see they were moving slightly.  These stars or lights weren&#39;t falling out of the sky like fire works would, but moving around, sort of in formation. Looking at these lights threw my binoculars they looked exactly like the stars in the sky only moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them move and dance around in the sky about twelve minutes until they all flew over the house and away, traveling south east.  They didn&#39;t look like UFO&#39;s. It looked like the stars in the sky were alive :)   My husband tried desperately to get his camera/video to work. Ha!  It was like the stars didn&#39;t want that to happen and it didn&#39;t.<n>

I thought it might be a star but was much brighter than Jupiter is right now.  There were several aircraft in the area.  My tree was somewhat in the way, so I moved to a better vantage point on my driveway check to see if it had FAA lights on it. It did not.  I watched it for about a minute.  It seemed to hover, then sped off to the east, the light slowly getting dimmer then disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was originally about 30 degrees above the horizon, and when it sped off seemed to go slightly higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if there were any other witnesses, but I was the only one out on my street at the time.<n>

At this point my mother in law was actually frightened and went inside I mean all! of us were blown away and there is no doubt what we saw that ! night ai rplanes?! NO helicopters? NO! miltary flares? NO! shooting stars?  NO weather balloons?  NO!  NOTHING we have could just stop in mid air while maintaining altitude perfectly and just vanish!  Even still, over cities every aircraft i believe is required to have a strobe which these did not.  The way they moved, looked, felt, just.. yea we saw UFOs no doubt in any of our minds! Well thank you guys and i hope this story helps for future reference my eyes are glued on the sky and i will be prepared with a camera next time!<n>

This even was at about 11:57pm and we watched it just until the ball dropped.  We all went inside to watch the ball drop and celebrate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then grabbed the small firecrackers we bought for the kids to see and went out front to the roadway to set them off.  At this point the light was gone.  We were all very confused as to what it was being that it moved in multiple directions then hovered just before we went inside.  After lighting the firecrackers and rounding up the kids to go back inside we saw the light appear much further off in the distance in the complete opposite direction.  Myself and one of the other adults stopped and watched it as it moved east, then north, then hover and disappear again.  About 20 seconds later it reappeared much further away, much too fast for any craft I as a civilian know of.  It then hovered once again for about 20 seconds, flew north west, hovered again for about 10 seconds, then continued northwest.  Slightly after it hovered the last time, another appeared and began to fly towards the original.  As the second sighting got closer to the first, the first completely vanished.  The second hovered and sure enough a third began its ascent towards the second.  The second flew to about where the first vanished and hovered as the third started to move closer.  At this time a fourth came into sight flying towards them both.  The second sighting vanished and a fifth and final appeared and performed a very similar routine until all 5 vanished at roughly the same location in the sky.  We watched for a good 20 minutes afterwards to see if perhaps they would return, they never did.  All 5 sightings were very bright, reddish amber colored, moved in random speeds and direction, made no sound whatsoever, and all vanished at about the same location in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does anyone else have a good explanation for this?  Why are there so many sightings of these red lights in the sky in the past year?  I have never ever heard about these lights or this site for that matter until tonight&#39;s experience.<n>

I looked towards The Clockum Area and there were 4 Amber colored lights in the sky all at different heights in the sky.  I noticed one begin to move upwards and the one next to it followed.  I called to my two friends to look at what I was seeing.  They saw the same thing.   We watched as these 4 lights moved up and down several hundred feet at a time. 2 of the lights would be moving while the other two held still.  After watching for a minute I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look at what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw still is difficult for me to describe.  This craft seemed to have more than one level, at least 2. It was pulsating and there&#39;s was so much going on with the lights inside this large object.  The object was orange/Amber in color.  One object appeared to have a globe shape on the top.  I handed the binoculars to my friend and asked her what she saw.  She couldn&#39;t speak for bit. She too couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing, and was having difficulty explaining it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the first two thru the binoculars, I went to look at the other two lights and they were gone.  My friend saw it shoot straight up into the sky while I was looking at the others.   The 2 remaining lights were still hovering and moving around in the sky, traveling what appeared to be several miles at a time in any one direction, but stayed over the Clockum area, but they too then disappeared straight up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event lasted for 3.5 minutes. It began approximately 15 seconds after midnight, and lasted until 12:04am January 1, 2014.   These were extremely large objects, and they were like nothing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first UFO&#39;s the 3 of us have seen and reported.  This is however the first we have all seen together, and multiple UFO&#39;s at a time.  These objects moved like no aircraft we have ever seen.  The shape, lights, movement, all were very foreign.<n>

At first I began to think that the unknown objects were part of a firework display exhibited by the local residents.  Then upon focusing into the night sky, I quickly realized this was no firework display at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to fade in the sky about 45 degrees from the horizon from a tiny spectacle to a round, dark orange/amber glowing shape which magnified about three times its original size.  Once this object achieved its optimal size, it then flew south for approximately 15 seconds at an incredible speed and then decelerated.  The next segment is what caught my attention the most.  Once the object stopped from its propulsion like movement, it stood stationary glowing brighter and brighter in the sky with a strong hue of orange dominating its presence.   After standing still for about a minute, it then (in my best description) shed some droplets of light descending directly beneath from the original object at a distance not measurable with the naked eye.  This image reminded me of heating a metal to its melting point and then observing its free falling behavior as it was poured out of a ladle.  The object would then fade away into the darkened universe as if it traveled out of! our galaxy and onto the next.   This particular occasion occurred several times over the next 35 minutes and at one moment in time, there were as much as three “UFOs” in the sky simultaneously.<n>
