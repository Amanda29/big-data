At first it appeared to be one large V shaped object flying with nose of the V pointed to our left. The object consisted of several balls of white lights. We watched the object for several minutes in amazement trying to figure out what it was. The Portland Jetport is to the right of where we were looking. My family has lived in the house we were standing in front of for decades and I have seen thousands of planes fly over our house throughout the years, the sound when they fly over is very loud and shakes the house, people who aren&#39;t use to it would cover their ears. I could hear no sound coming from the object. There were several balls of light in the V formation, my approximate would be 7. All of a sudden one of the balls of light came out of it&#39;s position in the top of the formation and quickly flew down towards a ball that was in the lowest section, it started to zig zag around it, almost as if it was playing with it. The ball of light in the lower section came out of it&#39;s place and they both zipped around, left, right, up and down. The balls of light then went back into their exact position, then at an amazing speed they zipped to the left out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first and the only sighting I have ever had. I am 100 % sure that it was not a plane, but I have no idea what it was. My best guess is that it was truly from a world other then my own, or something government or military related that the public is unaware of. I feel privileged to have had this experience and am intrigued at the possibilities that our own people or something out there has such technology. It was absolutely amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/95 22:00|Rockwood|MI|Changing|45 minutes|Green sky's and strange unatural cloud activity  followed by sudden lights|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72076.html|2|ndxe199506| Green sky&#39;s and strange unatural cloud activity  followed by sudden lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Southeast Michigan you don&#39;t see norther lights.  We walked out onto the porch, saw the horizon turning a glowing green.   It continued to grow more green in color, and on a perfectly clear night, ball shaped clouds appeard and began to move in an &#34;S&#34; pattern through the sky, tens of these appeared and continued to move through the sky and eventually disipate.  Then, the outline of diamonds appeared, and they would expand through the sky and each eventually disipate (appeared to be cloudy material too).  After about 30 minutes of watching this in awe, two large lights, opened up side by side, and one small light appeared between them.  The small light dropped earthward, and then back up again, then the two lights disappeared.  All the activity then started to fade, but continued for at least another 30 minutes.  I&#39;ve been wondering to this day, what exactly we saw.  It was actually quite terrifying at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Othe and drove around neighborhoods, looking at the new houses in a new community.  There was still construction going on in some neighborhoods, so it wasn&#39;t densely populated. It was night time, and the sky had some clouds in it but not heavy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving down this hill, all of a sudden in front of us appeared an enormous disk but with flat surfaces  that angled on the sides. It was so large it filled the sky in front of us.  It appeared to be incredibly close, about 30-50 feet away, hovering effortlessly and silently not very high in the sky at all. I cannot stress enough how insanely large this thing was just hanging low in the sky. From what I remember it wasn&#39;t a smooth surface, it was dark in color, and had steam all around it and red lights which made the steam glow red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall seeing where the red lights came from.  I just remember the red glowing steam.  Just as suddenly and silently as it appeared, it disappeared.  It was like seeing something unimaginable, right in front of you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently asked my ex about that night 20 years ago, and if we really saw a ufo, and he confirmed that we really did see it.  If I was alone, I wouldn&#39;t have believed my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were also close to El Toro Marine Base, where we lived.  I don&#39;t know if that had anything to do with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/95 19:20|Olathe|KS||~2 seconds|A moon-sized circle of bright white light, like a mirror reflecting the sun by tilting, appeared in the distance|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16180.html|4|ndxe199506| A moon-sized circle of bright white light, like a mirror reflecting the sun by tilting, appeared in the distance<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving towards the Kansas City metro area on I-35, several miles West of Olathe.  There was a full moon rising in front of me and a little to the right, and the sun was getting lower in the sky behind my left shoulder.  I noticed a configuration of ball-park miles ahead of me and to the right of the highway, with lots of trees, etc., in between.  As I was looking towards the ballpark lights, with the full moon upwards of it and to the left, DIRECTLY OVER the ballpark in the sky appeared, from nowhere, A BRIGHT WHITE CIRCLE OF LIGHT that was the same size as the moon.  It was extremely bright, like a huge circular mirror reflecting the sunlight, but it did not hurt my eyes and it did not glare.  It just &#34;tilted&#34; on and then, after a second or two, it &#34;tilted&#34; off.  I compared it to the size of the moon, almost precisely.  It really gave the impression of a big mirror tilting in the sun, or a &#34;portal,&#34; which opened for me to see.  I looked at the passengers in other veh! icles nearby (it is a double highway) but I saw no indication that anyone else saw the UFO.  I was awestruck by this sighting since there is no way it could possibly be explained in any conventional way.<n>

I will listen to you and all that but don&#39;t push this stuff on me... I have to see to believe, at that moment I made a request to them (aliens I guess) I wish they would come down right now so you can see them and believe in them. Like I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well at that moment in conversation I told her in Spanish...&#34; look in the sky. Here comes a car.&#34;   There were two lights directly above the Harbor Bridge like back behind it a little . She laughed and we just kept talking thinking the whole time it was probably a plane or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well for some reason I was watching it in the corner of my eye, and then realized like in no time it was directly above us. At this point my wife was starting to freak, and I was so full of excitement that this was happening.  I remember looking up and this object was huge, and made no sound... that was scary ...something that big floating above us and all you could here was a hovering noise..a very faint hovering noise... not loud at all...  The lights glowed from white to yellow to green and then the reverse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then moved directly behind the Art Building, came to a perfect stop and made a 90 degree turn around the corner of the building going beyond our sight... I was trying to run to the other side of the building and my wife was pulling on my hand.She did not want me to go because she was scared... I finally broke loose and ran around the building only to see the object blink out.  It jumped from near the art building to about 1 or 2 miles out above the bay and then just blinked out again and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife to this day does not like talking about this incident.... She is old school.. you know every thing has to have an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My kids were in the front yard talking to my in-laws who had stopped by to visit.  I walked to the curb to bring the trash cans back up to the house and noticed a brilliant amber colored light low on the horizon over Mt. Ashland coming directly toward me at an incredible rate of speed.  It looked like a huge fireball in the sky and I was scared that it was a meteor about to hit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only took a couple of seconds to reach us and I was shocked when I looked up to see a round metallic object streaking by directly overhead at a low altitude. (It was about the size of a tennis ball held at arms length from my perspective) There was no contrail or fiery tail and it made absolutely no sound at all.  The light source must have come from the top of the craft because there was no light coming from underneath. I watched as it streaked by and disappeared from view within a second or two. It went from one horizon to the other in the span of about 3 to 4 seconds. I asked my in-laws if they had seen it and they said they hadn’t been looking at the sky and hadn’t noticed anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never believed in UFOs and was a bit shaken by the encounter. I listened to the news that night hoping for a logical explanation to what I had seen, but there was no mention of anything at all. Out of fear of sounding like a kook, I’ve kept the incident pretty much to myself all these years, but I’ve never been able to get it out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was awesome, I never saw anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They broadcasted the festival on the local Nevada City radio station KVMR.  People on the air were saying that they were taken up to a  a UFO and visited with aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a festive occasion and everyone was real happy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Up, down, and sideways in all directions and then it just took off at a speed so fast straight up and was gone, just like that, and I knew it could not be a regular aircraft because I had never seen one move in this kind of pattern formation before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so fast but long enough for me to notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I thought I was the only one who had seen this object until my friend next to me said, did you just see that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I nodded yes and was still confused by my observation but I still to this day 17 years later will never forget that mysterious and  encounter!<n>

As the night approached they stopped in a very small land farm house, very far from the principal town, and decided to stop in there during the night. The owners, a very simple old couple, received them very kindly, and said that besides  his son was spected to arrive during the  same night ( he was a truck driver) but have no problem to received them, also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the night (&gt; 03:00 AM) my friend saw a very brightly light shinning troughout the window&#39;s fenestry. He thought: &#34; The driver is coming with his truck&#34; - and contineud to rest sleepping. Early in the morning, he asked to the old couple where was their son that supposed to come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#39; Oh!! you saw the lights too!&#39; We wake up and oppened the windows as soon we saw the bright light, imagining it was the truck coming. But, all we saw and heard the chikens noise and a strange and very clearly large egg object moving very slowly from the chikens &#39;s area and coming to our direction. We saw there were two men  inside, behind a large glass window. As soon as it got 20 meters from our window, it moved to another direction and then disappeared. We didn´t wake both you up, bacause we thought you were tired and sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the end of the same week, a similar object appeared on the South Region of the State (about 500 km  away)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

They were asleep downstair.  I was downstair with them. I got up to check on them sleeping in sleeping bags on the floor.  I than looks out the window and saw just above the trees over the house behind my house a white beam light scaning each house this white light shined on and off but it kept moving as if it was looking for something.  I saw the beam coming toward my house.  I started to run up the stair to yell for my husband. Just than, I felt two finger softly touching my sides.  After that I woke up in a sitting position on my couch the next morning with no knowledge how I got there. I lost time.  I wonder if anyone out in the world has had a similar experience.  Please post your sxperience because I really hope that am not the only one that this has happen to.

I originally thought that the object was a crashing aircraft that may hit me judging from it&#39;s descent path so I slammed on my brakes and killed my engine. (Foolish, I know) Object displayed no engine sound but did may have made a slight electrical crackling sound. It descended over a small lake in front of me, I was driving a suzuki samuri(Jeep) so I was able to observe it without glass in my line of sight. Object displayed lighting effects on surrounding trees similar to lightning but in a steady stream. Object continued to approach in my general direction untill it was about midway over the lake and in my estimate about 55 feet over the water. I held my arm strait out with fist to estimate size and at its closest(largest)it was covered by 1/2 with my closed hand. Object definately made a wooshing sound (similar to a flag in high wind) apon leaving and exited at a tremendous speed. I do not believe object was a craft but may have been an example of &#34;Ball Lightning&#34; Though I have read everything I could about the subject science does not seam to understand it. I believe that it was repelled by its proximity to the water, And I would like to know if this has been reported before. Object approached at an aproximate 40 degree angle and left at an aproximate 45. I can not be certain whether object retreated from me or dissipated so quickly that it appeared to retreat. Object was white in color similar to a strobe light or lightning flash with some orange.<n>

Interdimensional Craft - Daylight Sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> While  a friend and I were sitting on the bank of the Fraser River at Surrey, BC, he looked up and remarked on what he thought, initially, were large seagulls overhead.  They were instead very large craft with globular bellies that reflected sun light -- like a very white/bright metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were six to eight of them flying overhead which I estimate to be about a mile above us.  The wings were &#34;flapping&#34; but not like seagulls which flap in unison.  When I remarked about this to my friend, then they changed to flap in unison.  We had seagulls flying in front of us over the river, so it was easy to compare.  These craft at times flew in a loose formation, then aimlessly.  The strangest parts were I had the  impression that our thoughts were being picked from overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And they disappeared and REappeared -- against blue sky.  These were solid craft, sharply seen -- but they seemed to disappear and they reappear against blue sky -- as if they were going in and out of another dimension.  We watched them until we got bored -- went into the fish shop for the fish boat had come in and then left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this incident to the Canadian UFO reporting center at Vancouver, B.C. and the then president who called me back told me had a similar sighting, also over the Fraser River some weeks before -- but only one craft -- and no where near as many as we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a day time sighting, and one we watched long enough to be clear as to what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

( THIS WAS IN THE DAYTIME AND ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET AWAY)!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a sunday morning in June 1995, I was traveling on highway 395, about 2 miles from Kramer Junction , Ca , when I looked up and out my car window , that is when I saw a UFO. It was shaped like a saucer and it was rotating above a power line tower. It was sliver in color. I did not see any lights or markings. No sound or exhaust was coming from it. I watched it for about 20 seconds, from a distance of 100 feet away. When it left my sight, I could not track it with my eyes. It was traveling to fast. Their was no sonic boom. I live near Edwards A.F.B. and since 1965, I have seen everything that can fly from that base, I have never seen anything like what I saw that sunday morning. Thought you would like to know.<n>

Suddenly, only one orange coloured light seems to be &#39;escorting&#39; us. I realised it when it tries to overtake us (but the light are approximately far away) and then it stopped to wait for us and than start escorting us again. It still does that for maybe couples of time, and then &#39;zoop&#39; with a speed for about 225 mph or less, it speeds and dissapear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness chooses to remain anonymous.

I was fighting forest fires in california at the time and it was late about 12am - 12:30 in the morning and we and my friends was about to turn in, and a t that time we was laying down looking up and just admiring the stars..and at that time we all stopped in amazement as we saw these stars in a tiangular shape which was about 2-3000 ft above us, we sat and was struck with awe because we being from the Virginia we haven&#39;t never seen so many stars in the sky, but we watched it.  We thought it was a helicopter but we heard no engines, but it just sat there for about 20 minutes and then it started to move west but during this time we thought it it was something foreign because the triangle didn&#39;t break shape it stayed in the same formation until it was out of sight, I thought it was not to sound crazy, but i thought it was a spacecraft because i never seen anything like that in my entire life, but that&#39;s my story and i know what i&#39;ve seen but i never talked about it because i didn&#39;t want to be called &#34;crazy&#34;. but it was 6 of us that seen it and we said we wasn&#39;t going to tell anyone.

It must have been 5 feet off the ground, I have no idea how big it was but I think it might of been in the area of 3-4 feet. The blinds that were covering the glass door were closed so all I could see was the light and almost nothing else. Later that night I was still very shaken up when I saw a humanoid figure, I say humanoid because the head was much too big and it was only  about 4 feet tall, it had a amazingly smoth stride, almost like it was walking on air. I left the mini-blinds closed out of pure fear so all i ever did see were shadows but I know what I saw wasn&#39;t human.I&#39;ve been afraid to report it out of fear my family would think I was nuts, because the next day when I told my family none of them belived me.For this reason I ask that you not call and only contact me be mail or e-mail,((Name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  Similar incident reported by Cameron, MO, Police Dept. for 21JN95.))<n>

I grabbed my camera and took the first photo,they were a dull glowing orange colour and were sort of pulsating for lack of a better word.As I took the photos the first one looks as it did in the view finder but the second one that looks like streaking light was not visiable in the view finder.The camera has auto advance and after I took the first photo I snapped the second at a black sky and put the camera down.I never saw them &#34;Streak&#34;away.When I looked after taking the photos the sky was just &#34;Empty&#34; no sign of what I thought I had seen. It wasn&#39;t till months later when I took the film in for processing that I was relieved to see the objects.I really thought I was just real tired and had seen things that were not really there.I stepped to the ground and walked all the way around my truck about 3 or 4 times looking for &#34;Little green men&#34; I was kinda worried as I walked for fear of an encounter and not knowing how to react if it had happened.I drove to the next big wide spot where I could park safely off the road and spent an unknown number of hours trying to get to sleep.Thats about it.Like I stated before, I really don&#39;t want my name used in this and will send the  photos If I am guaranteed in writing that I will get them back.

I was traveling east on US hiway 50 near the Hickison Petroglyphs and Austin and Eureka, Nevada. I first saw what looked like an orange moon to my left and ahead of me that appeared to be really far away&gt; As I got closer it became obvious that it was not the moon and there were (2) Two of them and were above the ground. The colour varied from orange to reddish and when I stopped on the right shoulder and turned off all lights and the engine I felt a kind of static electric like putting your face inches from a TV or Computer screen only it was much stronger and the hair on my arms stood up. I watched for about 5 mins. or more before I reached for a cheap camera I had above the windshield in a map Pocket. I got out and stood on the top step (running board) and heard no sounds from the craft, there were no lights on board and I never felt in danger. I snapped the first shot and then the film advanced automaticlly and as I took the 2nd one there was nothing in the view finder that I could see. I had the film developed a few months later and when I saw the second shot (streaks) I was really surprised because I never saw those streaks through the camera. The first shot is quite a bit dimmer than it really was but is like I remember it.The objects were about1/8th of a mile or less from me. For years I was afraid to tell anyone or show the photos but I know what I saw and it was real. I did lose some time but I have never tried to find out what happened to the time. Driving trucks over the road you lose all kinds of time so that was no big deal to me. I will try to send along both photos with this message, I did send them to your webmaster,but I am not a computer wizz and may have to &#34;Snail Mail&#34; them to you. Thanks, ((name deleted))<n>

So about ten minutes later a bright light shines down on us so we looked up at the source and here is an aircraft about 50 feet above us that is maybe about the size of a football field and a half and it looked like it was made out of metal rods and had about three different inclosers and the spot light on the bottom so it stayed there for about five minutes stupid us didn&#39;t have a camamera or anything to take a picture and then it took off at a high rate of speed. What was weird about it was there were no noise from the thing and it wasn&#39;t a blimp either I am sure of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do live in Arizona  now that was 3yrs ago<n>

I was about ten years old at the time and this is my first time reporting it. I am now 18. I went to sleep on the living room couch one night because the living room has a large window looking out to the west. Anyway, I woke up in the middle of night (midnight was the time on the VCR) on my back, and surprisingly I was not groggy, almost as if I had been up the entire night. But I had decided to then count the stars until I go back to sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep. Well, there was this one star that was moving in north to south direction (from my point of view it was from left to right). I mistook as a plane and so my focus followed it. I decided to play a mind game with myself thionking it would make me tired and thought I could control the direction of the plane by looking at the direction where i want it to go. I said to myself, &#34;I&#39;m going to control you with my eyes.) and the exact moment when I finished that sentence, the &#34;plane&#34; then flashed a very bright light into the living room where I was. I shut my eyes and pulled the covers over me. When I opened my eyes I was on my back with my arms at my sides and the covers were still over me. At first I couldn&#39;t breathe out of fright, I was so afraid to move or even think. When I finally got the courage to pull away my blanket from on top of me, I saw that the clock on the VCR was about 2:30AM. It was still dark, so I immediately got up, ran to my parents&#39; room and asked them if they saw a light flash inside the house, they groggily said no. I climbed in bed with them and went to sleep. If anybody has a record of anyone having a similar experience, please e-mail me at I ((e-address deleted))  or call mny cell at ((telephone number deleted)). I am very interested in an explanation. Since then I have had an extreme phobia of UFOs, aliens, and especially the drawings of what they might look like.

I said to my two friends do you see that? They didn&#39;t at first untill I pointed right at it as it past by us.Then they said yes we see it.We could see the stars in the sky in between them, they apeard to be three seperet objects but they moved at the exact same time &amp; speed as they turned &amp; they keped the same distance from each other.As they headed North they apeared to pick up speed to what looked like over 300 kts &amp; faded as they got farther away.That night it was calm and clear skies.They again made no sound,no wind from passing us &amp; no exsaust of any kind.It was not something we could explain &amp; it gave me goose bumps.

We watched it for a few minutes, then she said &#34;it&#39;s going away&#34;.  I didn&#39;t think so at first, but suddenly it zipped away (strait away from us), at a high velocity, to the point that it looked like it just shrunk in upon itself and vanished.

My freind ((Name deleted)) noticed a wierd looking object in the sky to the west. He drew my attention to the object as well as my other friend ((Name deleted)). The object i witnessed apeared to be bigger than a commercial airline, in the form of a long cigar (like a 747 with no wings or tail). The object hovered vertically, which was why i didn&#39;t think it was an airliner. It appeared to drift slowly to the north after about two minutes..as it did this a white illumination encompassed it. The Illumination dimmed after about three minutes, and when it dimmed completely the object dissapeared (in no direction without sound) Just as we had convinced ourselves it was an airplane refecting the setting sun, a formation of 3 low flying, military style, black helicopters flew by directly over head in the direction we viewed the object. These helicopter were followed shortly after by 2 military jets (f-15? f-18? not really sure) at a much higher altitude but in the same direction....Coincidense?<n>

Anyhow, i was comming home with 3 people (one was my driving instructer) another was a guy learning how to drive with me.  We all saw it..and that&#39;s how i know i am not crazy in writing this to you. We saw it decend slowly down from a star..and then take a slant upward to the right...as we were going home from Sulpher Springs toward Commerce, Tx...(we had passed the point of the railroad tracks on the way home before the event occured) .. As it took the slant upward..it appeard to increase in speed and disappear for a short 1 or 2 seconds and then reappear at a higher altitude. then it went across the sky following the same length of the road we were on...and i fear that even though it was high up in the air...that we can only see it as a dot of light (redish,whitish, and bluish...i don&#39;t know if the colors were rotating or what but it appeared to show those colors ) I felt that it (the craft ) had taken pictures of us ..or at least knows that we viewed it. I believe that it isn&#39;t an alien ship..but rather some govt. intelligence work..they are using new types of crafts and testing their use.. The other observers noticed the craft with me ..and were in shock ..just like me..we sat still as the whole event occured. Part of me is afraid to this very day..and part of me wants to be a part of it..if there is a way for me to work on one of those .that would be the highlight of my life! Anyhow..I didn&#39;t see any green men ..or anything silly..but I know that it was some sort of new craft..that it wasn&#39;t a natural phenomon ... And i do believe that they made a mistake by accidently showing me the ufo..because now..and for the rest of my life ..i am going to always wonder ..and try to figure out what happened on that night. PS. In our town we have also felt the effects of these ufo&#39;s My mother was going into our house late at night and she said that the cars lights and all the lights of our street went out for a few seconds.. I witnessed the lights go out in our house at that moment.. I gather that if it was just the electricity on the city&#39;s line then just the houses would experience this..however because the car also had effects..i believe these crafts have some sort of magnetic properites that interfere with our electrical devices.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had finished packing my truck and hit the road for a five hour drive. I had changed jobs and had to move from Athens,Ohio (southeastern Oh.) to Lima, Ohio (northwestern Oh.). Had to report to work that morning (long day!!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 to 30 mintues into the ride, I was going around one of hills where you can see out over a valley. I first noticed a bright light to the left of me. It&#39;s size and shape was like a spotlight on an aircraft, or about the size of the end of a pencil. At this time I didn&#39;t give it much more thought. Do to the curving roads I lost sight of it, til I hit a nother open valley view. There was now two of them same brightness,shape. This time I had a fairly straight shot on this part of the road, so I slowed way down just to get a longer look at them. This was when the one in the front (I&#39;ll say) just shot straight to the west at unearthly speed. The other one seemed to start changing shape from round to elongated to diamond back to round. I had a curve coming up so I had to stop watching. When the trees opened up again on that side of the road. It was now closer to me larger in size, bright white with a lite blue edge. Needless to say I put the hammer down. As the speed increased I did pull out in front for I could now see it in the side mirror. Now at a 110+mph It was back along side of me, it now had a slight orange glow to the front edge, still changing shape. I slowed down to 85mph to go through some little town running all signs and signals. After going through there I did not see it for 10 mintues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After calming down mother nature began calling. I stopped in a wide open area to answer her call, and here it comes again from the area of that town just as I finished. This object chased me, or raced me I say this because it always stayed either behind me or beside me. It did at one time get closer to me, It looked like a very bright flying soda can at this time. I got to I-75 just out side of Sidyn, Ohio, this is when I finally lost sight of it. That was the fastest I had ever made that trip, an 70 mintues ahead of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD))<n>

As I got to the top of the overpass I saw a HUGE oval craft coming slowly from the ESE towards my car, just over the treetops.  I&#39;d estimate the size to be at least a football field, but circular and with multi-colored lights on the bottom (no flashing or blinking).  I stopped my car at the top of the overpass and just watched it move slowly W, right along I-195, and eventually disappearing over the trees in the distance.  What struck me most was that it made absolutely no noise, despite its huge size, and that it seemed to be gliding rather than flying.  In other words, it didn&#39;t seem to be displacing any air as it moved, and I heard nothing mechanical.  It was a warm night and I had my windows open, and I just couldn&#39;t believe how silent and graceful this thing was.  The only possible explanation I have is that it was a very large, very low-flying blimp, though I saw it pretty clearly and I saw no &#34;cockpit&#34; at the bottom of it and heard no mechanical noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was not a commercial blimp, we do not know what it was he witnessed.

Not as high as a jet nor at a level where the size was determinable. It was dark probably black but the lights underneath it were bright enough to obscure the vision as to color but the outline of it&#39;s shape was clearly visable in the clear sky. It hovered on occasion before changing direction. This lasted for a few minutes then it flew north out of view we saw several other normal (perhaps military) planes in the area afterwords. It&#39;s worth mentioning McConnell Airforce Base is  in Wichita about 25 minutes away. I&#39;ve never thought about reporting it since I&#39;ve always assumed it was of military origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A dramatic event was reported to NUFORC by the Cameron, MO, Police Dept. for this date, as well.))<n>

We were driving back from Lake Mead to Las Vegas Nevada where we all lived at the time. The desert was pitch black and the stars were very bright. As we were about 3/4 of the way to Las Vegas on Lake Mead Blvd. I noticed a bright Orange sphere shaped object moving in a straight line across the sky. The object was leaving a green trail of something behind it as it moved. The first thing I thought of was a &#34;plasma trail&#34;. It was moving to slowly to be a meteor or a satellite, but to fast to be an aircraft. I called out to the others to make sure that I wasn&#39;t seeing things, and they confirmed that it was there. None of us could identify it. I wanted the driver to pull over so I could get out to take a better look at it while not moving but no one else wanted to stop. I guess I was more fascinated then scared, but I could feel my heart pounding. There was no sound at all that I could tell, but the object seemed rather high in the sky. The green trail now extended half way across the sky as this object kept moving in a straight line without stoping, slowing, or speeding up. I continued to watch the object as it moved the entire length of the sky from one horizon to the other, about 10-15 minutes total. The green trail remained visible in the sky until we hit the lights of the city, long after the object had been gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued to look up,terrified but looking at blue lights zigzagging in the sky..I noticed a blue light above my head not certain if it was a star, but it started moving. Suddenly I turned to my right and saw a metalic craft, with what appeared to be light coming through 3 rows of windows. It floated tilted with no sound as it disapeared into the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I can&#39;t remember exactly what time it was, but it must have been after 10pm because it was very dark. It was the summer, I think, because it was warm. We had the windows down and the car was running. We were listening to the radio. At this landing, there is a man-made pond that the boat storage that kind of buffers it. There is a street light that is the only one back near this storage place. At this time, there were no houses around the storage unit. We both saw the bushes around the pond moving, and we both got really scared. Then, this object shot up out of the water/bushes. It wasnt very big,maybe the size of my car. It made no noise at all. I remember asking him what it was. It had lights on it, red and white. It moved over the car, and a white light beam came from under it. It slowed over my car. Then it sped of and disappeared behind the trees. We! both agreed we should leave. The next day I called him to ask if he remembered what we saw. He confirmed everything I remembered from the previous night. I still don&#39;t know what to make of that experience. I know it happened. I know it was real. I know I saw it. Just don&#39;t know what to do with that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When I got to the top I saw a man standing in the center of it staring at the stars by himself.  I looked into the direction he was looking at and could see a star or UFO moving westward slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a plane, but then all of the sudden it stopped right above us.  Then it slowly moved westward then stopped and made a perfect circular path right above us then went back to the center of that circular path and stopped. Then it took off like a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the tall man did you see that? he said yeah. What the heck was that?  He said, I don&#39;t know. He continued to look at the stars, and I again looked up and then to my astonishment we saw another star or UFO do the exact same thing the previous UFO had done.  I say it looked like a star because it looked like a star, but it was so high up it was probably a UFO with a bright underside to camoflauge the appearance to those below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a different date I saw a UFO with Red rotating lights move quite fast across the sky and it seemed to travel behind a star or a satellite. On another ocassion I witnessed something that I will never forget that happened this pass summer. I saw a red-orange ball of light approach my car and as it got closer my car stalled and I could feel heat all around me. I remeber staring at the light then falling asleep. When I awoke I found my car behind some building with dark tinted windows. I was in a parking lot and their was a fence with barbwire around it. I was so tired and exausted that I tried to start my car but it would not come on. After about 10 times it finally came on and I knew I had to get out of this place. I turned my car around and found a gate that was open and decided to turn right as I did I noticed in my rearview mirror the gate had closed. I got home at 3:36am where did all the time go? I was at my friends house and it should have taken me 20 minutes to get home. I awoke the next morning to find two moles right next to each other on my right arm perfectly lined up and my cars odomoter reset to a random number. This was smart, cause I could never mathmatically find out where that building was. I also felt as if I had been on vacation too, like I had missed being at my residence. The light from this latest ufo was the same light color from the Black Triangle light in Belgium.<n>

I came  back outside my tent to,  Well you know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway while I was  doing that I happend  to look to my left and I saw three bright white lights.

I was late, as usual, so I was driving fast to get there.  I was whipping around the back roads of Malvern, PA. The road in particular is called Providence Rd.  People in the area know it as a short cut, but it is very hilly and out of the way.  I remember it was Sunday night, about 9:00 PM.  Noone on the road and as I came over this one hill I noticed three white lights in the distance (20 miles).  I was a clear night, and not that dark.  The sun had gone down not that long ago.  I thought this is cool, must be some sort of military jets or something because it looked like they were in formation.  But the more I looked they weren&#39;t that close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Separated from each other by more than 10 miles or so, but they looked similar...three bright white lights.  I was heading north on Providence so two of the objects were heading east, the ones farther away from me, and then I realized one of them was heading in my direction, heading south southeast!  Once again, I was excited because I just thought this thing was like a F-15 or something.  It kept getting closer and closer.  So I slowed down because noone was around and it looked like it was going to pass right over me so then once I realized that I came to a complete stop.  I opened my moonroof to get a good look, thinking I would see afterburners etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead, I was shocked.  First there was no noise...nothing. The car was stopped and this was a desolate road. The only thing I heard were crickets.  The white light was on its front, but then it started to pass over.  I would say it was about 300-500 ft. up, actually very low for a flying object.  The speed was also slow, almost like it was giving me a show or something.  I could make out that it was a triangular shaped object.  Not a perfect triangle though.  It had a point in the front(where the white light was) then two straight lines/edges down the back and then two triangular shaped wings.  It really did look like a plane kind of, but trust me it was no plane because what I saw on the underbelly of this thing was like nothing I have ever seen, unless our military is way more advanced then I give them credit for.  Near the front of the craft on the bottom there was something I cannot even put into words.  It was a ball shaped object which almost looked suspended from the craft, and the thing that always sticks out and why I feel it was extraterrestrial was the color of this object.  The simple fact was, there was no one color.  It constantly changed color, and not like blue one second and then red. Not like that at all.  The only way I can describe it, it was like &#34;mother of pearl&#34;.  The white would form with other colors...mixing..blues greens reds and yellows.....then swirl to another color, but the white was always the background.  It just kept changing as it passed over.  Then behind it were 6 green square lights three on a side in a row.  To the right and left of the last green lights was where the wings were.  I was so in shock and so stunned, I just stared as it passed.  I mean I am an intelligent guy, I believe that there could be life out there.  I guess I never thought I would see it.  Of course I didnt have a camera or anything.  After it passed I just sat there for about five minutes in shock.  Not thinking I should follow.  Then it dawned on me that I should and talk to someone about it! or reco rd it.  I started the car and kept going north looking for a place to turn around, and I saw the two other white lights again...still heading east.  I started to chase them but I realized they were too far and I couldnt gain ground on them...moving to fast. I am not sure if those were jets following it or other UFO&#39;s, but the thing that passed over me was definitely a UFO.  By the time I turned around to find that one, it was gone too.<n>

6/15/95 21:00|Miami|FL|Light|10 - 15 Min.|Arizona lights...over Miami?|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37640.html|69|ndxe199506| Arizona lights...over Miami?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I am very unsure on the dates, I felt compelled to file this report because I know, along with the people who witnessed this with me, that we saw something unexplained. On a summer night in 1995 or 1996 I was outside of my house (parents&#39; house) along with some friends of mine as we did often. At about 9 PM (2100) I jumped up on a transformer box that was outside of many of the homes in that area. From that vantage point, I was able to look over the roof of my house and at that particular time I was looking to the south. Many miles away I could see what were 6 -7 lights yellow in appearance. The lights were in somewhat of a pattern in that they were one behind the other. Miami International Airport is South-South West of were we lived then so my first thoughts were that they were aircraft. After a few minutes I realized that wasn&#39;t possible because not only were they too close to each other, but they were standing still. As I continued to look I called over my friends to ask them what they thought that could be, they had no idea. As we watched some lights would disappear, and appear again only many miles forward (or ahead) of the first lights. Then some others would disappear, and reappear in the same locations. It was the first and only time I saw something that I could not explain in the sky. Years later I saw those same exact lights on television, they were calling them the Arizona lights. I have since learned that Homestead Air Base is also south of us, however I cannot confirm any operations because it was just too long ago, and I have no exact dates. I have seen flares launched from aircraft before, but I cannot say that they were what I saw that night. I am now a private pilot, and can confirm that there was nothing usual about what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My house is only about 2 miles from the Long Beach airport and during this summer evening I just so happen to look up at the sky when I got a sight of a faintly glowing lights moving silently from the ocean toward Los Angeles.  I believe there were 6 lights, arrange closely to each other that it formed a chevron or triangular shape, with the pointed end at the front.  All I saw was the faint light in this formation.  I would move my field of vision away from it slightly but had to search again to find it back because the glowing light formation was so faint.  It was completely silent and move slowly away.  After the lights had passed I could hear other small aircraft in the air, with it&#39;s typical propeller driven engine buzzing in the night sky.  I have only told a few trusted friends about this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife also saw the object and she also immediately recognized the teardrop shape and color were unlike anything we&#39;d ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside to the porch to get a better view.  It was passing about a mile away, and made no sound. It looked more like a streaking fireball than a craft.  I would&#39;ve dismissed it a a meteor if it hadn&#39;t been so nearby and was clearly flying just above the ocean cliffs without losing altitude.  I watched it move up the coast until it was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this sighting because of your great interview on Coast to Coast where you implored listeners send it in.<n>

Crash &amp; burn at Vandenburg &#39;95<n> <n><n> <n><n> So long ago now i can&#39;t remember the exact date, but but this was the only sighting of anything odd that i ever had and thought i&#39;d describe it here. Summer of &#39;95 laying in the pool looking up into the stars.......... i noticed one of them was moving. Thinking it was probably just an aircraft of some sort i followed it (visibly) for about 10 or 15 seconds and it stopped. I kept my eye on it so not to mix it up with the stars as it was about the same size and brightness of most. After watching it where it stopped for another 10 or 15 seconds the &#34;star&#34; accelerated at what appeared to be 90 deg. direction from which it original came from.... leaving a streak and promptly disappeared. I continued to watch the sky thinking i would see something else and approximately 15 or 20 minutes later i did. I believe it was a meteor coming into the atmosphere from the south east towards the north west at the same place as i just saw the moving &#34;star&#34; (as if it were marking the location). All this taking place (generally) over Edwards AFB and also near China lake Naval station...... i always wrote it off as possibly a military ufo, but a couple years later i heard a story right hear on nuforc about and object that crashed (touched down)and burned on the coast near vandenburg for a week. One last thing.... my cousin i found out just recently saw that so called meteor that lit up the sky green so bright it could have been day time, so i&#39;m thinking there were atleast more people that saw that to possibly comfirm the date. My opinion is....if this &#34;star&#34; was a craft from this world then we have some wicked awesome technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Occasionally I&#39;ll see some mention of these red &#39;Globes&#39; on some UFO show or report and think about what my First Officer and I witnessed. I don&#39;t believe it was man made, but something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The patterns or grids they were moving would, or at least to me, seemed almost in retrospect, computer generated and not some natural cause.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing was clear, clear as can be, which I&#39;ve never reported or written about, frankly I&#39;ve told few people with little detail on what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I&#39;m not sure what it was I saw, but it sure didn&#39;t look like something from this planet, really weird.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

While we were returning from the chow hall after the evening meal was served we noticed bright orange glowing lights off to our left (towards the east near the arizona -california border) they seemed to just hover there.  My first thought was that they were helicopters but to my knowledge choppers can&#39;t stay on station that long and to just hover there seemingly motionless.  Even helicopters on station will move laterally to some degree these did not we heard no noises either. Due to the proximity to the Yuma weapons testing ground and other military installations in that area we assumed it was some type of new flares or something along those lines. but To my understanding flares don&#39;t stay up in the sky that long. I&#39;m not sure exactly about the exact month of this sighting.  Also if they were helicopters they would have been to close together in formation to just hover it would seem that their rotor blades would have colided with one another.  It was strange indeed and there were alot of us prisoners that saw this incident. We were not allowed to stay out side and watch them as long as we wanted to as we were being herded back into our buildings/cells but we witnessed them for at least 10 minutes or so and heard reports from other inmates as they returned back to the building so they had to have been out there for some time. Also it should be noted that this occured for several nights consecutively at approximately the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date so that the report sorts to June 1995.

All the sudden the clouds above me lit up I saw flashing lights going in a circle very slowly the size of whatever was up there was a least the size of a entire football field maybe more. The lights were hugh not tiny and the flashing kept going in for hours. I got a chair and sat down and just sat there for a while watching the lights go around and around very slowly sometimes it seem to speed up then slow down. The lights travel in a counter clockwise and were bright white. There was a noise like a strange humming. I never saw what the lights were connected to because the cloud cover hid it from my eye, all I could see was a dark shadow of something hugh and round. Then after watching it for two hours the lights went out and it disappear right it front of me. I never reported this because I know the reaction I would have gotten if I call. But! now we no longer live there so I don&#39;t care who reads this because I am not a nut, nor was I drunk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have the information logged in a journal somewhere but where is anyone&#39;s guess. The reason I&#39;m putting it on here now is because of something I saw on TV about new camouflage technology. I was traveling north on the 55 freeway. Early summer, warm, not a cloud in the sky. I first noticed a shadow move past me, moving North. I expected to look up and see an airliner as I&#39;m not that far from John Wayne Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shading my eyes from the sun (which naturally would have caused the shadow) I saw nothing North of the sun. I looked back to the freeway and continued to see the shadow moving up the freeway. Again I looked at the clear sky and saw nothing so I looked back at the freeway. It was still there and still moving Nrth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this time I noticed the shadow was circular/oval and huge. The freeway moves pretty much due North. The shadow was moving in a North/NorthEast direction and I noticed that the edges of the shadow were overlapping both side of the freeway. That meant that it was wider than eight lanes and a center divider of the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being in the printing industry, I know something about screen density and know enough about shadow to know the closer the ground is to the subject, the more dense the shadow. I would say the shadow was what would be called in the printing industry an 80% screen which means it was at a fairly low altitude. At that time, at the point on the freeway, the traffic was moving at approximately seventy and I would the shadow was doing a hundred and thirty to a hundred and fifty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I detected no noise but I was driving the freeway. Anyway, the shadow continued in a straight line until it disappeared over my horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought, Great! Everyone else saw craft in the shape of a suacer and I see one shaped like a Big Mac. As I was driving home, I saw a National Speed Limit Sign. This is when In realised that the thing that I saw was in fact spherical rather than shaped as described above. If you rotate the National speed limit sign in England, around, about 45 degrees and you shrink the black centre line by a little, then you have the basic shape of what I saw. The colour was the same colour as Ragoo, a kind of sandstone orange. I have been asked how big it was? If you take a double decker bus and then split it in half, make the square bit that you have left, round, then this is about the size of what I saw. There were no flashing lights or anything to make this interesting, but I know I saw this object (although I somtimes even dought myself) and I know, having thought about it since, that every natural object, by it&#39;s natural shape is spherical. To travel at speeds exceeding light, which is not generaly acceptable today through the scientific channels, we would have to be super-human, but I know what I saw, and I have considered what I saw. I feel completely stupid, but I want to convey my theory, having thought about my experiance for many years. Would someone pleeeeeeeeeease talk to me.

It just seemed to be stuck in time not moving at all. I watched it intently almost as if I had no control... until it bolted into the only cloud in the bright blue sky not to return. The speed it traveled was unreal, more of a blur really and at a sharp downward angle. Amazingly it&#39;s speed seemed to be instantaneous. Example: like going 0 mph to lighting speed.

So we pulled up to a poplular spot to hang out on the ocean near captains cove.   The moon was about full and there was an object in the sky that was orangey yellow.  It was on the other side of the sky.  It was a perfect circle.   Larger than the moon.   We watched it for about a half hour.  Every minute it would get smaller and smaller.  It maintained a perfect cirlce shape.  And finally it got to the size of a star and then dissapeared.   This object didn&#39;t move.  It just simpley shrunk into nothing.

I do not remember the specific date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping alone on a remote beach located about ten to fifteen miles west of the town of Cameron, located in Cameron Parish Louisiana. The beach is located about a mile off state Highway 27, which runs along the Gulf of Mexico coastline from Cameron to Port Arthur, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had spent the day on the beach fishing, and was spending the night. The weather was perfectly clear with no clouds and no fog. I was laying on the beach, just looking at the stars and thinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2 a.m. I noticed an extremely bright object moving across the sky at very high speed. The object was coming in from out over the Gulf of Mexico and moving toward the beach, moving from south to north. I spend a lot of time outdoors and I am used to seeing aircraft at night. The object was moving extremely fast, much faster than I had ever seen any jet move. It&#39;s speed reminded me of a bright bullet. It was also at very high altitude, higher than what airliners normally appear to be, and seemed as if it were up among the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was quite bright, like a brilliant white light, and appeared to be quite large considering that it seemed to be so high. I was not able to discern any particular shape, only a very bright object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that this must be a military jet of some sort, but then something very remarkable happened. While maintaining speed the object suddenly reversed direction. It did not make a turn. It did not stop and then reverse. It was as if it hit a solid wall and bounced back along the exact same course. One second it was moving north, and suddenly it was returning south along the same route in a perfectly straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never before seen any aircraft do that and have not seen anything like it since. Because of this amazing straight line course reversal, I am convinced that this object could not possibly have been any comet, meteor, or known aircraft. I observed the object fly out over the Gulf of Mexico until I could no longer see it. The entire incident lasted only about a minute or perhaps a little less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my sister about it, but told no one else, out of fear of ridicule. I have decided to post my sighting now, thinking that perhaps someone else may have had a similar sighting in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my background, I have two college degrees, am a former police officer, and at the time of the sighting was teaching biology at a local university, where I taught for six years. I was not drinking or taking drugs of any kind. I&#39;m not making any wild claims, only reporting what I saw.<n>

After a few moments the glow got more clear and about a dozen red lights in no noticable arrangment dropped through the clouds and then quickly shot upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving south on Interstate 15 about 20 miles North of St. George Utah I noticed a red glow lighting up a small area of the low lying cloud bank.  I could tell that it was being lite up from above and not below (as city lights would do) and it was also not a very bright light or it would have lite up a larger area. The area that was lite up was about the size of a very large house. I was driving a loaded semi, so it took me a about a minute or two to come to a safe stop. I got out and observed it for about a minute or so. The spot of glow never moved in any direction for the few minutes I watched it. I say this because the glow never moved even up or down because the lighting did not get brighter or dimmer. Then it became clear that the object was lowering itself straight down. The glow became brighter and clearer until it completely dropped below the clouds for about 2 seconds, then quickly went straight up until I could no longer see even a hint of red glow. It moved up about the speed of a helicopter on a quick take off. The clouds were so low that I could have easily seen if the clouds were being disturbed by the wind that a helicopter would have produced but the clouds were not disturbed at all. Leaving me most curious about what propulsion system could produce no push or pull wind. A hot air baloon could have done what I saw if it wasn&#39;t for the lights. This had about a dozen red lights about the brightness of marker lights on planes and seem to be placed in no particular order. I could not see any of the object that the lights were on because it was dark except for the clouds and the glow. The craft ( as I assume it had to be ) was not flat, round, tubular, or anything else that would have a uniform surface around it. The lights were as if they were mounted on something with various surface levels. Like lights would look if mounted on an engine. My personal opinion of the movement of the craft was as if it was peeking below the clouds or suddenly realized it was below the clouds and didn&#39;t w! ant to be. Then took off like a child who has been caught.<n>

We watched it for about five minutes and in approx. 1 second the object shot by our car.  It was a brilliant flourscent fireball  about 30 to 40 feet wide traveling parallel to the highway , about 150 feet from us and the bottom about 50 feet from the ground. We were traveling with the windows down and the object did not make a sound. We had relatives traveling before and behind us. At our next gas stop we were anxious to discuss it with them - and they had seen nothing! We live near Cannon AFB, Clovis NM and I can guarantee you it was not a jet afterburner.

My 5 year old son and I were sleeping outdoors to watch for shooting stars and watched a redish softly glowing object travel from west to east. I measured it&#39;s size the same way your guest did. I estimated the first objest to be the size of a dime and the secound objest a bit larger, maybe a nickle. Looking at the first object I wasn&#39;t sure if it was round or not because it wasn&#39;t close enough. I thought it was but I wasn&#39;t sure. About ten or fifteen secounds later the secound object flew over and it was close enough to know that it was round. There was no noise and I would never have seen it had I not been looking up and in that direction. It was a soft red glow and I described it to a friend like the reflection of a red flashlight beam on a piece of aluminum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought that it was interesting that you described something so close to what I saw that many years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was no sound at all.  So i told my friend to come check it out and he got real sacred cause he did not know what it was.  then from out of nowhere a light came from one of the ufo&#39;s and my friend watching this with me just was in shock and did not move at all.  then from the woods came a grey creature that had a shape of pear for a head and two of the biggest black eyes that i have ever seen and had no mouth and no reproductive organs.  I had then felt a sharp pain in my head and i could hear the creatures thoughts and feel what it was feeling.  then he turned back after the pain in my head had gone away and the object had vanished before my eyes.  and ever since that day in june through the early days in july I have thoes sharp pains like migraines in my head.

Clear night. My friend&#39;s cats started climbing all over us and we thought that was odd, because they usually hide when company is over. We couldn&#39;t get the tele. focused on anything very well, so I got up to see if I could find the moon, easier to focus on. I walk down the driveway and turn around and looked above the house. She had tall Douglas firs between her house and the road. Above the trees was a round white light. I asked her when they got a new street light and she said they didn&#39;t. So I asked her to look and tell me what the light was. It was NOT the moon. She said she had no clue what it was and grabbed the tele.  When she bent down to look at it through the tele. the &#39;light&#39; (which was a bit smaller than the moon) flashed very brightly. My friend jerked her head back and held her hands over her eyes, saying the light had hurt them. Then the light shrunk to start size, zipped diagonally down and to the left and then took off way upinto the sky, where it continued to zigzag across the sky and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a red ball type of  light,  approximately 3 times flashed off.  Travelling at a very high speed approximately 6 fist lenghts off horizon, quite high.  It did a triangle flight pattern and proceeded to the north west  of sky area, did three sort of circular small patterns and went into atmoshpere,    It was a clear sky, was admiring stars for about 10 minutes prior.  Today is Feb 24, 1998, and I can still remember it clearly.  I was quite taken aback!!!  did some calling around to planetarium and observatories and they did not take me seriously, some said could be ball lighning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What surpised me most was how quickly it would change direction.  Zooming from one end and quickly shifting flight direction.  I screamed for my friends to come out of the house but time did not permitt.  Their is a small single engine plane  airport in area somewhere but I could not understand what flight pattern I was seeing especially as it flew up into atmosphere. It did not disappear into distance (i.e. east or west) but in altitude.  Seem to originally come overhead of Kitchner to south east over to Cambridge then to Waterloo direction back to cambridge over toward Kitchner direction   then in Kitchener area its 3 spins  small circles like spirals and then shoots strainght out into atmoshpere (space)..  I mention the towns to give you indication of how I observed it in  its flight pattern<n>

6/10/95 02:00|Northland, (remote countryside, East Coast)||Changing|6 hours|Head lights on a collison course with a hill which suddenly "jumped" back, appeared diamond shaped and zig zagged across the sky|6/10/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29076.html|113|ndxe199506| Head lights on a collison course with a hill which suddenly &#34;jumped&#34; back, appeared diamond shaped and zig zagged across the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were returning to our bach (beachside holiday home) in a remote farming/coastal area in Northland, New Zealand from a party at the nearest town.  I was as straight as a die as I had badly sprained my ankle the night before and didn&#39;t want to &#34;party hard&#34;  and make it worse (there was a good band and usually I love to dance) so had drank only two cans of premixed bourbon and cola over a period of about 7 hours prior to driving a car load of people back to my place who had been indulging. All up there were two car loads of us.  Our bach is situated on top of a hill which has a 360 degree view all around but the front of the place has huge windows which look directly out to the Pacific (directly east).  There is approximately 400 metres of land between us and the beach and it is totally flat - the top of our hill is probably about 5 or 6 storeys high...  Being a farming/rural community, the coast around here is reasonably unpopulated and there was only one house between us and the beach, an old homestead which my husband grew up in - about 100 m away from the hill between us and the beach.  There were no roads although a &#34;farm track&#34; lead to the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> October in New Zealand is still pretty cold, although officially spring, and we were all huddled together on the deck waiting for my partner to open the door when we all noticed two headlights coming straight towards us from the direction of the beach/sea.  We quickly realised that it wasn&#39;t a car as we were at eye level with these headlights and they were somewhat bigger.  The weird thing was that there was no noise and they had &#34;snuck up&#34; on us to quite a close distance without us realising.  Our initial reaction was that it was a plane or helicopter (do they have headlights?) and they were on a collison course with the hill (and us!) as they appeared to be getting closer and closer.  We were all talking about it when my husband finally got the door open and we all spilled inside.  I remember saying, quick turn on some lights so they can see it is a hill and a house and don&#39;t hit us.  We turned on the lights and everyone arranged themselves around the kitchen breakfast bar which looked over the sea.  I had gone straight to the window with one of the other girls and was amazed to see that the &#34;headlights&#34; were almost within striking distance but then in a &#34;blink&#34; of my eyes they had suddenly jumped back to sit out somewhere over the sea.  At this point they were bearly distinguishable as &#34;headlights&#34; and then suddenly seemed to be more of a diamond shape.  I verified with my friend that I wasn&#39;t seeing things and we tried to engage the others to reaffirm what we had all seen.  It was funny because they all sat down and opened drinks and seemed to forget about the headlights that had been coming straight at us minutes before.  We tried to get their attention and point out that the head lights had suddenly gone from about to hit us to sitting way back and they all went yeah yeah you guys are out of it!  Anyway, knowing that I was absolutely NOT out of it (may be a bit tired) I decided to go outside to have a better look as it was hard to know whether I was seeing things properly looking through the window and sheilding my eyes from the light inside.  It was pitch black outside except for a few dim stars and this bright white light which every now and then seemed to glow red and move about suddenly.  I felt a wee bit scared and got my girlfriend to come outside too.  We seemed to be the only ones interested or who remembered what had just happened...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got outside I was almost certain that the shape was a diamond although it had moved even further back, still at eye level though.  All of a sudden it zig zagged from side to side and seemed to come closer, then settled directly in front of us but further away.  I really thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and said to my friend... did you see that? She said yep and not wanting to lead her, I said, what did you see? and she descibed the zig zap movement too.  This thing must have been moving fast as it went from the left to right of our field of vision and back again several times in a matter of seconds.  At this point we got the binoculars and resting my arms on the fence to ensure I didn&#39;t wobble, I tried to see something.  It was too far away and only confirmed that it was vaguely diamond shaped, it was really bright and occasionally seemed to flash red but far enough back now that even through binoculars was hard to distinguish.  I gave up.  We started to run through all the things it could possibly be and logic said it wasn&#39;t any of them, ie. not a satellite as they orbit the earth on a horizontal plane, not a star as we had never seen one there before and they tended to pass overhead as night waned to day (incidentially I have looked and looked and never seen anything remotely like that light at any time of year, ever again), etc...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were determined to keep an eye on it and at one point started to feel that maybe it was keeping an eye on us!  Every now and again we would go back in and tell the others it was still there but they told us we were seeing things.  It zig zagged several times after that and occasionally appeared to come closer (and we got ready to run inside) but always it settled just beyond our field of truly distinguishable vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to keep an eye on it until it went away and finally it sat at a point which we realised was the horizon as the sun came up, and there it stayed until about 8.00 am.  As the sky lit up it maintained its brightness while the stars dimmed and faded out completely by about 7.00 am.  We watched the family in the house below arise and soon summised that even if farmers/early risers did look to the sky, unless they knew where to look, they probably would have missed this object or dismissed it as a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time we had &#34;landmarks&#34; to measure the object against, being several little islands near the horizon.  As the sun rose we were able to confirm that it was sitting just above and to the right of the one on the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were tired by now and nothing &#34;exciting&#34; had happened for quite some time so we would go inside and come out every half hour or so to check...  Around 8.00 am we realised that having sat stationery for most of the night, the object was now moving up, back and to the left at a considerable speed.  We could still see it because we knew where to look but, although bright, it was becoming much smaller as it moved away.  By about 10.00 am we could still see it getting smaller and further away and finally giving up, noted that it had moved a lot from its original position... instead of just above and to the right of the right island, it was now considerably to the left of the left island (bearing in mind the islands are situated straight ahead and directly to the east) and instead of near the horizon, was high in the sky, and a mere pinprick of bright light, having at first been of a size considerably larger and brigher than the largest and brightest star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years, we have talked of this experience to numerous people and not all have scoffed.  I didn&#39;t know who to report it to so didn&#39;t.  A few people even related their UFO stories to me.  One guy was on his way from shopping with his wife after work, when coming out of the city, noticed a many storied, brightly lit object hovering over the sea.  They pulled over and looked at it, as did the car behind them, before it disappeared.  He is disappointed that they then drove off without verifying it with the driver of the other car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another was an airline pilot who looked at me in horror when I asked him if he believed in UFO&#39;s.  I proceeded to tell my story anyway, at which point he relaxed, and realising that I wasn&#39;t going to cite him mad or cause him to lose his job, he told of a time near New Caledonia, an island in the Pacific, when his commercial flight and an American plane were both circling to land and reported an unidentified object sitting between them.  It didn&#39;t show on the radar on land or their planes, but the cockpit crews of both planes had visually identified it and started discussing it sitting between them, at that point it suddenly accelerated straight up in the air from a motionless position, at extremely high speed, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another friend who does air traffic control told me that something once crossed his radar and went off the screen in a matter of seconds - many in the control tower witnessed it and none can explain it as the speed at which it was flying was so much greater than anything known at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in October 1995 is approximate.

I witnessed 5 lights in the sky,moving in a &#39;V&#39; shaped cluster. I stopped my car after 1 mile to see if I could get a better view of anything in the sky. I looked out of the passanger window, before getting out of ny car. I saw a saucer shaped ufo about 100ft in diameter, this object was only about 200ft above a house rooftop. Underneath the object, the centre turned in &#39;like a trumpet&#39;.Around the rim, still underneath there were black square shaped panels evenly spaced. I clearly saw symbols on the side of the object, these were in the shape of triangles. There were 3 triangle smybols. In a line together, the middle triangle was &#39;upside down&#39; as you looked at it, the ones either side were as you would normally look at a triangle. The strange thing is, 3 years later, I was watching &#39;Fifteen to one&#39; on channel 4 in England, the presenter of the quiz: showed a card with the same symbols as I had witnessed, to a contestant. The answer was that it represented: Fire and water. There were only 3 black windows on the object. the object was metallic and stationary, it made no sound. I know If i had a camera i would have the best picture in the world. I am lucky to see a ufo so close, and in detail. The ufo disappeared when i had opened my car door to get out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

SUNY Albany, down town campus and the organized field trips that transpired?  I can tell you the story but my friend Steve can tell you more about it. The machines were silent! I mean, if you ever seen a flying object which was silent? It always came in full view (100 feet across)  blinked in and it always blinked out and the object was in a loop. It kept coming over and over, all night long. I kept watching the see if I could see it coming, but always full view. Only lights on the tips. It was brown and seems that we could only see an outline. We (((deleted)) and I) watched it until day break and then we stopped seeing it. It was too over top for us. We could not understand it then and we still, do not understand. It just does not fit into any of the things we have learned. We were not doing anything. He was cleaning his window and that was all. We never went back to the football field next the down town campus to watch for it again, because we thought that it would never reappear after that night. But that is not the end of the story. A year went by or more and I was in LA now. I had a girl friend and we picked someone up at the airport coming from Albany. And he said that their was flying objects in Albany without sound and that field trips were organized nightly to see this thing in action. If you were in that car, this guy was of the wall with emotions. I could not talk with him and we both did not believe the other. It was too much then and it is too much now. I was wondering if you know the people in charge and if the trips and if you know if they were still going on or put me in contact with the organizers I would like to go. I am ready to see it again. My girl friends name is ((name deleted)) and she still lives in LA and she knows the people behind this, but we had a falling out and I lost her number. So they say. Also I did not contact you before because I thought silent flying objects were stealth fighters or the government had the technology. This all happen in 1995 or 1996 when I was at SUNY Albany New York. My name is<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There is a report of an object seen on the 7th in another state that is remarkably similar to what I observed on June  1995. The other witnesses, who were my co-workers did not report this event, as we did not know how to go about doing so. The following is an account of what we saw. The details are not hazy in my memory, as they are burned into my mind- they could never be forgotten.I work at a Bungee jump tower in Golden CO. I am the supervisor of five employees that run the jump tower each day. At 6pm, one of my employees remarked how the clouds in the sky, when observed from the ground with the backdrop of the tower, made the tower appear to move.(the wind was blowing the clouds) I looked up, along with another employee, and noticed that this was true. Gazing at the sky behind the tower, something caught my eye. At first I thought it was an airplane, as it appeared to be at the same altitude as a plane taking off from DIA would. But then it abruptly changed directions. I pointed this out to the other employees. We then observed the object for about ten or fifteen minutes. The object was reflecting the sunlight, and therefore was flashing in the daytime sun. After five minutes or so, it appeared that the object was getting closer. We could then tell that the object appeared to be a metallic shaft with two round ends, like a barbell. The flashing was cau!sed by the object rotating irratically, and wobbling back and forth. I suggested that it was simply two mylar balloons caught in the wind, but then we noticed the same clouds previously mentioned, and the object was moving opposite these wind blown clouds, ruling out the balloon idea. Then, after approximately seven minutes of observation the object changed directions and headed back the opposite direction. The object did not seem to be getting closer at this point, but we then noticed a faint greyish foggy halo surrounding the object. At this point two customers came to the jump, and inquired as to what we were gaping at. They observed the object as well. After a maximum of fifteen tense minutes of observing this anomoly, the object changed course abruptly, went behind a small, thin, transparent cloud, and dissapeared. I would appreciate any information regarding this sitghting, i.e. whether the similar sighting in your log is of similar circumstances. Since 1995 I have been w!rithing to get this reported, and am very grateful for this service.<n>

I described it being eclipsed, but it wasn&#39;t because of another object.  It looked like a total eclipse of the sun, but you could only see the shadow.  Maybe it was turning, I&#39;m not sure, it was very small from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the blackest black I&#39;d ever seen, it looked like the period at the end of a sentence floating in mid air.

And when I said it vanished, it did exactly that, vanished,  It didn&#39;t accelerate in any particular direction. It was just gone.

Although the Gerald R. Ford Airport is less than a mile from where I was.  It wasn&#39;t any kind of aircraft I&#39;d ever seen before.

6/3/95 13:00|Syracuse|NY|Formation|15-20 seconds|High altitude V-formation of 7 objects|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62515.html|133|ndxe199506| High altitude V-formation of 7 objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> High Altitude Formation  Description  On a CAVU day while driving north on I-81 about 100 miles south of Syracuse, New York at around 1 PM on June 3, 1995, I saw a low-flying small aircraft pass directly over and perpendicular to the Interstate about a half-mile ahead, then disappear over a row of trees to my right. I deduced that an airport must be nearby and began scanning the sky for other aircraft. Not noticing anything, my scan gradually rose in altitude until I noticed a V-formation of white dots flying from west to north-east. I counted seven individual dots, one on point and three on each leg. They were moving rapidly, left no contrails, and appeared to be at extremely high-altitude. They had no discernible form, appearing as small white dots-not shiny but soft white. I watched them move at a constant speed for approximately 15 to 20 seconds as they traversed 45 degrees of azimuth. At that point they appeared to slow almost imperceptibly and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Analysis:  Although this event occurred almost 13 years earlier, it is quite accurate. I had written down the particulars shortly after it happened, and my present memory of the event corresponds exactly to that written record. I have also confirmed the exact date, although the time of day is approximate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is impossible to tell at what altitude these objects were flying. However, I expect that they were at extremely high altitude because they had no discernible form. Commercial aircraft flying at FL330 have a clearly visible aircraft shape, but these objects were merely dots. They were clearly not birds, which display a typical individual motion as they flap their wings. These objects never varied in size, color, intensity or motion. It is quite apparent that just before they vanished from view they began a turn, giving the perception of slowing. As the turn progressed, they no longer reflected sunlight toward me and became invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The angle of azimuth covered by the flight of the objects is known because they came into my view just beyond the left corner of the windshield and they disappeared almost directly ahead. Furthermore, this section of the Interstate was as straight as an arrow, for you could see the road stretch out for miles ahead with no curves whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of observation is approximate; I did not record the exact times. Estimating duration of time for short-lived events is notoriously inaccurate, unless there is some reference. Because I am cognizant of this fact, I have tried to mentally relive the event and time its duration. While observing the objects I kept pointing them out to my passenger, who never did see them. I have taken that dialog into account and added additional precious seconds to arrive at what I believe is a fairly close and extremely conservative approximation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given these variables, it can be estimated that at 30,000 feet the speed of the formation would be between approximately 780 and 1045 MPH, and at 50,000 feet the speed would range from approximately 1295 to 1725 MPH.<n>

At that time there was a drought condition and the lake water level was very low and as a result, we nearly had the entire campground to ourselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 11:30pm, we were sitting by the campfire and we both noticed a light on the horizon moving very slow from left to right, just a single dot of white light.  It was difficult to determine the distance but my guess was approx. a mile away.  I knew that there were not airports or air traffic around that area (it&#39;s in the middle of nowhere), and besides that, this object was too low and moving too slowly to be any type of high flying commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may sound rather incredible, but I picked up my flashlight that I had sitting next to my chair and on a whim, shined it at it.

There was noone else on the highway!<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, I got scared, and turned my lights off and floored my truck to get away from this THING!  When I got around the bend, I pulled down my window and could not hear anything or see the flashing lighhts,behind me!  Believe me, I have been in NAM and scared, BUT, never this bad!  I got a very weired sensation and started driving again, IT FELT LIKE MY HEART WAS GOING TO COME OUT OF MY CHEST!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was approx. 5 miles from home, and the next thing I knew, I was home!!!  It was like an instant!  I felt weired, and told my wife about it and we retired for the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I drove back to where I saw this thing and to my supprise, there is NO WAY for anything to be wheree this thing was; it was to steep an incline, so this thing must have been hovering like a helicopter!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen several sighting over the years,and those were wittnessed by others.  All I know is that I SAW WHAT I SAW!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/95 23:00|Provincetown|MA|Unknown|45 sec|Three white lights at high altitude in a triangle formation moving at "jet liner" speed|4/26/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/006/S06372.html|141|ndxe199506| Three white lights at high altitude in a triangle formation moving at &#34;jet liner&#34; speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a posting that relates to a sighting that occured in West Dennis, Massachusetts, on 8/31/97, and which is listed in this database.  My sighting involved a night out near the beach in Provincetown, MA, looking for satellites. I observed a triangle formation of three white lights moving at a &#34;jet liner&#34; speed, as if at 35,000 feet altitude, and at 50 degrees elevation or so.  The lights moved across a short arc and disappeared in sequence.  I was impressed by their lock-step movement, and I thought at the time that even military craft would not fly at that distance apart.  This sighting may seem innocuous, except that the West Dennis case involves what I am sure is the same sort of thing.  On another occasion, by the way, I was looking for satellites in Maine while on vacation and I saw a white light moving like a satellite, when it suddenly made a 90-degree turn!  This happened in Aug. of 1992 near Bath, ME.<n>

The area is very rural all of the surrounding land was owned by International paper company (logging). We spotted the craft above us as we slowly drove down the road with our lights off it was moving on a flight path that followed the road  it seemed. It was approximately 200 feet off of the ground moving VERY slowly and silently. It had two light beams that were shining in all directions in a sweeping motion. One light source on each side of the front or cockpit area of the craft. The beams swiveled and moved much like a chameleons eyes do in their sockets. The lights were searching the ground at times and out into the air around the craft at times. The craft banked very slowly toward the north (it was traveling east) tilting at an extreme angle while continuing to search with the lights. It went out of view for a few moments then returned to the same area.On the second period of observation the craft gained altitude steadily then shot off towards the southwest without a sound.The whole scene lasted around 18 minutes, with a total of 10 minutes of actually observing the craft. Some type of military craft on training from seymour johnson or camp lejune ? Or extra terrestrial ?<n>

I sped up very rapidly to follow the light and it suddenly got extremely small and made a teardrop looping motion and came directly at us,it was so rapid that it was frightening and moved with unbeliveable quickness directly at my vehicle,I quickly turned around and came back down the road to my driveway and pulled in.We got out of the car frightend as a huge steel object silently and slowly moved over my house and shop directly above us it was so large that I could not see either side and it covered the entire view directly above-we quickly ran into the house and I got a rifle and just sat on the couch waiting to see what would happen next,finnally after about 30 minutes I went back outside and it was gone.I know this sounds rediculious but it really happened-------very Frightening-----<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We had just got done eating and since it was a beautiful night out we decided to sit outside to talk.  The house we were staying at was in the woods and there were no street lights making the stars and sky as bright as ever.  As we sat there, someone said, &#34;look, a satelite!&#34; and pointed to an object that was moving across the sky...very high up.  It actually looked like a star that was moving.  As we watched it...it stopped moving...and traveled back in the opposite direction...disappeared for a few seconds, re-appeared and continuted traveling across the same path again.  As we watched in amazement, a second, then third then fourth object came across the same path.  As each reached a certain point in the sky they disappeared.   After discussing amongst ourselves we realized that they were too high up and traveling too fast to be any type of satelite.  Plus the fact that the first one actually stopped and reveresed direction at one point.   No alcohol or drugs are used by me or any of my friends.  Just the right place at the right time!<n>

To see Mercer, I looked across the other opposite lanes of traffic and up above a hill.  I saw a the hugest plane imaginable.  It seemed larger than a football field. What I noticed most was that it was actually hovering, stationary, for several moments while I drove. It seemed like a plane. It was not square like a football field, but more angular like a huge triange. I saw one.  Anyone on the freeway could have noticed it. The color just looked like a plane, some neutral off white, grey or silver I guess. It remained there the whole time I drove that strip of the freeway, which was many moments, and maybe a minute or more. I don&#39;t remember hearing any noise from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my 30&#39;s, with a Master&#39;s Degree in Information Science.  I was on my way to go two-stepping in Seattle.  I tried marijuana and hash in college a few times, over 10 years prior. No other drugs or addictions.  I should have turned around and gone back, but the person I loved was waiting for me in Seattle for a good night of clean fun.  I did not report it because I assumed hovercraft had been invented while I was cloistered in college and graduate school.  I assumed a plane that large was not unheard of.  It never occured to me that it could be UFO until I checked with my acquaintences who work at Boeing and they assured me they did not have planes like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in June 1995 is approximate.

6/1/95 21:00|Pensacola|FL|Flash|5 min.|Flash in a Pensacola sky|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70489.html|150|ndxe199506| Flash in a Pensacola sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has always been hard for me to talk about, but I think it’s time to share my experience so I can put it behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was eight years old my sister, my dad’s friend son and I were in their backyard jumping on a trampoline.  The three of us were by ourselves and our parents and other siblings were inside doing who knows what.   ((name deleted)) was irritating me by jumping right next to me and I started to wrestle with him meanwhile my sister is laughing at us sitting on the other side of the trampoline.  It was a pretty clear night with just a few clouds in the sky with a gentle breeze which I remember clearly because it’s so humid in Florida and it was one of the few evenings as a child that I was unsupervised and outside to enjoy the sea breeze.  The next few moments are hard to describe put I will do my best. Their was a bright flash of light so bright that I was blinded momentarily to tell the truth I’m not sure how long it seemed like a long time but I’m sure it was only seconds. It was almost like a strobe light you know how everything seems like it’s in slow mo.  After the flash, it looked as if a bright ball of light fell in the woods maybe 30 or 40 feet away from the trampoline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister, ((name deleted)), and I were stunned.  We scrambled off the trampoline and raced to the backdoor. Enroute I saw 4 different colored lights blink in the woods. (Yellow, blue, green and red) After that I heard a strange noise that’s even harder to describe it was like a metallic computer sound with one beep after the other with each beep a different pitch. By this all happened in seconds I think. By the time we had heard and seen the different colored lights and the beeping noises we were at the back door pounding on it for someone to let us in. Meanwhile there was a rustling in the woods which could have been a dog or other animal but I’m just not sure given the other things that had just occurred. Matty’s older brother came and opened the door maybe a minute or two after we had started pounding on it and we all rushed into the! kitchen The three of us were hysterical and proceeded to report the events that had just happened to matt’s brother and then told our parents who of course could not say what had happened and made it seem we were making it all up which to this day bothers me that my own parents think it was a prank or that we were flat out lying. So I hope that this may help someone else who has seen something similar to me experience.  Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))<n>

It was to the South.  We were within a mile of Interstate 35.  We watched it as we talked as we knew there was no tower or anything there. We eventually noticed it was slowly moving towards us. It took a good 20 minutes to go from the horizon to overhead. There was no sound and no other light. It did not variate in brightness at any angle. It seemed to stop overhead, maybe 3000 feet or less. Just far enough that a spotlight could not hit it. It drifted like a hot air balloon in speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching, I called the ATC tower at the local airport.  They confirmed they could see it visually but did not know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes it just turned off. 2 minutes later it reappeared in the exact same spot on the South horizon again.  When I called ATC again, they advised they now knew what it was but couldn&#39;t tell me. I told them they might ought to before someone shoots at it or something stupid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It repeated the exact same path until it was right overhead again, and then just turned off. We never found out what it was. I just thought it sounded exactly like the other report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The reason I&#39;m reporting it as a UFO is that it had no markings or lights on it as required and was hiding in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving West from Florence Jct. on Rt. 60 towards Mesa at 18:00 just before sundown and was still about 20 miles from Mesa when I noticed it among the clouds North of Mesa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it looked like 4 small clouds floating South but then 3 of the clouds continued to float South while the 4th one turned and went back North over the mountains when it looked like it might end up out in the open over the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I could make out the football shape and was able to identify the craft as a Zeppelin or something similar. I continued to watch it for about 30 min. as I drove West until it disappeared in the shadows over the mountains to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen the Goodyear blimp and the Fuji blimp and it wasn&#39;t either of them, it was much too big, all gray and had no lights or markings on it and looked a lot like the one moored to the Empire State Building at the beginning of the movie Sky Captain.  The odd thing is I searched for Zeppelins on Google and the last one seems to have been decommissioned around 1940. This sighting was before the Phoenix Lights so I figure something like that carrying a structure underneath with some lights on it at night could have been the cause of some of the reported sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, last year I saw a story about a new model Zeppelin that was flying across Texas and Arizona on it&#39;s way to California about the same time all the UFO reports were coming from Texas. It was on the local news in Phoenix because it stopped briefly in Tucson.

What is it?|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42512.html|161|ndxe199506| Orange Sphere 10 foot wide  just sitting out side our window for 20 minutes!  What is it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> This siteing has been on my mind for almost 10 years and I would really would like to know what happened to us that summer night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We (my xwife and I) were awakened at 4:20 in the morning my a electric sound almost like standing next to a loud generator, not the engine part but the humming sound.  We both sat up on the bed at turned around and looked outout bedroom window and we saw a orange sphere about 9 feet to 10 feet across. It looked like the sun but through a filter so you could see the makeup of the light , sorta like the sun when shown on t.v.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered just 2 feet off the ground and we watched it for a solid 20 minutes until it lifted up and slowley floated around trees and over our busy (not then) 4 lane road and watched as it floated up and over the homes across the street and after 40 minutes it looked like a orange spec next to the other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife turned to me and said &#34;  what the h%&amp;# did you bring home with you?&#34;  The reason for that comment was because 2 days before 130 miles North at my hunting property I witnessed a black triangle that was just above my head ( no witness on this one)  I heard it ( sounded like air being drawn through a hose)  and it shot off -  I had five and half hours of missing time.   Since then I have had two other close encounters, one very involved the same week and one years later,.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone out there in the Government  knows whats going on and I am tired of waiting for them to come clean,  I&#39;m getting fustrated trying to find out the truth.  What a bunch of liars they are saying they don&#39;t know anything when I know for a fact we are being visited, we have the right!  The strange thing was, was<n>

The only thing that caught my eye was a slight glare off of the silver/metal look it had. It then started to move at what seemed to be warp speed, first up then left  in what seemed to be in less than a blink of an eye, I lost sight for a second then the glare caught my attention and when I looked at it again it seemed to skip across the sky to my far right and then it vanished just as fast as it appeared. What I thought was strange is the movements made were very elusive only up, down, left, and right and even more it  never  sat still for long almost as if it knew it was being watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/1/95 13:00|Los Angeles|CA|Formation|15 minutes|A silver polygon object with several satelight ships over downtown Los Angeles in the mid nintey's, stops and flys straight up.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50266.html|164|ndxe199506| A silver polygon object with several satelight ships over downtown Los Angeles in the mid nintey&#39;s, stops and flys straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have the exact date, it was some time ago.  I estimate it was the summer of 1995.  I was outside in my back yard in South Los Angeles CA.  Clear blue sky, no wind, early afternoon.  Something told me to look up.  I did and at an altitude of about 10,000 feet (estimated, it was just above the normal flight plan of landing LAX planes) headed east bound right over downtown was what appeared to be a weather balloon, silver in color.  This ballon was shaped like a 3 dimensional polygon, the sides were triangular so I gues it would be described as a dodecahedron.  I looked closer and saw several dark collered what looked like jet airplanes with curved back wingtips in hot pusuit of this weather balloon.  Just then a friend of mine walked up and wondered what I was looking at.  I showed him and he saw the same thing (a big releif!).  Just then the Balloon stopped in mid flight just east of downtown Los Angeles.  The &#34;jets&#34; that were in hot pursuit split off in formation and began circling the baloon (i.e. the first plane went let, second went right, third left and so on).  The Balloon stated to spin at about 10 rpm.  More and more &#34;jets&#34; began to appear and I counted maybe 20 of them at this point.  After holding in this position for about 2 minutes the baloon took off stright up at a rapid and controlled rate and the jets broke the circular formation and followed right behind the balloon in a straight line, straight up until I could no longer see them with the naked eye.  The speed was comprable to a space shuttle launch but there was no noise, no smoke or trails.  I heard no unusual sound and the only thing I noticed is this was taking place in the normal flight plan that planes land at LAX and during the entire time of the sighting no other air traffic was seen or heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

6/1/95 13:00|Craig|CO|Changing|20 Minutes|Very Shiny and Reflective Saucer seen on the South side of Craig, Colorado Summer of 1995|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74044.html|165|ndxe199506| Very Shiny and Reflective Saucer seen on the South side of Craig, Colorado Summer of 1995<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unaware there was a site such as this to post your experiences.  My buddy and I had agreed not to report what we seen for fear that we would be laughed at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents live on the west side of Craig, Colorado, and I left there to pick my buddy up at his place which was a townhouse also on the west side of Craig.  The weather was a clear blue sky without any clouds so to speak.  We had decided we were going to go the Village Inn to eat and as we headed east on Highway 40/Victory Way toward the Village Inn my buddy said is that a &#34;jet&#34; as he pointed to the south side of town???  I said yeah that&#39;s a &#34;jet&#34; as I looked I could see a jet flying along with a vapor trail.  He said not there over there!  I looked and said I don&#39;t know what the h*ll that is.  As we were driving I noticed a guy walking along the highway that was looking in the direction of the object also.  I said lets get closer to it and we drove east and turned south on to Ranney Street.  We pulled up underneath the craft around the area of 1st Street.  I estimated it to be about 100-150 feet across and it looked like the common description of a saucer.  It had an eleva! ted center area and was disc shaped and was made of a very reflective and highly shiny metal.  I could see the sun reflecting on the side of it extremely bright!  I collaborated with my buddy the whole time to confirm what I was seeing.  At a distance it looked like the object was sitting in space on an exact point without moving at all.  When we got closer I could tell the object was rotating about a central axis like a top at an extreme speed.  It was holding exact position without a bobble and didn&#39;t make a sound.  We sat there and looked at it in awe when it started rotating faster and faster!  I said it&#39;s speeding up on its rotation right?  My buddy said yes it is.  Then it began to change shape flattening out like a cigar with the elevated center area completely gone and then in an instant it vanished completely!  I asked my buddy am I seeing things or did it just vanish!  He exclaimed yes it vanished completely.  This first time seeing the object I guessed it lasted ! about 12 minutes.  I looked further south and said there it is! again! We sped south to the intersection that heads east to the golf course and airport.  It was hovering like before and we sat there and looked at it again and like before it changed shape and vanished!  This time the viewing was for about 5 minutes.  Then we seen it again east of the airport so we headed east and as we got up on it began to change shape once again like before and in an instant it was gone.  It never reappeared after this time.  The whole duration of us watching the object was probably around 20 minutes.  We honestly couldn&#39;t believe what we just saw.  If I was to see a UFO I always thought it would be a brief passing in the night.  I&#39;ll never forget this that&#39;s for sure.  We seen this object so often and I had heard of abduction and people having their memories erased.  We checked our watches pretty closely to make sure there was no missing time.  I think I would still be scared to be hypnotized.  My buddy was from Grand Junction, Colorado and I haven&#39;t talked ! to him in years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Larger than a football field   There was no sound at all. Silver or white   it reminded me of what the hills must have seen. the flat side was toward the ground,and it just sat  there,like it was waiting for me to do something.  I wasn&#39;t scared, just     wondered what it was going to do, come down or go up.  Finally, it went straight up.  Flat like a pancake, then as come another cloud it tilted edge wise and went into the cloud,that was higher than the one it came out of.  I presume so it would not      disturb the cloud. I don&#39;t know why I saw it,maybe they wanted me to know they are here.    I just got a computer or I would have reported it sooner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The kind that fit over your regular glasses. Sailing is pretty boring when there is no wind. i was reclining looking up into the sky and I saw a circle in the clouds. My first impression is that it looked like one of those big round plastic paper clips, round with a tongue coming down the center. It was at a very high altitude and obscured by high clouds. It was so faint that I thought it might be a glare on my granny sunglasses. I moved my head up and down and side to side. The object did not move. I raised the sunglasses and the object was not visible. I put the glasses back on and it was visible. It was very faint and line pattern was white in color. so the object was a white line on a blue sky background with white clouds all around. Very hard to see. I had some binoculars just out of arms reach and I was worried about losing the object. I took a chance and reached for the binoculars. I never saw it again. The object was perfectly round and symmetrical. It did not move, with my outstretched arm, it was about half the size of my thumb. At the altitude that it was, that would make it huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will include a diagram of what it looked like, on Microsoft Visio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

This facility is located on a mountain top covering an expansive area and the perimeter shack was located in an area where the facility lighting was somewhat blocked for better night vision of the perspective area to be observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I retired in the spring of 1995, so this event took place in the winter prior to my retirement, though the exact date in January I don&#39;t remember. I do remember that it was crispy cold out and there was snow on the ground and the sky was extremely clear, black and filled with stars. I&#39;m guessing that it was between two and three o&#39;clock when I left the warmth of the perimeter shack to go outside to relieve myself of all my coffee intake and just happened to scope the very clear and starry sky when I noticed a bright light which at first I thought was a shooting star or satellite, speed and stop suddenly almost directly overhead and remained still, maintaining its&#39; yellowish reflection as did all five objects, which I&#39;m assuming was the reflection from the sun, when suddenly another appeared of the same size and speed, and then another shot in, and then a fourth one sped in, and then a fifth, each from different directions at an unbelievable rate of speed and seemed to hover there for maybe forty to fifty five seconds or so, not touching each other, but very close to one another as if they were having a meeting. Each of these lights where about the size of the hole at the end of a common ball point pen and left a slight tail that diminished when they stopped and there was no noise, possibly because they were so far away. The yellowish reflection color was the only color that was noticable, if there were any other colors at all, I believe these objects were to far away to distinguish any running lights or maybe the suns&#39; reflective beam devoured any other colors. You could have placed all five object lights into the diameter size of a dime or even smaller area. I watched for what I am guessing for about a minute or so and then they all suddenly sped off at the same time, at the same devastating speeds that they showed up at, in the same general directions that they all originally came from. I was totally amazed at what I had just witnessed and sort of wondered if I actually saw what I saw. I spent a g! ood hour or more out in the cold night peering for more of this action, but saw none and eventually the sun began to rise and I lost the night sky vision. I said absolutely nothing to anyone at my work place at the time because of the ridicule and possible accusations that I was halucinating or something and with the exception of a few friendly conversations over the years, very little has been to said to anyone until now. I can still see it so clearly in my mind. If I had had a camera at that time and was able to photograph this account, it would be even more believable than what it already is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was reading some of these reports in this space and thought I would share this account and experience. Just possibly, someone else out there may have observed this same phenomenon that took place in January of 1995 and maybe state what they had seen also. I am a firm believer in extraterrestial life and feel that we are not alone or the only intelligent being in existance in this universe....Thank You.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I really didnt see an alien space craft but I was abducted. It all started when i was sleeping in my bedroom. I was sleeping on my bed when i rolled over onto my left side. I opened my eyes and saw this alien looking down on me. The alien was smoke (black) colored skin, had shiny, black reflective eyes. It was tall and slender. When I looked into the eyes of the alien, I immediately froze. I was defenseless and had no control over my body. I couldn&#39;t even move or speak. I tried to open my mouth and scream but I couldn&#39;t. The Alien overrided my neurological system, which made it difficult for me to move. The only thing that I could do was watch in horror. The Alien then lifted his/her hand and I suddenly saw a bright flash of light that last for about a second. I was then on what appeared to be the UFO. The room (inside the UFO) was really bright. I saw 3 other aliens. They had me on a hard bed which was made out of some type of smooth stone. I then watched them inject a needle that had 3 smaller needles around it, inside my right bicep. I didn&#39;t feel any pain but I was able to feel the coldness of the needle. After the injection, an alien came over to me, lifted his hand up and a bright flash of light fulfilled my eyes. I was then back in my house, laying on my bed. I got out of bed and went into the kitchen and turned on the light. There, I observed my right arm (bicep muscle) and I saw markings (red dots) where they had injected me with their needles. I saw one dot, about 3cm and 3 smaller dots (about 1cm) that surrounded the bigger dot. This was my encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very light green in color and was more like a short bullet instead of a longer cigar shape.  It was traveling from west to east in a level flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My perception was that it was about a mile or two from my location.  I watched it for 6 or 7 seconds before it disappeared from my view because of trees along the road I was walking on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It impacted my memory because of it&#39;s shape and color.  I had never seen any object in the sky with its distinctive pale green color.  It definitely had no perceptible wings.  It was rounded on the front and flat on the rear.  It&#39;s length was about 3 times its height. No guess as to its speed, but not extreme.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Me and a bunch of other pay daily laborers ususally cut out for lunch around 1 am and would head for the 7/11, but this lunch I layed down in a wheel barrel and was just staring at the front range between pikes peak and cheyenne Mt. Living in the springs for some 20 years I&#39;ve always had an earie feeling of all the tech. lights above norad, but thats when I saw a bright red light racing Northeast. I&#39;d just got out of the Airforce in 92 and this didn&#39;t resemble anything I&#39;d ever seen. A few seconds had gone by and this red light was already over the middle of the city when it changed to an angle heading toward blackforest. It had crossed the entire sky in about 15 sec or less, just enough for me to get out of the wheel barrel and watch it dissapear. I know this wasn&#39;t a falling star, I know it wasn&#39;t a satelite, and I know it wasn&#39;t a jet or airplane it made no noise. Of course when I told everyone what I&#39;d saw when we resumed work they didn&#39;t believe me!<n>

Either or it has been awhile but that night still is fresh in my mind! I was taring the roof of the Citadel Mall w/ a bunch of other pay daily workers between the hours of 7pm to 7am. Around 1 am we would take lunch, climb down and head for the 7/11. But this night I just layed in a wheel barrel looking up at the front range star gazing between cheyenne Mt. and Pikes Peak when what looked like and comparably the size of the north star but Red was moving at pretty fast rate of speed. This was not a jet, this was not a shooting or falling star and of course it wasn&#39;t a satelite. It had made its way from a top of the front range to mid part of the city in approx. 8 to 9 seconds when it changed angle. Whatever it was, as I got out of the barrel watching it race toward the east, northeast of the springs it had crossed the entire sky frame and dissapeared no sound and all in about 15 sec. When I told everyone what i had seen after lunch you can imagine the smack!<n>

And then I saw a flash of light, and the object dissapeared. First I thought it was my imagination, but my friends said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;, so it wasn&#39;t.<n>
