The size of the objects was as large as if you held up a dime at arms length. Their rate of speed was slow. They were silent.  Each of the objects was egg-shaped and emitted a soft neon-like color, almost like pastel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each object was of a different color: the &#39;lead&#39; was blue; the others were red, yellow and white. There were no physical obstructions for those observing the objects, such as trees or buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the observers were senior individuals as they were there in the yard in celebration of a birthday. All saw the objects; some joked about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting itself captured my attention and I was awestruck at the beauty of what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I was 10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother ran outside and waved her arms hoping they would see her signal.  They did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived on Clough Rd, a cul-de-sac of town houses inhabited by several FBI families, a priest who lived next door to us, Gov. Volpe’s brother and the rest mostly made up of professional type families.  At the end of the road was the Clough’s big white farm house with stately trees dotting the land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the first evening, the UFO hovered above one of these trees approximately 100-500 feet above us. It shot straight up about 1:00 am.  It was a brightly illuminated oval with colored lights circling beneath. We think we saw what appeared to be windows, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second evening scenario was a repeat.  My mother called the Blue Hills Observatory in Canton, MA.  About 11:30 pm on the second evening, two Navy jets flew one above and one below the UFO (it had shot up a little upon their approach).  They flew off and repeated the maneuver flying by in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On their third approach back, the UFO shot straight up and we watched until it disappeared from sight. The Navy would not respond to my mother’s follow-up calls and asked her to stop calling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event was witnessed by over 30 people the first night and many more the second night.  There were a few, including my mother’s best friend who became hysterical.  Everyone else was in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event has shaped my beliefs through out my life.  I am 52 now, and this is the first time I am reporting the event myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was waiting for my boyfriend to stop by the house on his way home from work.  To the north we saw 3 white lights about the size of a pencil lead. They were stopping and going and changeing places with each other.  If you were to look straight up above your head and then tilt your head down about half way you could see them.  They danced around as if playing with each other.  They were spaced apart from 3 inches to several feet apart as they did this.  Then they divided and were spaced far from each other in sort of a triangle shape but way too far apart to be connected together as if they were lights on an airplane or something.  Then they all took off at the same time from a still position.  and shot straight up.  It was then that my sister and I saw a much larger object almost directly over head.  Also to the north of town.  This larger object was about the size of a half a ping pong ball.  and was stationary.  It also was white but also had a redish glow about it as well at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three small white lights then all flew toward the larger object and disapeared when they appeared to get about 3/4 of the way to the large object and then it all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That summer we saw 3 or 4 unexplained objects in the night sky.  Sometimes 2 or 3 at a time. My mother was an advid star gazer and we knew what the sattalites at that time looked like and what stars looked like.  We often saw sputnick pass over head as we called it.  The objects we saw in late July were nothing like an airplane or a satalite of that time period.  The objects we saw that night were the most spectacular sightings we both ever had.  I listened to Coast to Coast on stream link today and heard that it doesnt matter when one saw what they saw they should still report it.  It is now, over 40 years later and when I close my eyes I can still picture this event as if it were yesterday.  And I still get that same creepy feeling of wonder and excitment as I did 40years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)),  Shelby Ohio.  Now age 57.<n>

My mom and dad and uncle were on the back deck visiting. My mom called me, my friend, and my older brother to come outside to see something. I looked up and found what they were talking about. It was a light way up in the sky, not as bright as a satellite, more like a small star. This light was zigzagging in a pattern. At the time it seemed like it was moving so slow, but now I realize how fast it must have been moving. My parents and uncle had been watching it for quite a while before they called us outside. I watched this thing zig zag across the sky for at least 30 minutes and then it took off very quickly in a straight line and disappeared from our view. My uncle was retired from the Air Force and he ruled out all aircraft he knew about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in summer of 1965 is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/20/65 23:45|Portland|OR|Disk|20 minutes|A football sized glowing orange saucer shaped object , hovering completely still over head, disappears into the horizon in a flash.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78185.html|6|ndxe196507| A football sized glowing orange saucer shaped object , hovering completely still over head, disappears into the horizon in a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To Whom This May Concern:<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened a very long time ago so you may not be interested in hearing about it now, though you weren’t created yet when it occurred. I have never reported it and for years have wondered if I should to add support to those sightings I read about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was somewhere around 1965-67 and I was sleeping outside on my parents deck in southwest Portland, Oregon with a friend. It was summertime and we were in our sleeping bags on lounge chairs watching the stars and chit chatting. . . All of a sudden a star, or what we thought was a star fell out of the Big Dipper. . .like from one of the corners and straight down. We both commented on the falling star and kept viewing the sky as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after we noticed a light that was moving in our direction, yet still out in the distance quite a ways, so we began watching it to see what it was or where it was going. My parents lived in an old established neighborhood which had lots of trees here and there, so as this light moved sort of back and forth horizontally across our field of vision, it would be blocked for short periods due to the trees blocking our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, say within 3-4 minutes, this light flew around to the right of us behind a group of trees and when it came out into view and flew toward us, it stopped directly over head for about a minute. . . .This was a complete stop. It hovered over head at an angle and was no longer just a light, it now appeared to be a saucer shaped object, about a foot in length, and glowing like a coal out of a fire (the whole thing). After sitting there at a complete stop over our heads, it shot towards the distant horizon in a flash, within the snap of my fingers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another interesting thing about this is later, much later, in about 2005, I met a young woman in a class down in Eugene, Oregon who had lived next door to my parents long after I had moved out, and she told me that she had also seen a UFO while living in that house next door, (not the same incident), as this young woman is much younger than I, and then she told me that the neighbors on the other side of my parents house had years before also seen a UFO and I guess had reported it anonymously to have their name left off of the report. I find that really interesting and makes me wonder about that particular area, and why would three completely separate occurrences of UFO sightings be had there (?)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I got out of my car &amp; looked up &amp; saw a bright,circular object in the sky.  It was stationary, and looked bigger than a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure of the exact date or time, but it was during the summer of 1965; it could have been June, July, or Aug., and it was between 21:00 and 22:00, just before dusk.  I was 19 yrs old and returning from an evening college class, when I drove through the intersection of 17&#39;th St. &amp; Prospect Ave. in the North Tustin/Santa Ana, Ca. area.  I noticed 5-10 cars pulled off the road, including a Calif. Highway Patrol car, and people were out of their cars (including a Ca. Hwy Patrrolman) and gazing upward, towards the south, at a brightly lit circular object that appeared as bright as a full moon, and slightly larger.  I knew it was not the Moon, however, because I could see the Moon in another part of the sky.  The object, which I would estimate was a half mile to one mile away, did not move while I watched it for several minutes.  Since I was only about a half mile from my house, I hopped in my car and drove as fast as I could to my house, because I wanted to point out the object to my Mother &amp; Brother.  By the time I got to my house the object was no longer visible.  I never saw anything in the newspapers, or other media, about this event, and I have never seen any other anomalous objects in the sky, either before, or after this event.  What I would like to find out is if there were any other reports of this incident, or if there was an official explanation.  I&#39;m wondering if it could have been a weather balloon, or some other military operation, since I was just a few miles from the Santa Ana Marine Corps. Helicopter Base, as well as El Toro Marine Corps. Air Station.<n>

I and another company driver, that was driving another unit, were headed north on route 100 .  We were about (8) miles from the small city of Pulaski, Va. This was about 3:00 AM...<n> <n><n> <n><n> This route 100 was a (2) lane highway,with surrounding montains. There were many &#34;hard pulls&#34; on these mountains, for diesel trucks of this time period. (170 horse power).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular morning (3:00 AM) that I and the other company driver witnessed this sighting, the temperature was in the (70s), and the sky was clear as a bell . You could see the many stars in the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I witnessed this sighting, I was pulling a mountain, at approx.(20 mph).  The first thing I noticed was the mountains on my left, was &#34;lit up&#34; like someone had turned on a giant spotlight!  I then saw  what I assumed was meteors coming down from the sky. These were displaying a white hot light,and had like contrails behind them. As they came down to where I could see them better, I changed my mind from meteors, to maybe a large aircraft had broken up in the sky,and was crashing .<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the mountain that I was pulling up.  I could see the top of the mountain,and I could see the valley below. When the objects that I seen, I assumed they was going to crash into the earth. And I would have been a witness to a major airplane crash!  But to my amazement, the objects just pulled up ,and went thru this valley like a speeding bullet.  They traveled the entire length of the valley, and then &#34;shot&#34; straight up in the sky!  Also, when these objects was at my direct left, they gave off a large amount of white light, and leaving white smoke with sparks contrails.  I could see just like it was high noon daylight!  I could even see the green leaves on the trees .<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was all over. The other company driver that was ahead of me had pulled over at the top of the mountain, at a wide spot.  When I came to stop behind his unit, he came &#34;running&#34;to my truck, and with astonished look on his face said, What in the H**L was that ?   I then asked him what he had seen.   He told me the exactly what I had seen !  What was it?  Till this day (2005) I do not know !   But its one thing for certain. I and the other company driver had just witnessed something very strange .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was out after dark and had to be home before mom came home from work that night. I heard a strange humming noise coming from the other side of a large hedge. There was a large apple tree that I was passing under so I had to move to the hedge where there was a hole that the neighbor kids and I would pass thru to get to each others house.When I got to the pass thru I noticed something hovering above the neighbors dog house and that Duke the dog was not barking but staring at this thing. I looked up to see a saucer type object just floating there. No lights and only a slight humming noise is all there was. Duke started to bark but I wasnt sure if it was at the object or me being there in the dark. But after a few barks this thing started to hum louder and went straight up then with in seconds it was out of site but it took less than 1 second for this object to go from 30 feet off the ground to a few thousand feet turn at a right angle and disappearing. That night it had rained but I know for a fact that it did not storm. But Duke the dog was found dead and all the grass in a 30 foot circle was dead and brown. The rest of the yard was still healthy. I dont know what killed Duke but I do know it wasnt a storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

Saucer and some kind of a seperate long white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to share a story with you that happened in the 1960s when my in-laws were &#34;parking&#34; with another couple on Mt. Greylock in Adams, Ma.  While parking in an area by the top of the mountain they heard what sounded like some kind of machine running. My father-in-law and his friend took a short path to the top to investigate. What they saw was a UFO that was surrounded by people.  The people spotted them and gave chase. The two men ran back to the car to find the women crying. The car acted like it does in the movies, it kept stalling down the mountain. While on their way down, the men asked why the women were so terrified and they had said they saw a white light come up to the front windshield of the car. They did not understand what this was because the front of the car was parked up against a wall with a drop off on the other side. They did make it to the bottom and noticed the clouds above the mountain were illuminated pink. They never reported this because they said they thought nobody would believe them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not too long after, My Mother-in-law was at a friends house when this same (long) white light appeared outside the bedroom window on the second floor. There was a garage next to the house with a small alleyway between where she saw the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, around the same time, my in-laws were parked at Onota Lake parking lot in Pittsfield. They were watching another couple parked in the lot who appeared to be arguing (The other couple had their dome light on) when all of a sudden they felt like they were hit from behind, The only thing was is they were backed up against the woods. And just as sudden there was no longer that other car in the lot, but they said they never saw it leave. (Maybe missing time?) They both said they felt like they were knocked out. They inspected their car but there was no damage to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My in-laws are now divorced but will tell exactly the same story. They are not the type to lie and my mother-in-law still does not like to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We observed A red glow ahead. About one mile later we were directly opposit the glow. This is steep mountainous terrain and we were at river level and the glow was on the mountain, which was probably 800 feet high. The glow appeare to be along the top of the ridge line and appeared to be 200 to 300 feet wide. It extended down the side of the mountain for approximately 1/3 of the way to the bottom, which would be approximately 300 feet. It didn&#39;t illuminate anything but was a vivid soft red glow. At times there were white lights, about the size and brilliance of the brightest stars; and they would move around the edge of the glow. At times we could hear what sounded like human voices buy could not distinguish words; also, we heard what sounded like metal pounding on metal. At one point a powerful spotlight illuminated us briefly and just a small area around us. The beam came from the top which would have been about 1000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend wanted to go into Whitesburg, about 2 miles, and get a friend of ours, who was an attorney, to see what we were looking at. By the time we got back the glow was not as vivid and if I remember correctly we did not hear anymore sound. The glow just kept getting dimmer. Many cars came by and inquired as to what we were looking at. The next day my friend and I traveled to the top of the ridge to see if there were any signs of the activity there were none. It was very rough terrain with many huge boulders and heavily wooded. In order to get to the scene we had to travel a short distance north, cross the river on the highway bridge and walk down a railroas track for about 300 yards to go straight up the hill to the area. After getting back to the railroad track we met a young man who live nearby, about 12 to 15 years old, who had a rifle on his shoulder. We told him what we had seen and was trying to figuer out what it was. He said he knew what it was, a flying saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a ((employment deleted--federal employee)) at the time and my friend was a Whitesburg business man. The young fellow mentioned above is now, and has been for many years, an attorney practicing in Whitesburg, KY. I happen to meet him several years later, after he became an attorney, and mentioned the scene to him. He told me that at the time we met him on the railroad he was very scared becaus he thought we were from the saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about one month of this occurence we were traveling toward Whitesburg again, at approximately 10:00 p.m. About a mile closer to Whitesburg one of us spotted strange lights high in the sky, about 80 deg. above the horizion. Due to the movement they couldn&#39;t be counted but it looked like 12 to 15 objects. They looked like a very bright stars and was dancing around each other, in an area a little larger than a full moon, very rapidly. In a very short time one started to expand and became slightly larger than fell moon. That was scary because when it started expanding I felt it was going to engulf everything. When it got to the maximun size it appeare that molten material, of the same starlight intensity, was dripping from the edge. While this was going on the small lights were dancing around the large object. This sight also disappeared gradually in the same area. I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw this or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We became avid saucer watchers after this. We would travel to the top on some of our mountains where we had an unobstructed in every direction and spent many hours trying to something else. We never did. I can give names, addresses &amp; phone numbers to legimate persons if they are interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was still small enough to fit into the &#34;way-back&#34; that &#34;Bugs&#34; still had in those days.  We were driving from Madison to our home in Stoughton, along Highway 51.  Just outside of Stoughton there was a National Guard armory on the left, then a big bend in the road, with a gravel pit on the left.  As we drove past the gravel pit, we saw a huge, very bright light among the hills of gravel.  It was about the size of a small house.  The light was white and very, very bright, but it did not illuminate the surrounding area or make much of a glow in the sky.  We were all in awe and my mother slowed the car almost to a halt as we starred at the light.  Then, as we watched, the light &#34;shot&#34; at us, three balls of light in quick succession.  As each one hit the front of the car, we heard it make a boom sound on impact.  The car jerked with each impact, but I later learned from my mother that there actually was no impact, the jerks were her frightened reaction to the sight and sound of the impacts.  Although the &#34;shots&#34; made a big noise as they hit our car, they did not jerk the car at all!  My mother sped away and we drove the rest of the way, (only 1-2 miles) into Stoughton.  We stopped at a gas station that was on the right side of the road in those days, almost right accross from the A&amp;W root beer stand.  We all scrambled out and looked at the car.  There were no marks of any kind, nothing to show that it had been hit by those balls of light.  We were all shaking and drove home.  We told my father and the rest of the family there what had happened.  To the best of my knowledge, no one ever reported the incident to the police or anyone.  It was simply too fantastic.  No one would have believed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been very sorry that my parents did not alert the authorities at once.  Perhaps someone else could have seen it too.  Throughout the years since then, my sisters and I will recount those events to each other from time to time; just to make sure it isn&#39;t something we dreamed.  My mother too(now dead), always remembered it just the way I have recorded it here.  It was not, strickly speaking, a UFO.  It did not fly when we saw it.  But, all these years later (it is now October 2004), I still have no better understanding of what it was then we had at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Summer 1964, 0r 1965. UPI reported it was seen in 8 other states.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a silver cigar shaped object. 25,000 to 40,000 feet up. No wings, no sound. Could stay perfectly still in the air. Also moved to right or left  horizontally, without turning. It appeared tp be able to travel at extremely high speeds.3 children and 3= adults witnessed this event. According to UPI, U.F.O. sightings were reported in eight states at the same time of the Nyona Lake sighting. Unsure of  exact date.The U.P.I. story stated that the air force said that what was seen was the planet Jupiter. Robert Risser director of thre Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation planetarium in Oklahoma City , said that watchers in Oklahoma certainly did not see the planet. &#34;that is as far from the truth as you can get.

Outside, directly overhead in a daylit, clear blue sky was an oval shaped object, silver in color, very high up. I&#39;m not sure exactly but it seemed to be lower than jets fly but a lot higher that small planes are seen. It made no sound and did not move in a horizontal plane. It had a large white light in it&#39;s center with four smaller colored lights around it. The white light would come on and off very slowly, once every few seconds. While the white light was off a colored light would come on and then turn off as the white light came back on. The colored lights came on in a repeating sequence around the center light. We watched it for about 30 minutes and saw that it got somewhat larger and then smaller as if it were moving slowly up and down but never side to side. We went into the house for a few minutes and when we came back out it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

And it was as bright as the moon only on the ground.If you can picture the harvest moon just as it&#39;s rising ,and set it on the ground thats what we saw....we were terrified but for some weird reason decided to pass  beside it to get to the farm and drop off my sister and her family  2 children we let them off and drove back down the lane to the highway.It was still sitting on the knoll,but as we pull onto the road it started to follow us back into town.My boyfriendwas driving so fast and it stayed right above the car It was really big as he drove I watched it out the passingers side window. both of us crying and almost hysterical.We were going so fast we became patrially airborn  as we went over a railroad track. Anyway he dropped me off and drove home.Still crying and saying Oh my god !! I need to get home.I want my mom&#39;I went in the house but everyone was sleeping  , I hid in my room, I can still remember how frightened i was ,hart pounding shaking and scared to death...afraid it was going to find me ..I was 21  ..I&#39;m 59 now and it&#39;s something I&#39;ll never forget!!

It did not seem to be moving very fast, I could not determine its speed as I could not figure how high or how large the craft was.

As everyone started leaving around 10:30, I accompanied them out the front door onto the patio. Someone looked up into the clear night sky and asked, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; Looking up, we saw a large very bright white light hovering motionless at a fairly high altitude. From each side protruded bright, stubby appendages of light that gave the appearence of wings, as in the classical Egyptian &#34;winged-disk&#34; symbol. We watched it for over 5 minutes, when suddenly it began to move. After travelling in a straight line, it abruptly began making a series of rapid acute-angle turns as if tracing out a complex geometrical pattern. After a minute of this, the light resumed a straight line trajectory and travelled out over Lake Michigan. The next day, the Chicago Sun Times ran a front page story complete with a photograph, stating that the mysterious light had been observed for several hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was very young at the time and all I really remember about it was watching it with my mother and many neighbors over a several night period in the summer.  My guess is sometime around 1965. I would have been 5 or 6 years old at the time.  I know it happened over several nights because the neighbors gathered on the front lawn and sat in lawn chairs waiting each night for the &#34;show&#34;.  I didn&#39;t remember this sighting from my childhood until I had a dream about it a few years ago.  At first I just figured it was a dream but it kept bugging me and stayed on my mind.  I eventually spoke to my sister who is 5 years older than me to see if she remembered anything like this and she immediately remembered the sighting.  We compared our memories of it and they are pretty much the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the sightings themselves, we watched them at night in the summer and it was dark so it had to be between 8 and 10PM each night.  Each night was clear with many stars in the sky.  I remember it was in the western sky and that several of the neighbors said it looked to be occurring over Ft. Devens near Ayer Massachusetts.  The sightings themselves were simply dots of light in the sky, similar in size to the stars except these were moving making dramatic turns and creating strange patterns in the sky.  From my prospective at the time, they were just putting on a show and in fact I remember someone saying it was quite a demonstration.  It seemed to be designed to get our attention. I also remember several people being very frightened by the display.  I&#39;m not sure how many nights that this happened but it was several nights in a row as people came out of their houses expecting to see it each night.  I don&#39;t remember much about each night specifically, just that it happened over a several night period and everyone was amazed at the movements and wondered what kind of craft could move like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At the time the Quonset Naval air station was still in operation. IT was about five to eight miles away to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to steadily move and came very close to to Brenton Point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It glowed and I could not see the shape clearly as the light of the object made the  edges diffuse but strong.  The light was just a curiousity to me.  Then it shot south so fast that I could not follow it.  I moved and looked to the south and it was there stationary about what I thought was about 15 miles.  It stayed there for quite a while then it shot off to the east and zipped out of sight.

The event took place one night as I looked at the sky. I guess I was about 10 years old, I was on our front porch by myself and I spotted a satellite or so I thought. It did not look any different from all the others I had seen except for the fact that it changed course. I distinctly remember watching as this spec of light approached another spec of light which I assume was a star or planet. I realized of course that the satellite is circling the earth and would pass in front of this other spec of light. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. The spec of light I thought was a satellite went around the other spec of light. It made a perfect half circle around the planet or star and continued on its original path. My mother was near the door and I called for her to see it. She got to the door in time to see it finishing it&#39;s half circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both the star or planet, and what I thought was a satellite seemed to be about the same size. So this UFO had to be about the same size as the planet or star. Also it was moving at about the same speed as a satellite would move across the sky. Given it was on the same plane as the planet or star it had to be moving at an incredible rate of speed to appear to be moving at the same speed as a satellite circling the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

If the moon was the size of a small dinner plate, the object was about the size of a dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took several minutes for it to cross the sky and reach the center of the moon.  It crossed the surface and circled around behind it and came back from the other side and proceeded to move right to left back across the sky.  The whole event lasted maybe 10-15 minutes.

It was around 8:00pm when one of them started yelling at us from the front to come outside.  My other two cousins &amp; myself ran outside.  I don&#39;t recall any words being exchanged, just all of us staring at the sky, slightly from south to north.  The UFO was circular with a yellowish color, about the size of a full moon and was completely silent.  I could not make out any surface details.  The object seemed to be just a circular light.  It flew westward until it disappeared from sight, appearing to fly over Calexico, California, which is a border town next to Mexicali.  The object was not moving too fast.  Also, there was 2 or three (I can&#39;t remember) jet airplanes &#34;tailing&#34; it. The sighting was so spectacular that we kept checking the television &amp; radio for any mention of the event, but we never caught any mention of it.  Strangely, we were not in an isolated part of the city and still none of the neigbors mentioned anything.  It was summer and lots of people were usually outdoors.  I guess we became hesitant to mention it to others since we were just kids (I was around 10 years old &amp; the oldest of my cousins only about 3 years older).  My cousins still remember the event.  I cannot believe we were the only witnesses!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up to watch the Ozark flight come over the house.  Directly behind it was a strange, metallic object flying at least as fast as the plane.  There were approximately 10 neighbors outdoors at the time, engaged in gardening, playing with kids, berbecuing, etc. When the object was seen, all stopped what they were doing and came to watch. It had stopped and was hovering over an apple orchard that was maybe three blocks south of the neighborhood.  It was  a saucer-shape, definitely metallic and had a copperish or bronze sheen to it.  The size is hard to determine, but it must have been at least a large as a 1960&#39;s car, given the distance from which we were seeing it and the detail we could see.  It definitely had port holes, or circles near the mid-section. It rotated around as it hovered. It was totally silent, there was no noise when it entered the area, hovered and left the area.  Everyone was dumbfounded and stood together for quite a while. Finally, someone shouted he needed his binoculars and another one said he had a camera with film.  As the men began leaving the group, the object then rose into higher and accelerated rapidly away, leaving in a westerly direction, against the winds and disappeared in the distance.  Everyone was stunned by the event and we children were warned not to mention it to anyone. No report was ever made of this for fear that the reputations of the observers would be damaged.  Those who were there included an insurance agent, a regional sales representative, an employee of the USDA, a vice-president of a small factory, housewives and children of varying ages. All were totally sober and unimpaired at the time. I was about 14 at the time and my brother was 8.  He also remembers the incident well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/1/65 12:00|Ringwood|NJ|Disk|30 sec|Daylight sighting of silent hovering disc over Wanaque reservoir|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43501.html|37|ndxe196507| Daylight sighting of silent hovering disc over Wanaque reservoir<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 6 or so years old.  Several of my brothers and sisters were with me when my mother brought us food shopping.  She had been driving one of those old stationwagons that had the back seat facing out the back window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was summertime, I remember because the back window was wide open.  We were on our way home and I don&#39;t remember which of us were sitting back there but as Mom made a right turn we were facing the Wanaque reservoir.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, as Mom made that turn, we were staring straight at a silver disc hovering not more than 30 feet above the water, only about 50 feet away from us.  I remember all of the kids screaming at Mom to stop the car.  I just remember all of us screaming, but it wasn&#39;t really fear.  More excitement, I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, Mom had to drive up the road a short ways so that she could turn the car around, but by the time we got back there, it was gone.  Mom did see it in the rearview mirror when she heard all the commotion we were making.  The disc was about 50 feet long, shining silver and silent as it hovered.  I nor any of my family reported it.  I&#39;m really not sure why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some strange reason, maybe because we were all so young (I&#39;m second youngest of six)none of us discussed the sighting for years. I&#39;ve talked to a couple of my siblings about it when we got older.  We all remember it the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the Ringwood library to see if they had any information or old news clippings about that event. As it turns out, many people saw the same thing.  UFO&#39;s seemed to make an appearance for that entire weekend.  People from all around would park there cars around the reservoir day and night and many reported night sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, who has since passed, remembered men in dark suits but she wasn&#39;t sure what they were doing there or how they knew what was going on that weekend.  She was never approached by these men.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago, I read a book-Above Top Secret-by Mr.Goode and sure enough, he had reports in his book about the Wanaque reservoir sightings. Since then, I have spoken to a few &#34;old&#34; Ringwoodites about whether they had ever had sightings and to my surprise, many had.  But none had seen a daylight sighting. Only the night sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same witness.  We have spoken with the witness, and she sounded quite credible to us.  PD))<n>
