Rural area.  We owned 200 ac..  Girl friend, later wife, were alone.  We were in college at the time, home for christmas break.  Clear, cold eve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I commented that object was not a conventional aircraft, at that slow speed an altitude.  Object came to a stop approx. 100 ft. above us over trees at top of a small rise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect, I wish I had kept composure and observed, instead I panicked and started the car and made a run out the farm road.  Almost 1/2 mile to paved road.  All the while girl reported object following just off to the right about 100 ft away, tree top level.  When hit the paved road, we were going quite fast.  The nearest house was 2 miles away.  I knew the ocupant.  The object followed parallel 300 ft away, again at tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arriving at neighbor, I ran  to the door, knocking loudly.  It was imperative that someone else see the object and situation.  It took a good 5 minutes for the neighbor to come to the yard to observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Older man joined me in driveway.  Object now howering approx 1/4 mile away across a small valley and at about same elevation as we.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I explained the foregoing, the object went straight up.  No sound. Incredibily fast and in a matter of 10 seconds became a small star size dot and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three observers,crystal clear ,still night,,30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had considerable small air craft experience.  There were no sounds involved here.  The craft was not a helicopter, but displayed similar slow, hovering, capabilities.  The object had a luminous quality, nothing bright or shiny.  There were no protrusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For edification, there was no alcohol or drugs of any kind involved in this evening,  The event occurred exactly this way.  Any possibility of other phenomna as light, fog, reflections are definately not a possibility.  This was a clear, dark and rural environment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be more than happy to further pursue this report with any one at any time.<n>
