The tail extended out to the side of the object at 75 or 80 degrees, and it glowed.  Swath of light was estimated to be 1/4 or 1/2 mile wide, based on an estimated distance from the observers.<n>

It was the size of a kithen table.  I was scard and happy not to meet any of them, and glad to see it leave. We wanted to tell someone, but this is the first time telling it public.

I remember getting out of our car and standing in our apartment complex with my parents.  My dad just started screaming at my mom to get the camera and I didn&#39;t understand why.  Then he pointed in the sky.  There was an orange sphere of light with a ring around it.  It was relatively large compared to the small stars behind it.  At the southeastern side of the ball and ring there was a blur almost as if an engine was letting out intense heat.  We just stared at it for a while and then went back inside.  I don&#39;t remember if it was moving or not, I just remember being terrified and wanting to go in my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving,and my wife was awake in the passanger seat when I told her to look over to the left,but before that I noticed an air craft that resembled a helichopter which dropped a container into the Kanawha river that looked like a parachute, then the container was lifted back up into the air craft.After that I started to slow downand,and also roll my window down to hear the sound of what I thought was a helichopter,but we hear no sound at all,and we were only about 100 yards away.We watched as the air craft moved very slowly behind the trees near the river as I followed it&#39;s path,and about 100 yards down the river when it stopped,and we pulled over to the side of the road to a stop. We both looked up just over the trees to a large window shaped object with a bright clear window that had a small bright round red,and green or even a small blue light I can&#39;t be sure on the blue light. What was so scary is that it made no sound at all from a very close range,and moved side to side up and down trying to avoid us. After we looked at it for a few minutes my wife said let&#39;s get the hell out of here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It turned 90 degrees to the west, and while moving slowly west, ascended through the clouds and was not seen again. Within a minute a police helicopter moving from east to west just below cloud layer turned it&#39;s daylighter spotlight on at the approximate place where the UFO was sighted, shining it&#39;s light horizontally beneath the clouds as opposed to shining it in the typical downward angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I live near a wooden area…so the light was above the tree line.  The light was standing still, so I thought it was a helicopter at first, but then I questioned that the light was too big for a helicopter and no sound.  I wanted to get a better look so I blinked my eyes and I saw the light shoot straight up into the air – at an incredible speed – it was gone in a blink’s eye!!!

From a Piper Archer II I saw one light flying. After a while it turned 130 degrees. I contacted tower and nothing was known or seen on the radar. After a while a second light appeared. I flew to them not able to close them further in. They disappeared and when the appeared to hear the communication, they returned and I flew towards them again, which game lasted and lasted. They appeared to be intelligent lights which seemed to overhear the radio communication. I have an audio tape of it from the air traffic control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one time the radar controller says to the tower controller - over the intercom- which I could not hear in the airplane at the time - : two objects, three miles at his twelve o&#39;clock position. Tower asked me what I saw at the time and I reported : the two lights are now 12 o&#39;clock, three miles. The channel silenced down and surprise was the master at that particular time. Later on I saw one light disappear between the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know how high airliners go, I know satellites, I know the weather which was clear sky with hundreds kilometers of sight. On the ground was fog only up to 200 feet from the ground. They were no natural explainable things, because I read a lot of them and my response: No way José! At the time I did not believe in UFO&#39;s and still I find it hard to believe, but I must admit: they were spirits or UFO&#39;s! I will remain my further life in a mystery, which I saw that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This appears to us potentially to be a serious-minded report, but the e-address that the witness provides is not valid.

When I got out of my boyfriends truck I heard this strange humming noise, so I looked above me &amp; right over the stores were New york Lace is I saw an object flying above me . It was moving in a slow speed, and it blended with the night sky. I didn&#39;t see any lights on it ,but it was flat looking with dark spots on it. As I looked at it I crossed the street in a daze &amp; stupidly went into the bank to get my money out real fast ,so I could come back out and look at it,and show it to my boyfriend. It was moving so slow that I thought it would still be out there when I was finished. When I exited the bank I crossed the street looking up into the sky,again like I was in a daze and then I heard tires screeching &amp; a car almost hit me. Still I was in a daze until I got back in the truck,and said to my boyfriend &#34;did you hear that noise?&#34; naturally he didn&#39;t because he was playing with the radio. I explained to him what I saw,and we drove around town to see if we could find it. I also tuned into the radio to see if there was any reportingsthere wasn&#39;t any,but I was told that peole did report seeing something,but I haven&#39;t found anything on it. I was never one to believe in the whole UFO thing ,but till this day I question &#34;WHY&#34; &amp; &#34;WHAT&#34; came over me to not get my boyfriend out of the truck at the very moment &amp; tell him,and what happened to me that I would walk across a main road without even realizing the traffic? It was like this object put me in a trance. And this is the GOD&#39;S HONEST TRUTH!!! If anyone knows of anything that happened around this date,please post it. I would like to know I am not the only one that will never forget this!!! Now I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We decided to take a different route back since we were on the other side of the ravine from which we came in on. This route would take us through a farm field, to the back of small neighborhood. It was a clear night, the stars were visible, the moon was not out.  The ground was covered in a good foot of fresh snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started trekking through the snow covered farm field, heading southward when we all stopped dead in our tracks.  Out in the distance well above the horizon was a glowing yellow sphere.  We stood there for 15 or 20 seconds, my first initial thought was it was an airplane with it&#39;s lights on, flying really low.  The only thing was, it wasn&#39;t moving, just sitting there like a really bright, REALLY big star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where things got really really weird.  The sphere started to &#34;shoot&#34; out smaller spheres towards the ground.  One would come out from the left, once it hit the horizon, it would disappear, about 5 seconds later, one came out from the right, hit the horizon and disappear.   3 smaller spheres off of each side, 6 in total.    My two friends were standing a few feet behind me, I turned around and the one quickly turned around and started running the other way.  I yelled at him to stop, his brother ran after him and tackled him.  We heard  coyotes start howling like n! othing I&#39;ve ever heard before, living in rural Minnesota coyotes were no strangers to us but these howls sounded like they.  We then saw these coyotes off in the distance running from the farm field we were walking through, into the woods/ravine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere moved towards the horizon and slowly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Through a windowed door, I observed a light about the brillance of a bright star through the branches of a tree.  As I watched, it began to dip and sway as if in a pendulam (sp?) fashion, seemingly tightly controlled.  After about thirty seconds, it stop and formed into an extremely brilliant arrowhead.  /\ (closest approximation I can make).  It was completely illuminated white along the edges leading to the point, but dark along the other edge.  Even so, I sensed that it was a complete triangle shape.  It also appeared to have a faint white line of light straight down its middle leading to just before the edges of the object.  I stepped a couple steps to my left to my living room window.  By the time I had the object in view again, it had turned on its side to a &lt; as if following my movement.  At this time, I lose track of about two hours of time.  The next thing I remember is looking back up at a normal star.  From the right, two fast moving I assume at this point planes approached.  From my vantage it appeared as though one was on top of the other as in like a colon : but spaced out a lot more. The top plane actually transvered directly through the light of the star I had observed.  For a split second, they were as one.  This was the only observation I had and no more oddities have occured.<n>

I turned to see a rose colored rectangle shaped fog or cloud comming towards us.  We stood completely still.  There was no sound, it stopped right above our heads and stayed there for 20 seconds or so.  The object was not visible to us, just a fog, the only thing I can relate to would be what Star Trek called cloaking.   The fog object was rectangle in shape, rose pink in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it as it went over the ocean towards the Channel Islands which are about 20 miles from my home.  The craft flew over the ocean toward the islands and disappeared within 10 seconds. Have you ever heard of a sighting like this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have listened to Art Bell since he hosted Dreamland and never heard any discription of a sighting like mine.  I know when the object was above us that they saw us and were observing us.  I don&#39;t know how far above our heads it was, but if I took a guess it would be 75 to 100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sorry I didn&#39;t report it before.

I was coming out of my middle school after a basketball game.  There were a few people around, but I don&#39;t think they were paying attention.  I looked up in the sky, waiting for my mom to pick me up, and saw three sets of points of light.  Each set was in a perfect triangle, and then the three sets of lights were also in a perfect triangle.  The lights were moving at a moderate pace, neither real fast or real slowly.  When I got home, I saw something on the news that night about whether there was a UFO or not, but I wasn&#39;t allowed to stay up to watch it, so I never found out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

However, some days later I did discuss the ‘sightings’ with a coworker who resided in Akron and found that she too had seen a similar array, and was able to describe them as I had seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sightings occurred after dark at approximately 9 p.m. The road I was driving on runs true north/south.  I live in a small city of 22,000, and the mercury vapor streetlights were on.  I was driving north toward my driveway when I noticed lights in the rear view mirror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thought was they were police lights – flashing red and blue, that they were at a distance since they were obscured, somewhat blurry, and their were several of them, perhaps seven in a group. By instinct I pulled to the side of the road to avoid the passing (what I thought must be) police cruisers, but there were none. I looked again and the lights were there having not moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked in my driveway and exited the vehicle. Looking due north I observed a flickering group of seven lights in a formation that appeared to be hovering at the horizon what could have been several hundred feet in the air. They moved a bit in an easterly direction but generally were stationary. I heard no sounds of any kind from that direction, and probably the objects were too far away to have been heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the lights for fifteen minutes, excused it as swamp gas, and drove the car down the driveway and put in into the garage. I did not mention it to anyone, only several days later in conversation with an individual I worked with the topic of some strange lights came up, and she too had seen them. She described them as I had seen them, only she saw them to the north from her home in Akron, Ohio – some thirty miles northeast of Alliance. Multi-colored hovering in a group moving slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ‘thought’ perhaps the lights might have been over Lake Erie, but Alliance is too far south from Lake Erie – sixty miles, the curvature of the Earth too great – yet she observed them north of her location. I thought at the time the lights were swamp gas above the now closed Superfund site at Willowcreek, at the intersection of rt. 224 and rt. 225 in Portage County, Ohio where several large landfills are located. The intersection is about eight miles north of Alliance. Nothing ever was reported in the local newspaper, The Alliance Review, but that is considered not surprising as it would have been considered bad for advertising and well beyond the scope of the newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights shimmered, were round but the edges were obscured and fluctuated. They were brightly colored white, red, and blue. A resemblance would be when a very bright light is refracted through heavy crystal or diamond resulting in brief flecks of pure color. The objects did not wisp away and were not dissipated by winds, but did seem to move in a slow easterly direction. They were totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never been able to explain what they were, except to say they were U.F.O.’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I could see the rush hour traffic going buy slowly across the highway is Mount St-Bruno, a little mountain in the St-Lawrence valley. I was back then a master mechanic for a General Motors dealership, and in my spare time am an avid aircraft watcher, since we have airports all over. I am now a video editor for a large television network, so i hope this is enough to show you that i am sure of what i saw, and it was nothing i have ever seen before. Except maybe once when i was 16 when a friend of mine and i where scared out of our wits by something overhead, but thats another story. So, to get back to the task at hand. I&#39;m sitting in my car, my head turn left watching the ski hill on the mountain and the cars going buy on the highway.  To my right is the Dealer where i work. I turn my head front for a second and there it is, approx.200 feet from the ground hovering over the street just above the garage, a large red ball of light, i couldn&#39;t see a shape, more of a large glow. I couldn&#39;t believe it was i the only one seeing this, all those cars and those skiers. I got out of the car to get a better perception. There was no sound other than the traffic and that wasn&#39;t very noisy. Suddenly, the ball began to move over and across the highway very slowly. The thing was so large and so low i couldn&#39;t believe i was the only one seeing this, traffic kept moving and i was alone on the little street where i parked. It kept going until it reached a point just below the summet of the mountain in front of the lit ski hill, then al of a sudden it became a small point of red light, changed direction to follow the lenght of the mountain, then turned 180 degrees and headed for the ski hill again, then, this how i remember it, i saw the light fly over the ski hill still just below the summit, so i could see it very well, the it crossed the hill it then entered the woods beetween to light post at the top of the hill and then, just vanished. I have to tell you, my eyes never lied to me before, i was in going crazy thinking about it and going over it for weeks after that. To this day i don&#39;t know what i saw. I also have a couple of dreams that might interest you, well i think they where dreams.<n>

It left straight up when two F/A-18 fighters left the runway on take-off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way into work around 5am pst on approx. 12/15/94, I drove over a hill on a main road from Aliso Viejo, CA into El Toro, CA and saw a light in the valley moving back and fourth directly over the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. The point at which I first saw this thing was just before I crested the rise, I was angled to the sky and could not yet see the valley ahead. What caught my attention was this very bright but quite small light that was moving from my left field of view to the right, then instantly left again. The stars were clear and bright that morning I remember and there were no clouds. I first thought it was a police helicopter looking for someone close-by, not an uncommon sight in Southern California. Then I got to the top of the slight incline and the valley spread out before me with all the city lights intact. Directly ahead and just to my right (approx 10 miles) on the valley floor is the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS).I know excacly where it is because I like to watch the jet fighters take-off in the late morning and afternoons. They NEVER take off in early am due to residential noise abatement ordinances. Anyway, this light was NOT a helicopter and was maneuvering directly over the MCAS. I pulled over and watched this thing clearly for a couple minutes. It was not at high altitude and my best guess would put it at 1000 ft. It moved too fast for a plane, from the distance I was to it, it had to be going VERY fast to cover the arc it was maneuvering in. I have seen the Air Force Thunderbirds and Navy Blue Angels at this Air Station Perform and they never covered as much ground so quickly as this thing did . It made many 90 and 180 degree turns and stayed over the base. After only about two minutes of watching this light I could see fighters taxiing on one of the the runways. The light-object left nearly straight up (@85 degree angle to my left) when two F/A-18 fighters left the runway on take-off. As I said, the fighters NEVER take-off in early am. I watched them go airborne! , they quickly turned and accelerated in the direction the light was a few moments before then slowed and continued @ north-west and out of sight. I stayed about another 15 minutes but they did not come back, either plane or UFO.<n>

Trumbull, Ohio, 1994, Local Authorities &amp; NBC cite Mass UFO sighting, Gov./Military Denies Incident, flimsy, but effectiveCover UP<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  I live approximately 30 mile from this area and I never heard this story until recently when I was seeking quantitative data on Mexico City UFO reports for possible hypothesis tests relating public opinion of UFOs and official sighting reports frequency.  I didn’t find the Mexico City data I sought, but I did find this story and was nearly ill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is an abbreviated account of a mass sighting incident in Trumbull County, Ohio on Dec.14, 1994.   The incident involved the prolonged observation and pursuit of at least one, but more likely multiple UFOs, by no less than 15 local police officers.  The local 911 office received numerous civilian reports of inexplicable craft-like illuminated objects moving through Vienna, OH and surrounding communities.  Many objects were reported to be low near the ground and all were reported as displaying bright multicolored lights.  Police officers pursuing the objects were able to describe specific details about the objects physical appearance including the presence of machinery-like aspects of the objects.  A reporter for local TV station 33 Youngstown (ABC) initially followed up the incoming reports, but when she learned that the incident was most likely a genuine anomalous event and following a telephone call to the local FAA, she admittedly dropped the story out of fear.  This admission was made in an interview with an UFO investigator in 1998.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Police officers and local emergency 911 employees are willing to publicly discuss their observations.  Official verified recordings of communications between police officers and telephone communications to and from the 911 center are publicly available as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NBC did a report on the incident broadcast in 1999 called &#34;Confirmation.&#34; The story went completely unreported for two years until 1996 when a UFO investigator mistakenly called Vienna, OH Police Department when seeking information on a 1988 sighting near Urbana, OH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the reporter made an inquiry about a recent UFO sighting the officer fielding the investigator’s call began describing events that took place in 1994.  The investigator quickly realized that this was a different event from that of his initial inquiry and the event being generously described by the officer was unusually significant in terms of standard UFO phenomena reports.  The event described was openly corroborated by several law enforcement officers as well as many other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local 911 Center provided the investigator with duplicate recordings of presumably all related communications from the night which are widely available and undisputed as authentic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All witnesses noted that objects were silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rough Outline of Events the morning of Dec.14, 1994 paraphrased from a publicly accessible non-commercial website dedicated to the aforementioned principal investigator’s numerous reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object was first observed at a treetop level before midnight in the near  Samson Drive and the Fifth Avenue Extension. It was bluish-green with flames. Four calls were placed to the dispatch office before midnight. An additional call was placed to WYTV Channel-33 news reporter &#39;St*%ey A.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A unit (#998) was dispatched to Samson Drive to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point Unit #998 viewed the object at close range.  It was red and illuminating the ground with a red light &#34;as bright as daylight.&#34; Approaching the object, the police car suffered inexplicable electrical failure and stalled.  From all accounts, the object was described as &#39;huge.&#39;  Officer Unit #998 later stated that he encountered an elderly man in the roadway, saying: &#34;it was right above my house!&#34;  Having reported his (Unit #998’s) observation, other units are dispatched for backup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A call is placed to the airbase by the dispatcher. There is no answer at the airbase, and a call is then placed to the FAA tower, where the tower operator states to have nothing on his radarscope within a 60-mile radius of Youngstown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the unidentified aircraft departs from the Samson Road area and Unit #998 advises that he was &#39;out of service&#39; for a duration to &#34;gather his thoughts.&#34; The time is near 1:00 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO is again reported when Unit #429 advises central dispatch that an object is spotted to the east of the 911 center. The dispatcher, eager to view the object, steps away to look for the UFO as another person takes her place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is said to be near Route 11, and several units from different locations and directions triangulate its position from areas near Kings Grave and Henheid. The object is then observed over an empty field, and changes color from whitish red to a pulsating greenish lavender.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dispatcher returns, saying that she did not see the UFO. More incoming radio traffic relevant to the UFO causes her to &#39;take a break&#39; where she plans to meet an officer who will pick her up and take her to see it Through heavy radio traffic, several unspecified police units converge upon the UFO and triangulate its position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This documented triangulation of an aerial object from different vantage points indicates to us that it is not a star, as the object maintains a localized presence within a specific area.  One unit claims that he is heading east to intercept the object. Another unit advises that he is heading north to approach the object. A unit headed eastbound advised that the object was &#39;southeast&#39; of his location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remains stationary over an empty field prior to a departure path to the southeast, where it is seen near an 84-Lumber hardware store. There it is described as a structured object with an attachment or unspecified element protruding from the top of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every police department in the county now has the object under observation, and many units are now pursuing the UFO from different departments and localities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several units are maintaining the object under binocular observation, and discern a &#39;parachute-like&#39; structure attached to the object. One unit tries to signal the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One officer, who is at the airbase, is also observing the object from his vantage point. Present with him to view the UFO is a security guard at the airbase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, &#34;several&#34; objects are suddenly under scrutiny by law enforcement officials. This is announced rather cryptically, as the officer states: &#34;We have both of them under observation.  I think you&#39;ll know what I mean.&#34; The exact nature of this dialog is uncertain, but it is at this time that multiple objects were observed One specific object, described as a &#39;white light,&#39; appeared over the airbase, where it was observed and reported by a police officer Pursuit of these objects continued for some time, and it was again stressed that all departments in the county were concerned with the situation, and held the object(s) under visual observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All objects ascended to a high elevation and appeared as stars in the sky. As the objects were viewed at a high elevation, others on the police force that did not engage in close range observation of the main object, while at its low elevation, assumed that everyone else had misidentified planets or shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Toward the end of the event, jets were seen in the area, and one officer believed they were military jets from the airbase sent to engage the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One officer refuted the &#39;planet&#39; comment, but stated that there were shooting stars visible. He stated that there were six shooting stars in the same part of the sky that the UFO was seen in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One unit took exception to the remark that planets were mistaken as UFOs, and he added: &#34;What I saw was not a planet. It was 50-feet off the ground and lit up the whole area like daylight.&#34; It is thought that the event ended around 6:00 a.m. from previous discussions with officials involved, although a specific time is not reflected on the tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exact number of witnesses to this event is unknown, but the 911 center received numerous citizen reports some of which can be heard on the 911 Center recordings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unverified reports indicate that officers from 10 Trumbull County police departments responded to the event.  The principal investigator suggests the following departments as likely candidates for having officers involved in close observation and pursuit of the object(s): Niles City PD Howland Twp. PD Girard City PD Warren Twp. PD Liberty Twp. PD Cortland City PD Brookfield Twp. PD Trumbull County Sheriff Hubbard Twp. PD Hubbard City PD  An officer in the area reported climbing an observation tower and saw three hovering lighted masses in a regularly spaced formation.  His communications with other officers is also on the recordings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other reports mentioned law enforcement investigation of similar phenomena as far from Vienna as East Palestine, Ohio around the same time.  This assertion needs verification.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other officers noted that in pursuing some of the objects, if the officers fell too far behind the object seemed to wait for then to catch up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps most unsettling about this event is the clumsy yet mysteriously effective campaign to ignore the event.  The FAA staff, working at the shared Youngstown Regional Airport and Youngstown Air Force Reserve Station at the time of the incident, were all replaced by new staff not long after the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may also be of interest to note that the region in which the reported sighting took place is relatively close to a Defense Logistics Agency and National Defense Stockpile at 1740 Niles-Warren River Road, one of the biggest radar/air defense installations in the United States. The Youngstown Municipal Radar Air Defense Agency is also within the locality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local media deliberately chose to ignore this event despite the fact that local civil authority figures of undisputed credibility and presumed competence openly declared the veracity of the events.  The media doesn’t deny the story, they just refuse to bring it to the public’s attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the NBC broadcast of “Confirmation” in 1999, NBC totally ignored the 5 year gap between the event and the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Included in “Confirmation” was an interview with an astronomer who has a reputation for slanderous statements and a decidedly unscientific anti-UFO stance blatantly accused all witnesses to this event of mistaking stars for large, complex, brilliantly lit airborne objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The CO at the Air Force Station, also in charge of PR for the Air Force Station, spoke on behalf of the military and blatantly denied, dismissed and derided the whole incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The principal investigator made two requests for all data for the Youngstown Airport/Air Force Station regarding air traffic on Dec. 14, 1994.   The request was made in accordance with The Freedom of Information Act.  Both request were flatly denied  If one does minimal fact-checking, this frightening incomprehensible incident will be corroborated and verified via a myriad of sources.  I find it disturbing that the incident is not already included in the database and this fact alone begs many questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone truly acting responsibly must bring this national and potentially global security threat into the public eye.  I find it disturbing that North Americans actually disbelieve in UFOs when they are a well-documented officially recognized phenomenon.  A UFO is simply an unclassified airborne object and nothing more can be said about them with impunity, yet many N. Americans are ill-informed and largely misunderstand the phenomenon.  While this event should have been the story of the late twentieth century, it is instead buried in obscurity.   One would think that if NE Ohioans really understood that so many local, credible, civic officials trained to quickly and concisely assess conflicts and threats were witnesses to an event of this magnitude and importance and yet were all deemed incredible, deluded and incapable of distinguishing a star from an aircraft, by the Feds, that the citizens of NE Ohio would be united in indignation and demand an explanation, but for some reason this is not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is all-too-familiar and frightening.  The motivation and reasoning behind the military’s public stance on UFOs is incomprehensible.  To allow large unidentified objects to invade our air space, potentially drain resources and instill existential terror among innocents is tragic.  Then for the military to wholly deny it, leaving perfect sane productive members of society marginalized, confused or worse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mystery of the phenomenon while inexplicable for years, is growing more and more ubiquitous.  Slowly, people are learning and I think the Federal authority’s position ( that I can only hope is erroneously intended for the good of the people), may become a liability as faith in our own institutions decay in the face of incongruent and mounting evidence.  The best way to solve a mystery and counter a threat is to have every hand and mind possible contributing to the effort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say no more except, please, please help inform our fellow citizens.  Ignored and unaddressed issues always resolve themselves one way or another.  I think market and economic stability is threatened by this irresponsible outdated policy of public denial by our Federal Government.  It isn’t a ‘right to know as a taxpayer” issue, but rather one of honesty is the best policy and cooperation between all levels of society in problem-solving is the best chance we’ve got of avoiding global mass-hysteria or some other even worse unprecedented catastrophe when the Powers can no longer hide this anomalous, ubiquitous threat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report for his having submitted such a thorough account of the Turnbull, OH, case.  We are well aware of it, and it was quite well investigated, and reported, by the late Kenny Young, who was a very well-known, and highly respected, UFO investigator.  PD))<n>

We were meeting 2 girls in my neighborhood and were going to walk up to the local Circle K convenient store.  Well, we met up with the girls halfway, and started walking up to the store.  The neighborhood was a very large suburban neighborhood outside of Greensboro, N.C. close to the Piedmont International airport.  I can remember the night there so vividly, the cars had frost on them that would glisten under the street lights. It was such a cold night, but we were having fun sneeking out walking up to the store, we were about 14 yrs of age.  On our way to the store we were all cutting up having a good time when my buddy who was a jokster to say the least, all of a sudden said ya&#39;ll theres a U.F.O..  My initial thought was he is such an idiot, until I looked up and couldn&#39;t believe my eyes, their in the dark sky a little above the trees was a huge Bright yellowish oval object slowly careening above the trees.  We all in utter disbelief stood there and gazed at it.  Like I said, it was oval in shape sort of like a football stretched a little.  It Was completely glowing a very illuminated yellowish color, with a little blinking light at the front of the U.F.O. according to the direction of movement. Itwas approximately a quarter mile above the ground about a half of mile from wher we were at.  Without saying a word we all started running toward the object, but all of a sudden it simply vanished leaving puffy pink trails only to be seenin the city and moon lights.  So, with exubilation walked to the store and met w/ a friend who had a driver license and car and he picked us up to go riding.  We began to tell him of what we witnessed, and he sort of just laughed it off until he turned on his radio and radio DJ announced that a bunch of drunks on a Saturday night were calling in reported U.F.O. sightings, but we knew better because we were not drunk and definetaly not crazy. Our friend believed us after he heard the ra! dio DJ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh yea, forgot the object was also moving extremely slow and made no noise.  That is what I remember like it was yesterday.  Thank you for reading my story and keeping an open mind.  I could&#39;t tell you what we saw that winter night many years ago, but I would sure like to know.  I bet the Government knows.  Thank-You.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Up in the sky was what looked like a huge zeppelin with modern windows and lights. There was light cloud and it looked very high up (approx. 5000 ft) and approx. 1/2 a mile or 1 km ahead of us. I stopped the car and both my friend and I were surprised by the scale and luminence of the craft though there was no real detail we could see as it was very high above us. I said it could be a hoax by Richard Branson or someone else but then it moved from the spot it was in to a different spot in the sky to our east and at least 5 miles away as if nothing had happened - really quite effortlessly and in a split second, as if it was floating or moving gracefully, but suddenly miles away. We both felt we had witnessed something quite strange and I scoured the next days papers for any mention but there was none.

As I was talking to her I noticed a very large circular orange light to the east at about 40 degrees maybe. The size of it seemed maybe like you would hold a basketball about 6 to 8 feet from you, if that helps at all? It didn&#39;t make any noise at all. As far as I could tell it was moving to the north very slowly. After looking at it in awe, I told the girl to look, when I looked back at it, it just went out(disappeared). Well she didn&#39;t get to see it. For some reason I didn&#39;t make much of a deal about it at the time. Someone told me it was probably St. Elmo&#39;s Fire.

Ground was covered with snow at the time.  It lasted for 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the husband and wife, and found them to be quite credible and convincing in their description of what they allegedly had seen.   Both have responsible jobs.  PD))<n>
12/6/94 21:20|Farmington|MO|Chevron|2 minutes|No lights, no sound, and HUGE.  Quite an ironic sighting.|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30605.html|36|ndxe199412| No lights, no sound, and HUGE.  Quite an ironic sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting happened nearly 9 years ago, but, is different than most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a beautiful December night, a little crisp, practically clear skies, and very little moon light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been talking on the phone and smoking a cigarette, staring off into the northern skies off the deck at the rear of my parents home.  I ended the conversation, and was finishing my cigarette, and I noticed that some of the stars would disappear for a moment, but then reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for a couple of minutes, and realized it must be an aircraft or something, and also that it seemed to be headed in my direction.  Sure enough, it went directly over my parents house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was mesmerized by the size, which I would estimate around 10 blocks wide, and 3 blocks thick.  It was low enough that I could see indentations like giant portholes all around the bottom.  It was a rusty/greenish looking metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound.  And no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had I not been staring at the stars I was staring at, I would have never known it when it went over the house.  It just soared over the house at what I would estimate 50 to 60 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in to get my parents, but of course, by the time they got outside, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s my sighting.  And though nothing exciting happened, it is definitely an experience I&#39;ll never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/5/94 23:00|Sumter|SC|Circle|10 minutes|Large object no engine noise, hovering 75 yards away. producing a light that made no shadows. after short hover time began climbing at|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02639.html|37|ndxe199412| Summary : Large object no engine noise, hovering 75 yards away. producing a light that made no shadows. after short hover time began climbing at rate i&#39;ve never seen before..<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was also reported to Shaw AFB. It appeared in the police blotter in the shaw spirit (base paper). I was watching TV when I saw a bright light come through my window. I looked out to see who was shining it in my house when i noticed a hovering object circular in shape approximately 75 yards away. I immediately went to wake my wife so she could also see it. Returning to the window I noted that the object was beginning to lift higher. returning to my bedroom i again tried to wake her. this time she came in but it had already climbed high enough that only if you knew what you were looking for could you see it. I didn&#39;t say anything more about it till i saw it in the base paper. then i told my wife the details. It made no sound, and the light it gave off made no shadow. It climbed at a rate no jet I&#39;ve seen can make. 2 weeks after this event my neighbors were over for dinner, they breached the subject by saying &#34;your gonna think we&#39;re crazy. But we saw a UFO in your yard just 2 weeks ago.&#34;. Needless to say we exchanged our views of that night and they matched exactly. My background is a avionics Technician for the ((Deleted)). I was in the airforce for ((Several--# deleted)) years. I was retired medically for a injury incurred from a ((Reason deleted)). Which brings up another weird event. my 2nd day home from the hospital, i had a most troubling dream that i was being dragged from bed and dragged through some tall grass toward a bright light. I awoke that morning and woke the wife to go make breakfast, as i sat up she asked what was on my back. Then she brushed off a handfull of grass seed... I told her about that nights dream. and we both agreed it was weird. She says she remembers waking that night and i wasn&#39;t in bed, she thought i was on the computer so gave no thought to it. when we entered our front room, my brother 14 years old, was sleeping on the couch. he asked where we went last night. We said no where, why? He said he heard the door open and close once, like someone had left but never heard anyone return.<n>

12/1/94 01:00|Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)||Triangle|3 to 6 minutes|6 black trianges without any light or sound over a night at Rio de Janeiro|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42755.html|39|ndxe199412| 6 black trianges without any light or sound over a night at Rio de Janeiro<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 10 years ago, so I don&#39;t remember what day it was, but is was in the end of 1994 or beginning of 1995 and at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a house in the city of Rio de Janeiro, 20kms from downtown and 25kms from Ipanema (yes the same Ipanema from the “Girl from Ipanema” song), 2kms from the coast, in a condo with houses and buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (if the location were I live is important, I looked in the yahoo maps for the location http://mapas.yahoo.com.br/mapaxml.asp?arq=10.10.7.2/temp/6218_yahoo____endereco_06032005_235343&amp;jump=#topo )  Me and my 5 friends were talking in the swimming poll at my house (we were not drinking or using other stuffs). I saw a strange light far southeast, it was changing colors, faint, red, green and blue, just one spot. And it was dancing near the top of a distant building. I thought it was someone that taped a small flashing light in a kite, and was playing with it over the building. Then the light made a fast movement down behind the building. I thought: - well, they collected the kite. (Just I saw this light).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when the light disappeared, one of my friends pointed to the sky (west +/- 45 degree), and asked: &#34;What is that?”. Just above us one black triangle, with NO lights and NO sound, was floating, west to east, it seams to be very slow and calm. It seams to be gliding, floating, not flying. But it appears to be going in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a PERFECT triangle with sharp corners, it was not a glider, or a stealth plane (both of them are not a perfect triangle). And it was black, but stealth planes black. And smooth, with nothing visible on if surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night, without clouds and no wind. We were seeing it because of the reflections on it from the lights of the city. So it was relatively low. Kind the same altitude of the clouds (we can see clouds everyday illuminated from the city light too). As it pass, we could see the rear-end of it and there was no lights or fire from engines. It did appear to be a thin object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed over us until disappearing behind another building (not landing over or behind it, it just passed over it). We where amazed and wondering what was that, then we looked west and other TWO black triangles were floating the same direction of the other. They did disappear behind the same building the same way and speed (slow). We were even more amazed and clueless and we looked again to west and the last 2 were coming and did the same trajectory without light or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were very excited at the end, but frustrated for not having a photo or video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know how to describe the size of them. They were very big to see, but not huge like others descriptions that I heard of black triangles. The were probably huge, but due to the distant, they seamed to be just very big to us. Maybe it could cover 8 to 10 full moons lined up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a small not-military and not very busy airport 10km north from here, so I know how to identify planes and I know that they are noisy. And the city’s Goodyear Blimp, lands in the same airport almost everyday (sometimes passing south to north over my house), so I know blimps too. Gliders, well I can see all kind of them when I go to the beach here. Theses black triangles we saw are not like anything I ever saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if there were others in Rio that saw, but nothing were reported on the local or national TV or newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you need, I can take a panoramic photo from the place and draw the size and trajectory of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry my bad English it is hard to explain this kind of stuff in another language.I hope it was enough detailed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any question, just e-mail me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
