Duchesne, UT|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97248.html|1|ndxe194406| Woman, 20s, sees round object near Ft. Duchesne, UT<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a two-to-three-year-old child when my father was transferred to a small government boarding school for American Indian children during WWII.  The school was the now-closed White Rocks Indian School near Fort Duchesne in northeastern Utah.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother tells the story that, while we were there, she took me out for a walk near the school. I understand that many UFOs are spotted in the Fort Duchesne area today, with some speculation by some that there may be a UFO base in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During our afternoon walk, my mother said, a large, silvery object came into sight and made a 360 flight around us, then left.  My mother, for decades, thought the object might have been one of the incendiary-device balloons launched by the Japanese Imperialist forces from the Japanese home islands during the War.  The Japanese hoped to start fires on the American mainland, and would launch them between November 1944 and April 1945—again, about the time I was two or three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some 9,300 f&amp;#363;sen bakudan literally “balloon bomb” devices were sent aloft.  About 300 were observed.  They were an ineffective weapon, though six people across the western U.S. were killed by the devices.  Damage from the bombs was slight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, when I became an adult, I asked my mother some questions about what she saw that day.   She gave essentially the same explanation as above again. I asked if she would draw it.   She drew a round object that may have been a balloon. However, she apparently did not see a dangling incidenary device or bomb.  I think that, at the height she report—about 500 feet above us—the device would have been plainly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked what else she noted about what she saw.  She said that the device either shimmered or sort of shook while in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then, as I said, departed—I&#39;m not certain whether to say it drifted off or flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was young enough that I don&#39;t remember the incident though I do remember some other happenings of the time, none of which involved a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose I would not be filing a report, except for the facts that the object made the complete circle around us, and the object had a pecular movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

We where on a bombing mission in the early hours of the Normandy landings our target was a railroad depot where the Germans used that railroad to bring men and material up to the Atlantic wall so being that reinforcements could be brought up and to cut supply lines it was a target.  After all these years I&#39;ve lost the coordinates of our target.  About 10 minutes after we crossed the coast.  I heard one of our escorts over the radio call out &#34;bandits 6&#34;o&#39;clock high and low.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, after I heard this, I went to cock my weapon I was the right side waist gunner looking inside of our formation before we left on our raid i and check and recheck my weapon.  One of the objects appeared in between our formation and my I went to cock my weapon and it jammed i tried my best to check the jam.  It appeared normal.  About fifteen minutes after it appeared, it disappeared and my weapon had cleared.  It was the strangest thing ever because we also had radio loss and our number four engine had stalled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this on behalf of a vet who i heard this story from.<n>

I heard a sound of bees buzzing overhead as though a very large and angry swarm were about to attack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took cover on the ground and when I looked up and to the side from my prone position on the ground I saw a hovering circular and very large round aircraft with many lights shining from underneath the craft.  It took off after a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted)).

As the plane approached, the disk ascended upward out of its range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second larger plane with a higher operational ceiling was then sent up to continue the pursuit, and again the disk ascended upward until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, this incident was witnessed by a number of the facility staff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
