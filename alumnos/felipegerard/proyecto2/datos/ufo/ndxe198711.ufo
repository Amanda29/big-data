11/27/87 17:30|El Paso|TX|Oval|30 seconds|A noiseless, round object with colorful bright lights, hovering in the desert of northeast El Paso Tx. by McGregor Range.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42265.html|1|ndxe198711| A noiseless, round object with colorful bright lights, hovering in the desert of northeast El Paso Tx. by McGregor Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 27th 1987 I was out in the desert, northeast of El Paso Tx. close to McGregor Range.  I saw an object hovering to the south of my location.  The object did not make any noise and it had different colored lights on it.  The lights were going in circles around the object.  The object appeared to be round and appeared to be large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the object hover it proceeded further east slowly and then moved west slowly, and in a split second it headed into the sky at a very high rate of speed.  I could no longer see it, and it left no trail, nor noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported this to anyone, because I was always afraid of ridicule.  Only people who have seen something like it will believe me.<n>

It was a bright morning the sun was just coming up over the hills towards the east. I first noticed the vehicle behind me it seemed odd, because it was not directly on the road but somewhat above the road. I keep trying to get a good look at it because the lights were placed oddly on it.  They were up high and to far apart for a car.  The road is very windy and I had to concentrate on my driving but the vehicle behind(above) my car (a volkswagon bug)continued to follow me too closely.  I become alarmed when I realized it was actually above me and as I began to go around a sharp bend in the road I was suddenly blindeed by what I thought was the front of a semi-truck trailer(behind the cab)but after it passed me I looked into the side view and rear view mirrors and saw there was not a truck there!  I saw that the vehicle that was following me was now going past me above the road.  I couldn&#39;t get a good view of it due to the glare of the rising sun. But it was definitly flying past my car. After I was blinded by what I thought was the metallic reflection of the front of a semi-truck trailer I noticed the lights on the vehicle behind me were blue and a light green color. After being blinded and realizing something was flying past I got really scared and about in a 30 to 40 span minutes later I found myself knelling on the side of the road about a 1/4 mile away from my car. Then after walking to car and starting it up the next thing I am aware is that I am pulling into the Tehachpi Prison grounds!!! I turn and around and drive away from there only to next realize that I am at my friend&#39;s house in Rosamond and over 4 hours had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/23/87 23:00|Firebaugh|CA|Triangle|15-20 min|In late 1987 while driving south on I-5, I witnessed a UFO for approx 15-20 min.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45962.html|3|ndxe198711| In late 1987 while driving south on I-5, I witnessed a UFO for approx 15-20 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving along, approx 10 or 11 pm, I-5 was pretty deserted, it was the middle of the week.  I noticed a car pulled over to the side of the shoulder, and then a few hundred feet further another car pulled over to the side of shoulder.  The passengers of this second car, two people, a male &amp; female were standing in front of their car with a flash light pointing it straight up towards the sky and turning it off &amp; on, like they were signaling to something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought what the heck are these people doing???  I slowed down and had to lean over the wheel and look up to my right to see what they were signaling to.  Once I saw, I immediately pulled over to the side of road also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over about maybe 15 or so car lenghts in front of this car and immediatley turned off the engine and lights and then began to watch the object.  The object was to the right of my car, approx five or six car lenghts off the shoulder and then approx about a telephone poll and half up into the sky.  I can&#39;t measure real well in approx feet which is why I&#39;m using objects to describe this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that I saw was so close to me and so close to the ground but yet it just hung there, no sound or vibration at all, absolute silent, and very, very, big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very hesitant to give all the details over the internet however, I will say that in looking over your site I found one VERY close and similar incident which follows -<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 7/17/1996 01:35 (Entered as : 07/17/1996 01:35)<n> <n><n> Reported: 1/17/2004 4:37:11 PM 16:37<n> <n><n> Posted: 1/22/2004<n> <n><n> Location: I-5 (Firebaugh Exit), CA<n> <n><n> Shape: Diamond Duration:15 min<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw, and I know the other two people saw as well , was a triangle of lights. Becasue this incident was so close to me there was absolutly no mistaking what I saw.  I know that this was a craft of some sort, however, not something of our world.  I&#39;m no expert but I feel very confident that planet earth does not possess the capabilities to do what this craft did.  Additionally, the entire time I watched this object I had the very distinct and real feeling that someone, or some thing,  was watching me back.  I&#39;m posting this today becsue of the sighting that I referenced above.  This happened to me at approx the same area.  I was just about 2 or 3 miles from the Firebaugh exit on I-5.  After viewing this object, which eventually traveled straight up into the cloud covering and disappeared, I immediately drove to the first gas station there at the Firebaugh exit and phoned my mother to tell her what had just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience happened to me in 1987 almost ten years ago, however, I remember every detail as though it happened ten minutes ago.  I would like an investigator to contact me if at all possible as this experience bothers me a great deal.  I simply can not forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witnesses do not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Shaped like flying wing.  3 Lights, one on nose, one each wingtip.  Wingspan was 250-300 feet.  Speed was 20-30kts.  Followed in car for a couple minutes before getting out of car and getting up to second story of apartment complex. It was not a KC-135!  Object crossed over I-40 from N-S before heading West and out of sight at a moderate speed.  Within 10 minutes 2 fighters entered area low (3-4000ft) and at high speed from different directions and departed to the West with afterburner.  Total time observing was over 15 min.  Less than two hours later an object which seemed spherical was observed traveling S-N cycling between green and red.  It came to a stop and gained intensity staying red before departing to the East at high speed.  Total time was approx 4min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi- anonymous;  provides only e-address.  PD))<n>

My father was outside getting ready to start unloading his van , when he came in and asked us if we wanted to see a UFO . As soon as he pointed in the direction that he had see it we rushed out onto the deck , me just expecting to see some strange lights , as we had seen on two other encounters, looked straight up over head where dad was pointing. I was awe struck to see three triangular shaped crafts just barely visible in the night sky, seeming to just be giving off a glowing reflection and a slight silloet. one of the ships had a amber light and they were headed north at an speed of 60-80 mph perhaps a little slower. I could make out some detail of the under side of the vessele as i strained to take in as much of this spectical as possible just faintly seeing possible panles and contures in its structure. As they headed to the north and i was assuming that that was it they reached the hilltop 1/2 mile to the north of us and to our amazement made a 180 degree turn and headed right back over us for a second look. At that moment Im thinking can we hitch a ride . Well knowing that a photo wouldnt develope well under such low lighting we all just stood and looked on as they proceded over and continued heading south and out of sight over the dark horizon. All the time I qas watching I was listening for the slightes sound and all i could make out on that calm cool night was a faint whir like wind or air passing over the crafts smooth surface. When the crafts were at the hill crest I could estamate their altitude at around 500 - 900 ft. , and then on their second pass I figure that they were around 100 ft in length and 75 ft in width and perhaps 25 - 40 % larger .<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girl friend At the time who always looked at me strange when I would mention some of the questionable sightings I had in the past was speachless and never mentioned this to any one that I know of , and this is the first public mention that I or any of my family has made of this outside of a few close friends and relitives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking through some of the reports and finding a few that could be in the same time frame and had very close discriptions as to what we saw I thought I would let them know their not seeing things , well yes they did see something ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im sure that after I post this som other details will come to mind but their was soo much to take in in those few short minutes that seemed to go in slow motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We tried to decipher what it was against the dark sky.  The rectangular shape contained square like sequential lights with vary faint red dots leading upward to another red spot in the center top of the object.  Based on the lights, it appeard to be spinnig slowly while rotating left/right. Kind of like trying to spin and balance a plate on a stick object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then crossed over 4th st heading west and spead up fast then vanished into the western sky.

11/15/87 02:00|Gatineau (Canada)|QC|Triangle|45 min|The triangle was black as a hole in the night sky and as large as a football field.|7/13/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44834.html|10|ndxe198711| The triangle was black as a hole in the night sky and as large as a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> November 15, 1987, 2AM (time approximate) While returning home from work on a crisp, clear, moonless night, I was travelling east on hwy 50 just north of Gatineau, Quebec(Canada). I passed the Gatineau Airport on my left. It was closed for the night. I was alone in my vehicle and there was no traffic on coming or behind me. Making my way to Buckingham I passed several overpasses encountered on this highway and was approaching the last before my turn off which is about six miles east of the aforementioned airport. As I approached the last overpass I noticed a bright red light just ahead and to my left, about 100 feet off the road and 100 feet off the ground. The size, colour and brilliance resembled the kind of warning light you see on top of hydro towers. I thought this was peculiar because there was a hydro tower nearby but not at that location so I figured it must be a late arrival flying to the Gatineau airport. But it was closed and this was way too far away for a flight to be in a landing pattern anyway, so I slowed down expecting the plane to make a hard landing in the field. I pulled off to the side of the road just west of the overpass, stopped and got out of my car. The field extending north of the highway is fairly level and consists of scrub and weeds for about 1500-2000 feet until it reaches the bottom of a rise in the terrain that goes up maybe 100-150 feet. So looking north is fairly black with no illumination or dwelling in my line of sight  until the horizon which is higher than where I&#39;m standing. The night sky explodes with stars and the milkyway from the horizon up. The red light is in a fixed position in the darkness below the horizon and I&#39;m marvelling at how an aircraft can remain stationary for so long. I look around for possible wind sources to make this happen but the air is still; and I haven&#39;t been able to make out any kind of outline to put a fix on the aircrafts shape. So I walk across the double highway, down the ditch and up to the fence. This gives me a lower but closer perspective, all the while looking up at this thing to see if I can make its shape. When I reach the fence I begin to think this might be some new stealth vehicle the military is trying out because I don&#39;t hear a sound and still can&#39;t make out its outline. My eyes becoming more accustomed to the inky darkness I find a hard straight edge that leads up into the sky and then to my utter shock begin to see the staggering size of this thing! I stumble back from the realisation that the inky darkness was part of a craft that was triangular in shape blotting out most of the bluff in the background, the horizon and part of the night sky! What I mistook at first to be just a lack of stars in that particular section of sky was an enormous triangular shape the reached from above and just ahead of me to just below the horizon. The point forward I believe seemed to be to my left bearing the red light under its tip. It was all I could do to see the shape. No details, no one and no sound. You could almost describe it as an absence of light, like looking into a dark hole. Having never heard of flying triangles as possible UFOs I didn&#39;t speak of this until 2001 when I read a report about them for the very first time. I was very excited by the facts and descriptions regarding triangles and discovering I wasn&#39;t alone in seeing one. When I drove away from the object that night, I contented myself with the explanation that I had witnessed a military exercise of some secret airborne vehicle and always referred to it as such, never even suspecting a possible UFO context. After 45 min I left thinking what a mammoth airplane. Truly football field size as they say.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects travelled without sound, and were white lights. I thought they were hang gliders, but then they travelled very fast in an arc towards my vehicle. One was over top of us while moving at 60 Km/hr and the others were on either side, circling each other. The object over us which was just a rectangular white light at that time then travelled to the right and participated in that circular fashion arournd one of it&#39;s mates. I came to a stop light and stopped, by this time there were just beyond my eyes focal length. They stopped with me. When the light turned green, I accelerated to get a look at them, but they then proceeded to go essentially vertically up, and disappear one at a time, in a corkscrew fashion. The following day, and independant witness was discovered and never gave much care to share details. I since stopped communication with the other friend as well, but know both of them. Only sighting ever, but for very high velocity huge orange object (girlfriend witnessed also) -- for a fleeting second, 3 objects in total, one circular, and 2 angle like fins seperated, but with large gap between sphere, and contoured to match it&#39;s circumference. Again in Nepean Ontario but approx Sept 96, also strange lights in that area on 2 - 4 occasions. I have never seen an alien, nor any detail of ship, simply lights, though the most dramatic experience (first mentioned) when I strained to see the ship when the white rectangle was over us, I thought I could make out a trailing light, outlining an arc to what looked sherical. ie. a perfect sphere? with a perfect rectangle of white light, it seems to me the lights which I saw prior to that rectangle (the spheres) were less white, perhaps yellowish - I am reporting this 13 years later.<n>

On Colorado Highway 7 about 2 miles north of Lyons, Colorado, I caught sight of the underside of a very large object.  It seemed to be oval-shaped, maybe 50-75&#39; long and 25-35&#39; wide; there were glowing circular white lights on the bottom of the object. The lights were bright enough to help me make out the edges of the object.  I could see 4-5 of these lights, which seemed to be placed toward the outer edge of the object.  It was moving very slowly across the canyon, about 20-25 feet above the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my husband if he was seeing the object.  He did not respond but kept driving, staring intently ahead, and giving no sign that he had heard me.  He did not remember anything about this when I questioned him the next morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am presently a psychoanalyst in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S.  Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful and scientifically oriented observer.<n>

I can&#39;t remember what exact month it was (it was Sep, Oct or Nov) and I now for sure that there was smoke on the horizon line that night from wildfires that had recently swept through several parts of Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 6 surfers heading toward the waves with surf boards under their arms.  They were pointing up and then I saw it....a cylinder like a cigarette shaped thing with lots of lights.  The lights were rectangles some on their sides and some standing up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was ridiculus.  I can remember that there was no order to these lights.  Isn&#39;t craft supposed to have symmetrical lights?  The light source seemed to be soft fluorescent and didn&#39;t shine outward.  The lights were soft white and there was nothing visible behind them.  I estimated the craft was at least as long as a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow after about a solid 45 seconds of this the lights shut off and two purple lights appeared, one on each end of the thing.  Never at anytime did the thing make a single noise.  Then it started to move away slowly and began to spin wildly.  The spin was unlike anything that could be reproduced in any object having mass.  It spun out of control with no axis of rotation and dissappeared into the southwest sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That last split second it went from being just hundreds or so feet over the Atlantic to out of sight.  So the distance was like 500 miiles travelled in about one tenth of a second.  There was no light trail like the kind the starship Enterprise used to leave.  That is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and my step dad both saw it too but claim now that they can no longer remember seeing it.  I saw this thing just last December, a photo, in my Encarta computer encyclopedia.  The only thing wrong with the Encarta picture is that the lights were purplish not reddish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.
