We were concerned about Kamikazes and I was scanning sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found a shiny, silvery disc at a very high altitude directly over us.  I reported it to the O.D. and others viewed it, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as time passed nothing happened and only I watched it the rest of the day.  It remained directly over us all day.  At the time a Japanese weapon was a primary concern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
