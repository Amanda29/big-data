We were on vacation and were headed home from Northern California. We had pulled off of highway 5 in the Mojave area in the late afternoon, we made dinner and ate our dinner while it was still dust outside. Our rig was facing towards the western sky. When the sky had darkened the base of the mountains lit up, the light begain to rise slowly as it did, it increased in brightness. The light rose above the mountains and hovered for several seconds before shooting across the sky in a easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We used to watch these things nightly. All nightime workers used to watch these as a matter of routine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eary 1970&#39;s - Sinop, Turkey. In the mountains on the north coast of Turkey we would experience nightly light shows. White sphere shaped balls of light would &#34;pop&#34; up into the air. Sometimes a large &#34;ball&#34;, as I&#39;ll call it, would rise with a smaller one orbiting around it. Others would come up and down out of the mountains and just sit there. Usually that&#39;s all they would do - just sit there. Occasionally they would leap-frog over each other but would never leave the mountain tops or approach the base. One night working the midnight shift, I had to drive to a remote part of the base to another building. As I was waiting for clearance to enter the building the large &#34;ball&#34; came up with it&#39;s smaller companion orbiting around it. I mentioned it to the MP in the guard shack who just smiled and said, &#34;Yeah, they&#39;ve been real busy tonight.&#34; No one ever talked about them and my captain didn&#39;t want to hear of it. They usually would string the mountain tops like christmas lights. These things never did anything and would just sit there till dawn when daylight would fade their light. They were all over Vietnam too. Put out a call to GI&#39;s who have been in remote areas of the world, Turkey, Vietnam, Korea, Alaska etc.. You won&#39;t believe some of the stories. I know a Marine combat veteran who has photos. No name ATT.<n>

I was in a house with some friends at the edge of the open field.  A friend came running inside where the rest of us were and yelled &#34;come outside quick and look at this&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to the back yard and on the far edge of the field,three large red lights were assending up from behind the trees (about 1/2 mile away at the back of the field).  They came to a stop about 50 ft above the trees (or so it looked from that distance].  About 10 seconds later two very large white lights came up from the same place and stopped above the red lights.  After a few seconds the white lights started moving in our direction,very slowly and the red lights went back down behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights got about halfway across the field the hairs on my neck were standing up.  We all knew something wasn&#39;t right about this. There wasn&#39;t a sound coming from anywhere.  A dog about a half mile away started barking.  It was so quiet that nite you had no problem hearing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights got closer, one of them veered off to the right over the trees about halfway over the field towards us.  The other one was heading right over our heads. We were paralyzed.Before this we all had joked since childhood about ufo&#39;s and space men.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the other one got closer {the est distance from the ground would be about 100&#39;}I was going to run,but somehow stayed.The huge white light was just about over us and it started, very slowly to turn to the right over the trees.The whole time the thing that was the most obvious was that there was no sound or noise from it at all.Dead silent, directly over our heads,moving and not making any noise at all.The light was so bright you couldn&#39;t make out any shape. The light at about 100 ft over our heads was approx 50&#39; in diameter.Incredibly bright. I don&#39;t know of anything that flies and can make precise turns like it did in the pitch dark of night that doesn,t make a sound.We looked at each other and nobody said a word. Something inside you lets you know when something is not right.With all of our knowledge,intelligence and reasoning we just knew what we saw.I happened apon a TV show and saw your web site, is why after all this time I feel relieved to tell someone that doesn&#39;t &#34;yea OK sure&#34; I have never been as frightened and thrilled at the same time in my life.<n>

A small group of us were laling on the ground looking up at the stars and spotting the occasional satellite moving across the sky. Some of them would appear to blink, we supposed they were roating. We were tiring and about to get up and go to bed when someone noticed another satellite, but doing something it shouldn&#39;t be able to do. It was making sharp right angle turns as it moved in a &#39;straight&#39; line across the sky. It made maybe 30 or so turns and when it neared the horizon it got very bright and moved off at an oblique angle at an extremely high rate of speed. Hmmmm........

I told her to be quiet and i wasnt going any were,<n> <n><n> <n><n> as im watching this take place a smaller UFO came up and the beam of light coming from the larger UFO took the beam of light (perhaps a laser beam) and connected to the smaller UFO, the two crafts were so close to me that you could see them moving up and down a little as i assume the the smaller craft was being charged perhaps with electric from the larger UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place in 1972.  The beam of light stopped and the smaller UFO moved at first slowly.. then all of a sudden shot forward like a bullet following the tree tops as it sped away followed by the larger UFO in the same mannner.<n>

My 2 friends, my brother and I were out late that night (after 10:00 pm). I was 11 yrs, my brother 9, the others about the same age. We were playing some game on the sidewalk, and we noticed a huge yellow light in the sky, approx. 1/16 diameter of a full moon. It seemed to be very high in the sky or in space. The small airport called Sunland Park was visible in the west accross IH 10, and the lights from some small planes could be seen in the vicinity of the airport. The light was very high above the airport, and slowly moving to the north. We were excited, and I said to my friend that we should run up the block to his house to get his new telescope. At first he didn&#39;t want to, being afraid we would miss something while we were running up. But it kept moving so slowly that he agreed, and we sprinted up the street to get the scope. When we got to his house his Dad was out getting ready to call him and his brother in. He said &#34;Dad, LOOK AT THAT!!&#34;, and his Dad took a long look at it, then called his wife and the older sister out to look. By this time, the light had crossed 1/2 the horizon, but was still very high (in space?). Soon thereafter it stopped moving, and after hanging there for 15 secs. or so, it began dropping smaller yellow lights out of the bottom, one after the other. The lights were about 1/10 the size of the larger light. It proceeded to drop about fifteen of these. The craft was at about 10:00 high, and these smaller lights would each disappear at about 08:30 high. When they began disappearing, the number of them and the realization that they could fly over us invisibly made my knees start to wobble and give out from fear- the only time in my life that has happened. After the last of the lights fell, four lights simultaneously broke off the object at each corner or quadrant, then fell to the same area and disappeared. After that the entire craft just blinked out. I looked around the neighborhood, and some other neighbors saw this as they! were ou tside watering the grass and others working on a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At first I thought it was someones spotlight, but suddenly realized that it was much larger as it broke into a beam of light projecting down into the city. I pulled over and got out to see what the heck this was all about and it was absolutely silent. No sound from the City, no barking dogs, not any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was wierd, so quiet. I thought what can that be? Is it a large light that the carnivals used to use to shine a light beam up into the sky to attract people? As I studied this light, it rose above the horizon of the mountain top and I could see stars below it, so I know it was not a land based object. After a few minutes, it receded back to itself and vanished. All that remained in that location of the nite sky was a bit of fog looking stuff which slowly disipated. At that moment, all sound returned. The sounds of the city and freeway traffic far off, and closer was dog barking, lots of dogs barking all around at all the homesites in the foothills. The hair on my arms stood up and I chilled all over. After thinking more about what I saw, I realized that the size of that object was huge and the beam of light did not simply turn on and off, but projected (visually extended and retracted like a telescope ). Certainly not the speed of light. I am reporting this because I just ran across your site for the first time and never knew there was a place to report the incidence. I am having chill bumps just reliving the experience. What ever that thing was, it controlled sound and was silent itself.The light beam that it projected was a different light than I have ever seen, it was thick and intensly luminous even though it source had to have been at least two or more miles away. I observed it from a side view, it never shone on me, but I could see what it was illuminating at a great distance. Thanks for a place to finally tell of my encounter after 30 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We all walked outside, as we always did, and her son pointed to an object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a large &#39;cigar shaped object&#39; emitting light and hovering above us in the sky. It made no sound. We moved toward the back yard (which was a small field) in order to see it better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started to decend right over us, like it saw us looking at it.  It got larger and larger but there was no way to really judge the size or how close it was, but it seemed bigger than the neighbor&#39;s house. It decended slowly and blocked out the stars in the sky. It felt like it was right on top of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, without warning, the Object shot straight up in the sky at a speed that was astounding. It became the size of a Softball and bright white in the sky.  It stopped and angled right and zipped away so fast that you could only follow it for a few seconds. Then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or so later, we heard and saw several &#39;Airforce Jets&#39; from &#39;Pease Airforce Base&#39; flying in the same direction the object retreated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound of the Jets made us realize that the object that we had just witnessed had no sound to it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The three things I saw were things in the sky that I could not explain.  The first two occurred at night in 1970.  They only amounted to lights in the sky, but I will never forget them, as I will explain.  Two friends witnessed the first sighting and one of the friends witnessed the second.  The third event happened during the day about 15 years later and was seen only by me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was in Houston.  My two friends and I looked up one night and saw a star-like light crossing the night sky.  We thought it was a satellite, so we watched it.  After traversing across about one half of the sky the object changed directions by 90 degrees.  It did not turn.  It did not slow down.  It simply changed directions.  One instant it was traveling thousands of mile per hour in one direction, and the next instant it was traveling thousands of miles per hour in a direction 90 degrees to the first direction.  It finally went out of sight over the horizon.  The three of us commented about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It then sped up and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were changing a shifter in his car when our dog started going nuts.  The dog ran up and down the driveway barking wildly, as he did only when someone was coming up the driveway.  I ran out (we had the car parked over the old cellar steps) to see who was coming up the driveway, and saw that the dog was looking up.  I looked up to see what he (the dog) was barking at and saw this grey triangular outline with orange lights against the clouds.  The triangle was moving slowly going west to east.  It had glowing orange lights in each angle of the triangle.  I measured the size by holding my arm out and judging the lights to be about the size of a large pea at an arms length (that would be one of the three lights).  The object was perfectly silent.  On the farm at 5:00 in the middle of summer it is pretty quiet.  There was no wind at all.  It was very still and perfectly quiet.  Absolutely no sound came from the object.  It moved at what seemed to be a very slow steady speed as it went directly overhead, with the dog going nuts the whole time.  I called to my brother to get out there to see it but he was putting something together on the shifter and didn&#39;t come right away.  As the object passed over our farm and went over the feild. it began to speed up and raise in altitude.  This change was very obvious, even to me.  It really sped up and it cruised up right off into the clouds.  At about this time, my brother came out and asked what I wanted.  I said &#34;man you missed it&#34;.  The dog ran out into the feild and went probably about 1/2 mile before he gave up and came back.  Just directly West of our driveway was our neighbors runway.  He was a crop duster and when he landed, he flew at pretty low altitude right over our house. Our dog was very used to that and could care less when it happened.  This was very different.  This is absolutely true.  I have never reported this to anyone other than close freinds.<n>

I am now 43 yrs old and can see this in my mind as clearly as it happen only 5 mins ago! also a day never goes by without me remembering the event. we were coming back from a camping trip at crystal lake. as i stated eariler i was in the back of our family station wagon ehen i looked up and saw what looked like to be a giant bird flying  appox 1-200 ft. up and to the west of our car, just below the top of the mountains and seem to be go the same speed and dirrection as us. what really gets me and why i am finnaly telling someone about this is, i have heard David Davenport on Art Bells show now several times, and never heard any discription like what i saw. this was now what i call &#34;bird of brey shape&#34;the color of this thing was dull green. what it reminded me of in regards to color was that of copper when it tarnishes. the shape was very close to that of the &#34;bird of prey&#34; seen on star trek! I know this was a long time ago and I hope I dont sound crazy, but I got to know now if anyone else has ever seen anything shaped like this?<n>

There was a big pit surrounded By hills and we used to slide down the hills on cardboard during the summer.  I was doin gjust tha twith a little girl ( to this day I can not remember who she was)  all I remember about her is that she had long dark hair.( none of my friends at the time match that description.)  I remember cli\mbing to the top of the hill and once at the top I saw a large silver disk sitting in the pit.( yes the typical flying saucer)  It was a dull silvery color and was sitting on three &#39;legs&#39;.  I remember going closer to see it better.  I heard a kind of pop and one section of the disk began to lower to the ground.  The next thing I remember running across a field on the other side of the hill towards my house. And it was getting dark so I think several hours had elapsed.  Since then I have had several other unusual experiences.  I have seen a &#39;creature&#39; in my bedroom window and when I tried to screm no sound came out.  I have a small lump on my right shoulder that has been there for as long as I can remember.  I have seen several mysterious objects in the sky.  I have another episode of &#39;missing time&#39;.  I have been unuassauly interested in UFOs, space, etc... all my life.<n>
7/12/72 12:15|Southington|CT|Disk|15 minutes|Connecticut Siting - Daylight - 2 Silver and Black Saucers - Separated but moving as if they were one.|12/9/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15337.html|21|ndxe197207| Connecticut Siting - Daylight - 2 Silver and Black Saucers - Separated but moving as if they were one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of this siting, I had just quit my job at a small anodizing factory. At Noon I punched out my time card and just walked out. I walked East for approximately one quarter mile. This area was a commercial area of the town. High traffic area. The sky was absolutely clear and not a cloud to be seen. I noticed a flash approximately 150 to 200 feet in altitude. My first thought was that this was simply a plane and I glanced up. I saw two saucer shaped objects. They were about 50 feet apart from each other. The objects were silver colored on the top half and black on the bottom. The saucers had no lights, no windows, emmited no sounds, and were seamless. As I watched for a few minutes, the objects were hovering and moving in unison. It was as if they were acting as one, maneuvering in exactly the same way. I estimate the diameter of each object to be perhaps 50 feet or so. As I watched I was under the impression that I was also being observed. It was lunch time and this being a high traffic area, I was amazed that no vehicles were seeing this event, so I tried to stop traffic as I pointed up to the two saucers. during this time the objects were ascending and descending slowly as they moved from side to side, circling. They had a slight wobble and were not spinning. I decided to try desparate measures to get someone else to see this, so I was about to step out into the oncoming traffic, and at that moment I watched the objects take to space at a tremendous speed. Since I had no other witnesses I have never made this public until now. I have had other sitings but never quite the same as this in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Very nice illustrations of two saucer shaped objects accompanied report.  PD))<n>

7/5/72 14:00|Park City|KS|Disk|5-10 seconds??|I saw a flying saucer hovering above me in the middle of the street.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32352.html|23|ndxe197207| I saw a flying saucer hovering above me in the middle of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was eleven years old, my family was visiting my grandparents in Kansas (where I now live)during summer vacation.  The date I gave is an estimate, because I am not entirely sure what month it was, though we usually visited around the Fourth.  I am certain it was 1972, because I know I was eleven.  I also am not certain of the time, but it was early afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandparents (mother&#39;s side)lived in a small house (where my parents now live) on the corner of a tree-lined street.  I was inside, in my grandparent&#39;s living room, when I heard the music from the ice cream truck in the general vicinity.  (I remember each of these details vividly because of what happened that day).  I begged my mother for money so I could go run after the truck and get an ice cream treat.  My mother was hurrying around to find me enough change, and as soon as I had it, I ran out the door.  As I was leaving my grandparent&#39;s house, I saw the ice cream truck driving up the street on the west side of their house, which ends up curving back around toward the northeast on the next block.  I hurried because the truck was going around the curve and I was afraid I wouldn&#39;t be able to catch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was crossing the street, what I saw stopped me dead in my tracks and I completely forgot the ice cream truck.  Hovering right above me, at about tree-top level, was (what I later would tell everyone) a &#34;flying saucer&#34;.  The diameter of the saucer was about the same as the width of the street, which is a pretty narrow street, a little over the width of two cars.  It looked exactly like a flying saucer out of some horrible B movie.  It was metallic and exactly saucer shaped, and I was looking up at it, not directly underneath, but looking at it from about a 30 degree angle.  It seems weird, but I remember seeing what looked like rivets on the underside, but it all happened so quickly, I can&#39;t be sure about that.  Anyway, the &#34;saucer&#34; hovered above me, motionless and completely silent, for maybe five seconds, then before I had time to react in any way at all, it took off suddenly and &#34;zipped&#34; straight off to the northeast from the house.  It was gone from my sight in maybe two to three seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can remember seeing it last as it just cleared the rooftop of the house across the street.  This detail is so vivid in my head, that I still think of that house as pink, as it was then.  (Now it is cream colored).  I then reacted, appropriately, I believe, and ran in the house screaming and hysterical.  I remember telling my mother &#34;Call the newspaper!  Call the newspaper!&#34;.  No one called anyone, because I guess they didn&#39;t know what to think of the whole thing.  My mother says now that I had told her at the time it had little blinking lights as well.  This event is still talked about in my family, &#34;I remember the day you saw the flying saucer&#34; and I get teased about it from my cousins to this day.  It has always been very frustrating for me, because it was broad daylight, and I never knew if anyone else saw it or not.  I wish I had had someone else with me that day, but anyway, it is all true.  When I hear &#34;experts&#34; say there is a logical explanation for all UFO&#39;s, I just think it is because they have never been witness to something like what I saw, or they wouldn&#39;t say such things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 42 now, and a mechanical engineer in the aircraft industry.  My father is also an engineer, very pragmatic and logical. He told me many years after my sighting (after his mother died...my other grandmother) that she used to look out her kitchen window across the pasture (they lived on a cattle ranch in Texas) and had several times seen &#34;saucers&#34; hovering above the field.  She told him and my grandpa and aunt about this, but my dad said she didn&#39;t want anyone else to know because she was afraid they would think she was crazy. (She was a very stern school teacher).  He only told me after she died.  My father has always believed me, as he did my grandmother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, that is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

We lived in the country in Powell, Wyoming, Park County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had watched the fireworks from our country home and were in our sleeping bags by 12:30.  The 7 year old fell asleep but the 9 year old was still awake.  We suddenly saw a very large orange-red &#34;fireball&#34; coming from the south almost directly over our house.  It seemed rather high but was quite large (I tried to compare it to the size of the moon) yet don&#39;t know how high it actually was.  It was way above the tall trees that grew close to our home.  It was completely silent.  If we hadn&#39;t seen it with our eyes, we wouldn&#39;t have known it was there.  Just as it glided over I watched it as it went to the north towards Billing, Montana (about 90 miles north).  As I turned to watch it go, I saw another one coming in almost the same trajectory.  It looked the same size, no noise and was headed up north like the last one.  And as I started to watch it, here came another one from the same direction.  All in all, it was about a minute for them to all come, one at a time, and go north.  I quickly ran in the house, recorded the sighting on a piece of paper and drew the trajectory of the 3 fire balls on a paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I worked for the State of Wyoming as a departmental secretary. On getting to work I told fellow workers about what I&#39;d seen and they said that people who saw something last night were to call the Sheriff&#39;s office.  I did call and gave them the information as I am giving you now.  I have never been contacted about this and I&#39;m almost 81 years old now. I will never forget what I saw and cannot ever deny seeing it.  I know there are UFO&#39;s.&#34; I&#39;ve seen them. I wonder if anyone in that area has ever reported this sighting to you.  Thanks for your giving me the opportunity to report this after all these years.<n>

I lived in the countryside back then in Les Escoumins, a small village in the province of Quebec in Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first  time i was about 5 years old . I am now 38 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time it was about 2 or 3 years after that .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time we were several people who saw it. We called neighbours and they saw it as well. It was a huge round orange fireball crossing the horizon line.  The sun was on the west side and that fireball was going towards Maine ( so it was going from north to south when looking into the west direction).  We all saw it for a few minutes untill it desapeared ( some peole said it plunged into the st Laurent river so if it did, it changed it&#39;s directory to go down). Some other people said that an army aircraft tried to chase it but i haven&#39;t seen any aircraft at that time.  It must have been at least 5 times bigger than the sun.  It was just amazing an no one ever knew what it was. It left no trace of smoke on it&#39;s path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time, i was back home after going to see a car accident that happened up the street from where i lived ( there must be a report somewhere at the police station about that accident if i ever want to know the exact date of ny sighting).  At that time , it was peach dark and there was no light post around.  I saw the exact same fireball on my way back home.  This time i was in the north direction and the firewall was heading West.  Same fireball, same speed, same everything but it was much furter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen shooting stars many many times before and after the events and i can tell that it was not one. The movement was constant. Both times, they were not going in an angle but on a straight horizontal line.  No noise, no crashing ( that i saw) , no reports in the medias.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What strikes me the most is when many years later i saw the movie about the Allagash Abductions.  The fireball looked a lot like the object in the movie. Was it the same object? I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I think I was about 8 years old and it was summer.  A friend and I were across a field near our house. There were bins that the park district used for dirt and stone, mulch....  There was also this garage that was used to store Native American things from a group that was in our town and performed in the field every fall. As kids I remember we thought the garage was haunted or had special powers or something. we used to go try the door which was always locked but we would always get scary feelings or felt something was weird there.  Maybe just kids talking about the unknown or maybe kids know something.  Well this one time we were walking back thru the field and I looked back for some reason to see a glowing figure of a person standing in or near one of the bins.  I can only describe it as glowing light, with no facial features but just in the shape of a person.  My friend and I were so scared we ran! home across the field and ofcourse nobody believed us.  I saw her years later and asked her about it but she had no memory of it. Its weird because I remember it vividly although we were at some distance away already and like I said I cannot say I saw eyes or even a face, but just a glowing figure standing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I live in Tinley Park, IL and I did see the red lights not on Halloween (which was the mass sighting) , but a few months before that, living in Orland Hills, many people saw them that nite as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

No booze, no drugs, no traffic at that time of night.  Came around a curve and there was a REALLY bright light shining on the road in front of us.  I was driving and I shut off the headlights in the car.  I remember thinking that we didn&#39;t want to be discovered. The craft was so low that we could see the light reflecting off it.  It had lights of it&#39;s own but I don&#39;t remember the colors.  It seemed to be surveying the road.  The light would follow the left side of the road and then it would cross and follow the right side.  We didn&#39;t say anything to each other.  There was no noise from the craft.  Maybe it saw us but it accelerated away fast.  Somebody said follow it.  We were all excited.  There was no road going the way of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home, we compared notes and we all saw the same thing.  We lost no time  We left the movie at about 1:30 and it was 1 hour drive home.  We called Hartsfield Airport, the police and Dobbins Air Force Base.  Everybody said nothing in the air.

I was at Boy Scout summer camp in a heavily wooded area outside of Goshen, Wisconsin.  Two fellow Scouts and I were walking back to our campsite after a campfire meeting, late at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a dark shape silhouetted in the middle of the trail, very tall, blocking our way.  Thinking it was a bear, we stayed frozen, stock still. We had been told that if we ever encountered a bear,  the worst thing to do would be to try and run.  A full-grown bear can out-run a human  easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ‘bear’ was making sounds, but more like a dog’s barking than anything else: very high-pitched.  The smell was foul, like something rotten.  We still couldn’t get close enough to get a good look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the next few minutes, an oval blue shape appeared directly overhead, about 100 yards above us. It didn’t have a clear outline but was more like a vibrating glow.  Reminded me of the blue flame from a gas stove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back and forth, first staring at the shape in the middle of the trail, then staring up at the blue light in the sky, for what seemed like a long time.  Probably just a few minutes, though.  The thing standing in the trail began to make a rasping breathing sound.  We were scared out of our wits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, in a flash, the creature took off running, upright, down the trail.  The blue light hung in the air for a brief second, then shot like a rocket in the same direction as the creature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were really freaked out, and promised not to ever tell anyone about it, because no one would ever believe it.  As far as I know,this will be the first time that anyone besides the three of us will ever be aware of this incident.  Was is it in fact a bear, or something else ?  The connection between the creature and the blue light ?  Hard to say, no one will ever explain it.  I do know this.  Three of us saw and heard exactly the same thing(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very high-pitched.  but a kind of chirping sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
