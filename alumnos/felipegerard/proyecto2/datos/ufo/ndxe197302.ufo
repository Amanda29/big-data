2/10/73 16:00|Houston|TX|Rectangle|2 MIN.|Skin burns and bad health for all of us.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20103.html|2|ndxe197302| Skin burns and bad health for all of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at the bottom of a sand pit(near lake houston) covered in mud. A loud humm came through the sky. We felt a sense of power against us as the 2 triangles stopped directly above. They hoovered above for a few seconds are so(we still don&#39;t agree on that one). They seemed to have no discribable color, other than the reflection of the sky and sun. The humm intensified for a moment and then the objects darted through the sky out of our sight. We have discussed the event at great lenghts since then. I seem to be the only one without selective memory as both friends shun any idea that it was other than an earthly encounter..we all suffered severe skin burns after the encounter and i still possess visible scars. I believe.<n>
2/3/73 16:00|Fort Rucker|AL|Light|10 seconds|Red Light Appears to Go Right Through Cockpit|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54399.html|3|ndxe197302| Red Light Appears to Go Right Through Cockpit<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a Military helicopter flight returning from a round trip from Ft Rucker, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama and back.  I was attending the Air Traffic Controller, school at Ft Rucker and it was my birthday so I went for a requested a jump seat ride on a Huey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached Ft Rucker near dusk (approximately ten miles out), the tower asked us to turn on our landing light so they could verify our position. This was done and the tower reported seeing our landing light and proceeding to give us altimeter and wind direction. Skies clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, cockpit covered in clouds and through the clouds a faint red light (blinking) about the size of an orange was approaching the craft.  The light as it approached became brighter and more distinct.  It broke out of the clouds and came directly at the cockpit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pilots dove the helicopter down and to the left.  Pilot and copilot called tower to ask if any traffic was in our area and they said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us, Pilot, Copilot and myself thought we were going to collide with something.  Pilot and Copilot both said they over the helmet mikes that they thought what the had encountered was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS I was further back in the Huey, it appeared to me as if the light went right through the cockpit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was Distinguished Graduate of the Air Traffic Control School and have seen many aircraft in my days but never anything as unusual as this.<n>
2/2/73 21:00|Roanoke|VA|Sphere|1.5 minutes|Silver silent sphere seen in Roanoke, VA in 1973|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89898.html|4|ndxe197302| Silver silent sphere seen in Roanoke, VA in 1973<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was 1973 in the winter (January or February), I was standing in my back yard in Roanoke Virginia.  As I was standing there in the dark Friday night about 9:00pm, something moving caught my attention in the sky.  It was a flying object about the volume of three 50-foot boxcars or the average fast food restaurant.  The shape was that of a sphere and the approximated dimensions of an M&amp;M (without peanuts) and was a &#34;brushed&#34; silver finish.  There were no wings nor rudder or any kind of protrusions along the crafts’ smooth lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling from south to north (approximately) and I was curious, as this direction would lead it towards a close encounter with our airport so certainly they would see it on radar.  I viewed the sphere from about a 45 degree angle.  This object was flying at approximately 250 to 300 feet in altitude and was travelling about 100 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a rushing sound like the sound an automobile makes when it whizzes past very fast but no mechanical sounds were detected.  In addition, there were no lights whatsoever, there were the red and yellow reflections bouncing off its lower surface from our local nearby Burger King.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I summarized that this craft was under its own power, under some kind of intelligent control, has a purpose and if made by mankind it is far beyond any propulsion type and aerodynamic configuration that is publicly known about.  It was beyond any doubt an Unidentified Flying Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 56 and then I was 17 soon to be 18, a aircraft model builder and being raised in the post WW2 environment was an avid young researcher in aircraft of all kinds so I was and still am “up-to –date” with most designs as well as with the experimental aircraft both commercial and military.  I still build models and am a far better researcher with perhaps more interest in the unknown than is healthy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So it has been some 39 years ago and I am truly as baffled by my sighting today as I was the night that it happened!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

2/1/73 23:00|Port Sulphur|LA|Circle|3 seconds|Drag Racing UFO's|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39727.html|5|ndxe197302| Drag Racing UFO&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> While Trawling for Shrimp late one night in the Louisiana Bayou with a friend, the sky was pitch black out that night. I was on the back the boat looking into the night sky at all the stars that were visible. I suddenly looked up and saw two circle shaped objects high in the sky, they were flying as high as Commercial Aircraft fly, they were silver/white in color, with a glowing bluish all around and leaving a blue trail behind each. They were flying side by side towards the North with one just behind the other as if they were drag racing. I quickly looked at my friend to hurry up and look and just when i looked back up I just caught them going beyond the horizon. They had to be traveling 50 or more times the speed of a Commercial Jet Liner. They were flying as high as Commercial Air liners, other than the shape and color of them, thats all that I could make out, and that they were FAST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

2/1/73 22:00|Honolulu|HI|Sphere|5 minutes|I was standing on the shore looking out towards the water when I saw a blue sphere coming toward the shore .

It was at about a 45 degree angle and out around 5 miles or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it stopped. At this point it was still quite a ways out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it moved upward at lightning speed, then stopped. Then it came down at the same speed to its original position. Then it moved downward,paused, then moved back to the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then  it moved to the left. then back to same spot. Then it moved right. then back to same spot. then it slowly moved away from the shore going back where it came from until I couldn&#39;t see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever publicly disclosed this sighting. I knew then  as I know now, It wasn&#39;t from this earth. I was 19 yrs old when that happened. I am now 54. I will never forget that night. I even rubbed my eyes in dis-belief a wew times, but it was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
