At a distance of about 1 mile away and at least about 300-400 feet above the treetop line, just true north of our house this object was slowly moving on an westerly direction. It resembled an upside down funnel, rounded on the edges and the top of the funnel was rounded also. Looking at this it had 3 eggshaped oblisques attached to the bottom of the cone evenly spaced apart and rotating at different intervals. As they rotated they went from a bright yellow to a sharp orange. The main vessel consistently stayed at a bright yellow. My wife who also observed this, very quickly layed back down in bed and quite frankly told me that she did not want to talk about this at all. Our vision is good and this was no plane or helicopter or weather balloon.<n>

Would have been just as the pilot said.  The trail behind was the flair exhaust.  Not trying to disprove, just say it as I saw it.  Bright, red, maybe metal on fire with smoke from behind.  My wife and my kids all saw it from our van.  I have 20/15 if not better vision and blue eyes to see a night.  Could have been a few people pulling our leg.<n>
11/30/97 02:00|LeMars (IA)/Denver (CO) (uncertain; traveling from)|NE|Light|approx. 5 minutes|Multi-colored "pole," appearing to hang in the sky for several minutes before dissipating slowly, from top to bottom, into darkness.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14362.html|3|ndxe199711| Multi-colored &#34;pole,&#34; appearing to hang in the sky for several minutes before dissipating slowly, from top to bottom, into darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were returning home from Iowa after Thanksgiving in 1997, driving in the middle of the night. My mother was driving; I was in the passenger seat, looking out the window, as we drove along the highway through endless farmland, indistinguishable in the black of night. I don&#39;t recall if there was a moon out, but as I gazed out the window my attention was suddenly grasped by what appeared to be a lit pole - long, thin, and vertical - hanging in the middle of the air over the field on the right side of the car. I have no idea how far out it was; it was a very dark night. The light of the &#34;pole&#34; was rainbow-colored, blended like a spectrum, and did not appear to light the field around it. It hung there for several moments, doing nothing; then, starting at the top and working its way slowly down, the light dissipated and was replaced by darkness. The minute it started doing this I turned to my mother to ask if she was seeing what I was seeing, only to find her looking out my window with a shocked expression. She said she saw it, too, and we watched it until all of the light had dissipated. I could not make out anything that might be connecting it to the ground, but as I said, it was very dark, so I made it a point to search the same fields on subsequent visits to and from Iowa. Taking the exact same route in the daylight, on several visits, at no time did I see anything that looked like the strange pole we saw that night, nor have I found any reports of anything remotely like it. It has been a constant, haunting presence in the back of my mind ever since. I am a State employee, assisting with investigations for the Department of Human Services; my mother is a former dental technician, now working for a company that assists the developmentally disabled.<n>

A red flickering light came down through the cloud cover, at first I thought it was a red beacon for a tower that was on the hill but then realize they were behind me and this was out over the Interstate 5 freeway. It moved around in a lazy manor the faded away... gone. Others on the freeway must have seen it also, there was alot of traffic at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a red light that was flickering vary fast, it was on the bright side but not like a fire, but a light. It was not going on a set course, but wandering about the sky. The cloud cover was not to high, may be 1000 feet over my location on the hill. I heard no sound and after it faded away, I packed up and drove with my lights off until I reached the old ridge rout road. I was shacken alittle. May have been a military craft? I don&#39;t know.<n>

Saw similar in Lake Geneva, WI 11/28/97 around 7:30pm.  Appeared to be an elxposion or electrical fire; presented with a huge red-orange glow that pulsated and flickered, but without sound.  Saw no craft, but noticed three electrical surges during this time period.  No reports of downed aircraft, substation fires or explosions to local authorities.  If you saw any similar display please report it here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After finishing dinner 11/28/97, a friend and I were watching TV in a condo on Lake Como near Lake Geneva Wisconsin.  There were suddenly three power surges/interruptions in rapid succession, but without any sound of explosive nature.  I got up to check out the electrical system, and noticed a huge pulsating red-orange glow to the northeast appearing to be just beyond the tree line near the lake.  However, no sound could be heard only the strange pulsating, flickering red-orange glow.  We went out to the balcony, but could not determine any more about the visualization.  We heard only one distant siren, but observed several autos heading down our cul de sac and on the roads nearby.  So we apparently were not the only ones to see this occurrence.  Since the weather was inclement, we did not got out to pursue this any further.  Unfortunately, we did not report this event to local authorities either.  I have since called the local police, but without any result.  I have contacted the Sun Times reporter in hopes of discussing his article and what we saw.  Possibly there is some reasonable explanation, but it seemed to be very strange and unworld-like!  The sighting in Will Co Illinois on Sunday 11/30 had similar characteristics.  The observer, a local businessman and pilot, reported seeing a brilliant &#34;fireball&#34; about the size of a full moon descend straight down form the clouds at about 125-150mph.  Within 20 seconds it disappeared. Authorities could find no evidence of any downed craft or debris.  Our experience was similar except that we saw no object/craft/etc and the color display lasted for about one hour.  The pulsating/flickering reached intensities that almost totally illuminated the night sky; then suddenly it would stop, start up again, vary in intensity, then flicker and pulsate wildly!  All without any sound!  My first impression was of some sort of electrical fire/explosion, space debris, a meterorite, or possible a UFO!  This event was witnessed by two adult males, approximately 50 years old, ! who had not been drinking, taking drugs, or otherwise mind altered!  One is a business man, the other(myself) a medical professional and student pilot.  This seemed too bizzare an incident not to report to someone; maybe you can shed some light on all this!!<n>

I&#39;d never seen an object this orange, and it fizzled, throwing off sparks as it fell. It ended with a visual &#34;poof.&#34;  It was like a pop-bottle rocket in reverse. I saw this driving home from work. I can easily believe it was just a piece of meteor or space junk that got unusually close to the earth to flame and spark so much. Most other shooting stars I&#39;ve seen have been white and made a thin white line as they&#39;ve streaked across the sky. This seemed to have a more downward motion to the earth. I wouldn&#39;t report it other than the fact that I heard Peter&#39;s report on the Art Bell show, and was wondering if the sighting in Chicago occurred at this time. I didn&#39;t catch the day or time of the sighting. If this seems to fit the description of a regular falling star, then I apologize for having taken your time. It&#39;s just that I&#39;d never seen a shooting star this orange. Thanks. BTW, I work as a copy editor at a daily newspaper here in the Twin Cities and am skeptical-to-open about UFOs, etc.<n>

11/26/97 22:30|Campbelltown (Australia)||Other|1 hour|UFO flew over neighbours house with object flying inside craft. Ufo's play tag with each other.|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17167.html|10|ndxe199711| UFO flew over neighbours house with object flying inside craft. Ufo&#39;s play tag with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:30 pm on the 26th of november 1997 My feionce alerted me to a very bright diamond shaped object sitting just above the horizion. On a overcast but still night. After watching the object for a minute or two i went to get my video camera. We went outside and started to film the object, almost imeadietly as i started to film the object slowly started to more to my right until it dissapeared behind a hill in the distance. We both look ed at each other and thought it was a bit weird but proceeded back inside. At that point an object in almost the same position as the first one. A large object was sitting on the horizion with a smaller object aproaching from it&#39;s right side (my left side) passed right by the bigger object and stopped and then flared up to the same size as the the other object. Big! at that point they started to fly towards each other passing by each other, one of the objects stopped where the first one was sitting and the other object moved behind the hill and out of sight. The other object remained in position for minutes before leaving in the same direction as the previous two objects. As was stated in the video by my feionce and I we where surprised at what we had just witnessed. At that point out of the corner of my eye i saw an object coming towards us i called to ((name deleted)) and said look up and we saw what looked like two balls of light with a strobing red light flying right by us with no noise and no definable features apart from being two balls of light. No wings no tail no blinking and more importantly no noise. the object was low in the sky, infact so low that it passed behind a tree a about 25-30ft tall about 20 metres in front of me. As it passed by us and went in front of us it was a mirror image of itself. In other words no visable change just two balls of light with a strobing red light going from left to right. We lost sight of the object about two or so kilometers away going behind trees. at that point i think we both knew we were watching something we had never seen before. Around five os so minutes later a large oval shaped orange glowing light appeared on the horizion right where we had lost the object behind the trees, low in the sky but clearly visable the object stayed still for minutes when all of a sudden a small object seemed to fly write up into the bright oval object.The bright object then changed shape into two white lights seperated by a small gap but with no red light this time and was approached by another similar looking object which flew past and a minute or two later both objects seemed to fade out and were no longer visable. The time now was around 11.30pm 1 hour later. Quite a long exhibition what ever it was! The next day i telephoned Air services Australia the official people who monitor aircraft movement into and out of Sydney. Their Response was that there was only one plane in the area at the time a 747 which flew past the area at 10.30pm and into Sydney (Mascot) and asked if i wanted to persue the matter further at the time i was a little nervous and so no but i would like to no what it could have been. Their response was after a minute or so on hold was that &#34;it could have been police helicopters or rescue helicopters&#34;. Well if this is true then i am convinced we would have heard them as we had one pass almost directly overhead at no more than 100 feet. the UFO Society of Austrailia has also looked at my tape as well as an astronomer at Sydney Observerty, Channel seven news here in Sydney not to mention my family and friends are all of the same opinion we have seen and video taped ufo&#39;s. They cannot at this time be identified. I would be only to happy to show you this and other footage i have and let you make your on mind up. However as i live in Australia we only have vhs. Can you view a tape of this format. Also i would like to add that we also observed and taped other objects in the imediate area of that first sighting for a period of three months with other eyewitness accounts. ((name deleted))<n>

It was almost crescent-shaped(the curve was not sharply defined). It remained in sight for approximately five seconds and then fell toward the car, increasing in brightness, and then vanished from sight. We looked for several minutes for another trace of the object, but could not find any. The witnesses were two musicians, aged 20 &amp; 18, both of whom are also amatueur UFO investigators who reside in Hyannis on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.<n>

I only saw it for a few seconds ( less than five seconds ). I was in town, not in the country, the night sky was clear. It moved more or less from West to East.  Don&#39;t know what it was, but I thought I was important enough to report. I don&#39;t know how high in the sky it was. I was in my back yard. I am not obsessed with UFO&#39;s or anything, I just saw something odd and was wondering if anyone else saw it.<n>

It drifted to the west, alternately blinking out and reappearing.  As I parked and got out of my car, it stopped.  I ran inside and got a pair of binoculars (Tasco 7x35mm). When I got back outside, the light was still in the same place.  When I aimed the binoculars at the object, it had three lights on it, two white and one blue. It looked like a helicopter, but I continued to track it as it moved slowly back toward the east. After about two minutes, four or five more lights appeared, two white and the others blinking red, orange, and blue. As it acclerated, I could make out a vague triangular shape which contained the lights. The object took up a good portion of the lenses of the binocs, and with the naked eye was about the size of a dime. There was no discernible sound coming from the object, and the rustling of nearby trees made it hard to tell if there was any noise. The! object continued to accelerate to a speed which made it difficult to track, and disappeared behind the home across the street from mine. Observer info: 21 years old, college student, some knowledge of aircraft, but no non-passenger flying experience.<n>

We got out to see what that light was.  It was oval and it was in one spot.  We keep asking ourselfs What is that?  The light got dimmer, then brighter, then dissapeared.  There was now nothing but pitch black behind these trees now.  I called the airport for aircraft in our air at that time, none. We seen it come up behind the trees, but it dissapered in one spot.

It appeared trough the trees as the moon or another form of light. After walking around to get a better view through the trees, we could see the object wasn&#39;t moving much, but the posibility of low flying was out of the question. The object was gold in color and oval in shape. No sound was heard from the object. The light from the object gained and decreased in intensity serveral times, making it hard to see but then popping back up out of no where. Then finally disapating completely, and no trace of the object was visible. The whole sighting lasted for about 2 minutes. The other witness and I then proceeded into her car to try and see if we could see anything departing the area around my house but to no avail.<n>

I am a honest, no nonsense husband and father who was cleaning up outside the house before winter sets in. I happend to look up at just the right time to see a very large and very fast, floresent green object flying north. I only  observed it for a few seconds as it flew through a break in the clouds. I was shaking by the time I got back to the house to tell my wife. It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The object was egg or tear dropped shaped. The green &#34;glow&#34; was surrounded by a bright white &#34;glow&#34;. Both the green and white trailed the object a short distance to form a short &#34;glowing&#34; tail. I was looking NW when I saw &#34;it&#34;.<n>

I work the early morning shift and at this time of year the sun hasn&#39;t risen yet.  I have been watching the sky a lot lately due to some very strange looking airplane lights, we have had a great deal of air activity lately.  Anyway, was watching a regular plane flying in the North and then I turned around to take the unleaded gas reading when I looked up and saw an auburn red dot floating across the sky.  At first I thought it was a falling star, because there was no sound, but then it darted to the left, not slightly it was a very fast long movement, and then it just disappeared.  It was very graceful and strange to stay the least.  My descriptions is a single working Mom.  I don&#39;t know if this is something or not, but I hope it helps.<n>

11/21/97 17:00|North Kingstown|RI|Triangle|10sec or less|While driving at dusk my daughter and I noticed an airplaine flying up in the sky w/ it's lights on heading in an easternly dirtection|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02965.html|24|ndxe199711| Summary : While driving at dusk my daughter and I noticed an airplaine flying up in the sky w/ it&#39;s lights on heading in an easternly dirtection to Green Airport.  We were driving on route 1 heading north onto route 4 Just as we came to a location on rt.4 near a combination miniture golf/batters cages/golf hitting range that is when we noticed the airplaine w/ it&#39;s lights on.  In this same are there are no tall trees and the area has a considerable panoramic view.  The air plaine was a couple hundred feet in the air, and I had a view of about  100 to 120 degrees.  A friend of mine has informed that jet airliners go a maximum speed of about 200-250 mph.  I would assume that the airplane was going less than 200 mph if it was heading for a landing at green.  No sooner than I had seen this plane I then saw another plane above the 1st,  it was 2 time the hight of the 1st it too had its lights on and both had a triangular look to then. BUT as I watched both airplane&#39;s the 2nd passed the 1st as if it was standing still.  W/ in  5 seconds it was compleatly out of my sight as it to headed easterly direction. I would estimate that the other plane?!?!? was going about 10 time the speed of the 1st.  Even my youg daughter mentioned &#34;look at that dad&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a back ground in science/natural history.  I have seen the jets at the airshows in the summer at Quonsett base at the old sea-bees base.  The only time I have ever seen them disappeare that fast, they were close to the  ground.  I would estimate that both objects were about 1000 feet to 1/2 a mile away. Since it was dusk and dark I could not see  much except that both had a grey outline and both had their lights on.  dividing my windsheld up into 10 units by the time the 1st airplaine went one unite the second had disappeared.  I would basicly estimate that the 2nd object/plane was going 10 times the speed of the 1st. So if the 1st plane was going about 180 to 200 mph then the 2nd&#34;plane/object&#34; was going about  1800 to 2000 mph or more.  I have never seen a &#34;plane&#34; dissapear from my field of view like that in my life.  I have never seen a ufo in my life but because of the speed that this &#34;plane&#34;  was  going and that it dissapeared out of my viewing area w/in 5 + seconds I thought I should report this. I do not want to leave my name because I have heard about another person who has witnessed triangular and cigar shaped ufo&#39;s here in RI and that this same person who has recorded these ufo&#39;s, has since reported them on line.  I was also told that since this person reported these sightings several months later but use his own computer.  Later I was told that the ufo reporter was literally  visited by people in a white lincoln and the &#39;visitors&#39; were taking pictures of this persons house.  These visitors stoped the picture taking only after having their picture taken by the person who made the ufo reporting.  I was also told that the visitors inthe white lincoln had no plates on it at all, because they had watched it arrive and leave.  In fact on its way in twords this persons house, a cop had stoped the white lincoln and then left the lincoln alone. Depending who these people  in the white lincoln are be it &#34;men in black&#34; or &#34;government military personell&#34; I for one do not want my life subject to what ever hell these people put  ufo reporters through. All my daughter knows of ufo&#39;s is what she saw in the men in black video, I don&#39;t want her or myself subjected to anysort of &#34;interogation terror tactics&#34;.  I asked her about the &#34;fast plane &#34; we saw the previous week and she didn&#39;t remember the sighting that we had made at all. Anon. in RI<n>

Fireball went straight up and then down at high rate of speed.  The Fireball had a long tail of greenish-gold &#34;sparks&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on a couch in front of a fireplace at our family cottage in Cedar River, when I noticed a light moving quickly over my shoulder.  I glanced out of the sliding glass door and saw what I believed to be a green flare shoot up out of vision above the window/door.  A few seconds later this same green ball fell down out of my line of vision.  I jumped up to see if the ball would hit the water, but could see nothing.  It had either not entered the water, or did so before I could stand to see over the back of the couch. This sighting was over the Green Bay of Lake Michigan. Thinking that what I had seen was a distress flare from a boat, I called the local Sheriff&#39;s department to advise the water rescue unit. I was told that there was no green marine flares used and that it was probably fireworks.  A few days later, I had seen a T.V. news story about many such sightnings from Chicago, IL to Green Bay, WI over Lake Michigan. The object was very bright green with a long tail of much lighter green-gold &#34;sparks&#34;.  The fireball appeared to move straight up, but the tail had a slight cork screw type of undulation.  I could hear no sound, but I was inside of a cabin with a radio.  My wife was also with me, but did not turn soon enough to see the object. I saw the same type of fireball two more times that same autumn (11/97) and once again the following year (11/98). Three of the four sightings were of the object shooting up and falling back down, one of the four was only of the object falling.  Because of the windows I was viewing through, I never saw the object reach apogee or fall into the water.  My wife also did see one of the other subsequent objects with me. I am in managment of a small manufacturing company.<n>

I was Driving past there (I was&#39;nt even looking, as I was concentrating on the road) when one of my mates (the one in the passenger seat next to me) said &#34;hey (my name here), what ((deleted--is)) that over there?&#34; I looked and noticed what he was looking at. it looked really strange thats for shure. it was definately a UFO!, I answered my mate and said &#34;it looks like a flying saucer or something!&#34; the whole four of us where looking at this &#34;thing&#34; which was a fat squat cone shaped, obviously a solid metal craft of some kind, and it had a blue light round the edges of it, it also appeared to have windows!, which you could not seem to see because they where black!! (what the hell would you have black windows in a flying machine for) if they where windows that is. the metal of this craft seemed to be a matt creamy fawn color (dont know what the hell sort of metal would be like it to describe in comparison, it is like or looks like, something on Earth we have, but I do not know the name of this metal to say it, sorry) by this time we had pulled over of the road (not to cause an accident if somebody came fast around the sort of bend) we got out of the car to more proper observe this thing, and we said &#34;S--t! it is definately a flying saucer&#34;. we watched in disbeleif and where sort of shocked by this &#34;thing&#34; in the field, and just to shock us more it came over TWORDS US!, and it seemed to have a very powerful throbbing, whirring, high tension e! lectrici ty like sound coming from it. it came very close and hovered, but we had already fraked out and s--t ourselves, got back into the car as quick as hell (because that was too too much we thaught, too freaky!!) but we did not take off immediatly, because as we was starting the car in a blind fluster, the craft moved away sort of in a lifting as it sort of turned (you could tell by the above described &#34;black windows&#34; on the craft that it was also turning, it looked very like a spinning top) way it went over the road and sort of up and over these hills that there is there, and seemed to stop for a few seconds there and then completly disappeared out of sight. we were all quite shaken up and sort of excited by the incedent that just took place, we were talking about it the rest of the night, as we ate dinner, and the whole of next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not report the incedent to anybody, we said &#34;lets not, tell anyone, because people would think we are f-----g nutcases! or being stupid making jokes with people&#34; and besides, I did not ,nor my friends know where to report something of this kind (A bloody real UFO!!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> we didnt see it again, when we drove home to Melbourne a few days later...because we checked out the field....but nothing. part of us wanted to spot it again, and part of us didnt want to see it again…<n>

The object was moving toward Pine Bush NY roughly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved with very little sound, just a whisper of air movement but now large turbine or motor sound. It was dark but there were lights on all three sides of the object allowing to see that there was a center and it was solid not small planes flying in tight formation as the militatry sugests. The duration of the sighting was about one minute. Traffic was slightly heavy for that time of year and I did not have a camera or camcorder with me so pulling over was necessary. This object ot me was not a normal plane or like anything I have ever seen. I am not convinced it was full of little green men (but not oposed) but  it was not a plane or conventional aircraft by both visual or audio recognition.<n>

It was very var away and real high. I was facing Northeast when it appeared it was comeing towards me going toward Mexico. You can see 100 miles from the mountain i was, on it was flying around, well like a bug in the sky i was saying &#34;Man i wish i had my camcorder with me&#34;! The object got almost over my head when i tried to get a look at it with my scope.I had tried earlier but couldn&#39;t stay with it i would lose it because of how fast it was going.This time i could see it better better ,then all of the sudden it spit three little red things out of whatI would call the front of it .Not shot out spitout they dissapeared i never heard even one sound then my feeder went offf . I it scared the shit out of me  i wtched it for another min as it dissapeared towards mexico then shot an eight point.

November 17th 1997, I was watching the Leonids meteor shower on Caldesi Island near Clearwater Beach. When I saw 2 glowing, amber-colored lights to the west out over the Gulf. I pointed them out to my friends but they all just dismissed them as being planes. Until one craft started to get closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One stayed behind, and the other started approaching the shore, where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to just glide right to me. I was so excited that I said to my friends, &#34;this is definitely a UFO&#34;. After I had said this they all took notice and became very scared. It did not take long for the four of them to take off running towards the pier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was about 500 ft offshore when it sent down some kind of light beam that lit up a boat that was anchored right in front of me.But the light only lit in a cylinder and no light anywhere but the tube of light! I was not the least bit worried for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the light beam went off, the entire craft was no longer lit the orange-reddish glow that it was before. It looked as if it was reflecting it&#39;s surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the water and the sky&#39;s reflection on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered above me and I remember feeling as if I was reporting to headquarters, so to speak. My head was tilted back all the way I was looking up at this object telling whoever everything about myself. I have no idea why I was doing this. I was mesmerized. Then I felt like I was given a telepathic message or picture of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 2 beings that were facing each other. They were very tall and dark. My memory of this picture is not very clear. I know I thought they seemed to be some kind of reptilian creature. I really can&#39;t say for sure if they were dark green or black, if they had scales or what. But I do know they had just introduced themselves to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This introduction must have taken some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends had already reached the pier which was very far from where I was. It was about a half an hour to walk that distance. After the encounter ended the craft just headed over the neighborhood, with no sound at all, it was lurking over certain houses, and I decided I needed to follow it. I ran back to where my friends were. Clearwater Police Officers were at the pier, they had also seen this object. They were all discussing what it could be when I showed up. I convinced a friend to come with me, and we followed this thing from Clearwater all the way to Tampa. It was so bizarre. When we were leaving the beach, watching this thing in the sky, was very eerie. It was as if time had stopped for me, like everything changed. My whole world had changed forever. There was not a cloud in the sky and we both followed it to the Courtney Campbell Causeway. Once we were side by side, it started to created a cloud or fog around it, so it became impossible to see it. After about 10 minutes the entire sky was just fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we ended the chase. Even though I still wanted to try to find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had several more encounters with EBE crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two years ago I went to Sedona, Arizona and I saw many in the sky at night. These were blue-ish lights that zipped around really fast, but went right back to where they initially were. I saw them every night for 2 weeks while I was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also in Gulf Breeze and Panama City I have seen interesting lights that hover around like bugs, buzzing back and forth. I go to Gulf Breeze every so often to watch them, but I would rather be with a group! Than to just be by myself...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not want to be afraid of these things. But I really would really like to know what they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most people do not want to talk about this type of thing with me. They will either think you are crazy for talking about it, or they just don&#39;t believe you. So I hope to know more as to what they are and why they are here, and what they want.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I can find some sort of group or research team in this area it would be wonderful. Could you tell me what web sites if any, or meetings, when and where, that would be great!  Thanks so much for your time, ((name deleted))<n>

In the northeast quadrant we saw a bright white object tht caught our eye because it was moving very quickly.  it moved  from the east to the west and stopped on a dime it looked to be enormous and might have been seen from quite a distance .  We pulled the car over and got out to view it better. The object while it was stopped changed from the bright white light  we originally saw changed to a bluish hue.  It looked as though it was hovering over or near EROS Data Center. The cows in the field on the east side of the road seemed to be come nervous and start walking around. The object then darted off at a 90 degree angle and went straight up until it vanished.<n>

I wirled around to see and the light instantly vanished.  There was no sound at all.  Witnesses include, myself, my aunt who lives about 3 houses away, and a friend of my neighbors who lives a few miles away. I never actually saw the craft, it vanished AS SOON AS I TURNED AROUND (like it was watching me) I got the description from my aunt. The following night, I was walking down our hallway with the lights of, just in the dark, when the whole hallway lite up bright red, then whent to a dark blood red.  At first I thought it was the tail lights to a car, but it wasn&#39;t.  I also was frozen in the position I was in.  I have told myself before if anything wierd like this happens I&#39;ll go investigate, walk around, etc, but I couldn&#39;t it was like I was frozen.

I attempted to take a picture with a disposable camera but it was useless. these glowing sphere&#39;s were not emitting light around them but were yet glowing...they were definatly higher than anything that could have been a structure. They were glowing amber/yellow and when they disapeared they were just gone..you could have seen the sphere&#39;s still in the sky if the lights had just been turned off, but they were not there when they appeared to implode into themselves and disappear. Then a trucker stopped thinking we might need assitance, he asked us what we were doing?... we told him we were watching those lights but when we turned to point them out they were gone again. The trucker said that there was a military base in that general direction and with that I decided we needed to move on before we trolled up a cop. we then left and they never reappeared to us again.

It was not moving and seemed to be at the same distance the whole time.  At one point it turned into a  bright orange ball the same size as the bight ball of light. Then a few minutes later back to the bright ball of light. I watched for about 25 minutes altogether.  Finally it turned back into the orange ball and quickly got smaller and smaller until it disappeared about 15 seconds later.  Someone told me that the faster it goes from large to small is the rate of speed it is traveling at. I know for sure now that there is something out there.<n>

We listened to Artbell on his AM talk radio.  We just viewed what we thought were UFOs in the bay area and wondered if there was any news about our sighting.  We heard about the 9 PM Oregon, Washington, and Reno sightings of UFOs and this sort of confirmed our sightings and wondered if they were related.  We kept hearing about triangular shaped objects being sited so we were observing the sky.  The moon was unusually bright that morning.  When I got into Reno, I was headed south on Highway 395 toward our destination and I saw three dots of light that was about 30 degrees from the horizon almost directly toward the south.  The three lights looked like stars but were unusually bright.  I have been star gazing for a couple of years since my wife and I have been interested in UFOs.  I&#39;ve witnessed the landing of the Space Shuttle above the skies in Vallejo.  I also saw the Mir streak across the sky one evening when a local newscaster told me when and where to look for the Mir.  I tried to get a better view and get closer to the lights but the three lights moved toward the west and one of the lights went behind Mount Rose near Lake Tahoe.  We went climbing near Mt Rose about three weeks earlier so we were familiar with locations. The strange thing was the exact symmetry of the three points of light from each other as they slowly moved across the sky.  It seemed like they were guided exactly by the movement of the other lights.  We got out of the car and I took photos and I&#39;m not sure if they will come out.  I should get the photos back on Tuesday.  As my wife and I looked at the two lights as they hovered behind Mt Rose, the right most light flared up in brightness and appeared like it got brighter, then suddenly dimmed.  The lights appeared to me to about 100 miles south west of Reno, somewhere above the Sierras in California.  It could be deceiving and the objects even further out like hundreds of miles.  It is hard to tell unless someone triangulates the movements as I described them.  Now my wife and I and the kids are convinced that we are not alone in this galaxy.  The numerous reports of triangle shaped objects may have merit If I am correct, the object could be miles across and may be cloaked.   The tips of the triangle are the size of stars to throw off our perception and blend in with the stars at night.  Without a telescope, it was difficult to determine if  these were craft that were navigating and controlled by equidistance between each other or one huge vessel. We were excited and contacted the local TV news stations but no one called us back.  You are our only hope to describe this UFO.  Please advise what to do next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Project Manager working for ((Name deleted)) Corp and have a scientific background.

From my perspective, it was consistent with the theory of space junk burning on re-entry.  I say this because about 100 initial lights gradualy faded out until only the few brightest remained, and they too faded. Some other observations: * I saw point-lights only, without 2 dimensional shape * Multiple colors, blues, reds, golds, and whites * Two major clusters, the larger one above the smaller * Parallel, straight line path, of all lights, no relative lateral motion between the lights, but some traveled faster than others. My advice to folks who want to label this an object of extraterrestrial origin:  Better make sure your theory holds that the object burned up.<n>

(203?) There were two parallel primary bright objects with multiple bright objects following, much like one would expect of a comet or a shooting fireworks display. The tails were reddish in color extending quite far behind and again moving parallel. Low on the horizon the tails were perhaps the width of my palm (4&#34;) at arms length. The tails seemed to get shorter as the objects moved toward us. The objects were moving very slow, about the speed of a plane about to land, from a West-Southwest to a East Northeast direction. It seemed to come over Tiger or Cougar Mountain and disappear just to the north of Mt. Si.  They started very low on the horizon and moved up and over my shoulder. I had the distinct impression that I was watching something burning up.  My comment was it looks like a sattelight breaking apart and burning up, but again it was very low on the horizon. The tail was reddish but gave the feel of a headlight piercing fog.  However the sky was exceptionally clear. Observer(s): Male 48, Female 45, two children 13 and 11.

One of those 3 lights seemed to be a bit bigger and brighter than the other two. They each had these &#34;tails&#34; that were golden, and came out of those front lights like perfect rectangles!  I mean, the tops and bottoms were a perfect straight line, and there was golden glittery stuff in them.  The &#34;glitter&#34; was of different sizes, too.  Not all the same size.  And NO glitter was outside of those rectangles!  They were cruising right along, but not zipping by.  They were absolutely silent.  They followed the contour of the land.  It seemed they were about a mile away from us (very hard to judge), so taking that into consideration, with my hand as a guide, I&#39;d say they were about 6&#34; above the horizon.  The first two were overlapping each other, but the 3rd, and smallest, was behind a bit.  I could se! e it more clearly.  I thought about reporting it, but didn&#39;t know who to call!  Then, as one of the women was driving home, she heard on the radio that there&#39;d been sightings all the way up to Seattle!  The Oregonian tried to say it was &#34;Space Junk&#34;. A rocket!! Ha!  There is NO way that was either one!!  It was incredible.<n>

I|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02918.html|63|ndxe199711| I live on Burnaby Mountain and noticed a large, well lit flying wedged shaped object flying very low over my house without any noise. It was flying at a fast and consistant pace, heading towards the North East. It startled me as I caught a glimpse of it from my bedroom window, as it&#39;s unsual to have jets fly that low over my house and usually there is the accompanying sound. There were many lights outlining the wedge shape. They seemed to be about the same brightness although some appeared to be reddish while others blue. It is hard to describe something that is so unusual, as I don&#39;t have any frame of reference for it. It definitely appeared to be travelling similar to aircraft, as it travelled in a consistent and fluid manner towards the northeast and out of sight within a minute or so. I was listening to the radio at the time and heard the announcement that some space debris had been reported flying over the lower mainland. While listening to the Art Bell show on Sat. Nov! 22, it was requested that anyone who had a close view of the object send in a report. I hope that this report will be helpful. I am curious as to why the media reports stated that the debris fell into the pacific ocean, as the object was heading away from the ocean?<n>

There were approx 16 lights/fireballs that were twisting and turning in 2 parallel lines that resembled a BI Plane.  The size was massive and as the lights spun around, they emitted a white flame with orange red smoke.  Some cars on the freeway pulled over but I was too mesmerized and stunned. They were slow moving and were visable for at least 3 minutes.  After they had passed, I drove through a magenta fog for approximately 1 mile.  It was beyond comprehension.  2 and half hours after the sighting, I experienced severe stomach cramps which resulted in projectile vomit of ten feet.

My wife ((deleted)) was in the hot tub outside at the time and my four sons and myself were inside the house.  My wife appeared at the front door very excited/frantic calling for us to come outside.  When I got outside she pointed to the northeast and sad in a load voice &#34;Whats that!!&#34;  I didn&#39;t answer her at the time because I was in awe of what I was seeing.  My 12 year old son ((Name deleted)) and my 16 year old son ((Name deleted)) had also come outside with me and were witness to this event as well.  My wife was viewing this object for about 1 to 2 minutes before she summond me.  During this time the object looked very different.  She described it a appearing as a white ball with flames or trails of sparks shouting out behind it.  When I first saw it the object was travelling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300 to 500 feet above the ground.  The object was large (about the size of a football field) and appeared to be translucent.  Weather at the time was extremely clear with the tempe! rature between 35-40F.  Multiple lights surrounded the perimeter (reddish/orange) and varied in intensity.  The dark outline of the superstructure could be seen outlined by the lights.  Object was 200-250 yards from our position of observation.  No sound eminated from the object and there was no other noise (cars, planes, stereos, etc.) at the time.  It was very quiet.  Object was pursued in a vehicle but sighting was not regained.  Various news reports speculated that the sighting was due to Leonid Meteor shower or a Russion spacecraft reentering earths atmosphere.  Meteors do not fly subsonically in formation horizontally for 10 seconds.  It was not that.  While there was a Russian spacecraft that did reenter the earths atmosphere and was seen by many people on the west coast at about this time, the reckage supposedly ended up in the Pacific ocean.  The object we saw was traveling northeast,  had a very clear symmetry/structure and was close enough to us for us to  want to p! ursue it.  I have read many books on astronomy and the UFO phenomenon and have worked at The ((Name deleted)) Company for 18 years as a business analyst.  This sighting did not have anything to do with the Leonid meteor shower, Russian space junk or planes flying in formation!<n>

We didn&#39;t know, and we frightened.  When we lost sight of the lights it was not because they dissipated, but rather moved behind some trees and out of our range of vision.  Seemed to move faster than airplane, but much slower than shooting star. Local news is very vauge on what this could have been. Would like to find out more - what are the possibilities?  Wondering if it could have been a natural phenomenon, that no one has considered?  Could it be some military exercise, or experiment?  Mass in sky much larger than could be created by Russian rocket - mass would indicate debris from something the size of Washington State - can&#39;t think of anything man made that could have created that much debris in the sky, with the light so bright, rocket should have burnt out and dissipated.<n>

I could not identify what they were.  At first I thought they were a squadron of helicoptors flying in formation with their lights on.  I immediately pulled over and got out of my truck.  I looked up and saw the mass, moving very slowly to the east.  It looked to be about 3,000 feet off of the ground.  There was no engine noise. It moved at a steady pace until it got to the tree tops to my right(east) and then dissappeared.  I have seen many meteor showers and this was not like anything I have seen in 15 years of living in the desert southwest.  The lights did not arc.  They all moved in unison and steady.  They did not change course.  Today, the official explanation from the Pentagon, is that it was a &#34;Russian rocket&#34; which crashed into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington.  Why was it heading towards eastern Washington?  If it was space junk, it would have had to be enormous.  It covered about 25% of the visible sky. Which makes me think it was lower.<n>

I noticed a cluster of lights in the sky, all of varying size, and all larger than stars.  There were more than five and less than a dozen, but I&#39;m unsure of the exact count.  If I was in fact driving north, then the lights would have been moving from West to East.  I was not the only one on the road at the time, and I know other drivers witnessed the event as well, because many were slowing down and craning their necks.  I also noticed some pedestrians pointing toward the sky in the direction of the lights.  I watched the lights for 10 to 15 seconds before they arced toward the ground as if they were falling, and disappeared behind some trees.  All the lights appeared to be moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  I am unsure of their color, although my initial guess would be white.  Also, my firs! t thought was that the lights were not aircraft lights, as in lightbulbs or some other electrically-produced lights, but were instead produced by flames or heat (which is why I compared them to shooting stars rather than planes).<n>

During intermission to a vaudeville show at Hokum Hall in West Seattle, the entire audience and some performers went outside onto the front patio and steps to enjoy the brisk still air.  After some time, everyone--all the grandmas and grandkids and moms and supportive West Seattle locals--went back in for the second half of the show...that is, everyone except me and my two freaky friends (one of whom hadn&#39;t finished his cigarette), and my performer friend, who was headlining that night.  After a few more words, my performer friend went inside and there were only the three of us remaining.   We contined to stand on the stairs, staring out into the deep western sky.  On one side of me, Mr. ((name deleted)) dreadlocked-to his-waist I-Do-Magic-with-a-K was still smoking his cigarette while people-cough-when-I-walk-in-the-room Mr. D stood on my other side.  Both D and I shaved our heads then and if you didn&#39;t know us as some of the most gentle folks around you might have been intimidated by our sense of style then, very minimalist, tough guy black leather jackets and boots.  Experienced trippers we, we were all on about 1/4 hit of acid (25mcg) each that night, not enough to hallucinate, just enough to encourage a little synchronicity...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not even a minute had passed after my performer friend had returned to the fold, Mr. ((name deleted)) was speaking as I stared into the night sky, listening intently, while slowly, a pattern of lights in the distant west-northwestern sky &#39;dawned into my awareness&#39;[ital.] exactly in the place I had been staring.  I&#39;m sure we must have all noticed it at pretty much the same time, but I was the first one to interrupt Mikey...&#34;wait, that&#39;s &#39;not normal&#39;[ital.].&#34;  All three of us stood there silent, mesmerized, as the lights moved in formation due eastward in the sky.  They appeared to by flying a little north of us over maybe Everett (about 30 mi. to the north), at the speed and elevation of low-flying aircraft.  What was strange was that each entity was only represented by one light, of the brightness and pale color of a star.  They varied from white into reds and oranges and blues and greens but only as much as a star would.  There were about 13-15 lights all moving precisely parallel to the ground plane in fixed formation.  There seemed to be two lights ahead of the denser cluster.  The quality of the lights themselves did not flicker or vary in constance.  I could tell that the lights did not form the edges of a single entity because you could see the stars behind and between them as they passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the local topography of tall trees and two story houses, we had to hop down the stairs and run north to the intersection and turn right heading east to keep them in sight.  Acid is known for its ability to inspire hallucinations, but I hadn&#39;t been hallucinating at all that night, and was on such a low dose as to not expect it.  Still, I couldn&#39;t believe it and I checked in with my friends as we ran. &#34;Are we hallucinating?  Is this a collective hallucination between the three of us?&#34;  They both had similar thoughts about low doses and hallucinations and it is also extremely rare to hallucinate the SAME THING as two other people simultaneously.  Still, we wanted to double check and so when we saw this black gentleman, apparently a local, on the street, we stopped and asked him, &#34;Do you see THAT?!&#34;  He was staring at the lights but he said nothing, he only looked down for a moment and shook his head.  We took that as a &#34;yes&#34; and kept on running, keeping the moving light formation in sight.  Finally, as the light formation glided eastward, approaching a position northnortheast of us, it moved behind an extra tall tree on our block and we lost sight of it for a moment.  As the two leading lights emerged the trailing light formation no longer followed.  In the same way that the lights had dawned into my awareness, I watched the remaining two &#39;dawn out of my awareness&#39;[ital], right before my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wow.  We were silent.  We walked about two blocks or so back to Hokum Hall.  I always remembered the entire event taking about 30 really long seconds but there&#39;s a probability of it having been more like a minute and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we walked back up the stairs, an eerie airy haunting tonal music wafted out of Hokum Hall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stepped into the midst of the second half of the vaudville show and sat down as unobtrusively as possible.  Mr. ((name deleted--2nd musician)) was playing his glass armonica, one of only six in current existence in the entire United States, an invention of Benjamin Franklin banned in the early 1900s on the belief that it awakened the spirits of the dead.  Crystal bowls of increasing diameter turned together on an axis as Mr. ((2nd witness)) touched his moistened fingers to the rims, playing it like a piano.  The sound was hardly like that of a piano however.  Sonorous sirens, otherworldly, perfect music to commemorate my first UFO sighting.  I felt strangely honored to have witnessed the event, one of three in a crowd of 60 who narrowly missed an opportunity to see what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shared this experience with a lot of people in Seattle in the days that followed; with my friends, with people in my local coffee shop, with my fellow bus riders.  Folks told me that it was on the TV and on the radio the night of the occurance.  I found the event reported on the front page of the Seattle Times and PI the following day, but after that, there was no mention of it to be found anywhere.   I was surprised by how many people, once I shared my UFO experience, in exchange told me stories of UFO sightings and alien encounters they had had at some point in their life.  Surprised especially by the ones I had known for years who had never mentioned it.  &#34;Some people think you&#39;re crazy,&#34; they&#39;d reply, &#34; so I don&#39;t talk about it much.&#34;  When I told my friend who shares my sun and moon sign (Aquarius and Virgo respectively), she said that she witnessed it also, only from a downtown location.  From her more northerly location, (for you out-of-towners reading this report, West Seattle is actually SW of downtown by about 5-8 mi.), she was able to she the shape of the formation--two &#34;V&#34;s.  &#34;Like geese,&#34; she said.  This correlated precisely with what I had seen, with the two lights out ahead and a greater cluster following behind.  Just like the lights had disappeared behind a tree for me, for her they disappeared behind a skyscraper.  In the same way--two lights remaining, then winking out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a B.A. in English/Professional Writing from the University of Puget Sound.

An enormous craft moved slowly across the sky from west to east.  It looked like a double decker ocean liner with two rows of compartment windows running down its entire length and a string of small lights across the bottom which &#34;ran past each other as some moving holiday lights appear to do.  At the time, official sources poo-pooed it as &#34;falling space junk&#34;, but the object was a unified and coherent field which moved in a straight line across the sky.  I described the object to an insomniac friend who a month or two later saw what I described on an early morning program.  It had been photographed moving across another state (Utah??) The official report this time was falling weather balloons.  I was in a car headed uphill with an unrestricted view of the night sky as it moved slowly across the sky.  We tried to follow it and encountered many others, especially in the kenmore school parking lot who were also watching it. There was radio discussion about it, but I didn&#39;t catch any TV or newspaper coverage at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report alludes to the event witness over Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta on Friday night, November 14, 1997.  We have entered that date here.  The event may have been precipitated by a re-entering  Russian &#34;Proton 2&#34; rocket casing, but other data in our possession seem to militate against this possibility.  Please see other reports about this event.  PD))<n>

11/14/97 18:35|Dallas/Ft. Worth (Approaching)|TX|Formation|35-45 minutes|Saw strange lights above high clouds from an American Airlines flight into Dallas Ft Worth|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02882.html|85|ndxe199711| Summary : Saw strange lights above high clouds from an American Airlines flight into Dallas-Ft Worth<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing you because of something I saw (along with a friend) while flying into Dallas Friday evening.  The more I have thought about this the more I knew I should write down what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying from Seattle to Dallas on Flight 18 Friday Nov. 14th.  At about 6:35-6:45 P.M. Dallas time, about a half hour out of Dallas/Ft Worth we were high above thick cloud cover.  There was a full moon out and the clarity above the clouds was good.  As we looked out ahead and to the east (port side of the aircraft),  I noticed few lights out ahead of us.  I presumed they were other aircraft coming right at us since the lights did not blink like wing lights but as the head lights do at times.  There were two such lights and they looked far off but being at night it was hard to tell just how far.  I watched for a long time watching other aircraft with blinking strobe lights passing in various directions.  These lights (the identifiable aircraft with blinkers) were much smaller in size to the constant lights.  What started to seem strange was the fact that the original two lights which were constant began to appear to be closer the nearer we flew, not farther apart as it should be is! we were approaching them.  Also what seemed strange was the fact that at no point did there appear any other lights such as a green (starboard) or red (port) lights with these two constant lights.  I watched intently as I saw a normally lit and identifiable aircraft fly perpendicular to the main light on my left that I had been watching.  The identifiable aircraft approached extremely close and behind this light.  The light was not a distant star or light on a hill or a beacon as my mind raced to start to explain what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time span now is maybe 15 full minutes of watching these lights. We were approaching these lights which was apparent since the lights were now directly to the port side of the aircraft and no longer in front of us.  As we continued on, and our approach to Dallas caused as to slightly alter our approach, these lights became directly to port from us and even closer and seemed to rise higher above the cloud layer than before. I had mentioned the lights to my companion several times since I first spotted them when I had described them first as two aircraft with their  headlights on.  At this point I saw a third light low in the cloud cover below these two lights.  This third light was hazy as if slightly in the clouds and also seemed larger and closer to us.  It had shape to it, almost like it was like a soft cube shape (a cube with rounded corners and puffed up sides.  It was not just light). I was seriously questioning that these lights were anything I had seen before.  I had made! several comments to my friend trying to explain what I was seeing since I knew they were not aircraft like &#34;these have to be beacon lights&#34; or &#34;maybe they are power lines&#34; always to be followed by, &#34;but we are too high for that&#34;.   I said to my companion that she should look at the lights. Right about then, I leaned back as we passed the lights.  My companion leaned over me and looked now back slightly aft and to port through the windows and said to me &#34;You mean those lights that look like a triangle?&#34;.  I looked out the window again and now saw that indeed there was three distinct lights, not blinking above the cloud cover in a triangle formation.  The third light had indeed come out and was well above the clouds.    As we continued to move towards Dallas and begin our decent, the lights remained in a triangle formation eventhough we continued make a left turn towards the Dallas/Ft Worth airport. In other words, even thought they were in a triangular formation while we looked at them to port, they remained in a triangular formation as we viewed them to aft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes we were descending into the clouds and I lost sight of the lights.   I have thought a lot about what I saw and discussed it with my companion who also saw them.  These were stationary lights at our altitude during normal flight approach about 35-45 mins out of Dallas or slightly higher (with the exception to the third light) which would put them at  least 25-35K feet.  The lights were stationary since while we approached they were in front, as we continued they were to the port and then aft of us as we passed.  There were initially two constant lights very far apart when first viewed and only slightly brighter and very much closer to each other 30 minutes later when joined by the third light from the clouds. the lights did not seem to move but were stationary though they must have moved since they were closer to each other after viewing them for 30 minutes than at first.   I am a 42 yr old businessman in Seattle (your town).  I work as a real estate broker.  I was a concert promoter for many many years and have flown hundreds of thousands of miles.  I have a good grasp of astronomy and can identify the moons of Jupiter with my binoculars and Venus along with my favorite constellations.  I grew up with a pilot as y best friend and have logged hundreds of right seat flying in small aircraft so I have an appreciation for what aircraft look like at night and during the day.  Though I do listen to Art Bell and have read many books on Roswell and a few about other UFO&#39;s, I am not a &#34;believer&#34;.  I am a curious observer.  With thousands of hours of staring at the skies, of flying all over this country many times over during night and day, I have never seen anything that wasn&#39;t identifiable, at least after 5-10 minutes of viewing.  These objects were viewed by me for nearly 45 minutes non-stop and I have no explanation that meets any test I put to it.  I have replayed the tape in my head over and over.  I keep seeing the aircraft passing behind the main left light.  I keep seeing the two lights far apart and them seeing the triangle shape after the appearance of the third.  I see the third boxy light shrouded ion the clouds then see it clearly in view above the clouds.  These objects had to be moving, but in such a way that they seemed stationary. There were no additional lights associated with these white lights. there were no strobes with these lights.  While other aircraft came and went from Dallas and appeared across the sky, these lights seemed to sit still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to finally admit I saw something strange and unexplainable with my resources. I guess in a way, I wanted to live in denial that I saw anything weird at all, but in the end, had to write this down and send it off as a statement of my very best recollection of what I saw.   My companion is a person who works for the airline, does not wish to be involved but has flown extensively for the last 5 years in her porfession<n>

Just as I had reached the top of the hill and was leaning against the corner of the building, I happened to look NorthEast and saw a small triangular object rise straight up, out of the trees and hover for several minutes perfectly still. It slowly moved toward me and being rather frightened at this point ran around the end of the building and ran into on of the three friends I was walking with. The friends, also watching the object and I walked back around the way I had come and watched the object pass directly over our heads. No more than 30-40 feet above us we clearly saw that the object had 3 lights, one at each point. One was red, one was green and the third was either blue or white. There was some conflict to the color of the third light. it made no noise other than of the air moving past it. The object was about 10 feet thick. seeing this we all mutually agreed to keep this incident a secret to all except to a close friend of all of us who wasn&#39;t with us. We decided not to go back into the school immeadiatly; but to discuss it on the playground and clear up who would know, what we would tell and also to clear up details of what had happened before I joined them. In discussing this last matter we discovered we all had the same expierence. On walking back to the school we spotted the object hovering over the absent friends home which was visible from our location. The next day, the absent friend reported nothing strange the night before. Since that time One of My friends and I have seen many of the other objects similar to the first. The fore mentioned friend and I share the symptoms of shaking and nausea when reading alien or UFO related materials and both have the feeling that sometimes there is something watching and getting closer.Sometimes we will have these symptoms simultaneusly.<n>

It did not act like an airplane but before I called my children to come and witness it I stepped out the door and watched it rise rapidly straight up into the air.  I called my four children out to watch with me.  At first we only saw one and then another one appeared over another neighbors house--what really amazed us was how they seemed to be pulsating in a pattern together.  They actually looked like fireworks in the sky when they were doing this.  Everyone I saw who was walking down the street I pointed it out to them--(they thought we were nuts).  I was talking to my Office Manager at work about it off and on while she was at work.  We tried to call the news stations but nobody would listen we didn&#39;t have a video camera so we couldn&#39;t take pictures.  One of the objects stayed pretty low and started heading off behind some trees, we decided to follow after a minute to see if w! e could still see it.  It was in a holding pattern over a main street, it stayed there for at least 20 minutes then  it took off it made other planes in the sky look as if they were standing still. One of my children wrote about it in her journal right away but I held off until Sunday.  It was a wonderful and exciting sight.  I was really upset that nobody would listen to us in the news media and when the news came on later we heard it was &#34;space junk&#34;, Who are they trying to kid?<n>

At|9/13/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24950.html|91|ndxe199711| We had just pulled onto Interstate 5 from leaving Corvallis when we saw these three amber/orange lights hovering above the freeway.  At first we thought we were seeing street lamps or something, but when we realized that we were about to pass underneath them we pulled over immediately.  The sky was full of clouds which gave us a good idea of how low they were, and the wind was blowing fierce enough to push anything around that might have been floating...but these things weren&#39;t moving at all.  We couldn&#39;t believe that nobody else was pulling over to watch these things.  There was a trucker about 100 yards ahead of us that had pulled over, but that was it.  Eventually, two of the lights moved off to the right over a field while the other one remained stationary over the interstate (we were in the south bound lanes by the way).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two lights began moving over this field they began dropping some kind of glowing red objects.  The objects would fade out before they hit the ground but they continued to drop them at a rate of about 2-3 per minute and did this for about 10 minutes.  Then they stopped and the one hovering obove the freeway joined them and they moved north and up until they were above the clouds.  That was the most amazing thing I have ever seen and I wish I would have had a camera on me.  All my friends who saw it freaked out to the point of denial, trying to make up excuses as to what they could have been.  One guy even convinced himself that they were parachuters with some kind of fan that kept them aloft and could move them in any direction they desired.  One more detail, there was absolutely no sound coming from the lights.  All we could that night were the freeway sounds and the wind.<n>

They were high up in the sky at about the 10-11 o&#39; clock position.  They were moving about the same speed a satellite would appear to be moving.  They were bright white and moved in a downward westerly direction and then somewhat rapidly dimmed out completely.  Then I noticed a brighter star about a full moons distance away from the last position of the other two.  This was was much brighter and slowly moved in a downward westerly direction and it also slowly dimmed out and dissappeared.  I made a few calls to 911 and the FAA and no one had hear anything about this sighting.  I then called the King 5 TV news tip line and talked to a lady who said that they were just starting to recieve calls about some weird lights in the sky. She contacted me later in the evening -9:30pm- and told me that qiute a few people called in to report this.  They were unable to come to any conclusions as to what this may have been.<n>

Came very very close.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21011.html|93|ndxe199711| The object was the size of a basket ball. Cotten white in color. Came very very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I might be able to account for this story, but feel I should tell it so that others might have a comparison if they encounter the same event and yes it is very odd to witness this phenomena. This event took place on Rampart lake located just outside of Divide Colorado. I was accompanied by my brother and a cousin .  The event took place as the sun was setting but being down between two mountains you can’t see the sunset but you can notice the light of day fading.As, it grew darker and cooler the lake was cooling fast and thus causing a very thick layer of  fog to form  across the full breast of the lake. We all were standing at the lake edge chatting and waiting for our wives to arrive and pick us up after a day of fishing. I noticed a subtle white ball of light over the water and out in front of us. It appeared to be about 60 yards or so away from us. The funny thing was that the fog was really getting thick and visibility over the lake was only about 4 feet or so. But yet this light could be seen moving in an arc. The ball of light would move about in a 90 degree arc or so. At first we thought it was a light from a boat however, this was not the case. The object then moved directly at us doing about 5 miles an hour or so. It got so close at this point,I would say no more then 12 feet or so. The light was about the size of a basketball. At this point we all was getting a little concerned about our visitor. Now, this event so far has been going on for about 15 minutes or so and we have been discussing and detailing the event the whole time. As we all was very curious but trying to remain calm and for me this was a chance to really take in and understand the event.  Now, this object was about 7 or so feet away at this time and hovering above the water at about 12 feet up and 7 feet or so out. Now at 7 feet, this was a little to close. So with this being the case, I could clearly sum up that the object was indeed no boat. So I picked up a rock through it right at the object.I did this several t! imes and came very close if not hitting the light. This action had no effect on the ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But not long after throwing the rocks at it and by the way keeping my cousin from shooting it with his pistol. I knew he had it the whole time. I was sure it was not man made but I didn’t want to make a bad mistake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball light object next slowly withdrew in the same arc as it arrived and that was that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What do I now believe it was?  Not ball lighting that I am sure of.  We came back to the lake the next day And I took a stock of the lake and noticed an aspect of the layout of the lake and roads coming into the lake. I noticed that there was a road on the other side of the lake. It was about a half mile or so directly in front of the lake and had about 45 degree turn and was about 30 yards from the lakes edge. Now, grant it that is really some distance away from where we had been standing. But I now believe that even though the fog was thick and we could not see far at all, a car turning that corner with the brights on could shine into the dense fog, it’s at this point that the phenomena occurs. The fog was able to condense the light beams and merge them together at just about right in front of us and above the lake at about the same height as the road is above the lake some half mile or so in front us.  Now, I know this does not account for the period of time in which we saw this event about, 20 minutes in all. I can say that maybe the car parked on that corner and then backed away accounting for the arc exit of the light. Or, the car had passed but the condensed fog was able to absorb the light. Which, then continued to break the light apart over and over. Next,it was then picked back up and then amplified just like the intensifier tube would do for a night vision scope.<n>

I&#39;VE SEEN UFO&#39;S ON TWO SEPERATE OCCATIONS, DRIVING FROM LOS VEGAS TO LA AND AT MT RAINEER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> LOS VEGAS.......IT WAS ABOUT NINE PM AND I WAS TRAVELING WITH ONE OTHER FRIEND WHO WAS DRIVING.  HEADING TO WHAT I THINK WAS THE SOUTH I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT TO THE WEST OR RIGHT OF THE VEHICLE OVER THE MOUTAIN RANGE.  REMAINING STILL FOR A MOMENT THE LIGHT MOVED, PARELEL TO THE GROUND,  QUICKLY TO THE NORTH WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MILES AND THEN TWICE THE DISTANCE TO THE SOUTH AFTER WHICH IT RETURNED TO WHAT SEEMED TO BE IT&#39;S ORIGINAL LOCATION.  AFTER REMAINING STILL FOR ANOTHER MOMENT THE LIGHT SHOT STRAIGHT AWAY AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE DISTANCE. THE ENTIRE SIGHTING ONLY TOOK A FEW SECONDS.  I WAS SHOCKED, DUMBFOUNDED AND UNABLE TO SPEAK OR LOOK AWAY DURING THE INCIDENT, AFTERWHICH, I WAS ABLE TO MURMER TO THE DRIVER, &#34;I JUST SAW A UFO.&#34; MT. RAINEER.......A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER THE VEGAS SIGHTING TWO FRIENDS AND I WENT CAMPING AT HUCKLEBERRY CREEK NEAR WASHINGTONS MT. RAINEER NATIONAL PARK.  IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK IN NOVEMBER AND THE TRIP WAS SPONTAINIOUSLY PLANNED BY MY FRIEND ((name deleted)).  MY BEST FRIEND ((name deleted)) HAD AGREED TO JOIN US THOUGH HE WASN&#39;T THE OUTDOOR TYPE.  WHILE I WAS TALKING TO ((name deleted)) ON THE PHONE,  WAITNG TO BE PICKED UP, A YOUNG MAN RODE BY ME IN FRONT OF MY APT.  HE TURNED AROUND,RODE BACK TO ME AND ASKED IF HE COULD USE MY PHONE EXPLAINING THAT HE HAD JUST ESCAPED FROM WESTERN STATE HOSPITAL. SURPRISED AND SLIGHTLY HUMORED, I COULD SEE THE FEAR AND HONESTY IN THE BOYS EYES AND I INVITED HIM IN. HE CALLED HIS MOTHER, WHOM I SPOKE WITH BREIFLY, AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT I WOULD BRING THE BOY TO HER AND SHE WOULD RETURN HIM TO THE HOSPITAL THE FOLLOWING MORNING.  MY FRIENDS ARRIVED TO PICK ME UP AND THE ((name deleted)) RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO TAKE THE BOY TO HIS HOUSE IN SPANAWAY WHICH WAS ON OUR WAY FROM LAKEWOOD TO THE MOUNTAIN.  WE DROPPED THE BOY OFF AND CONTINUED ON OUR WAY. AFTER LEAVING ENUMCLAW, WHICH IS THE LAST TOWN BEFORE YOU HEAD INTO THE FOOTHILLS,  THE ROAD WAS EMPTY. ATER DRIVING IN THE DARKNESS FOR SEVERAL MILES WE NOTICED A FORMATION OF LIGHTS ABOVE US AND MOVING WITH US.  THERE WAS NO SOUND AND THE LIGHTS,  WHICH SEEMED TO BE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US,  FORMED A SIMILAR PATTERN TO THE ONES SEEN IN PHEONIX AND CONTINUED TO TRAVEL ABOVE US.  I REMEMBER LOOKING UP TOWARD THE LIGHTS SEVERAL TIMES AFTERWHICH WE ALL EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF TIME AND MEMORY.  I START HAVING FOGGY MEMORIES AFTER WE HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE CAMP GROUND. I DON&#39;T REMEMBER ARRIVING OR SETTING UP CAMP ONLY TAKING A COUPLE OF DRINKS OF LIQUER WE HAD BROUGHT WITH TO NUMB THE COLD WEATHER AND PASSING OUT.  THE NEXT MORNING WE ALL AWOKE AT THE CRACK OF DAWN.  WHILE LIGHTING THE CAMPFIRE, THREE ARMY HUMMERS STORMED INTO OUR CAMP GROUND AND CAME SKIDDING TO A HAULT.

There were trails, but I believe the trails were caused by the objects moving so rapidly. This is to corroborate ((Name deleted)) experience on the same date (11/10/97).

Perfectly clear sky no moon.  Just to the north I saw a very thin white curved line appear, moving in a southern direction.  The line was so thin I could hardly see it.  It looked kind of like a curved bolt of lightning. Following the line was a object blacker than the night sky.  The line started to fade away until it was completly gone.  I could still see the black object moving slowly, against the stars that would disappear then reappear.  Just before it past over the trees the lights from the city reflected off of it.  It had a brown tint, and the front edge was almost white.  I saw no flashing lights or other elumination from the object, only the reflection of the city lights. The shape was triangular but closer to what the stealth bomber looks like.  I thought it might have been the stealth bomber but the speed seemed to be to slow for its altitude and size. There was no sound.  It was about 200 feet from the ground so, if it was a jetplane, I definatly would have heard some noise.<n>

We have seen this once before in the same spot in the sky in late July. Of the two ships one was really bright and one was not very bright. The bright one was glowing a hot white color, and when viewed with binoculars, it had what appeared to be two rocket boosters, which were tapering off in width, and where at about a 120 degree angle from eachother.  Also a white hot ring seemed to be floating around the ship.  Sort of like some sort of force feild.  The smaller ship was keeping a constant distance from the brighter bigger ship. Like it was bing controlled by it. The strangest and weirdest thing thathappened though was this bright band of light that crossed the sky. It was like a twisted plane or ribbon, twisting at the left, and then ging straight across the sky.  Then at the right side or the end of it it looped and went up.  Then it dissapeared. &gt;From the beginning of the sighting to the end, the brighter ship moved down and over a little to the right. The smaller ship seemed to move a lot more.  Then about an half hour later, the ribbon instantly vanished.<n>

A nova star? Perhaps it was the planets aligning that night? It had teh steadiness of a star or planet but it was very bright. At one point there seemed to be three interior lights, a little less bright. I thought it was my eyes but my wife and two kids saw it too. I went to California a week later and told a friend who said a similar light was reported in Santa Barbara on NOv 15 but it was reportedly a rocket launch. Maybe so, but what I saw was not a rocket launch.<n>

The object appeared to be about 150-200 feet in the air (very LOW). It hovered above a barn in a borderline suburban/rural area. The shell seemed to be made of metal, riveted together (very industrial- looking, Star Wars-like). I did not stop my car but drove to my destination about 3 minutes (1 mile ) from the site.

This part of the country is dessert terrain and on that night the sky was incredibly clear with generous moonlight.However the lights held our attention as they remained stationary in the sky and as we drove it became apparent that we were moving towards them. Our second conclusion was that it must have been the lights on top of a piece mining equipment. It also became apparent that the lights were a lot closer than we had first presumed and as the road made a slight curve within minutes we were driving alongside them. The light formation consisted of 4 vertical rectangular shapes. The rectangle on the far right glowed a constant red while the other 3 alternated in a pulse. Firstly the outer two would pulse white while the inner would remain black/invisible, next it would pulse red while the other two turned black/invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove they remained up on our left not moving in a rock solid position. Our estimate at distance from us would have been 50 feet back from the road and about 50 feet in the air. The length of each rectangle looked about 10 feet long and about 3 feet across. The light given off did not radiate off of any surrounding shrub or the ground and even though the night was clear no shape of any object connected to the light could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were on our direct left we slowed down to about 15Kms an hour as did the car directly behind us (they were the only other car on the road, I wound down my window to look at the lights which kept on flashing and made absolutely no sound. While doing this we passed the roadsign indicating 20Kms to Broken Hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove on to town with the lights remaining as they were. Upon arriving we asked a local his knowledge of any construction or lights in that area to we which he answered no.The next day around midday we returned to the same spot to examine the area but found no sign of anything.<n>

She called for me to come outside and look at somthing.  I went out and watched them for about 5 minutes until the upper two were slowly enveloped in the cloud cover.  I went inside and got my SLR camera &amp; 400mm lens.  I went back out and looked at the remaining light, but the strong lens showed revealed no shape behind the light.  The other two lights now began to emerge from the clouds and the formation of the three was now close to linear and vertical.  I would estimate their distance to be about 2-3 miles.  I couldn&#39;t tell if they were making any sound because a helicopter was hovering 1.3 miles to the west, over the football stadium.  The orange lights had no accompanying aircraft-style strobes or red/blue positioning lights.  They did not move constantly, as a sattelite would and! the cloud cover was dense enough to obscure anything that high or faint.  I am 34 and I am quite familiar with the way civil and military aircraft move.  These lights moved similarly to helicopters, but had no regulation lights and didn&#39;t generate the sounds that a group of 3 military helicopters would make.  I asked a neighbor to look at them.  He did, but looked for 3 seconds, said &#34;Oh, airplanes&#34;, and went back inside. I was looking for film inside for 2 minutes and when I went back outside, the 3 lights had vanished.<n>

I was apparently awakened by the noise too, but did not fully gain full consciousness until it ceased and so I did not know what it was that had woke me. My wife walked into my daughters room and they both listened to it together. The sound seemed to move from above the house from the east and moved slowly over the house and then more quickly away from the house toward the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not post this account in 1997 because I had already posted another account about a UFO and felt that it would sound unbelievable that so many events were happening to us. But I recently noted another person’s account on this site about a like event at 3:50 AM on 11/7/04 in Ashburn, VA. Our account was much like that one except we saw no special light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However on 11/9/97 (a few days after the first event) my wife was woke out of sleep by a light shining in her face – but this time with no noise. Also, later on, a small lamp in our room came on by itself and caused her to wake up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I found interesting is that from 11/2/97 till 11/7/2004 is 7 X 366 days. And from 11/9/97 until 11/7/04 is 7 X 356 days.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Vanished after 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were lying on our backs on the top of our condo watching the stars and satellites. We both saw this object, with the shape of a foot-long ruler heading directly north up the coast.  It seemed to be semi-transparant, that is it appeared to be a bit fuzzy, although the edges were sharp.  There were 4 glowing spots (not blinking) arranged evenly accross bottom. I say glowing spots, rather than lights, because they appeared similar to glow-in-the-dark luminescent spots. The object was either very high and extremely fast or else low and with a reasonable speed, but totally silent. It completely and suddenly vanished after about 15 seconds. We couldn&#39;t sleep that night;-) I have e-mailed a PhotoShop reconstruction of the object.<n>

WHEN I DROVE OFF THE HIGHWAY ONTO CASTLEHILL AVE. TWO MINUTES LATER WHILE DRIVING ON CASTLEHILL AVE. I D HEARD AND THEN OBSERVED AN AIRPLANE FLY ACCROSS (HEADING NORTH) THE SKY. FAR BEHIND THE AIRCRAFT I SAW THREE VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS  FLYING TOWARDS THE AIRCRAFT AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED EVENTUALLY CATCHING UP TO THE AIRCRAFT AND PASSING IT.  THE THREE LIGHTS WERE STEADY AND DIDN&#39;T BLINK, BUT I OBSERVED THEM SWITCH POSITIONS TWICE. THEY CONTINUED TO FLY ACCROSS THE SKY VERY FAST. AT THIS POINT I HAD DRIVEN A COUPLE OF MILES ALONG A STRETCH OF LONELY DARK ROAD TRYING TO KEEP THE THREE LIGHTS WITHIN MY VIEW. EVENTUALLY THE SITE OF THE THREE LIGHTS DISIPATED INTO THE CLOUDLESS NIGHT SKY.<n>

11/1/97 18:50|Doniphan|MO|Fireball|2 min.|2 fireballs fall from sky and light up surroundings|10/15/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25328.html|120|ndxe199711| 2 fireballs fall from sky and light up surroundings<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened while my brother and I were sitting in the family room watching wheel of fortune, this room has a sliding glass window which faces north, and I had the seat on the other side of the room, so I could see out the door and up a narrow field, which is about 1/4 of a mile long by maybe 250 ft wide. There is a vacant house and a barn used for storage at the end opposite of where we observed. All land is owned by us. It was about half way thru the show, when I yelled to my brother to &#34;look at that&#34;! He was in the couch , so he had to lean way over to see it. I had seen 2 deep red balls of light fall from the sky,about halfway up the field, one right after another, however, my brother had enough time to get up and witness the second ball. There probably was only a 2 second delay between them.They seemed to &#34;burn out&#34; about 50 ft above the ground. They were maybe 3 ft across, just guessing. Not large at all. We immediately went upstairs to the 2nd floor to the balcony which overlooks the field. My other brother, who was in his bedroom, joined us, we watched and saw the entire area by the old house light up with a bright white light, We could see the tops of trees,and the roof of the house, almost like someone had shone a spotlight on them, But there wasnt a beam of light, things just &#34;lit up&#34; like it does when there  is lightning. But it was perfectly calm that night.After about 20 seconds, it died out.Not a sound was made. I drove up to the old house with a camcorder, but  nothing at all happened again that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the closest experience Ive had with these things. However, lately, these bright red, and sometimes orange orbs have been making loud noises, much like fighter jets do when they fly close to the ground, and the noise starts and stops very abruptly. The noise is usually accompanied by glowing red balls flying above the tree line, which stop, ascend, descend sometimes making noise, most of the time not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing Ive noticed over the years of seeing these lights, sometimes I see what looks like a star, but Im good at telling the difference, because if I keep watching, it stops acting like a star(flashing red, gree, blue, white) and turns into a glowing red ball which sometimes pulsates or fades. Ive seen them start moving, change speed, direction, even split into two or three different balls, then go back together. Some fly pretty close to the house at times.  So what in the world is it that does these things? We can see them almost any given night.<n>

I was looking up in a northerly direction hoping to see some meteors (I think it is the paladies meteor shower?) when a movement caught my eye.  the reason i was able to see this object is that it &#34;blocked&#34; out the starts as it flew directly over me heading south.  The best way I can describe this is that it looked like a bent bowling pin, bent back at the neck.  it had no lights, made no sound.  it took me a few seconds to focus on it, the bottom side was a shade lighter than black, but it was still dark out side, but my impression is is that it did not want to be seen.  it was also very big, how much I do not know but it flew over the last of some rain clouds as I watched it head south.  there were also no small commuter planes around which I noticed the days after are pretty frequent.  I have seen B-2 bombers fly over when backpacking in the sierras, so I have seen a &#34;delta&#34; shaped craft at night and this was not like that.<n>

When i saw this bright light .It first seemed to be going off and back on  andcomeing toward me at a verry high rate of speed. It was verry foggy that morning and as it got closer it seemed even more strange and it was lighting the cab of my pickup almost like day light.I stoped my truck and got out and stood beside as it passed over my head It was verry unusual. It seemed more like it was geting daylight and going dark again and not makeing a sound . When i arrived at the office one of my coworkers wes already there he had seen the same thing .He was in a field beside the road i was traveling on going to his deer stand .He surned around and changed his mind about his hunt .I cant explain it. But it was something verry strange , verry bright and unusual.It lit up the cab of my truck like day time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

WORK THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT AND ENJOY STAR GAZING (FINDING AND IDENTIFYING CONSTELATIONS) WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT FOR MANY YEARS IVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE NIGHT SKY,BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON.I HAVE SEEN SATELIGHTS, COMETS, FALLING STARS AND EVEN SKYLAB WHEN TOLD WHEN AND WHERE TO FIND IT.AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER I AM TRAINED TO BE OBSERVANT AND TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. IN ORDER TO BETTER PROTECT THE PUBLIC. IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1997 (I FORGOT THE EXACT DATE)WHILE ON DUTY I DID OBSERVE A GROUP OF STARS THAT I DID NOT RECOGNIZE, VERY LARGE IN THE NIGHT SKY,FORMING A TRIANGLE.CONSISTING OF THREE WHITE STARS IN THE FRONT AND TWO RED STARS AT THE BASE OF THE TRIANGLE. I ASKED MY SELF WHAT CONSTELATION IS THAT, NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. THE NEXT THING I OBSERVED WAS THAT THIS (GROUP OF STARS) WAS MOVING. IT APPERED TO BE IN EARTH ORBIT MOVING IN A NORTH EASTERLY DIRECTION. I OBSERVED THIS IN THE SKY FOR 10 MIN. ITS SPEED WAS  CONSTANT (ON THE SLOW SIDE) AND THE TRIANGLE FORMATION NEVER VARRIED. I ALSO LOOKED THROUGH BINOCULARS,HOWEVER THIS DID NOT REVEAL ANY NEW DETAILS.THE NIGHT SKY WAS CLEAR AND I DID OBSERVE THE OBJECT UNTIL IT WENT OVER THE HORIZON. MY THOUGHTS BASED ON MY OBSERVATIONS, MY FRST OBSERVATION THAT THIS WAS A GROUP OF STARS WAS INCORECT BECAUSE THIS OBJECT WAS MOVING. THE FACT THAT WITH A EXPERIENCED EYE FOR STAR GAZING THAT I MISTOOK THIS AS A CONSTELATION REVEALS ITS SIZE. IF MY OBSERVATION THAT IT WAS FLYING IN EARTH ORBIT WAS CORRECT THAN THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A MILE WIDE,MORE OR LESS, IT WAS TRULY HUGE. ANOTHER POSIBILTY IS THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN THREE SEPERATE CRAFT FLYING IN PERFECT FORMATION IN EARTH ORBIT,ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE THIS TO ME AT THE TIME,I HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO RULE THIS CONCLUSION OUT. THE FORMATION SEEMED TO ME TO BE TO PERFECT TO SUPPORT THIS CONCLUSION. THE REASON THAT I HAVE REPORTED THIS SO LATE IS I HAVE JUST GOT ON THE INTERNET WITHIN THE PAST WEEK.SINCE I HAVE GOTTEN ON THE INTERNET I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING U.F.O. FILES TO SEE IF ANY ONE HAS SEEN ANY THING SIMILER TO WHAT I HAVE SEEN. I DID FIND ONE WHICH HAPPENED IN RENO NEV ON 11/15/97.WHOEVER READS MY REPORT SHOULD CROSS REFERENCE IT AGAINST TIS REPORT. IF I HAD TO PLACE A DATE ON MY SIGHTING I&#39;AM SURE THAT IT WAS IN NOVEMBER OF 1997 THE DATE WAS SOME WHERE AROUND THANKSGIVING,DEFFINETLY THE LATTER THIRD OF THE MONTH.<n>
11/1/97 01:30|East Troy|WI|Unknown|30 minutes|My daughter was 3 and 1/2 years old at the time this occurred. It was approximately November.

It was approximately November. I arrived home from work at approx 02:30. My wife at the time said &#34;I just got our daughter back to bed&#34;. She was sleeping fine and awoke talking to herself and when my wife went in to check on her, my daughter said that she was taken to a space ship. My wife asked me if I had been letting her listen to Art Bell and we went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up around 06:30 to meet my daughter when she woke up. When she woke up I asked her a series of questions and this is a pretty accurate transcript of our conversation. It&#39;s one I may never forget. Remember she was 3 and 1/2 years old at the time. And she was and still is a fairly bright kid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: I heard that mommy had to come into your room last night. Did you have a bad dream? Her: No, I went to a space ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: What do you mean you went to a space ship? Her: Some aliens came into my room and took me to their space ship? Me: But when mommy came into your room you were sitting on your bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her: I came back by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: How many aliens were there? Her: Three Me: Did you get a good look at them? Her: Yeah Me: Can you draw me a picture of what they looked like: Her: I don&#39;t know how to draw aliens. You&#39;ll have to show me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: Aliens are cool! But I wonder sometimes what they look like. Did you see their hands?.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her: She held her left hand about 8&#34; from the tips of her right hand fingers sort of like an extended &#34;time out&#34; gesture and said &#34;They had long fingers&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: Did they have hands like your hands? Her: No they were skinny and long Me: Did you see their faces? Her: Yeah.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: What did their eyes look like? Her: Big eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: Did they talk to you? Her: Looking confused she finally said yeah Me What did they say? Her: Nothing, they had no mouth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: But you said they talked to you Her: Yeah. I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [I&#39;m thinking telepathy at this point] Me: They had no mouth? Did they have a nose? Her: really little. But they had big heads Me: How tall were they? Her: A little taller than me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: Where did you see them? Her: standing by my closet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: How did you get to the space ship? Her: I don&#39;t know we were just there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: Can you draw me a picture of the space ship? Her: I don&#39;t know how to draw a space ship, you&#39;ll have to show me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: It was dark in your room, was it dark by the space ship too? Her: No it had lot&#39;s of lights, all different colors but they were all on and real bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: Where did you go on the space ship? Her: On a table.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: What did you do there? Her: I just layed there. I was scared to move Me: what did they do? did they hurt you? Her: she repeatedly points at her temple Me: They pointed at your head? Her: No, they poked me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I&#39;m now thinking implant) Me: They poked you? with what? Her: something pointy, right here. And it hurt a little. And she points at her temple again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [I saw no marks of any kind] Me: When mommy came into your room you were sitting on your bed. How did you get on your bed if you were in a space ship? Her: I don&#39;t know. I just floated down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: Did they come back with you? Her: they went back when momny came in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me: I saw an alien in a movie and they were scarey and all different colors and different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She interupts me and says, It hurt a little when they poked me but they were nice. and I think they were green or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked again if she could draw me some pictures and she repeated the I don&#39;t know how you&#39;ll have to show me answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I had a little 3 and 1/2 year old girl who was transported from her bed in the middle of the night to a space ship, implanted and presumably examined, had a conversation via telepathy with 3 aliens who then accompanied her back to her room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And she basicaly shrugged it off like it was no big deal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We figured she did not see any television that day even remotely referring to a space ship or aliens or anything similar. So the question is. Did it happen? Did she have an etremely vivid dream? or?...<n> <n><n> <n><n> She doesn&#39;t remember a thing about this now. She&#39;s 9 and perfectly normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I tried to contact [someone] but had irratically available computer so I couldn&#39;t e-mail or search the internet for UFO sites like yours to properly report this. But I figured you&#39;d find this interesting. So now that I found your site I sent the info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
