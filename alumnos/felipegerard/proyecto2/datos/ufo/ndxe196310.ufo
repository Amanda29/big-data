10/9/63 21:30|Laurel|MS|Oval|7 minutes|1963 sighting of beautiful objects in southeast Mississippi , worth reading|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17331.html|2|ndxe196310| ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1963 sighting of beautiful objects in southeast Mississippi , worth reading<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were seen on a beautiful crystal clear night (with no moon as I recall it). A friend of mine and our dates were &#34;parked&#34; in the country side just to the southeast of our home town in southeast Mississippi. We were facing roughly northeast.  I happened to be looking at the horizon when the first object ascended into view. It was followed by two additional objects of the same apparent shape, size, and color. They appeared dark red when I first saw them, much as the moon does as it first starts to rise. They were in a lazy J formation and flew from northeast to southwest with their closet point at about 2 oclock . As they ascended up from the horizon their color brightened. At their closet point they appeared oval in shape. The outside rim of each object was the purest gold color you can imagine. Think of a simple gold wedding band lit from within. They were gradually brighter toward the center, with the very center being their brightest point. The center was bright white. twinkling like a very large and bright star. They appeared to be three seperate objects. They would black out stars as they flew, and you could see stars between them at the same time. They were silent. I heard no sound. One of the most interesting aspects of this experience was what you felt as you looked at these objects. A feeling of peace and serenity . Strange as it may sound, there was a level of awareness as you looked at the objects. Mutual awareness. Another outstanding charecteristic was the light they emmitted. It was intense but had no glare. It was like you were looking through polorized glasses. It is hard to judge size. If I had to guess i would say that they were at least 50 to 100 feet in diameter. They appeared to be about 80% the size of the full moon in the night sky. As they passed 2:00 oclcck they object that formed the bottom tip of the J suddenly changed directions and flew to the west. They all flew out of sight on those same directions.<n>

I agreed I would not tell anyone until we were out of high school, Hopewell High.  The incident is included in the Amazon e-book, DIVINE CURSES.  Two glowing saucers, one orange(ish) red, and the other, a medium iridescent green, flew down to us from different directions in the night sky.  Both of us were within 20 feet of both glowing saucers.  The green saucer parked itself over a barn full of corncobs and the red saucer parked itself next to it while we walked under the “ships” and watched in amazement.   We lost almost two hours of time and the saucers left only after we had driven away from them. (Later in life, I became a MUFON investigator.)<n>
10/4/63|Millington|NJ|Disk|7 minutes|a pie shaped disc with 2red and 2 white lights closely hovering over neighbors home.|1/22/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34535.html|4|ndxe196310| a pie shaped disc with 2red and 2 white lights closely hovering over neighbors home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived on a small dead-end country road.  My 11 year-old brother and I were going to a local restaurant to pick up my husband, who worked as the manager.  As we reached the bottom of the driveway, we noticed a large disc-shaped object hovering over our neighbor&#39;s home.  It was covering the circumfrence of the house.  It had two large red, and two large white lights along the center of the craft.  No sound emitted from it.  Normally we are both easily scared, but we were both calm, as though it had something to do with how calm we were.  I turned the car off and rolled down the windows so we could be sure to hear for any noise from the craft.  It was so close, any occupants had to be aware of us.  We parked at the bottom of the driveway, just watching it, wondering what it was doing over our neighbors home.  After about seven minutes, it glided up the hill following the road.  We waited a moment or so to be sure it wasn&#39;t going to be waiting for us.  I was concerned that it was going to land at a small airport we had to pass to get to the Old Mill Inn in Basking Ridge, NJ.  It was the only time I experienced an encounter such as that, but it was so close that it is still vivid in my mind.  The unusal thing is both my brother and I were almost wishing while it was across the street, that we could see who was inside the craft.  I had a feeling it was not related to our world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was the same shape as a star and it looked white to me.  I noticed it had moved from left to right in a zig zag direction. I would say if I had my finger up towards the sky it was moving a fingers lent each way.  Clear as a bell this thing moved slowly from left to right about eight times then it stopped and it had zoomed up and had got smallar, and than it zoomed down and was twice the size of the stars and suddenly it shot up into space like a bullit.  Then dissapeared and I now believe in U.F.O s<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>
