A strange sensation was report by female then I felt it too.This started the abduction scenario. I remember very much of it and has thought of it almost everyday since then. It startedf with two of them, then at the ship another was there whose form I saw outlined by a goldish light and he communicated with me by beaming a very bright ultraviolet light. I do not know how we float aboard the ship but I remember come off it with my female friend and it was like walking on something solid that was also transparent. We all spoke of many things some which I remember and other things I cannot fully recollect. They took us some place and showed me some things. One thing they said that really has stayed in my mind. I asked where are you from? The reply was, &#34;How can I tell you where we are from if you do not know where you are at&#34;. They mentioned something about coming from north over Canada and they said something about south. They told me that one of their crafts could take on the entire world, and at that time, I did not know it to be true, but they said that Russia had more milatary might then the U.S. I told them that I was going to tell my people about the incident, and after they made me &amp; my female friend understand, believe, and know to be true, what the ones who I called my people would do to us, after we left them and went to the police station to get help for my car which would not start up, we only laughed when they asked us where we were. Then they asked us where are the two kids who took us into the woods, and we said that we did not know anything about taking two kids into the woods. Later, many years afterwards, I understood that the person who called the police witnessed the abduction. When we repilied to the question, &#34;where have you been?&#34; and we said, in the car. The patrolman replied,&#34;Lt. , I search the car, they could not have been in the car.! We call ed someone from our college, a friend of mines who I transfered to that particular college with, and he came to pick us up. He arrived at the station somewhere near 3:30 a.m.; this person is currently a prosecutor in Newark, NJ,Essex Co. During 1979 or 1980 I underwent hypnosis and began remembering bits and parts of the abduction. On this day I remember so much of it and seem to be even getting more pieces to the puzzle. Here is something that I remember and looked forward to see. I asked would we all be dead by the year 2000; to that question the answer was, &#34;I cannot say&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have written a lot above this section. Here is another part that I remember. The older individual ( about 2500 yrs. old our time) asked me to look into his eyes, and I called him a big eyed ((deleted)) in my mind. As soon as I thought that something hit me in the head very hard. I asked him how did you do that ((deleted)),  because it seems like he never got up from his seat. After that I was his friend. Now here comes another part, I told him that he was not real because I can see the spirit in a person and I saw nothing in him. At that point I saw or felt or sensed the being of a very good person who was very old like 2500 years old. Then I asked them or at least some point in the contact I asked what the universe is like. And a younger one said, it is like your sea. It seemed like he was saying or said that there is life in the universe like there is life in your sea. They told me that the universe has many kinds of spirits, and that there are very high spirits around. That next day or the night of the next day I have come to Jersey City to have my car repaired because it had a warranty (30) days and this was something like the 28th day of having been purchased. A VW and a regulator went or something like that. I also remember we were in this room and it seems like there were 2 or 3 guards watching me, and this other individual like the boss or something came in and said to them why are you anwering his questions, and the rest went something like: &#34;You are not going to remember any of this when you go back&#34; that&#39;s exactly. I replied, oh yes I will.(editorial: I know this seems hard to believe and I&#39;ve confided in some people close to me like my family members, some cousins and close friends but this is what happened). I could tell more but it gets even more incredible so I&#39;m leaving you with what I have given.<n>
3/15/76 12:00|Fountain|CO|Disk||Stationary lit object hovered above trees.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27450.html|3|ndxe197603| Stationary lit object hovered above trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years ago, while driving from Ft. Carson, CO, to a restaurant in Fountain, CO, I remember seeing an object from my car.  It was daylight and clear - The object was saucer-like and appeared to have a couple of tiers or layers, was bright, almost as if a balloon lit from within, but it had separate lights on it.  I was driving east (don&#39;t remember road) on Ft. Carson, and noticed the object as I approached the I-25 overpass.  I was on high ground and the object was low to the horizon on the other side of the interstate.  I snuck glances at it as I drove, being quite taken by it&#39;s presence.  I remember thinking it was probably a balloon for a sales pitch, and I couldn&#39;t wait to go see it.  After I crossed the overpass I couldn&#39;t observe it any longer because of the decreasing road elevation (bad angle) and increasing amount of trees (obstruction).  I did my best to estimate  the point on the ground upon which I thought it was, so I could drive there and see it, but I could never find it.  I was too embarassed to ask anyone at the restaurant.  When I drove back, I u-turned to see if I could see it again, but no joy.  I was very familiar with the area back then, that portion of Carson being mostly high desert, and Fountain being a smallish Army post town where friends lived- I&#39;m sure it is all built up now.  I do not remember the exact time of day, other than I think is was in the afternoon (near meal time).  I don&#39;t remember the time of year, but I suspect it was after January and before July (before my discharge).  I believe it was a weekend, becuase I couldn&#39;t drive to Fountain during the weekday due to my work.  I can&#39;t believe no one else would have missed it.  I was dumbfounded, and to this day wonder what it was.  I never saw it move, never heard anything - it was just a few miles away. I concede it could have been a ballon, but I couldn&#39;t find it. I just found this site, and scanned it hoping to see another report from Carson, Fountain, Colo. Sprgs, or Security, CO. My background then, Army soldier ! / elect technician, now engineer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object moved very, very quickly, and silently. Upon reaching the southern shore of the lake, the object paused. Using binoculars and a 20X-60X zoom telescope, a circle of perhaps fifteen bluish lights were visibe on the botton side of the object. Altitude is not known. It could have been a couple of tousand feet high, or much higher (though it would have een a massive craft at, say 10,000 feet). All was silent. The object then retreated, due north, and vanished into the far reaces of the sky, perhaps outside the atmosphere. ast glimpses were of an object resembling a &#34;shooting star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers noted aircraft activity to the east, elieved to originate from a US AFB. One oserver phoed the base, was told no aircraft had landed or taken off from that AFB in three weeks, and, no, they hadn&#39;t seen any bright ight in the sky, but they&#39;d let us know if they did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers included about ten students of a new england prep school, aged 14-17, and ton faculty member, a Ph.D. in Classics. Another faculty member and his wife missed the event, having been in their tent for the duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All observers were surprised, and many thought there must be a rational explanatio - Hollywood or something. all voiced the possibility, at least, that this was indeed an unusual aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was one of the observers, then aged 17. i have only ever mentioned this event to a handfu of people, and am reporting this on December 18, 2001. I am merely interested in knowing if there were ever any other reports from the vicinity of Lake Okechobee (sorry again about spelling) on March 14 or 15, 1976. I would love to contact other observers (some of whose names I recall) to know what they think they saw that night, now over a quarter-century ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received two other reports that are reminiscent of this one, but they turned out to be missile launches from submarines, apparently located in the waters to the east of Florida.  Such launches are not necessarily announced either ahead of time, or even after the fact.  One of the first possibilities that should be ruled out is a test launch of a ballistic missile.  The Poseiden missiles, scheduled for deployment on the Trident submarines, may have been under testing during the mid-&#39;70&#39;s, although this is just a guess.  PD))<n>
