THAT WAS ODD AND A FIRST FOR US. THEN BEFORE 10PM WE NOTICED A TRAIL OF CLOUDS OR EXHAUST THAT LOOKED LIKE WHITE STAIRS. WE HAD BEEN WALKING AND I POINTED THAT OUT ALSO. THE FOLLOWING NIGHT I WAS WATCHING TV, MY GIRLFRIEND ASLEEP, AND MY UNCLE EATING, WHEN SOMETHING TOLD ME TO GET UP AND OPEN THE SHADE. I DID IT WITHOUT HESITAION AND I SAW A VERY BRIGHT WHITE-YELLOWISH ELIPTICAL CRAFT HOVERING OVER SOME POWER LINES. I WOKE MY GIRLFRIEND UP AND GOT MY UNCLE OUTSIDE TO VIEW THIS OBJECT. THEY WERE SHOCKED AND IN AWE. PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE LAKEWOOD SHOP RITE OBSERVED IT TOO. BEING THE LEO THAT I AM, I WENT OUTSIDE TO FOLLOW IT. IT MOVED SLOWLY WITH STRANGE LIGHTS DESCENDING FROM IT LIKE DROPPING FROM THE SHIP AND COMING BACK. MY DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR CARLOS SAW IT TOO. SO I WENT OUT AND FOLLOWED IT FROM A FAR DISTANCE AS IT CONTINUED EAST OVER THE COUNTY LINE AREA, ANOTHER ODD THING WAS THERE WAS A LADY SITTING ON THE CURB SIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX, WITH A JEAN JACKET AND JEAN PANTS ON. I COULDN&#39;T MAKE OUT HER FEATURES BUT IT WAS ODD FOR ANYONE TO BE OVER DRESSED AROUND 130 AM IN AUGUST. IT DIDN&#39;T LOOK RIGHT. MY UNCLE THOUGHT THE UFO HAD TAKEN ME UNTIL THEY MET UP WITH ME ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES LATER. I CALLED THE LAKEWOOD POLICE DEPT. AND THE DISPATCHER REPORTED OTHER OFFICERS SEEING IT, I THEN CALLED THE MUFON NUMBER AND MY PHONE CALL WAS BLOCKED. AS I WENT OUT TO WORK THAT MONDAY THERE WAS A RED BLIMP THAT SAID GOLDEN ON IT BUT THAT WASN&#39;T WHAT WE SAW,THE BLIMP WAS OUT BY THE LAKEWOOD AIRPORT. ANOTHER ODDITY IS THE BIRTH OF MY SON ON AUGUST 16TH THE FOLLOWING YEAR. WE HAD BEEN TOGETHER SINCE 1987 AND HAD NO KIDS TOGETHER OR SEPARTELY.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought that it may be a planet but it was very bright. I watched it and aproximately after 1 minute, the bright object became 7-8 smaller objects which flew in a downward motion then outward and up, in a J fashion and disappeared. The motion resembled an upsidedown open umbrella. All lights moved in a synchonized fashion. My first thought that an aerobatics team such as the Blue Angels or the Snowbirds were rehearsing. The next day at work I checked the NOTAM (notices to airmen) Board. There were no practices in our airspace on that date and no airshows scheduled around that time. I was working in Air Traffic Services at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

We had no electric so we slept out on the pool deck on lounge chairs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fell asleep first and my wife woke me up and asked what was that overhead.  I woke up and saw a saucer shaped craft with what looked like a cabin underneath it with 8 or 10 rectangular windows and an orange light coming from the windows underneath.  The sky was 100% clear and when I blinked my eyes it was gone.  No sound, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to my wife and asked her what she saw and she described exactly what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived at XXXX SW 104 St.  Pinecreat, FL 33156<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the newpaper and asked neighbors but no one reported or saw anything.  I was with the sheriff&#39;s Dept. at the time and no one reported anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I had better go on record now to see if you got any reports that night.<n>

The sky was dark. Our sliding glass door to our room was closed and locked. When we were getting ready to go to dinner my husband heard a knock on our sliding glass door. He asked me if I heard THAT and I answered no. Within seconds, it knocked again but this time I heard it! From where? We had a private balcony many feet up from a beach. We felt compelled to open the sliding glass door and we saw it. Two bouncing lights over the ocean doing a dance. Awestruck we tried to communicate telepathically and sent our greetings to what appeared to be a joyous welcome from unknown visitors in the sky. We watched the lights move quickly to the right and left, then when I asked my husband quietly to get the camera on the bed, he slipped out and at that time, the lights did a corkscrew movement backward and charged away at an unbelievable speed. Gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Moments after spotting the object, 5 similar objects ejected from the first fireball one after the other in a straight line.  The fireballs hovered for what could have been only seconds, then they just disappeared, or fizzled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were on a return trip from Mobile, Alabama one afternoon after having visited my grandmother and done some shopping.  I was about 12 or 13 years old, and my mother, a medical technologist, was in her early 40&#39;s.  It was between 4:00 and 5:00 PM, and the sun was still above the horizon.  As we were nearing Jackson, Alabama, our home town, we were on the north side of Wagarville, Alabama when I looked to my right and noticed a single bright yellow/orange sphere hovering above the treeline. I turned to my mom to get her to look at the strange object when I noticed that she was already staring at the fiery globe.  Then I turned to observe the object again, and after a couple of seconds, one - by - one 5 or 6 objects of the same nature shot out, or ejected, from the first in a right - to - left motion, until they were all in a straight line.  The objects hovered there for only a moment, then they disintegrated, or vanished. Mom and I both looked at each other, and neither of us said anything. Finally I said, &#34;Mom! What was all that about!?&#34;.  It looked something like a fireworks display, only I knew it wasn&#39;t.  The objects didn&#39;t flicker like fireworks, and fireworks don&#39;t hover. I still think about this incident from time to time, and cannot for the life of me fathom what it was I saw that afternoon.<n>
8/18/92 02:00|Columbus|GA|Disk|1 minute|UFO outside window, waits in backyard|7/1/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23331.html|8|ndxe199208| UFO outside window, waits in backyard<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin was staying with us for the Summer.  We were about 13 and 14, then.  She was sleeping next to one of the windows in my bedroom.  I was on the other side of the room, facing away from the window.  We had just turned the light off.  She said there was a UFO outside the window.  I had seen UFO&#39;s before.  I thought she was just trying to annoy me.  She said it again, and I got up and went to the window.  There was a UFO.  I told her to get up and run...outside.  We ran out of my room, through the house, and outside into the backyard.  It was still there.  Did it wait for us?  I was disk-shaped with whitish-colered lights and/or glow.  It hovered above us for a few seconds, then took off.  What is so strange, is that we were in a neighborhood where the neighbor&#39;s house was only about 15 feet from the window.  The UFO appeared larger than that.  Maybe they can change sizes?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  One of two reports from same source.  PD))<n>

The evening of August 16, 1992 I went out on the patio to smoke a cigarette.  I was looking at the stars and watching planes fly overhead.  Then the sky suddenly became black--no stars, no planes.  Then the lights appeared--8 to 10 &#39;v&#39; shaped lights that appeared ahead of the blackness.  The lights and blackness slowly glided overhead in a westerly direction towards Portland, Oregon.  This thing was gigantic and I did not detect any sound as it passed overhead.  It was not moving fast like the airplanes I had seen just a few moments before, it was moving very slow.  I got up and started to walk across the backyard in the direction the lights were travelling, then the lights disappeared as if they had tilted upward, a few seconds later the stars and planes reappeared as if nothing had been there.  No light trails, nothing.  I was 51 at the time, not drinking, do not use drugs, not known to halucinate, divorced, owned my own business, two children at home.  I called my aunt who lives in the area the next day and told her what I had seen, also my granddaughter, and daughter&#39;s tenant.<n>
8/16/92 03:30|Santa Rosa|CA|Unknown|approximately 10 minutes|I was visited by an unexplained anamoly in the middle of the morning.|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31816.html|10|ndxe199208| I was visited by an unexplained anamoly in the middle of the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened about 9 years ago. I had a visitation from something right-out of my ceiling in my den. It was very hot earlier in the day and right up to bed time.I went to bed about 11:oopm. My head was facing south away from the den windows. What I remember happened exactly as it did 9 years ago (because I can&#39;t forget this moment).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found myself standing up looking out the windows of my den which faces  my neighbors house approximately 6 feet away. It was 3:30am. All I could see was a blinding white light but it was&#39;nt making my eyes close. It just made me focus more intently.But when I asked myself why I was focusing so intently at this light just outside the window, my position changed. Suddenly I felt as if someone had picked me up with a giant hand and placed me on my back resting on the sofa.This was performed in one swift motion. I was now facing north.I was completely conscious and realized that this was&#39;nt a dream. Then I noticed what appeared to be a person in a white suit, wearing welders goggles.Then focusing more clearly I noticed that these goggles were fluctuating and changing shape from thick band to narrow band.I noticed it had three long fingers on each hand. It gave me the impression that it was puzzled with me because of its hand movements kept jockeying back and forth resting on the window it had made out of my ceiling and back to its face and then leaning on its long hand.It had no nose or mouth or ears. Suddenly this stopped when I said,&#34;what the hell is that?&#34;It got shocked and leaped up suddenly surprised like it was discovered.It stretched its long arm out to close the window. This seemed odd to have a long arm, only because the window was&#39;nt that big.The whole time I basically viewed a half a torso through this window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has taken a long time to reconcile. when I tried to explain this through communication I have become intensely afraid of describing this, just as intensely afraid right after it happened.I called the F.B.I. not long after this happened but they tried to chalk it up to hallucinations or stress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as working in the legal industry.

8/15/92 22:30|Norwood|PA|Cigar|10-15 seconds|Cigar shaped,lighted object.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29387.html|12|ndxe199208| Cigar shaped,lighted object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few friends and I were hanging out one night on the railroad tracks when something along the horizon caught our attention.It appeared at first,to be just hovering.We could see two bright lights,and some sort of oval shape between them.Now,if you&#39;re standing with your arm extended in front of you towards the sky,and held your thumb and forefinger about 3 inches apart,that&#39;s how far apart the lights appeared .I can&#39;t give an approximate size,other then to say it was big.The lights were nearly as bright as the full moon.Anyway,it hovered for about a second.Also,there was planes approaching this object from the east.We noticed two of em as the flew directly overhead of us.As quick as we saw this object,it shot off to the south  and out of view.We thought it was gone.Then,within seconds,it came flying back into view,to the same spot(or fairly close)it was.There it hovered for a few seconds,then shot off to the north at a fast speed till it was totally out of sight.We watched for about another hour,thinking it might come back.It never did.I can&#39;t say for sure it was extraterrestrial.But,it certainly wasn&#39;t a plane.It was moving way to fast,and  the lights were too bright.I&#39;ve always wondered what the hell it was.There was no sound at all.I would think something man made,that was that big,would make some noise,as did the planes flying overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had just been out on a date, and it was a warm evening outsude. I was driving my mother&#39;s minivan, and we had the windows down because it was nice out.  The road my parent&#39;s house in on was, at the time, in a semi-rural suburban area.  It was a very clear night with lots of stars, no moon from what i recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were about 2 miles away, I saw a dark shape above the treeline in the direction we were headed. Even though it was very dark, there was still some ambient light from philadelphia on the horizon below the treeline. Because of that, I could define space that was much darker then the surrounding sky. I pointed the shape out to my girlfriend, and we both thought it had to be a cloud. Then we realized that it seemed to be moving. Then we thought it must be some sort of flat looking blimp. We could see no lights on it whatsoever, which we thought was very odd for an aircraft at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were approximately 1/2 mile from home, we saw that the object was much larger and closer then we thought, and then it was moving over us. I slowed the car down to almost a stop and stuck my head out the window to see what it was. It made no noise at all, and blocked out a very large portion of the stars. i was able to see that it was roughly triangular in shape- though i can&#39;t be certain of that fact because it all happened so fast and unexpectedly. I didn&#39;t see any visible markings or lights, and it wasn&#39;t moving at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both sort of laughed the whole thing off and never talked about it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been at a loss ever since to explain what it was, since aircraft flying at night have some sort of lights. I&#39;d also expect some sort of noise, even from a low-flying blimp- should one decide to float around in the dark at low altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Nothing out there except a house on south/west corner, two story right on the corner.  Green light from source about 20 feet above second story beaming a trapezoid shape of same light down on back of house and back yard.  We could see the trees behind the house, the light waving off of the peak of the house like a mirage, or heat off the hood of a car.  I was staring into &amp;quot;source&amp;quot; that was around 30ft x 12ft. I was looking into the rectangle to see equipment, or anything but it was just pure lime green light, saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, we did not see a shape, lights, a craft, nothing.  Not even sound.  Then I got out of my car and by the time I looked back up it was gone, however the little street light that lit up the little 4 way stop was illuminating a/an &#34;exhaust cloud&#34;, &#34;churned up atmosphere&#34;, or what I call the &amp;quot;Doughnut shaped cloud that the Road Runner leaves when he splits.&amp;quot;  This &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; was floating at a 45 degree angle and if the &amp;quot;Road Runner&amp;quot; just &amp;quot;split&amp;quot; the trajectory of the object was South/Southwest (If Calvine is true East/West).  We watched this &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;vapor&amp;quot; float for about 20 seconds before 2 fighter jets buzzed us from Mather Air Base.  Some seconds later or minutes, came the rumble of a C-130 or AWAX, something obviously bigger and slower than the fighter jets inbound on the same course as the fighter jets, eventually coming overhead and continuing Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other cars were at the intersection, not much traffic at all on the roads in that area at that time back then.  We got in my car and left, turned on the radio and heard DJ&#39;s saying people calling in from all over the Sacramento area with sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day evening news said, &amp;quot;We looked into the sightings from last night and spoke to (Naval Command?) and confirmed that it was a test missile launch from the San Fransisco area.&amp;quot;  My friend&#39;s dad flew the (T-42?) trainer jet out of Mather, a side by side 2 seater jet for training new pilots.  He said to his dad that we had still not stopped talking about what we saw and after asking his dad what it was his reply was, &amp;quot;I cannot tell you what it was, but what I can tell you is that it wasn&#39;t a missile launch from San Fransisco.&amp;quot;  Since then, I&#39;ve studied Ufology, and seen almost every video, and read a pile of sighting stories and I still haven&#39;t read or seen anything I saw that night.  After years and years of study, and cutting away the media fat, smoke and mirrors and separating information from mis-information and dis-information I&#39;m about 98% convinced that what we saw was either a multi-dimensional craft, or this realm/dimension simply opening up to the other side.  The latter is from a total lack of observing any craft, or lights, or sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It slowly moved toward another tree. Both witness had blue light shining on them. They also lost conciousness for several minutes. When they regained conciousness, they were standing in different locations and positions. When the craft reached the other tree it tilted onto it&#39;s side and began to wobble. It appeared that the craft would tip over on top of the two witness, so they began running away. They then turned back to see the craft shoot away from the tree at a very high speed out over a feild and then dissappear. The craft was silent while hovering, but made a very distinct noise as it shot away. The following day, the witnesses returned to the sight. They discovered distinct and unusual markings on the ground and tree correlating to what they experienced.<n>

Time: 3:45/Or 4:30 a.m (We arrived late setup our camp in the Campground I &amp; a friend woke up to it after sleeping about 3.5-4.0 hrs.   I awoke first for NO APPARENT REASON! I had been sleeping in our &#34;Smoker Craft.&#34; ( On it&#39;s Trailer) Upon Sitting up I looked to my Southeast &amp; Noticed for the first time a very large mountain only about 1 mile from where we had parked in complete DARKNESS FACING THE RESVOIR.( I could NOT SEE MY HAND IN FRONT OF MY FACE; Without Artificial lighting! As I looked above the mountain, I recall first seeing a Platinum semi sphere the size of the ENTIRE MOUNTAIN, but it rose over an approximate 3 minute Period! At this time the Silent stationary OBJECT WAS AT LEAST 3X&#39;s the Size of the Full Moon! Alarmed by my inability to explain what I had already whitnessed; I then woke Jim Y. He and I observed this object for what seemed to be ten to fifteen minutes. The now complete Mercury/Quick-Silver Full Circle could be seen, in TOTAL SILENCE!   What I don&#39;t understand is why after speaking to Jim, to wake him: Why he or I spoke nothing about it the next morning?  WHY WE DID NOT WAKE MY BROTHER SLEEPING IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK, to Also view SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SIGHTING!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I felt like I had a dream, because it took nearly a year or two after this sighting to RECALL ANYTHING!  I almost felt like I had been given the Out-Patient Valium type of drug called Versedt!   I only RECALLED THIS EVENT WHEN AT OUR CABIN SOME YEAR OR SO LATER!  The first time I made what would be one of 3-4 sightings over a 2-year period.  I was putting out the Campfire about 2:45 in the morning alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I.

Their Sir names end in &#34;l&#34; and Differ by ((names deleted))...my last name after we were married in 1996.<n> <n><n> <n><n> V. Description of the Almost Identical sightings:  Azimuth 115 degrees/ but facing due north looking almost 85 degrees in Elevation( I took Meterology &amp; I had just place my RCA Direct tv dish in the first summer of it&#39;s release) I have also taken General Astronomy, as well as Dead Reconning/ Cartographical Navigation. Almost every sighting seemed to be on an exact time an Schedule: The observations would begin at 02:30/02:45 and 0:4:50ish with a duration of between 15-1hr...dunno if longer because I randomly would either go out in the middle of the night or early morning to find what looked like three stars, but brighter. They would almost appear straight-up in the North or Northwest direction. These objects would start in a straight-line, evenly spaced at at least 16-19 miles high, because sometimes, I could see the Atmospheric &#34;Sparkle&#34;&#34;Twinkle&#34; Effects. This on clear nights. The sighting would progress greatly in movement and bright-flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;Formation&#34; would then increase to about nine evenly spaced objects. Each evenly spaced, equal in size luminosity. They would then either rotate 45 Degrees to the left or Right, forming a Osciles Triangle instantaniously, with no perceived time lapse between each munuever. The addition of the six oringinally seemed to just turn on like a Distant white LED. The ojects would then shoot an &#34;ARGON&#34; Green LASER between them. Then it would discontinue in about 10-15 Seconds, then the nine would form a straight line Array. Repeat, then Rotate another 45 degrees withouth changing the Over-All location in the sky by more than the total Estimated Six inches in the Sky. But if one applied the change in angles in the Sky observed from the ground at 7,400 feet; One would deduce they were moving up to 6&#34; @ 19 miles or easily Two hundred miles per second, or other arrays were already in place and then were activated? Either way the speed would be 200 plus miles per non perceived time o! r moment! The other alternative is this &#34;Array&#34; that made triangles rt,isoc...Circles and then either a total &#34;Wink-Out or on one instace I did see on then leave West covering from about 85 degrees to 15 Degrees Behind/Below Horizon in about 3.3 Seconds( I counted one one thousand two one thousand ecetera) [ the array would be literally hundreds of miles in area?]<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other deductions or findings:<n> <n><n> <n><n> A.

I had no reason to look up / wake the first time at either location! No sounds or ANYTHING SEEMED MORE THAN SATELITTES THE SECOND TIME.

At the time this occured, i was self employed. I ran a service company that cleaned commercial heating and air conditioning systems. This sighting happened just outside of Altivista va. on state rd. 29 heading north.  Myself and one employee were traveling home after work this particular night at about 11:00pm when i noticed a very bright light up ahead just above the highway.  At first when i mentioned this to my work partner, he laughed and did not pay much attention to this object, but i was watching closely. As i began to get closer to this object i realized that it was no air craft.  This object was a large black colored trangle with three huge barrels under the bottom that emitted light from each of them.  The light glowed brightly and then it faded out to a dull glow under each barrel, and it did this several times as we were still approaching the object.By this time we were almost directly under the object in my work van.  I pulled over to the side of the road so we could continue to observe this object.  My work partner was at this point, very afraid of what he was seeing and i admitt i was not feeling comfortable with this sighting because it was so close to us and we were the only ones on the highway during this sighting. This object was totally silent as it hovered above us. This object was just above tree top level which was about sixty feet up.As we were sitting there on the side of the road looking up at the object it began to slowly move to the right side a little further closer to the trees and then we noticed that the object was gone, but we did not see it vanish or move one direction or the other at that point.  Strangely enough, we both had a feeling of missing time or something i just have no way of explaining, but thats how it was.  My work partner, who is now a long time friend as well, was a serious skeptic about such things as u.f.o.s until this experience.  I had told him about the disc i saw back in 1996 over the s! ears bui lding, but he never believed me until this experience happened to him.  To this day i still get a laugh out of what he siad while we were driving home that night after we saw the object.  He said to me (i&#39;m glad it diddn&#39;t suck us up in there!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I told my husband and two friends there with me to look at it. We all agreed that it was not an aircraft of any type we knew ( my husband was a licensed pilot) and I was a student pilot at the time. It was high in the sky, estim. at least 10k feet or higher. It traveled in a straight path above the horizon, and as it reached the western sky, suddenly a very bright strobe light flashed 3 times in rapid succession, and 4 other lights emerged rapidly from the source of the light, flew rapidly away, and all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We then started talking about fishing,he asked me if I wanted to go to a place on my night off where him and his dad used to go and catch tons of cat fish. I agreeded to go , he told me it was on private land ,that it was an eragation sluogh a couple of miles into this land ,we would have to go at night, but not to worry,nobody is ever out there,he was right it was prestine, and soon as your line hit the water,you would get bites. We probably caught 25 to 30 cat fish, it was realy buitiful out there ,there was&#39;nt a piece of trash to be seen anywhere,tall trees lined both sides of the slough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two weeks later, I was telling my friend and my sister in laws boyfriend about this fishing spot they both wanted to go, I told them about the land being private, and that we would have to go at night. We went about 12:00 am by 1:00 am we where there starting to fish, just like last time we started catching cats like crazy ,we where using an electric lantern to see, it was mildly bright, while we were sitting there all of a sudden down the slough ,on the bank, about maybe 150 yards or more away, a bright light came on, it looked to be like one of those bright coleman gas lanterns, but we could&#39;nt see or here any people, we where instantly scared being on private land where my nieghbor told me he and his father never saw a soul out there, we quikly turned off our light and watched. Nothing was happening ,the light just stayed on, we waited a while and then thought it might be someone fishing like us, we thought we would try to be quiet and keep fishing with our light! off,we did. We fished for about an hour or 2, when my friend said he wanted to go lay down in the back of my nova, that he did&#39;nt care if we kept fishing,we did, though we kept looking down the slough at the light, we got so used to it being there we kinda stopped thinking about it, when all of a sudden the light got intencely bright, it scared the hell out of us ,when I say it got bright I mean like stadium lighting, we jumped up asking each other what the hell where we looking at?, before we could wake up my friend the light got giant ,it loominated all the trees and water,and I swear to you this light rose off the ground, it was so bright we could&#39;nt see any mass on it,just light. I then opened my car door and shaking my friend to wake up, by this time the light was at the top of the trees, My friend said what is it ,I told him it was the light that was on the bank, he then asked me if it was a u.f.o., it made no sound at all, I told him I have no idea what it is,we the! n stared throwing our gear in the car, and we jumped in,we did! &#39;nt know what to do, we had to drive towards it to leave, as we started near it ,it backed up, as we got closer it then moved quikly across the top of the trees,we could see it loominating the trees as it took off, it almost seemed to know we where watching.Im getting goose bumps remembering this night.  I have been through many things in my life since then, I remaried to a wonderful wife,but we suffered some great tradgedy in our life ,like the suicide death of my youngest son, the passing of my father who died fairly young,I dont usualy tell this story, because it sounds crazy, but I swear its true, I dont know what we saw, maybe you do. Many years had past and I lost contact with the 2 guys I was with that night, but one day my wife and I ,and my sister and her boyfriend went to the asparagus festival in Stockton Ca.,and while we where there amongst thousands of people I hear someone call my name ,it was my friend who was in the car asleep,he said hey ,hows it going ?,its been a ! long time, how about that thing we saw that night? I laughed,I thought it was funny ,that was the first thing he brought up .I was realy glad to see him and talk about it. Just for the record, when we drove over towards where it was there was no farm equipment no building no lighting of any kind,just acres and acres of corn field, we truely saw something that night ,and I think it was something we were&#39;nt supposed to see, I dont know if this story is helpful to you ,I just wanted to tell it,and its 100% true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated by witness is flawed.

It was 1:00 AM on a clear but non-moonlit night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a light that at first appeared to be a house window (opaque orange-ish). Traveling slowly I realized the light was right over the Clearwater River and as close as 100 yds (maybe closer).<n> <n><n> <n><n> First sight was one light then we seemed to see another side of this &#34;craft&#34; that had three rectangular lights and a round light (as if an exclamation mark on its side).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rolled our windows down wondering, if it was a helicopter dropping for fire fighting water. No Noise. It slowly started to rise and move toward the Southwest and over the horizon to our due south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it disappeared over the tree lined horizon the appearance was of a forest fire (behind). Soon (within 10 seconds) a &#34;round light&#34; appeared to just &#34;pop&#34; over the same horizon and droop down and &#34;hold&#34; still for several seconds. It then darted straight up to the &#34;heavens.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Mere seconds it appeared to be among the stars and changed from a white light to a blue &#34;cast&#34; light.  We watched it, until seeming to disappear, for many seconds. The speed was beyond all belief! When we looked back at the previous light over the top of the horizon it was gone. We seemed to be Euphoric and hesitated to discuss this for a long time. We waited about a three weeks before discovering your existence. We contacted you by phone and you asked for a hand drawn depiction which we provided. You also suggested contacting MUFON which we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were visited by a MUFON investigator named Li (woman) who lived in Winchester Idaho. She told us she and her colleagues lived in &#34;fear&#34; for their lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She called me a week after our in person visit and invited me to come and watch a video that she said would &#34;change my life forever more.&#34;  When I attempted to contact her a week later to follow up and view this video she was no longer anywhere to found?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Li no longer is State Director of Idaho/MUFON.

It was around 9:00 pm when we went outdoors. One woman said she had seen one from her car years ago in California. I mentioned I had seen one in Maryland in 1984 or 1985 near the Washington, DC Beltway in Silver Spring, MD and started describing what I had seen. As soon as I started describing it, I looked up into the sky and said,&#34;I can&#39;t believe it! Look north over there, that is exactly what I saw six or seven years ago!&#34; It appeared to be one object, very far in the distance with some colored lights, white, reddish, possibly green. The object was moving straight up and down, then in right angles, like it was climbing stairs, then it looked like it disappeared, but it reappeared further to the west (or it was another similar object). Then moved in the same perpendicular type of motion, very quickly up and down then it just went straight up very rapidly and disappeared from our view. It was too far away to see anything but the lights, but the movement was definitely NOT like any aircraft I have ever seen, except for that] sighting in November of 1984 or 1985 in Maryland.<n>

Thinking it was a flashlight from the house, I called out for my mother but to my surprise the beam of light was coming from farther away and was now moving directly onto our circle where we were sitting.  I screamed out LOOK! and all my friends but one or two said they saw what I did.  I saw a circular object flying about 300-500 yards up in the air through the trees.  The middle point where the light was coming from looked like a huge strobe light and then there were two opposite rotating rings of cilindrical shaped lights that would change colors individually like a fibre-optic light.  On the outside of the craft I witnessed viewing windows not much unlike those from an commercial aircraft, except a lot bigger. After I pointed upwards the craft mysteriously disappeared vanishing withou leaving a tracer of light or any sound.  Which leads me to believe that the craft shot straight up into space.  I know it sounds like we were all under the influence but no, It was before I or my friends even did that stuff.  In the papers the next morning it read that there was a ufo sighted over bellevue last night and that 50 people other than ourselves reported it.  The Government or Officials said it was Strobe ligths reflecting off swamp gas, what ever! Believe what you want, My friends and I know the truth is out there.

The light (orb) at first was a very big white light (much bigger than a star or aircraft)but when it reached altitude it started to change colors from white to red to green, it started pulsating faster and then little lights that where white started to shoot out of it at the same time (3 of them) they would then shoot back to the main white light and join with it) then the main white light (orb)would just blink out and then reappear in another posistion.  All three of us watched this for probably about an hour, finally the bright white light just moved off from East to West and disappeared.  Also my dad took some pictures of us sitting around the camp fire on the beach and there are weird misty looking things around our heads (it is not smoke, the wind was blowing the other direction).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have forgotten the exact date and time but will never forget the other details – the image and brilliance of this strange ball of light and the feeling that it was certainly not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on a couch chatting with my visiting father.  At the time I was 32 years old and my retired Naval officer father (I mention that because my father is not prone to frivolity) was about 54.  We have a 200 acre farm in rural West Virginia – very secluded and private.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The couch faced a wall of floor to ceiling windows overlooking a small mountain ridge and a pond.  All of a sudden an enormous ball of light appeared – there was no beam – the light was consistent for the entire size of the “ball.”  It looked like the sun but obviously a bit too close!  It was clearly moving but at a very slow and controlled speed.  It was not falling.  ” My father and I have related the experience to people every now and again and frequently people will ask it might have been a meteor.  We don’t think it was because of its slow controlled speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed out of sight after about 15 seconds.   I called the police – but felt they wouldn’t take us seriously.  I told the person who answered that I just felt like I should report it (I didn’t call it a UFO) in case they got other calls attesting to the same sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing ever came of it.  My father and I, after all these years, both say that we certainly saw something that defies our ability to understand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

8/1/92 16:00|Waukesha|WI|Other|2 minutes|Strange interaction with men in black|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55169.html|29|ndxe199208| Strange interaction with men in black<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t be certain but this most probably happened in the summer of 1992 which would have been the summer before my senior year in high school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hanging out in the driveway at my best friend’s house on N. Greenfield Ave. in Waukesha, WI between E. Broadway and Ellis St.  I had parked &#34;my&#34; 1980 Chevy Malibu on the curb in front of his house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my best friend and I  (and possibly one or two of his other brothers, I don’t remember) were standing in the driveway a new black Lincoln Town Car with tinted windows pulled up behind my car, blocking the driveway.  As soon as it stopped three men (possibly four, I can’t remember) including the driver; got out of the car, walked up to the sidewalk and faced us.  They all were all wearing black suits and dark tinted sunglasses; all of them normal build and physically fit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest part of the incident that I recall is that the one man immediately addressed me, as if he knew the Malibu was my car.  &#34;I will give you $2000 cash for your car.&#34;  He was as far as I can remember totally expressionless, as were the others.  As far as I was reading into the interaction, he would hand me cash and drive the car away immediately.  Apparently a title was not an issue.  Still kind of dazed by the weirdness of it all, the only thing that I managed to reply was,<n> <n><n> &#34;It’s not mine to sell, its my dad’s,&#34; which was true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was it, they made no more attempts at trying to deal.  They turned around without a word and drove north on N. Greenfield.  They didn’t stop at any other houses as far as we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I knew nothing of men in black stories nor did my friend.  We both stood there awestruck and after rehashing the event came to the conclusion that two grand wasn’t worth being implicated in a felony acted out by clean cut secret service types.  Interestingly enough my dad sold the car a few weeks later, I think he got less than $500 for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend may be willing to back up my claim, if he remembers.  I haven’t seen him for almost five years but it was such an odd event we reminisced on it a few times after it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this site was appropriate for this type of sighting - please feel free to forward onto more appropriate channels if need be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

8/1/92 12:00|Belgrade|MT|Triangle|few minutes|Unidentified flying bright orange triangle 20 miles north of Belgrade, Montana in late summer of 1992|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42137.html|30|ndxe199208| Unidentified flying bright orange triangle 20 miles north of Belgrade, Montana in late summer of 1992<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were walking up a hill to the shop where our father was working when something cought my eye over the mountians.  When I looked I saw a bright orange triangle hovering over the mountian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound.  It was a perfectly clear day no clouds at all.  I would say it was the size of a car, but it&#39;s been over ten years so it&#39;s hard for me to remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my sister&#39;s arm and we both stopped and stared at it for what seemed like a few minutes, but it could have been only seconds.  And then it just shot straight up into the sky.  No noise or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran home and told our mother who said we were full of it.  I recently saw a show on ufos that talked of a triangle shaped space craft and had to report this.  I was 12 at the time and my sister was 7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/1/92|New York City|NY|Oval||metalic and fast- under intelligent control.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52645.html|31|ndxe199208| metalic and fast- under intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 objects were seen by me and my friends on that august night.they were metalic and flying in formation in a circle high up over the lower east side. they made moves that no aircraft I now of could make.--- it all started with 3 objects in a straight line up above our heads- then they would go into a circle and spin around fast,then slow down and do it again the other way- then slow down, and turn into a triangle formation. then spin around the other way and do it all over again!!- this lasted for a total of a few minutes. it was seen by all of us, and then they spun around one more time and raced off toward the direction of brooklyn. it still stands as the most unbeleaveable sight I (or we) had and have ever seen. I still remember the sighting today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
