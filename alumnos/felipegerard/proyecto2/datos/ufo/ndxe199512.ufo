The fireball had a diameter of about 10 yds with trailing flames some 60-80 yds long.  It then flew directly over the highway at Bozeman Pass (the pass has an elevation of 5780 ft) by not more than 1000 ft.  It then rose in the sky at a low constant angle to disappear in the distance in not more than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball covered a distance of 1-1/2 miles, measured with vehicle odometer, in an estimated 2-3 seconds, suggesting a speed in the range of 1800-2700 mph.  It was silent.  The speed of sound is about 750 mph.  The fireball should have produced a loud sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One possible explanation for the oft-reported silence of UFO&#39;s might be connected to the incredible accelerations and decelerations of which they appear to be capable.  Some witnesses have claimed UFO&#39;s make no-radius 90 degree and even 180 degree turns at speeds estimated in the 1000&#39;s of  mph without decelerating at all.   The g-forces involved must measure at least in the 100&#39;s.  One possible way to protect the crews from these maneuvers is an anti-gravity system, perhaps in the shape of a torus in the rim.  If such a system existed, it might be omnidirectional, that is, it might have the same intensity outside the craft as within.  Hypothetically it could be so powerful that it could repel air around the craft.  In otherwords UFO&#39;s may fly in a self-made vacuum.  If this were true the craft would not contact the atmosphere and could not produce a sonic boom.  Other advantages to such a system would be the absence of heating by air friction when flying in the atmosphere at high speed, and the repulsion of smaller objects out of the path of the craft when flying in deep space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If a torus did exist in the rim of a UFO, then a possible structure exists for a propulsion system.  (I am not suggesting that an anti-gravity system and a propulsion system are the same, only that they may be in close proximity and possibly share the same structure.)  Cyclotrons require a torus.  One account of the vimana or flying machines of the gods in ancient Indian tradition that I read stated that the machines had mercury in them.  So we are talking about a cyclotron which spins up a mercury plasma to a relativistic velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thrust occurs when mass is lost at velocity from a vehicle.  We are all familiar with rockets ejecting hot gases to produce thrust.  There is nothing in this definition of thrust which requires the loss of matter.  All that is needed is the loss of mass.  When plasma at a relativistic velocity decelerates it loses mass at velocity.  It may be mathematically derived mass based on relativity but it&#39;s still mass.  If this deceleration occurred in a vehicle such as a UFO it ought to produce thrust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suppose a UFO is headed north.  If the torus in the rim had a shunt come off of it pointed south, then plasma might be directed into the shunt, where it could be decelerated and produce relativistic thrust.  Perhaps then the shunt loops back into the area of the cyclotron where the plasma in the shunt could be accelerated to the operational velocity of the plasma in the torus, at which point the shunt rejoins the torus and dumps its contents into it.  In this way the plasma could be used over and over for propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Please see other report from San Diego for December 29, 1995.  PD))<n>

It emited no sound and was a rounded T-shaped object. A large green light appeard off its left side and streaked off in front of the craft, leaving a green trail behind it. the object joined up with other craft and headed S.E. out of my site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heading north on the 805 frwy just before the junction with the 8 frwy, I noticed four large bright lights in the northern sky, approx just east of Mt. Solidad. I was mesmerized by the brightness of the lights, and the fact that aircraft lights appeared in the sky, but none like these crafts were emitting. I was so engrossed I missed the offramp for the 8 West frwy, I pulled off the freeway at the next availble exit and turned into a parks parking lot, I exited my car and noticed that one of the craft was going to fly directly over me. it was aprox. 800ft. up in the air and seemed to be at least 100yards long. it was T-shaped with the cross of the T at aft. it had Nav lights, however a blue and a yellow light were part of the configuration of Nav lights. (I am an aviation buff, and know aircraft of all types extreamly well. this was like no craft I had ever seen or heard about before (including speculation as to what the Aurora or other experimental crafts look like). the craft emited no sound and moved rather slow. this craft was flying over residential areas and ajacent to Brown Field. Suddenly a bright green light appeared on the crafts left side, and shot off in front of the craft, leaving a green trail behind it. The craft contined south towards Mission Valley joined up with the others and headed S.E. towards Spring Valley and Lemon Grove. I headed back to my friends house, where I was staying, I reported the incident to him and he asked &#34;what have you been smoking?&#34;  I told him I had a couple of beers while visiting with another friend, but that I was in full control of my senses. The following morning we were reading the paper over breakfast and he told me that the San Diego Union -Tribune was reporting that people had seen lights in the sky the prior night, so I know that what I saw others saw. However, I have never seen an explanation and have never spoken to another person who saw what I saw that night. At the time I was 31 years old and I am a travel executive. I am college educated, an avid reader, and somewhat of an amatuer scientist. As I mentioned before, I know aircraft, and this was no aircraft, I had aver seen before, or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

For those of you familiar with Winnipeg it occured in South St.Vital on Warde Ave and St.Annes Rd. I was the passenger in a friends car. As we were driving I looked to my right and noticed some bright lights over top of some houses. I thought about what I had seen and requested that we turn around and investigate. As we approached the object we noticed that it had 3 distinct lights in the form of a triangle. One on top and two to its sides. The lights seemed to have some color to them, at times I remember seeing hints of blue and red, but white was the most frequent. The object just seemes to hang there. It was no further away then 200 yards and was no higher than 50 ft. It hovered motionless for a few minutes. Meanwhile we were fiddling with the radio and flashing our headlights at it. Nothing out of the ordinary occured. Soon thereafter it proceeded top move in a South easterly direction. The lights were always visible. It seemed to move backwards. We proceeded to move east on the road we were on to try and intercept the object. We made it to a road which went North-South and turned south and then just stopped. The object was hovering over the road in front of us. Maybe 20-30 ft above the road and 200-300 yards away. It hovered, slowly moving backwards by some trees lining the road. At that point I rolled my window down and stuck my head out to listen....dead silence. There were no other cars on the road. We must have sat there 5 mins until it started to move in the direction in which it had come from. So we quickly turned around and headed down the same road we were on before only this time we were following a moving target. The lights were still visible at this point. The object seemed to accelerate quickly. We were doing about 80 -90 km/hr when it out accelerated us and vanished. I have never seen anything accelerate like that before. It was fast. I will never forget that night. We were 19 and 20 years old and we were not under the influence of any substanc! es. We w eren&#39;t tired and we definately were not dreaming.....Thanks for providing me with a place to post my encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The apparent close proximity of the two aircraft is what first drew the observers&#39; attention and caused them to conclude that they were military aircraft, as opposed to commercial or private aircraft.  The individual who called and who submitted the written report stated that he and the other observers are familiar with the general flight characteristics of aircraft flying out of Roanoke, VA, airport, and they invariably maintain greater separation than what they observed for these two aircraft that had drawn their attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the observers became aware of a third &#34;aircraft,&#34; which was directly ahead of the first two aircraft.  The observers immediately developed the impression that the third &#34;aircraft&#34; was being pursued by the first two they had witnessed.  The third object was less well illuminated that the first two, and its lighting pattern consisted of three red, somewhat &#34;subdued&#34; lights, arranged in a triangular pattern. Its size was approximately that of the other two aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30-60 seconds after the observers had spotted the first two conventional aircraft, they suddenly noticed that a third aircraft was flying from the northwest directly toward the triangular aircraft, apparently on a &#34;collision&#34; course with it, closing from the starboard side of the triangular-shaped aircraft, and flying at a somewhat higher speed that the triangular ship exhibited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds of sighting the fourth aircraft, the observers realized that none of the conventional aircraft were able to keep up with the triangular craft, all of them beginning to fall behind at the latter apparently began to accelerate.  The third conventional aircraft fell behind the triangle, and began to fly parallel to the other conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident was reported to the FAA in Roanoke, VA, and to Andrews AFB.<n>

As very common in Brazil, families put together for parties, specially in hollidays. It was about 20:30, when me and my closest cousin were in garage, talking about useless things. When I repared, in a long distance, I saw a light. It was circle-shaped, and it was kinda big. At first, I didn&#39;t mind - there was one airpoirt close to that direction. Five minutes after, one small light was emanated from the big one, and fied slowly around it, before going east and disappear seconds after. The second light was circled, but blinked in purple and red. I still thought that was the airpoirt, then I pointed the lights to my cousin. She said something like &#34;Cant be the airpoirt. The airpoirt is down there.&#34;. And surely, the airpoirt was the opposite direction. When the first light disappeared, it took thirty seconds for the second light, same of the first, shows up. This event kept happening for one long hour, and suddenly the big circle flashed and just disappeared. Some of my friends still call me crazy for telling that story, but I know what I saw.<n>

It eventually went up ahead and crossed over in front of us. My husband pulled off the road and when we looked the object had changed to a huge triangle shape that hovered in a field no more than  50 feet away. It was dark so all we could see were the 3 big white lights, one in each corner. We decided to get out of there and when we started to pull away the object shot back into the sky and became a small yellowish light again and began following a plane, heading toward Memphis, TN to the northeast of where we were.  We didn&#39;t talk about the incident to anyone for about 3 to 4 weeks, and then we just sort of &#34;remembered&#34; it.<n>

It was a very large red glowing ball of light, traveling straight downward at a controlled speed, as though it intended to land. There were no other lights visible on or near the object. We observed this for about ten minutes before it finally disappeared below the horizon. I later spoke to a friend of mine about it, describing what we saw. He said it could have been a Chinook helicopter flying under simulated combat conditions. Since the sighting took place at night, there is very little possibility that it could have been a blimp. Also, there are no vertical takeoff\landing airplanes in the area. The only local airports are Hobby (civilian), Bush-Intercontinental (civilian) and Ellington Field(joint-use). The only witnesses that I am aware of were myself, my mother, and my father.<n>

We were getting ready to watch a t.v. show when all of a sudden a huge beam of light lit up the back yard. We immediately shut off the t.v. and watched in awe for a few moments until we started to get frightened. We then woke up our grandmother who came out of bed and we all walked right up to the sliding glass door in hopes to get a better look above. All of a sudden the light started to pan from side to side. Thinking rationaly about the situation as I always do when wierd things happen I thought it might just be a helicopter. Unforntunately I had to throw that thought out the window due to the fact that it was absolutely SILENT. I wanted to go out side to get a better look, but I knew my grandmother wouldn&#39;t have allowed it.

I was shooting skeet on either Wednesday or a Thursday night with a squad of 5 others when we took notice of what we first thought was an aircraft as it was moving slowly and apparently not at a high elevation from our perspective.  Gradually we noticed that what we first thought were the aircraft landing lights were pointing to the rear instead of forwards.  There was a light ice fog somewhat diminishing visibility but soon we noticed that the lights were in fact flames as the meteor slowly transited the sky.  Frankly we were all slightly stunned at the unusual sight.  After several minutes we went back to our skeet round, I kept an eye on the object until it disappeared over the Chugach mountains behind Palmer, AK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I heard reports that the object was sighted by many including Airline crews. From our perspective it appeared quite low so I would estimate the distance at between 10 to 30 miles to meet the trajectory we observed.  I was unaware that a meteor or asteroid could transit our atmosphere without hitting us but this object certainly didn&#39;t give any indication of going down, I guarantee there would have been reports if it had made landfall.  The object appeared to be the size of a large house at the closest and seemed to be a light aircraft at first.  The flames as the material ablated behind were unusual and unique.  The trail of flames was no more than three or four times the length of the object itself.<n>

We were on a family reunion celebrating the nearing Christmas Day. I was sitting in the balcony of the house looking at the sky when a flashing white light appeared. It looked like the strobe of a plane but it had a very dinstinctive motion. Everytime the light flashed the object would appear to be static but in the next flash the object would have moved to a new location in it&#39;s path of travel (like forming a dotted line). When the strobes of a plane flash the motion of the plane is visible on the flash, this was not the case. Also there were no other lights in the object like a plane has.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light object was moving east to west on the south side of the sky. I told my uncle &#34;DS&#34; to look at the light and I told him that it didn&#39;t looked like a normal aircraft because of the strange motion. He replied jokingly that it may be an ufo and we both laughed at the idea. I told him also that I was seeing that same aircraft every night for almost a month travelling on the same course and that it would return back a few minutes later after it dissapears. About 10 minutes later it dissapeared in the western side of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I told &#34;DS&#34; 5 minutes after dissapearing it appeared again, this time traveling west to east from it&#39;s last position. &#34;DS&#34; told me that it was really strange that the aircraft was turning back again, then he told me that maybe it was a patrol aircraft guarding the coast for drug boats. Another uncle &#34;DP&#34; told us that maybe it could be a police helicopter patrolling the area, this was possible because there was a narcotics police department in our neighborhood and it had a helicopter landing pad and landings were frequent. But usually the helicopter would have it&#39;s searchlifht on when it was on the area and there was no sign of a searchlight. Again the light object dissapeared, but this time in the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then around ten minutes later, 2 identical lights apeared on the eastern sky traveling on the same course to the west side by side, this time all the people in the balcony was curious about what were those lights. Again the lights dissapeared on the wertern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 15 to 20 minutes later both lights reappeared on the western sky going to the east, but this time a third light appeared almost at the same time from the east going west in the same course. When the three lights were next to each other, one of the lights going to the east changed direction and joined the light that was going to the west, the other light remained on it&#39;s east course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so suddenly a big light apeared west near the two western going lights, it was like the apparent size of a marble but it&#39;s distance was more than a mile away this light was static unlike the others and wasn&#39;t flashing, it also had a yellow glow instead of the white glow of the little lights, it made a sound I&#39;ve never heard before, the most close relation would be like a metallic cracking sound mixed with  an electric sound. the light remained in the same position in the sky for about half a minute or so. The two small lights moved towards it and dissapeared inside the big light, then the big light dissapeared in the same position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 9 people sitting in the balcony watching the event, and everyone was terrified after the big light appeared. There was total silence for almost a minute, and nobody was able to talk because of the shock. My aunt &#34;MI&#34; almost fainted because of the shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes: During one of the times I watched the lights before that day, there was also a plane in the sky. The movement behavior of the light was totally different from the plane, also the &#34;strobe&#34; flashing timing was totally different from the aircraft, the flash duration was longer than in the aircraft and the flash timing was slower than that on the aircraft. Also the aircraft course was different being from the northeast to the soutwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother, sister, and myself were returning from my sister&#39;s Christmas program. We were headed east from town and were near the cemetary. We looked south and saw a large triangular shaped object. It was moving slowly and silently above the tree tops. It appeared to be about one hundred feet in length. The object was black and had three white lights on it-one on each corner. It had a bluish light in the center. We  slowed down to watch it as it moved towards the southwest. We apparently experienced missing time because when we got home it was almost 11:00 PM. That means it would have taken us 2 hours to go a distance of half a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was walking home from work about 8-9pm, 12/18 for a fact, possibly &#39;94, &#39;95, or&#39;96 ...going down Lexington Ave in Midtown NYC...walking by like 29th or 28th street in front of Rocky&#39;s Bar, when I saw several people and 4 Cops looking straight up into the sky... I almost kept walking...but something in me said, &#34;no look, don&#39;t be an idiot&#34; ... so I followed their eyes up, up, up and WOW!  way up beyond what seemed for some reason like fake clouds was a HUGE plane-like triangleish shape with several lights at various points (which might have blinked different colors) which when I connected the dots in my mind the first thought I had was:  Space Shuttle.  But this was MUCH, MUCH bigger, at about 1000 feet up I could bracket it with my hands being about 8 inches apart... As more people walked by some stopped till there were about 20 people watching....just looking at each other and oohing and aahing and saying  &#34;oh my god&#34;  &#34;oh my god&#34; ... the 4 cops were shaking their heads, shuffling their feet,  and putting their hands on their heads like they were wondering whether or not they were going to report this...or just agree to all keep their mouths shut... one Cop next to me looked at me and we shook our heads and he said...&#34;Definitely a UFO&#34;  and I said &#34;definitely a UF Something&#34; ... after about 5 minutes or so, the craft started rising up into the sky and it got smaller as it rose and went completely out of sight into the clouds or fog...  I started walking home amazed...it had been my 3rd UFO sighting (my first being &#39;78/79 over Poughkeepsie, NY) and  by far the best....a few blocks down was a guy standing outside the old Tom O&#39;Reilly&#39;s bar across from the Armory on Lexington &amp; 26th...he was looking straight up with his hands forming a viewfinder ar! ound his eyes as if to focus better... I started to ask him &#34;HEY, did you see...&#34;  when he cut me off and said something like &#34;that big thing in the sky? yeah!  Did you?  Were you up there (pointing to where I&#39;d been) by all the cops?&#34;   I said yeah! wasn&#39;t that amazing? and he went &#34;YEAH!&#34;  And then a buddy of his came out of the deli next door and he screamed his name and said that he&#39;d just saw something up in the sky and that I had to and had been standing a couple blocks away with about 20 people including 4 cops...and I confimed that to his friend and we were both very excited and pumped up...and at that, as though he at least now had a friend as a witness who had at least witnessed me confirming the sighting and the crowd and the cops, he went running back into the bar screaming &#34;HEY GUYS!  HEY GUYS! ....&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

He took me to Bassett to introduce me to a cousin of his for a possible date with her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some chatting with her and her father we decided to drive back to Ainsworth which is about 17 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time we left her house it was dark with no moon visible. It was also a very clear, crisp December night with no wind, ( unusual for NE!!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way home I noticed an unusually bright star in the North West, more West than North.  The closer we came to town, the closer this light seemed to be.  It did not appear to move, and the closer to town we came, the higher up it appeared.  As if it were stationary and we were approaching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time we were about ¾’s of the way home I pointed this out to my friend and it sparked his curiosity.  We continued to watch it until we were 1 mile outside of Ainsworth.  At that time I asked him if he would turn off onto a country road leading north.  He did, and we drove 1 mile north, turned back West and drove about ¼ mile then stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat with the pickup running and observed this bright light in the sky for about 30 seconds.  We were the only vehicle on the road since this is a very rural area.  At our vantage point, the only other lights in our immediate area were distant yard lights and the other stars in the sky, not to mention the soft glow from town.  He mentioned that it looked like a light from a helicopter searchlight and I agreed, it looked like it was about 500 feet up and about ½ mile to the Northwest of us.  It was at this moment that he shut off the pickup and the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 second after he killed the lights, the light in the sky literally turned off!  We sat there stunned for about 1 minute looking at where it had been, we started to see a light again, but it was faint.  It grew brighter and brighter until it was as bright as it was before.  I rolled down my window to see if I could hear an engine or something, but it was dead silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend got very nervous and said, &#34;We’re gettin’ the hell out of here!&#34;  He started up the pickup turned on the lights and high-tailed it to town.  We both lived in town at the time, so he dropped me off, didn’t say a word about it and he went home.  He still lives here and hasn’t said anything about that night since then.  I was honestly still a little freaked out about it so I called the sheriff’s office to see if there were any reports about strange lights.  The dispatcher said there had been no reports.  I managed to lie down and get a little sleep that night, but when I woke at 6:30 the next morning the light was still in the sky, except it was more in the West.  It remained in the Westerly sky until I went to bed the next night and I have not seen it since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some days, months, and years after I have asked certain close friends of mine if they saw anything unusual around that time, but none have admitted to seeing anything.  I don’t claim that this was an alien spacecraft, but it was the strangest thing I’ve ever seen, and I think I speak for my friend too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for the opportunity to tell about my experience.<n>

It seemed to be quite low in the sky.  As I stood there for about 30 seconds staring at it, it began to stretch and elongate to a cigar shape and then took off to the south at an incredible speed which made it seem to stretch even farther.

We were both intrigued and frightened so when we returned home, I called several places to check for reports or meteor showers and such. No one had called in and there were no meteor showers.

It was almost midnight and we were just bs-ing and all of the sudden this aircraft lite up in the sky. It did not come from anywhere. It must have been just hovering over the ocean waiting for the ship to pass and than it lite up all its lights and was just floating there. It had different color lights on it, red, blue, white. There was no sound or smoke coming from it. It wasn&#39;t far from the ship but it was behind us so I told the deck seaman to call up to the bridge and ask if they could see anything on their radar. The bridge said they could not see any aircraft. Than all of the sudden this aircraft took off light a bolt of lighting. It did not just go up straight. It was zig zagging but it looked like it traveled over a thousand miles in just a split second. Both of us just shook our heads and said to one another, &#34;I didn&#39;t see anything, did you. I never believed in UFO&#39;s until than. I highly doubt that the USGovernment has a top secret flying machine that doesn&#39;t make any noise, and flys 1000 times faster than the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Object would change shape and size and brightness/intensity. Also would change colors - white, red, orange, yellowish - no specific pattern/no consistency. Light got smaller and smaller and faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While flying from Portland Or. to Burbank, Ca. I noticed a white light outside the aircraft.  It did not resemble another aircraft - no strobes or consistant light patterns. This was just one light - which would change shape (from large ball to a much smaller defined point of light). Object seemed to fly alongside our plane for about 45 minutes.  It was really fascinating and as it changed shape it would also fade in and out of different colors. It went through shades of red, orange, yellow, and very bright white.  This whole time I could see other aircraft along other routes and this object did not resemble or act like any of them and it was not a planet or star (too low on horizon).  It always seemed to stay a consistant distance (hard to judge because it was so dark) yet it would morph into these different shape/color phases. The patterns of color and shape were not consistent and differed throughout the whole time.  I asked the person ahead of me on the plane if they could see it - they acknowledged they could and I told them to watch it for a while.  I noticed that person looking out at it occasionally yet they never said anything about it. Eventually the light seemed to start getting smaller and smaller (like a pinpoint of light) and it eventually disappeared - as if turned off!  It was really quite interesting and I am happy to have witnessed something like that. I have flown many times at night and have NEVER seen anything like that. It behaved like no aircraft I have ever flown on or seen while flying - it was really quite amazing!<n>

We were young, 11, 11 and 10 at the time.  It was a clear crisp night and we could see what seemed like millions of stars in the night sky, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked northward of our community towards the other side of the bay.  Above the ice starting from around 200-300 feet in the air I saw a big blue fireball and told my friends to look.  It seemed to come from behind the west hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled from west to east and didn&#39;t seem to make any noise, all the while descending.  It descended slowly, by the time it made it behind the east hill it looked to be about 50 feet in the air.  It travelled at about 20 kilometers an hour, very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about 15-30 seconds.  It then disappeared behind the east hillside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited to hear a big bang so to speak but there was none.  Even with my child logic, I was expecting to hear it hit hard and maybe even shake the ground a little bit, but nothing happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that we decided we better go home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I lost visual after I made the turn north towards Lordsburg.  I had been driving West on I10 in a rented U-hall truck in clear weather on a sunny day when I notice an object to my left which seemed to be traveling at the same speed, 60 mph, I had been traveling.  I know it sound strange but it seemed to be purposely following my vehicle at a distance of about a half mile on my left, at times I was the only vehicle on the road.  At first I thought it was a silver weather balloon as it seemed to float, however, it continued at a constant height less than 1,000 feet above ground.  The shape was constantly changing, I could not say if it was round or a crushed beer can shape or crumbled paper shape, or flat or what as it consistently hanged shape at random.  No sounds emitted from the vehicle, no lights were visible. As I passed a small town it was hard to believe that the locals could not see it as it was very low.  As I came into the town the object disappeared behind structurs and water towers and more than one point it would disappeare behind small hills only to return after we passed the hill. It left as it suddenly lifted up and out of site at a very fast speed. The time and date are the best I recall. I was moving from Georgia to California at the time so the exact date was recored by the rental.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ten seconds later, it happened again.  Then, approximnately 10 minutes later, as they were driving west on Rte. 101, they looked back to the same area and witnessed the same phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their impression was that the light was being radiated from a solid object, that was sitting on the ground, out of sight, beside the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several other vehicles on the road at the time.

Multiple lights on it.|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01032.html|57|ndxe199512| She was driving west of Waukesha, WI, and saw a &#34;shooting star&#34; descend vertically, suddenly stop its descent, then shoot &#34;forward&#34; and disappear.  Even though she saw it for only 2 seconds, she got a good enough look at it to believe that it had lights of some sort on it, not lights that one would expect to see on a shooting star.  Case was forwarded to Richard Thieme, MUFON SD, and I called him with a follow-up call.  He had already talked to the woman and surmised it might be a C-172 in the pattern of a local airport, but reconsidered after our talk.<n>
