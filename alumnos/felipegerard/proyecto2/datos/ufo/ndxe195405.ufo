I lived on a farm east of Quincy, Il.  One morning at approximately 04:30 A.M., I woke up as my father had left the hallway light on and it was shining in my bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had gotten up early to go plow.  As I laid there looking out the window, a saucer shaped craft floated by my bedroom window going from south to north.  It made no noise as the window was open. It had red and white pulsating lights around the rim of the craft and a lighted dome on top,  My father was at the fuel tank fueling the tractor and he saw it also.  It was still dark outside, so when he started the tractor and turned on the lights, the thing took off northbound at a high rate of speed.  At approximately 06:30 A.M., a neighbor came by our house all exited and claimed he had seen it too and that it had landed in a field across from his house.  He said there were three circular imprints in the spot where it landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
