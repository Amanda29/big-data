Riverside Plaza right near the Sears Tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only saw it for a seconds because it zoomed off fast with bright lights. I called Meigs field, but no answer, then I called O&#39;hara airport and they said that they did not have any solid returns on the radar screen to support our sighting, but it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember this sighting because it was my B-day.<n>
2/28/02 22:30|Liverpool (UK/England)||Triangle|1 30 seconds to minute ap|dull red traingle forming lights seen travelling north to south in liverpool|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22167.html|2|ndxe200202| dull red traingle forming lights seen travelling north to south in liverpool<n> <n><n> <n><n> i reside a very short distance from one of liverpool&#39;s city parks, princes park. I was out walking the dog and was heading in a clockwise direction around the small man made lake when i noticed  three dull redlights in the sky in an unequal triangle formation. there was partial cloud cover and a break in the cloud allowed a fairly clear view of the stars. plieides, taurus, orion on view, although a fine cloud mist still blaked out the background stars. there was a lot of air traffic - four planes moving at normal speed, but a lot of jet noise. at first i assumed the red lights were plane lights but the formation was moving at exactly the same speed and had no additional standard aircraft lights as did the other planes. the lights appeared to be part of one extremely large craft that was moving far faster than the assumed passenger planes(liverpool airport is a short distance away and there is usually high air traffic) the planes, two of which were going in approximately the same direction(south &amp; possibly chasing) were still on view well after the ufo had dissappeared into cloud. this meant that the object was travelling at least two to three times as fast as the planes, although did not &#39;zip&#39; out of sight. furthermore, as i was almost around the lake two more dull red lights slowly appeared at the front end of the triangle seemingly forming the shape of two unequal triangles tip to tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it is viable that the lights were from five individual military jets, but they were travelling very quickly and seemed to be lower than the other  planes, although i am not certain of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> if the object was one craft, then it was huge. it was above the cloud base, but semed to dissappear into it, as did the planes due to the &#39;whispy&#39; nature of the cloud it was heading into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> n.b. i have also seen a similar thing several years ago whereby when reclining in another park, sefton park, during partial cloud cover two white lights travelling at the same speed flew by at the same speed. this was for about ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> to clarify...the red lights where the same approx perceived size as medium intensity stars.<n>

Saw a single white light that looked like a star, not moving in the North sky. As it was a clear night I didn&#39;t think anything of it, looked away for less then a min looked back and object was gone. None planes or other aircraft were heard around the area. Total time I saw it less then one min. There was some interferance while using a cell phone around that same time<n>

Yellowish/Orange.  Much bigger than a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was moving southward once it appeared and then completely disappeared for about 10-15 seconds then reappeared just as bright but slightly lower to the horizon then the first time seen.  It vanished each time like it went behind clouds; however there were no clouds in the sky.  A clear sky, of which one can see the stars very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second viewing only lasted about 10 seconds and vanished just like the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reappeared for the third time but in a different path to which it was previously moving and much further away like it was a totally different object.  The appearence was exactly the same.  It stayed the same brightness for about 5-7 seconds and vanished.  The size of the light was very large.  It did not blink or change colors at all.  The windows of the vehicle were closed so whether it had sound, we could not tell.  There were other planes in the sky at the same time so we hope someone else had seen what we seen.  Truely amazing and we had never seen anything like it before!<n>
2/28/02 20:00|Dumfries (UK/Scotland)||Circle|unknown|bright orange lights in the sky|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22076.html|5|ndxe200202| bright orange lights in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> it wasent accually me who witnessed the ufos but it came from a very trusted friend who i would trust my life on him.  there have been many sitings around dumfries recently, especialy in the rural areas. my friend noticed at the side of his eye a bright object hovering between 1300 and 1500 feet in the air producing a huming sound. the bright light seemed to come and go as if the light was rotating. he also says that it very slightly changed colour. this ufo was soon met with another. this one looked the same but flew away at an atonishing acceleration with little noise. you may think this is a hoax but i assure you, my friend was very sceptical of ufo&#39;s untill then, and he is a very close friend who i know would not lie about this or axagerate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> other sightings that i have seen is orange lights in the sky. i have saw a few of them. one time i was outside getting tools from my dads van when i saw a bright orange light in the sky, it looked like a star but noticeably closer and brighter. after watching it for a few minutes i went inside to get my torch. when i came back out the dot had dissapered. this has happend about 4 or 5 times and it seems more and more likely to be something intelcuall e.g. the last couple of sightings were very close to the village i live in, 1 mile or less away, and seemed to move across the sky when i either walked or decide not to look at it. this is not some eye trick as i sat at a bus shelter at 5:30am in the morning before going to work one day, when it was still dark, and i saw one of the orange lights. it seemed to come out of nowhere because i had been looking at the sky before hand and never noticed it. I sat watching it, and it only moved to a different location in the sky when i did not look at it. these distances were probably around 0.66 to 1 mile apart. it was difinately not any type of air craft i have ever seen and it certinly never acted like one. e.g no engine noise, it seemed to &#34;hover&#34; and moved large distances in short periods of time.<n>

I studied it a while then finally look at my friend and said that&#39;s not an airplane look. she looked and freaked out saying oh my gohs,we watched it.. it had 3 white lights in a triangle form with a red light in the middle  it was close to the ground and going really fast. then it just stopped and we kept going. I watched it and it looked far away so fast ..we didnt stop just said that was a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Note date of February 29, which is not valid for 2002.  Possible hoax??  PD))<n>

A close contact with me told me about her sister who works at NBC and last week(story was told to me on 3/6/02) her sister and others at NBC saw a ufo hovering in the sky near the sears tower.  She said they taped it for around 45 minutes.  I watched the news but heard nothing about it.  Maybe this message can help corroborate an eyewitness account.<n>
2/28/02 03:00|Denton|TX|Unknown|3 minutes|Slow moving aircraft that would change lights from white to red, and made a quiet droning sound.|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22058.html|8|ndxe200202| Slow moving aircraft that would change lights from white to red, and made a quiet droning sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work at about 2:30 in the morning. Out of my window I saw a high flying object that was a blinking red light. Out of my window the object appeared to be moving in an eratic pattern, no set course. I thought that this was probably an illusion because of the motion of my vehicle. I continued to watch the object however. On getting closer to my house, I saw another one of these objects. This one was closer. I could make out 3 blinking lights, that seemed to blink in a pattern. This object did not appear to fly eratically, but the blinking of the lights appeared almost in a revolving motion. In addition, flying lower than this object, looked to be a slow moving passenger plane. It had the front white headlights of an airplane. All of a sudden, the white headlights turned off and the object was blinking red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally got to my house and it was 3 o&#39;clock in the morning. I was extremely hopeful I could get a good look at one of these objects on the ground. Then off in the distance I saw a slow moving object with two white headlights coming toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it appeared to be a plane, moving at a set flight path. The object dropped altitude and continued to come closer. Once it got closer, the object appeared to turn, but it did not turn at an angle like a plane. It appeared to make a horizontal right turn. At the instant it made the turn, the white lights shut off and red blinking lights came on. I made out 4 red blinking lights. The object flew low and parallel to my house. As it flew by it made sort of a quiet droning noise. Hard to describe the noise because I&#39;ve never heard a plane make that monotonous sound before. I could not make out the outline or shape of the aircraft. I would estimate its size to be about that of a small jetliner (737), but again, that is hard to determine, based on the fact that the red lights were all blinking from the rear. The object never displayed both white and red lights congruently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This aircraft was very mysterious and interesting to watch. This is just speculation, but this aircraft seemed almost as if it was trying to simulate an airplane. That night, I saw 3 of these objects. The longest duration was at my house for approximately 3 minutes.<n>

State Street, Feb. 27, 2002, about 19:00 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were at the Office Max Store on E.State St., in Rockford, IL.. When we left the store my husband noticed 1 large disk shaped UFO above E. State and told me to look at it. It was large; about 30 feet across, and seemed to be of a dark color that was not highly visable at night. When it listed to the side a bit, we could see underneath it, and there was one large round light in the middle; not beaming outward - but just lit. There was no sound from the ship at all, and it disappeared in just a couple of seconds. (we were able to watch it for abour 3 min. before it left. But it disappeared into no where in 2 seconds when it took off.) Did anyone else see this ship? We&#39;ll be watching this site for more reports from other people in that area of Rockford, Feb. 27th, 2002.<n>

From my front porch facing the oceanside of the island I observed 2 sets of double lights.  Each set ran vertically and was rotating clockwise.  At first it looked like two planes circling each other but they were too close.  The lights were on for approximately 2-3 seconds then blinked off and on again in a different part of the circle as both sets moved south.  I observed 3 flashes as they moved south.  The fourth and last set of lights there were approximately 10-12 sets of double lights.  Each set ran vertically only this last time they made a half circle that was moving clockwise.  They were closer together than the first 3.  Kind of like a double chain or a rollercoaster.  There was no sound at any time and it took less than 2 minutes.  The lights were a light yellow in color, almost white.  They made no streaks as they moved.  I could not see anything but the lights.  It was too dark.<n>

I was out in my backyard when about 6-8 white lights suddenly appeared. They were all in a line and seemed to float in the air for a few min. before they started to move North to South. The sky was clear and there was very little wind and there was no sound of jets, helicopters, and prop planes. I had enough time after watching them float to run inside and yell to my wife to come down and see them. She was really excited and we both watched them increase in speed and move out of sight. We also both made an observation that kind startled us both. As the lights moved away from us they seem to make up the outline of a much larger ship. When they were above me I only saw the lights with clear sky in back of them, not the outline of a ship. But again as it moved away it looked, as those lights were again the outline of a larger ship. I have read in the past about a sighting here in Phoenix of the Arizona Lights, but these lights were bright white and blinked in a pattern that was sometimes random and sometimes one right after the other. Did anyone get a better look?? Has anyone see anything like this. Thanks<n>

They looked to be about the distance apart of one centimeter held at arms length.  The two white lights with hints of many more smaller lights between and around, likely part of the same object, moved to the left and then stopped dead before moving back to the right and continued in that direction untill it was out of site about 15-20 seconds later.  The two lights stayed the same distance apart and at the same horizontal orientation to each other which rules out a plane banking. As its direction changed the one in the lead that was the brightest grew darker, and the one now in the lead grew brighter.  Its position in the sky was very close verticaly to the tree line on the other side of a clear cut that is about 500 meters across. The object was in my opinion about 1/2 mile away.  There was no sound at all or blinking running lights like you see on all aircraft.  If it was a rescue helicopter from CFB Comox (the largest helicopters in the area) it would have been fairly loud from that distance and it moved unlike any fixed wing aircraft commercial/private/or military.  Im located just on the outskirts of Courtenay B.C. to the west of town and I was looking north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM SUBMITTED MARCH 23, 2002))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oops.  I submitted another report to try update my first report.  Then I saw it said to email updates, so<n> <n><n> here it is.  I went into further detail on certain points, and I also belive that I now know what kind of craft it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I saw two bright lights moving in an unconventional fashion.  When I first noticed the light it was behind a group of trees that was blocking my view.  I moved my head around to get a better look through the branches. After 20-30 seconds I gave up and continued with my smoke.  A half minute later I looked back at it to see if it had moved enough for me to see it better.  It had moved, to the left of the group of trees.  I was curious what it was because it was brighter than a plane.  As I studied it I noticed that it was actualy two lights close together. They looked to be about the distance apart of 1 centimeter held at arms length.  The two white lights had hints of many more smaller lights or possibly a reflection between the two.  It moved slowly to the left and then stopped dead before moving back to the right(it didn&#39;t seem to excelerate, or decelerate. It was just moving or it wasn&#39;t, with no in between speed) and continued in that direction until it was out of site about 15-20 seconds later.  The two lights stayed the same distance apart and at the same horizontal orientation to each other which rules out a plane banking. As its direction changed the one in the lead that was the brightest grew darker, and the one that NOW was in the lead, grew brighter.  Its position in the sky was very close vertically to the tree line on the other side of a clear cut that is about 500 meters across from my backyard. The object was in my opinion about 1/2 mile away, but could have been much further as its size was hard to judge.  There was no sound at all(it was a very quiet night) or blinking running lights like you see on all aircraft.  If it was a rescue helicopter from CFB Comox (the largest helicopters in the area) it would have been fairly loud from that distance and it also moved unlike any fixed wing aircraft Commercial/private/or military I can think of.  Im located just on the outskirts of Courtenay B.C. to the west of town and I was looking north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I reported this I found a video on the net of a sighting from Belgium of a triangle shape ship.<n> <n><n> There video shows it from below, and also from the side.

I was to excited the first time, and I now belive I know what kind of ship it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -update- I saw two bright lights moving in an unconventional fashion.  When I first noticed the light it was behind a group of trees that was blocking my view.  I moved my head around to get a better look through the branches. After 20-30 seconds I gave up and continued with my smoke.  A half minute later I looked back at it to see if it had moved enough for me to see it better.  It had moved, to the left of the group of trees.  I was curious what it was because it was brighter than a plane.  As I studied it I noticed that it was actualy two lights close together. They looked to be about the distance apart of 1 centimeter held at arms length.  The two white lights had hints of many more smaller lights or possibly a reflection between the two.  It moved slowly to the left and then stopped dead before moving back to the right(it didn&#39;t seem to excelerate, or decelerate. It was just moving or it wasn&#39;t, with no in between speed) and continued in that direction until it was out of site about 15-20 seconds later.  The two lights stayed the same distance apart and at the same horizontal orientation to each other which rules out a plane banking. As its direction changed the one in the lead that was the brightest grew darker, and the one that NOW was in the lead, grew brighter.  Its position in the sky was very close vertically to the tree line on the other side of a clear cut that is about 500 meters across from my backyard. The object was in my opinion about 1/2 mile away, but could have been much further as its size was hard to judge.  There was no sound at all(it was a very quiet night) or blinking running lights like you see on all aircraft.  If it was a rescue helicopter from CFB Comox (the largest helicopters in the area) it would have been fairly loud from that distance and it also moved unlike any fixed wing aircraft commercial/private/or military I can think of.  Im located just on the outskirts of Courtenay B.C. to the west of town and I was looking north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I reported this I found a video on the net of a sighting from Belgium of a triangle shape ship.  There video shows it from below, and also from the side.  When shot from the side you can only see two lights, again with more small lights or a reflection connecting them.  I belive this is the same type of ship that I observed.<n>

It looked like a plane, but for the lights to be that bright we would have had to be within 100 yards of it. The light appeared to be a couple of miles away. We went behind a hill for about a half mile &amp; when we could see to the south again it was still there. Using the lights from the windmills on the hills (approx. one mile to our south) to position it, it appeared to be stationary. We continued to travel east, and after about a minute, the one large very bright light changed to two smaller lights. When that happened we could make out the shape a little better. It seemed to be oblong &amp; shone silver in the reflection of its lights. There almost seemed to be a long skinny pipe coming out of the bottom at an angle. It was too far away to estimate size. We drove for about another mile and at the bottom of the hill, when the object was directly to our right, there was a road heading straight towards it. The object appeared to stay stationary this whole time. We turned right and slowed to a stop, about 20-30 yards down the road. However, as soon as our headlights swung around to point in the direction of the object, the two lights went out. Within a few seconds a small red light and a small blue light appeared and began blinking like a normal airplane would. The lights then moved off west-northwest (not towards the airport in Tri-Cities) very, very rapidly. Faster than a small plane like a Cessna could travel. We didn&#39;t hear any noise during any of this time.<n>

These objects when they did move it was at a rapid speed.

I was alone.  It caught my attention as unusual.  As I watched, it changed back into what appeared to be one star.  It wasn&#39;t as if the lights merged; it was as if some lights were shut off.  Next it appeared to be a regular, but bright star with a thin &#34;X&#34; light shine pattern coming out of it.  Went back to the &#34;ball&#34; shape.  An arm of light appeared to project off of it, making it look kind of like a long, thin arrow.  The light didn&#39;t appear to be projected, but again as if it were turned on.  A few times there appeared to be a gap between the arrow tail (the ball) and the shaft of the arrow.  It was moving in a northerly direction, but very, very slowly.  The &#34;arrow&#34; seemed to point easterly.  There was no noise, and the light appeared to be quite high up, but I don&#39;t know, as the light was all I could see (no outline of any shape).  The &#34;ball&#34; part of the light looked about the size and intensity of Venus in the night sky.  There was a very, very faint aura of light around the object.  I phoned my son to ask him to go view it, but he had company, he said it was probably a satellite, and he refused to go look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:15 PM As at the first sighting, the look of this object wasn&#39;t constant; it changed.  A few times it appeared to project a very thin green &#34;X&#34; light pattern off of the ball of light.  The shaft of the arrow would appear and disappear.  At times there appeared to be a red light at the tip of the arrow.  At times it appeared to project thin green lights that gave it a diamond shape, with one tip of the diamond being at the &#34;ball&#34; and the other tip being at the end of the &#34;shaft&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:54 PM It appeared much the same as 11:15 PM.  It had moved higher in the sky (more easterly).  I could see it moving, but the movement was very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2:20 AM Still fluctuating between showing the different light patterns as described above, mostly appearing as a star-colored ball with a shaft of light from it.  It wasn&#39;t like a searchlight being projected, but like lights being turned on.  Still quite close to the same location as 11:54.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3:10 AM The object had moved way off to the north and was quite a bit lower in the sky than at 11:35.  At this point the lights appeared to be pulsating.  The ball was red, and the shaft was green, then they would trade colors.  There didn&#39;t appear to be a set rhythm to the color changes.  After this, I went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At each observance, I watched the object for approximately ten minutes, but it was close to 30 degrees on my front porch (facing west), so I couldn&#39;t stay outside long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At noon today there appear to be some &#34;clouds&#34; -- fanned con trails? -- that have strange patterns to them... then don&#39;t sweep straight across the sky like a con trail, but curve.  They are close to where I saw the object, almost tracing the object&#39;s path, but lower.<n>

It looked really bright. at first we thought it was green when we were sitting in our car and seen that it was moving in kind of a triangle shape then it would dissapear and then a few seconds like mybe 30 seconds would go by and it would come back. we got our telescope out and was looking at it and it was like a rectangle with a clear but shadow lin very thin running in the middle of it. on the right side it was like dots connected together with a bright electrical blue color. and on the left side it was like three thick shadow like lines connected together. it would sit there like that for a bit then all of a sudden the right side the electrical lines would fade and the shadow like lines on the left ould start movingg in different directions kinda slowly all over the figure with a strange pace to it. and then it would dissapear and come back.and the thing would do the same thing over again.but as we were watching this there was another craft that came along on the right side of us and it looked like a plane at first but it was really low to the ground and did not make as much noise as a plane and there were no blinking lights on it and the lights looked real bright like it was nothing but one big light that never blinked or flickered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The first possible explanation of the sighting to be ruled out, we believe, would be some kind of celestial body.

The sound is so deep and rumbling that it does not sound like conventional aircraft. The first time I went outside to try and see where it was coming from,I stared up at the sky for almost 15 minutes - but saw nothing. This evening I was leaving my friend&#39;s house in Placentia around 9:45 pm. I heard that same noise. As I reached the parking lot, I stared up at the sky and observed two white lights. The lights struck me as being MUCH too far aprt to be the lights on a conventional airliner. It was impossible for me to tell how high this thing was. I didn&#39;t see anything in between the two lights. The craft was cruising in a westward direction. When it got about 2 -3 miles away it abruptly switched directions and went south, then it switched again and came back east in my direction. I may have lost sight of it behind some trees, but when I saw it again, it was now two flashing red lights which seemed to continuously change their position in relation to one another. And the lights were not like the type you&#39;d see on a plane, they had kind of a jittery, laser like quality. The two lights became 4 or 5, and were forming various triangular shapes with one another. The way they moved was erratic, not at all in a linear fashion. They seemed to join back together to create one light and headed off in a northeasterly direction. My friend remarked that he had never seen any plane move that fast. I feel that I was lucky to have seen a craft at all, because as I mentioned usually when you hear that loud rumbling noise, you do not see anything that could be creating it. As a matter of fact, my friend&#39;s husband was leaving for work one morning recently and heard that same noise, and despite standing there for 10 minutes and staring at the sky,he saw nothing. Sure would like to know what it was.<n>

When I was in high school, my best friend and I were driving around on country roads in rural nebraska (we didn&#39;t have much to do)  There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the cool night sky.  Something caught our eye... it was a bright light in the sky.  We couldn&#39;t tell what it was, but we decided it wasn&#39;t a star and it wasn&#39;t a plane so I drove closer to it.  As we got closer the light became brighter and more visible.  The light became clearer as we got closer.  The light was actually 6-8 lights in a very precise circle pattern hovering in the sky.  We estimated it was no more than a few hundred feet in the air.  At our closest point we stopped the car to get out and look, shut off our headlights so we wouldn&#39;t be noticed.  No more than a few seconds after we got out of the car the lights moved very smoothly and took only about 4 seconds or so turn into a &#34;V&#34; pattern.  Once it was in the &#34;V&#34; the object flew west so fast... it was out ! of our sights in less than 20 seconds.  Really spooked us but nothing had become of it even though I watched the news for similar sightings but apparently no one else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

At first I thought it was a flock of birds in formation but noticed no &#34;voids&#34;  between them. The object was solid as it banked/rocked (when I noticed the tailfins) across the sky. It traveled in a south bound direction  (NASA to Santa Cruz) a bit over 1/4 mi. up at approx. 50 mph. Proportionate at 50yds L x W.  Incredible!  Being close to many Air Stations/Ports I&#39;ve seen my share of planes and sea birds that fly through the night, this was by far one of the &#34;oddest&#34; occurances I&#39;ve ever seen.  I do believe in &#34;aircraft technology&#34; and can&#39;t discolse this sighting to any other explanation other than an advanced type of stealth fighter.  Although I&#39;ve never seen the stealth planes fly in person (other than TV) this craft differed in shape &amp; sound. Impressive.....<n>

I could not hear any noise other than that of my car on the road.  There were many cars driving down I-10 at 8:20 in the night.  I was traveling westbound, and the lights were moving northbound.  The lights were visible for approximately 2-3 seconds.  The lights were traveling at very low altitude based on my view, and the mountains around this area (estimation, it is pitch black around that area in the night, Fort Huachuca lies approximately 20-30 miles south of where the lights were seen - lights may have been approximately 15 miles away from F.H. and may have covered the remaining 15-20 miles in what appears to be 2 sec, this should give me a speed, correct 27K mph? ).  This was an one of the most exiting things I&#39;ve ever seen.  To describe the shape/size from my view:  ovals (based on view could have been round), appeared to be approximately 1 foot wide on the wide section, we should be able to figure out an approx. size based on information given above.  Each light appeared slightly smaller than the preceding one, based on distance I suppose.  I was driving down from an area called Texas Canon.<n>

The V&#39;s legs were at a 45 degree angle.  It was about 10-15,000 feet and was burnt orange in color with possibly globular lights on its perimeter.  As it moved I could see stars between the objects legs.   It moved in an effortless, and noiseless manner and after about 10 seconds faded and disappeared before our eyes.  The conditions were clear, and cool, with some light refraction from the city.  I have a position of trust with the government and am a true skeptic.  But I and my son saw this and it was no flight of birds, swampgas, helos, or any other aircraft.  About 20 minutes later I heard aircraft possibly on afterburners moving at high altitude in the same general direction as this craft.<n>

It was a clear night, the moon was very bright. As we were talking I looked up, and at first thought I was seeing a comet, but then I realized it was traveling much to slow. It was too big to be a satellite? So I told my friend, and he looked up and saw it to. &#34;It&#34; looked very large, it was in a rectangular shape, and it was either just in or above the atmosphere. The moon lit, it was barely illuminated. It coasted across the sky, then suddenly slowed down and changed direction. It then spread off out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was pretty amazing!  My friend and I were in disbelief of what we saw. I have seen satellites before, and I have seen pretty high up planes. This was definitely neither.<n>

We were probably about 1/8 of a mile from the Sunoco Gas Station in Putney when we saw a very bright white light in the sky that was standing still.  I said that is too bright to be a star so the farther we got down the road, it became appparent that this thing in the sky was a UFO.  We immediately pulled over to the side to the road (someone else pulled over too) and I looked up and the object was trianglar in shape with a rectangle at the horizontal end of the triangle.  There were 3 white lights in the triangle, one on top of 2 and red and green lights in the rectangle (red and green and red and green).  It was very close to the us and flew right over our heads going South.  Then it went East very quickly and went out of sight.<n>

He responded &#34;No That!&#34; Looking directly above us We saw a batton shaped object flipping end over end out of control. It looked like two spheres attached to a long cylinder. It was high altitude but appeared to be slightly larger than a jet linner. It was moving west to east. My first impression was that it was some sort of satelite or space junk falling back to earth. But then it stopped in mid stream, still flipping, and made a hard 90 degree turn to the south and vanished out of view.<n>

Just as I entered Little Falls I saw an air craft flying fairly low. I watched it for a few seconds and as it passed over my car I caught sight of another object which was a very bright, silver colored object off in the distance beyond that plane. It was very high in the sky which was mostly clear and blue except for some very high white clouds. This object appeared to hang motionless just at the base of those clouds. It hovered at a fourty-five degree angle. I saw no lights or flashing from it and it appeared quite smooth. As I drove on I had to change directions and when I finally resumed driving north again I looked up to the same area in the sky where the object had been, however it was gone.<n>

It glowed a brilliant green and illuminated the sky for a few seconds. I guessed that it was a meteor, but meteors don&#39;t glow green. It startd streaking down the sky. Unlike a meteor, it did not burn out. It hit the ground,sending a brilliant green flash into the sky, and then it was gone.<n>

When I looked I saw 3 white dots very far away in the sky.  We had seen planes flying over head before this.  The white dots seemed to go closer and further apart to each other the same way they did on 09/02/01.  Then they disapeared and we saw a red dot in the sky with our naked eyes.  Looking through the binoculers we saw that it was an oval, silverish, craft with a red center.  All together we saw 4 &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34;.

The sky was a beautiful blue with a few scattered clouds so visibility was not a problem. At first I thought it was an airplane that was reflecting the sun and I was waiting for it to fly overhead. But when it &#34;morphed&#34; into a white chevron shape and then disappeared, I was in disbelief. This object did not leave a trail at all. I noticed that the planes on that day did. I then drove west on I-80 towards La Salle and saw another object that was in the same shape as the first object. It also morphed and then disappeared. I then saw another one which also morphed and disappeared. At this point, I prayed to our Heavenly Father that with the shed blood of Jesus Christ to protect me from these &#34;Nephilim&#34;.  When I did not see another one,I started to doubt what I saw until I noticed another driver searching the sky.  This all happened in the span of about 13 minutes.<n>

I am ex-military, I have traveled around the world several times and I have always watched the skies, so I have no problem identifying aircraft, lightning, satellites, stars, and most anything else in our night skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night at approximately 0130 while making my rounds I noticed a light blue flash of light from behind a ridge line 12 miles to the south of me.  I drove up on to the small hill on the west side of the warehouse were I could see better and watched in that direction for a while (This is not the first time I have seen this happen in Wenatchee.  I saw this once before in November 1995, 30 minutes before a diamond shaped UFO flew north up the Columbia River.  This was witnessed by at least two on duty police officers.).  As I watched the surrounding area I turned on the hand held scanner that I have to see if anyone had reported seeing it but nothing was said about it.  After 30 minutes I started making my rounds again and made a note of the temperature reading at the scales, it was 34 degrees (and dropped to 32 by 0400).  At approximately 0245 I was driving on the hill on the west side of the warehouse (and watching the ridge line) when the flash occurred again in the same area but much brighter.  Again I sat and watched and again nothing happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 0300 a co-worker arrived and I told here about these flashes (She looked at me like I was crazy) and we both agreed that even though it was cloudy, it was probably to cold for lightning.  She left to check the refrigeration equipment and returned at 0345 to tell me about a door that was opened.  At this point we were sitting in our trucks with the engines off and the windows down and talking.  There was no equipment running and no one else on this side of the building, so it was very quiet out.  As we were talking I was facing east towards the Columbia river, her truck was pulled up to my truck about 2 feet away, when the whole inside of here truck just suddenly flashed into a blue glow.  I turned my head towards the front of her truck and up and saw a Dark blue object, below the cloud base and over the river, that seemed to pulsate as it got brighter and then suddenly flashed and went out.  It lit up the whole area around us for about 4 seconds, and was bright enough to leave spots in my eyes for around 2 hours, but there was no sound.  Nothing else was seen the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report for 21FE02 in New Mexico.  We consider the possibility that they may be linked, in some way.

Two lights, one blue and one red either joined or the red followed closely behind the blue and streaked across the sky together EXTREMELY fast.  We stopped and rolled down our windows and there was no sound from the sky at all.  Another light appeared and I thought it might be an airplane investigating the phenomenon but suddenly a meteor-like lazer blue flash came from this object and streaked downwards for a second or two.  Two lights, one turning to return westward, came hurtling towards each other and we thought they were going to collide but when they met, one crossed behind the other and then both of them turned back and jolted across the sky.  All the lights traveled into one direction. . .northeastwardly. This experience was something I had never seen before and words cannot really do justice in describing it with mere words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previously on two separate undated occasions (about four months apart), in the same area, I was traveling with relatives (the first time this happened) and the car was hit by three separate lazer-blue beams that were probably four to five feet in diameter. When I questioned the V.L.A. supervisor, (because this had happened close to their vacinity), I was told that it had been Game and Fish people spotting deer poachers.  They were definitely not regular spotlights.  They hit the car at about a 45 degree angle at approximately three second intervalsThe second time, my granddaughter, who had been with me the first time this happened, had the same experience. . Again, when the windows were rolled down, there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 68 year old teacher with 46 years of teaching experience, presently employed at a high school in the New Mexico area. I feel that I am certainly a credible witness and would like some explanations of the phenomenon which I witnessed on these occassions.<n>

It was hard to tell its shape cause we were moveing and because it was dark but it had a red light on the front of it. A bright light shot out from under neath it (like a spot light).

After about 15 seconds a triangular shaped craft ~100yards in length emerged from behind the trees into clear skies traveling west to east.  The craft had three large, bright incandescent to slightly bluish colored lights at each point of the triangle.  The craft was completely silent and appeared to be ascending at a gradual rate.  After about 5 seconds of observation the craft simply disapeared as if it was realized that it was being watched (accompanied by a low vibrational rumbling).  I scanned the skies for an additional 15 minutes to see if i could hear the sound of jet engines overhead but no additional noises could be heard.<n>

The time of the occurance was roughly between 10:00 pm and 10:30 pm between Fargo and Hickson ND on well traveled Hwy 81 south.  There were two wittnesess to the event.  It was a Friday night, my girlfriend and I decided to go out to Hickson, ND for a few drinks and fun.  We left from Moorhead, MN (which is across the river from Fargo, ND) and proceeded across the river on the far south side of Fargo and turned on Hwy 81 south for about a 15-20 mile drive to Hickson.  Hwy 81 is a well traveled road, especially on the weekends, there are a number of small town bars that people enjoy within a radius of 20-25 miles from Fargo-Moorhead.  As we traveled down 81, we were having a calm - dissagreement about something, and noticed a group of red lights above the treen line some miles ahead(the night was clear, and black, but you could still differentiate the tree line from the sky line).  As we approached the lights stayed at the same location without moving, and became larger the closer we got.  My girlfriend asked if I saw the lights - and asked if it were a plane.  I replied that if it were a plane, it was flying very low, and incredibly slow (also, earlier that day 747 airplanes were doing touch-and-go landings at Fargo&#39;s Hector Airport- in the winter the winds are very calm - so they use the airport for training purposes - because were not the busiest location in America - but this was not a 747 on a training mission).  As we approached I slowed down (we were driving a Mercury Mountaineer) and the lights were from our left (heading south) to our right, half were red, and half blue, one solid row, no blinking/flashing of any kind.  We don&#39;t remember how many total colored lights were in the row, however we do know a few things for sure: 1.  we had not been drinking,  2.  we were of very sound mind and body,  3.  we were very rational  4. Hwy 81 is a busy road - and we were over half way (15 miles or so)to our destination ! - and ha d seen ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER VEHICLES - none from the north, south, east, or west NONE!  As we slowed down to where our vehicle was now under the object (we could see the row of colored lights right above  us) the colored  lights suddenly went off and two large - spot lights came on and lit up the entire area around us.  At that time my girlfriend put her head out the window and looked up and listened - all we could here was a dull hum - no jet engines, helicopter engines ect.  I never came to a complete stop, the vehicle was always moving but a very slow 5-15 mph once we were near and below the object.  We continued slowly until we came out from under the object - this is when we really started to wonder what it was - just a matter of seconds (10-15 maybe) we looked back and the lights were completely gone - nowhere in sight.  We turned the radio back up a little, and proceeded to Hickson - never seeing another car.  When we got to our destination, we talked to friends both seperately and together, and never mentioned a word about what we saw- it was like we were thinking about it, but for whatever reason, never mentioned anything to anyone else.  After closing, we headed back to Fargo-Moorhead, and saw numerous cars on 81 and the other adjoining roads - at that time we began discussing what we saw.  The next morning, we each took a sheet of paper and seperately drew the object from what we remembered from the previous night.  We then &#34;compared notes&#34; only to find we had both drawn virtually the same object.  I would just like to again say, we were both of sound mind and body - and still are - what ever it was - we had never seen before - and couldn&#39;t explain it.  There were too many coincidences that night - no traffic anywhere, over a 20-25 mile drive with many conecting roadways, homes and BARS, on a Friday night, just south of a community population of close to 200,000 - where nobody takes a bus - everyone owns at least one car - most have two or three, not to mention snowmobiles - it&#39;s a big deal to ! ride sno wmobiles from bar to bar is this area - no snowmobiles = ZERO activity in this area - VERY VERY VERY STRANGE.  We can&#39;t explain it, but I have an idea it wasn&#39;t a normal everday object or occurance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The craft was large, well lit, and no sound whatsoever. The size upon first spotting it was about the size of an inch at arms length. As it moved closer, it was evident to be quite large, no sound whatsoever and hovered for a time and then moved very, very slowly to the Southeast, then, did a very slow, graceful &#34;U&#34; turn and heading was North after that. Was in view for quite some time. Called out husband to observe also. Had Large, bright white light at nose, smaller green and white lights at the back of the wedge shape. Seemed very long, narrow, and large, yet no sound. Continued slowly beyond the trees until out of sight. Thought this was interesting in light of the earlier sighting we had earlier this same night of 3 bright oval objects at 20:00 not too far from our home. We were riding home and in a nearby town. Others were observing the oval objects as well. The wedge shaped craft was very graceful and beautiful. ((name deleted))<n>

Bossier, Husband and I noticed 3 very bright oval lights in &#34;stair-step&#34; formation, each one a slight distance above the other and were stationary at the time. The light from these 3 objects was very bright white and slightly pulsating. We passed a young man out on the main road in front of his house observing these objects as well and pointing. A truck on a side street nearby pulled over. We pulled over farther down the road to observe. The objects were about the size of a green pea held at arms length. No sound evident at all. We watched these 3 objects for about 10 minutes when 2 seemed to &#34;blink out&#34; and disapppear. We started our truck and headed for home and the 3rd object passed directly over us at a very low rate of speed, N. Easterly heading, no sound, bright white oval shape but upon close observation, could see band of red/green lights around center of object. A second object appeared and seemed to be a companion but was higher in altitude and appeared to be a triangle shape with white, blue, and green lights. The oval object may have been around 3,000 feet in altitude...hard to discern at night. No sound from either objects. ((name deleted))<n>

I was with my three daughters(two 17 year old twins and an 11 year old). All four of us saw multiple lighted spheres approximately 6 that were about a mile away through the woods just above the treeline. They started out in a V shape then moved to a line. I rushed home and returned with a camera about ten minutes later. The spheres were now in an L shape and still moving around. Some would fade out and disappear then reappear. They would move in all directions but stayed about the same distance from us. The spheres were a yellowish/white color. I had a similar instance occur about a year earlier in the exact same spot.<n>

At first it looked like a white round object with a metalic looking aircraft wing sticking out from the object. I was able to get one photograph of the object which shows a white triangular wing with the metalic wing going downward from the point of the triangle. One big white circle was behind the triange.  Also there was one smaller circle at the tip of one wing.  We were skeptics of UFO&#39;s until this sighting. The photo is quite clear and in color. I sent the negative to The J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies. I have the picture also didgetalized and can send it by Email.<n>

This proceded into a high pitched sound that would change octaves for a long period of time. I thought I was losing my mind so I got out of bed and went to look around the house to see if I could find what it was and my 3 acre yard was lit up like daytime. The high pitched noise would start up, then stop for 30 seconds or so and start up again. My husband also heard these sounds when he woke up so I know I wasn&#39;t dreaming. My cat was going crazy running around the house like a lunatic. My brother lives three miles away from me and we also work at the same business and when I was telling him about it the next morning I couldn&#39;t believe it but he had also heard it. I could not see any form of craft in the sky but there was a very bright light shining down. This was wild! Finally everything stopped on a dime and it was completely over with.<n>

When I decided he had been in the room long enough I went in. As I began closing up the window on my part of the room I noticed a very bright light about half a mile away resting on some trees. It was much brighter than the light that would normally come off of an airplane or from a radio tower with a warning flasher. I asked my room mate if he had seen it and said it had been there for a while and that he had been watching it with his girlfriend. For a while we just watched the constant light; it didn&#39;t appear to move at all. Then it began to float south of us for what might have been a solid minute, moving very slowly and at tree level. It then began to move up higher than the tree level, perhaps 600 feet into the air. It then continued at an extremely slow pace south and suddenly stopped and stayed suspended again for about 10 minutes. It then moved very hastily south and disappeared around the corner of our windows. The whole experience lasted about 30 minutes for myself, but my room mate maintains that he and his girlfriend had seen it at about one o&#39;clock and it was 2:30 when the object left our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at a celestial body.

It could have been an airraid siren, but I haven&#39;t heard of any reports that were given about an airraid siren test.  This happened around 2pm MST on 02/19/2002, we were standing outside of one of the Federal buildings when the so called &#39;noise&#39; started.  It sounded like wind going through a tight crack but then it changed to sounding like a siren, we couldn&#39;t tell.  We were out in the open, and the wind never ever sounded like that.  I was looking for possible aircraft that might have flown overheard but saw nothing. Weather was partly cloudy/mid 50s and a little breezy.  Other than the wind, it was a perfect day.<n>

I had quicly wet my finger and touched window as to length and width and height. being a commercial pilot, I checked the overcast height later and by perspective from finger marks drew out approximate size : length of about 3 RR box cars width of 4 and height of 2. taper from bottom to top was about 10 - 15 degrees. I estimated the velocity to between 150 to 200 MPH.  The craft was &#39;scud-running&#39; as we pilot say. Being in the &#39;scud&#39; any view of the surface color was diminished other than to say &#39;cast iron&#39;like /dark/ dull -finish  The lights did not reflect from the vessile&#39;s sid! e or tail end.

I can&#39;t say how high up they were, can&#39;t estimate size, but they were triangular to rectangular, a dull oranginsh brown color, and seemed to be reflecting the city lights or had a dull glow of their own. My initial thought was a small flock of geese, but as I watched I noted they seemed to be dancing around each other, changing positions but maintaining a close formation. As I watched, one of the objects swung out, moved to the front of the grouping, then began to accelerate to the northwest, with the others falling in behind; then the grouping accelerated out of view. What was so striking was these objects were absolutely silent, even as they accelerated. There&#39;s a fairly large air-guard base at the airport which is a couple miles north of my residence. I&#39;ve kept silent on this mainly because there have been no other reports of similar sightings in this area, and nothing about unusual phenomena reported from the air guard or airport radars.<n>

I don&#39;t know what it was but I know I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before.<n>

I looked to my left out the window and I saw an extremely bright circular light. At First I though it was a reflection from our glass ball hall light projecting onto the window, until I discovered that the hall light was turned off. The object the began to move in wierd patterns. After about 1 minute it suddenly dissapered. At this point I my heart was racing.<n>

The object had orange, green and blue lights that seemed to rotate as if the object was spinning. I called my son into the room so that he could see it and we watched as this object went from left to right as it ascended upwards into the sky. I ran into another room to get my digital camera so that I could get a photo, but my security alarm sounded and so I was distracted by trying to turn it off. The security company called to verify my password. By the time everything had calmed back down, I ran outside with my camera, but could not focus in on the object. By this time it was high up so I tryed focusing with the camera but it just disappeared. In our area, there are planes that are seen on any given night, since we live about 35 to 40 miles northeast of the airport, but make no mistake, this was no plane, no helicopter!!! There is no machine that I know of that could fly as spastic as this thing!!! The weird thing is that when my alarm sounded it was not even set!!! I must tell you that my alarm has done this in the past and without reason. I found it very strange that it sounded at the very moment I picked up my camera!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>
2/17/02 22:20|Moses Lake|WA|Light|2 minutes|Observed a strange orange light in the night sky.|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21987.html|88|ndxe200202| Observed a strange orange light in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 02/1702 at approx. 22:20 hours Local time, I was on routine patrols when I noticed a strange orange/white light in the sky over Quincy, WA. ( a town about 30 miles west of Moses Lake). I assumed it was an aircraft in the flight pattern from Wenatchee to Moses Lake, however we do not have any scheduled flights after 20:30. Because the light looked out of place, I parked and began to watch it through a pair of 10X50 binoculars. When I did this, I noticed that the light seemed to be pulsating, going from a dimmer orangish then intensifying to a larger whitish. I wondered if the light was a yard light from a farm house somewhere on top of Monument Hill located just south of Quincy, WA. however I could clearly see the silouette of the tops of the hills, and this light was obviously higher than the hills. At first the light appeared to be stationary, but then it began to move slowly along the ridge of the hill towards the town of Ephrata, WA. It appeared to move along top of the ridge for about 1 minute and then stopped, began to desend towards the hill top. I noticed that the pulsating seemed to get brighter as it began to desend, as it neared the hill top, it was just like someone turned off a light switch. It just disappeared!! I sat there for about 20 more minutes searching the skyline thinking that maybe I just lost it behind a cloud,(it was overcast that night). After about twenty minutes, I spotted the light (or one just like it) about 20 miles to the west of where I saw it desend towards the ground, the light had the same characteristics as before as it seemed to be pulsating the orange/white light. It started to travel towards the west very slowly when it also just disappeared.END<n>

These &#34;jets&#34; were flying faster than other planes, we saw one next to a regular airplane and it seemed very small, fast and agile.  We saw three going from north to south within approximatly 20 seconds of each other and then throughout the hour we saw periodic &#34;jets&#34; in in the area.  The craft did make a very quiet jet like sound.  These were much faster and more agile than normal planes.  The &#34;jet&#34; had one red light that stayed on consistantly and then a flashing red light and two white strobing lights.  The speed, agility and strobing lights are what differ from regular planes.<n>

2/17/02 18:41|Calgary (Canada)|AB|Sphere|3-5 seconds|Bright ball of light seen flying above us no more than 50 feet away in Calgary Alberta.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21914.html|91|ndxe200202| Bright ball of light seen flying above us no more than 50 feet away in Calgary Alberta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was playing basketball out in Abbeydale this evening and it was getting dark. It was quite cloudy and you coudlnt see any stars. I was with 2 other friends, and I passed the ball to one of them for him to shoot. As I did, i turned the other way and looked at my friend who was looking up. I looked up as well and saw a white ball of light that was gliding across the sky with such perfection. This lasted for about 3 seconds, and then the light seemed to fade away really quick, as if the light scattered across the sky. I have seen meteor showers, and this looked nothing like it. Whats scarey is that It was so cloudy, that if this ufo was above the clouds we would not see it. I could tell that the object was no more than 50 feet above us when if flew by. The way it moved is undescribable. It moved in a straigh line, but with perfection. It was so bright, but did not have a tail behind it. It was so close to us though, and it did not make any noise as it floated across. Whats also very wierd is that there is a sighting posted by a man from Calgary in the January section on this sight. His sighting is very similar to ours, and whats really odd is that he saw it exactly one month before we saw ours. (His sighting occured January 17th, ours was February 17th) One other thing I should add is , the reason I have the exact date AND time of the sighting is because my cell phone rang as soon as we witnessed the object, and my phone recorded the time and date of the call.<n>

My mother and I saw what at first appeared to be a plane crashing. We did not have a camera or a telescope. The oject was red with a long tail coming from it. My mom and I decided that it must be a meteor, however in a few minutes, the tail disappeared and the object began climbing up towards another object in the sky that we had not at first noticed. The two objects were beside one another for a few seconds, then one went straight up into the sky, and the second one began to descend. The one that was climbing up looked kind of like a squid because of the twin trails of smoke coming from behind it. We lost the descending one behind trees in the distance, and the ascending one became blocked from our view by the sun. There were a lot of other cars on the interstate during this event, but I do not honestly know if anyone else witnessed it. I have never seen anything like it before and didn&#39;t know where to go to research this information.<n>

Sometime after that around Winfeild she pounted out what she beleived to be a ufo, which I still beleive was a plain with two blinking lights on what would have been the wings and one in the middle. She said she had seen it for some time and it hadn&#39;t moved (give or take an hour or 2 that we where trying to find our way down those back roads) I couldn&#39;t see it so I stopped and got out and had her point it out, it still looked like a plain and was headed pretty fast opposite the direction we where driving. We get back in and head down the road and converse back and forth about it until are lights start flickering and going off, they did that for about 10 mins off and on until I turned the brights off and spead the car up, later down the road it happened again, and again an hour later. It hasn&#39;t happened since. The car is a &#39;91 mercury cougar if it helps any and there was a digital clock but it was unaffected. Nothing else was effected by the lights and we where about 15 miles from a town both ways when it first happened. The radio was going, the heater was going, the car didn&#39;t act up nothing except those lights which is scary when your stuck in the middle of no where with no light and not sure how far from home you are, eithere way I&#39;d appreciate any knowledge anyone can share on this<n>

I took a double take...then I ran downstairs and went to the front of my home and looked to see if I saw the same thing I did in the window.  It was there!

REFLECTOR SCOPE, WAITING FOR IT TO SET SO OT WOULD BE DARKER.  WE WERE LOOKING FOR DEEP SPACE OBJECTS TO ADD TO OUR CATALOG OF OBSERVED BODIES. WHILE ((name deleted/brother-in-law)) WAS LOOKING AT THE ORION NEBULA I USED THE BINOCULARS TO SCAN THE SKY, WHEN I NOTICED A BRIGHT REDDISH STAR DUE SOUTH JUST ABOVE THE HORIZON, AT ABOUT 8-10 DEGREES. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY AND SEEMED TO BE WHITE ALTERNATING RED, LIKE IT WAS PULSEING OR ROTATING.   AFTER A FEW MINUTES JIM TURNED THE SCOPE ON THE OBJECT AND TO OUR AMAZEMENT IT WAS SHOWING ALL THE COLORS OF THE SPECTRUM, WITH EVEN A GREATER DEGREE OF ROTATION.  IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING AT ALMOST THE SAME SPEED AS WITH THE EARTH&#39;S ROTATION, BUT IN A MORE NORTHERLY  DIRECTION, THE BEST THAT WE COULD TELL. AFTER ABOUT 30 MIN. I DECIDED TO GO HOME AND CALL THE LITTLE ROCK AIR BASE TO SEE IF IT WAS INDEED A WEATHER BALLOON. THEY GAVE ME THE UFO HOTLINE # SO THAT I COULD REPORT THE SIGHTING.  I CALLED AN LEFT A MESSAGE, THEN WENT BACK TO THE MTN. THE OBJECT WAS STILL THERE BUT APPEARED TO BE SLIGHTLY MORE TO THE WEST BUT STILL LOW ON THE SOUTHERN HORIZON.  WE STATED LOOKING AT OTHER DEEP SPACE OBJECTS THAT WE HAD INDENTIDIED ON OUR STAR CHARTS TO VIEW THAT NIGHT. CLOSE TO 10;30 WE NOTICED THAT THE OBJECT WAS GONE.  WE KNEW IT WAS NO STAR OR OTHER CELESTIAL OBJECT THAT WE HAD EVER SEEN. AND SINCE IT WAS &#34;NEAR&#34; LITTLE ROCK WE ASSUMED IT TO BE A WEATHER BALLOON.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WOULD JUST LIKE CONFIRMATION ON WHAT IT WAS AND IF ANYONE ELSE SAW IT.

At first I thought it was a plane because it was dark outside and the craft was far away so it really didn&#39;t grab my attention. As the craft got closer, there was still no sound. That is what really surprised me because I don&#39;t know of any plane or helicopter that doesn&#39;t make any noise. The craft then started going backwards, and I know planes can&#39;t do that. When I saw the craft do that I knew that I just had to see it. So my wife and I went outside to see it and that is when I realized that it wasn&#39;t a plane. The craft started glowing and it was definitely a trianglular shape. When the craft stopped glowing it was gone and there was no trace of it. I&#39;m not sure what it was. I don&#39;t think it was a UFO because I don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s.<n>

Spherical. Like a giant siver balloon, reflecting silver-white light reflex. I happened to look up into the south east sky at a passenger jet that had just taken off from DFW airport, that was traveling south west and that was turning further west. As I was watching the jet, the bright silver light caught my attention because of it&#39;s proximity to the jet. I thought it was a small plane and that the jet might crash into it. As I watched, the jet passed in front of it, occluding it just like one object passing in front of another one. My attention was focused entirely on the silver-white ball object that the jet passed in front of (from my perspective) at that point. Over the next two minutes, as I watched, the silver-white ball got smaller and smaller, as if it was receding in distance away from me, and it got dimmer and dimmer, and started to turn a soft shade of blue white, the same way the moon appears when seen in the sky during full daylight. It gradually got smaller and then dissapperared entirely, never changing altitude or azimuth in its relative position to my position on the ground, and then just dissappeard when it got too dim to see any longer. This was in the afternoon in full daylight, the sun was about fifteen to twenty degrees above the horizon in the opposite part of the sky. No clouds. Air traffic from DFW was clearly visible for approximately fifteen miles in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also sent you another report on almost the same phenomena, but observed on a different date.

The second one was on July 23, 2002 at about the same place in the sky at 6:10 to 6:14 pm.  I am an amateur astonomer and I own an 8in Celstron. I am accustomed to seeing space craft in orbit (ISS, SS, etc.) and even have seen the<n> <n><n> atmospheric abberation shock wave of a re-entering vehicle.   All of those things follow the physical laws of orbital mechanics. These lights that I saw, did not. Even if they were naked eye, and even if one was pretty shakey through a pair of 10 X 50 binonculars, they must fit into the category of<n> <n><n> unexplained and unidentified, at this point.  I really thought that they were genuine weather balloons with a radiosone attached, and that still could be the explaination, but at this point, I am confounded. So I figured it would be appropriate to put it into the database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

It was a clear day with a few clouds in the sky. I was parked north of the runway on Aviation Drive. I was listening to my radio shack 200 channel scanner model#20-312, which Icarry in my personal vehicle to listen to air traffic communications. The frequency for the Statesville airport is 123.05.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a Beachcraft KingAir 200 airplane takeoff on runway 28and head in a westerly direction. I viewed the take off through my binoculars a pair of bushnells model#13-7016. I had used the zoom lens to zoom in on the airplanes takeoffs (7-15/35 zoom). Using my scanner, I listened to student pilots getting clearances fo their takeoffs and landings. ACessna 172 skyhawk was holding on runway 28 to let a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter land. Shortly after landing, the helicopter took off again and headed south and turned east past the airport. It then turned north and then west for final approach to runway 28. It then hovered while the Cessna followed the same pattern. At the same time, another Cessna 182 skyhawk recieved clearance and tookoff.I was still watching the helicopter and the first cessna in my binoculars, when the second Cessna took off. I followed it up about 20-25feet off the runway. At this point, I saw a black sphere about the size of a BB bullet off in the distance behind the airplane. The object hovered for about a second and then accelerated quickly from the southeast to the north. It was just a little norteast of my position when it disappeared behind the trees. The object was 15-20 degrees above the horizon and from the first time I saw it to it disappeared was 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even with using the binoculars, I was unable to find a rudder, a contrail or after burner exhaust. I feel certain that it was not a B-2 Spirit, which I had seen at a Concord airport airshow back in May 2000. The B-2 started out looking like a black line in the sky until it got closer to you.

Since I live in a valley there is hills around me so I was just looking around and in front of one hill about 3/5 a mile away I saw an intense light in a spherical shape. The light traveled left from my view point and stayed on a perfect line not going up or down an inch. The light traveled very slowly, not even reaching 10 m.p.h. as it was going the light changed colors: blue,white,green,red, and some mixes of the colors. After traveling about a hundred feet in about 2-3 minutes it stopped and continued to change color, never going up or down at all. My mother and sister both observed it and we decided to see if we could get close to where we had last seen it. After about 30 minutes of searching we didn&#39;t find anything even after going right by where the phenomenon had been. When we got home I looked back out side and the craft was there, It hadn&#39;t moved an inch since we went searching for it, there must have been some kind of nearby cloaking system or something. I decided to just let it go and go to sleep. Any way I have seen many in the area around this valley that I live in, maybe there is something special about it, besides the hundreds of acres of farmland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I don&#39;t recall exactly when I saw the UFO, but it was some time in the winter months of either 1992 or 1993. I was with my husband, Michael (who was my boyfriend at the time of the sighting), late one evening.  I was a student of Pennsylvania State University at the time.  Michael was a graduate of Penn State and was visiting me for the weekend at the time.  Penn State had an area in its vast grounds commonly called the &#34;Deer Pens&#34; which is part of its Deer Research Facility. Late that evening, perhaps roughly around 11:00 pm, though I don&#39;t recall the exact time, we decided to go up to the deer pens and see what we can see at night, even though it was pitch black out at the time.  Call us crazy college students.  Anyway, we went up there driving in Michael&#39;s car, and the place is deserted.  The deer pens themselves are surrounded by a tall chain-link fence to contain the deer, and the inside the fenced area is off-limits to the public and accessible only to the deer researchers and the deer themselves. The access road (dirt and gravel road) we were on was just outside the fence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove up to the central part of the deer pens viewing area, we noticed a glowing object on the ground inside the deer pen.  The object was roughly the size of a small barn or very large storage shed.  However, the object&#39;s shape was like a rounded cone shape.  The whole thing was glowing a bright orangey-red color, and appeared to have a &#34;doorway&#34; in the center of the object.  The doorway was shaped in a vertical rectangular shape that was arched at the top.  The doorway, or opening perhaps, was colored black or was simply darkened.  The object appeared to be sitting on the ground inside the deer pen, and was located perhaps 100 ft away from us in a clearing of the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there in the car peering at this object in disbelief for a long minute or so, wondering what in the world it was.  We both quickly came to the realization that we might be looking at a landed UFO or some sort, and became freaked out.  We then fleed the area as quickly as we could by backing out down the access road in our car.  After we left the scene, we did not see anything else that night out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning, we went back to the site to check and make sure there wasn&#39;t some strange building on-site in the pens that would explain it all and make sense to us in the morning daylight.  When we arrived at the site, there was no buildings or structures of any kind in the deer pen, only deer and trees.  The was a clearing in the trees in the area where we saw the ULO (Unidentified Landed Object) large enough to contain the ULO, but no sign that anything had been there the night prior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I opened the back door and was talking with them about making so much noise when I saw a bright light coming towards me (from north to south) and as it reached me to my right and passed me at just above the tree tops there was absolutely no sound and it was a bright very large light without a trail that cut through the sky ever so smoothly, and because of prior snake bite and being barefooted, I did not step out in the yard but ran through the house and out the front door and it was gone so i did not see which way it went. It was moving fast. There were no leaves on the trees yet so i had a good view as it came toward me appearing through the trees and then as it came closer it was obviously above the trees. Do not use my name as i didnt report it for fear of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They are a eye catching color, almost a amber. We have seen these lights about four times always in the same area. These are unexplainable, we have got them on tape twice. When you are just looking at the four in a row, they seem to stay in the same place, but looking through the camcorder, the four lights come together. The other time we saw two, and they also came together through the camcorder but not just looking at them.  These are very strange lights. They stay lit up for different amounts of time. They seem to disappear when there is a plane coming. Would like to have a explaination for what we have seen.<n>

The three dot appeard to vear off course to the left slightly and the back on course due east. Almost like three jets but much to high and fast. Faded in to the eastern sky appearing to go straight out not curving down as with the curve of the earth. Slight haze around the dots of light. appeared to be connected with an invisible string<n>

Red and blue lights flashed on its bottom side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, husband and I went outside on the east side of our house to talk to the neighbor lady.  A very bright light (seemed larger and brighter than the stars) caught my eye through the tree boughs.  It stayed very still for approx. 1 minute, then it would move in a straight line and stop. It would stay still again for about 45-60 seconds, and move in a radical direction, and then stay still again.  We also saw what looked like red and blue flashing lights on the bottom of it.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but it was much too high, and the movement didn&#39;t seem typical for a helicopter. From our house in Clearview (southern Snohomish)we were facing southeast (in the direction of Maltby.)It was fairly easy to see the way it moved relative to where the tree boughs were. We noticed 3 other aircraft flying toward it, but it was difficult to tell if they were chasing it.<n>

At approx. 7:36pm, an extremely bright single point-source white light similar in appearance to Venus but much brighter was seen directly north and positioned between big and little dipper: there was no movement against star field; at first sight it was at least three times brighter than Venus at its&#39; best; but then faded out within about 20 seconds.  Since this is outside the ecliptic plane I assumed it could have been: 1:  A flare fired from mountains north of city, but the elevation was too high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2:  A balloon (but what made the bright light)? 3:  A meteor seen head-on (but there was no motion, no arc, no directional movement) 4:  A Nova (extremely rare).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5:  Something military unexplained! 6:  Aircraft (but again there was no motion against star field).<n>

Being half in and half out, of the upstairs window, I had a 180 degree view of due south facing the St. Laurence River. The sky ceiling was about 10,000 feet, but I may be off on that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was ‘man he’s fling really low!’, but when I considered how fast it was moving and how bright it was I then thought ‘holly crap that’s moving fast!’. Having lived for many years less than a quarter mile from a Canadian Air Force landing strip (Trenton Ontario) and witness to many many night time flights of craft of all sorts I knew the sight of running lights and the sounds they made. I also know what a plane/jet looks like when the sun is beyond the horizon and reflecting on it and running lights. More over I know the sound. This thing had no sound from the moment I first saw it to well after it passed from the point where I could see it (I went out doors to find it again).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Simply put, an unusually clean white coloured craft less than a quarter inch in size (to my eyes) flew a full 180 degrees across my field of view in less than 10 seconds. I have never seen anything move that fast, move in a perfectly straight line and make no sound...non at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is only the second time I have shared this and I’m doing this because of what you said on the coast to coast program. I’m a mature person and was in my mid to late 30’s when I saw what I saw. It left such an impression on me that I think about it more often then I would like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,<n>

It was round in shape,color was black and lights all around that were red in color and the lights flashed in oreder which each other. the craft stayed there about 5 to 10 mins long enough to see it and know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thesize was about the size of 2 big homes put together, and not a sound came from this craft and it was so close to us i could hardly believe it. i had never seen one. But I tell you now I know what I saw and it was a space craft. now I didnt see who was flying this craft. but I can suerly tell you now, that we are not alone on this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ther have been times i have been on my back patio were i saw this craft and heard sounds in the air of something flying over head but didnt see anything in the sky. i have heard these crafts are known to become invisable and fly and no one see them. i believe thats why no see&#34;s when the cropt circles are being done and showing up so quickly. makes since to me. But see this is believeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> sorry this experiance came late to your website i just found it today 05/25/2005 and wanted to share it with you. i have talked with other people here in florida that say they have seen  crafts here too. and they have freacked out about it and when they hear me talk about it,they open up and tell there experiance. i guess they are afraid people will say there crazy are something. but buddy this is no joke, I saw what I saw and that is believeing enough for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was cool. I wanted to get closer, but I didnt I am kind of a trill seeker daredevil I guess you would say. but this is no lie, if i hadnt seen it for my self i probably would not of believed it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHY IT STAYED THERE TO LET US SEE IT THAT LONG AND AT A SHORT DISTANCE i DONT KNOW BUT IT DID.

REALLY TO CLOSE ITWAS KINDA SCARY. WHY WOULD THEY BE THAT CLOSE, AND WHY STAY THERE THAT LONG DURING THE DAY FOR US TO SEE AT THAT MOMENT. THEY HAD TO OF SEEN US LOOKING AT THEM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WOW IT WAS AMAZING.

No one was looking in my area so I was not going to say anything but then an Iron worker from a boom lift said &#34;Did any of you guys see that ?&#34;, I said yes and was relieved that someone other than myself saw it. Completely silent about 400 feet above me. He said &#34;What the hell was that ?&#34; I said I don&#39;t know. He said it was a BUO &#34;Blue unidentified object ?&#34; I said and he said no &#34;Big unidentified object&#34;. We see military craft all the time.

My estimate would be that it was late January or early February.  I was outside in my hot tub.  It was between the hours of 2 - 4 am.  I first noticed an object moving as it blocked my view of the stars.  I turned of the jets on my hot tub and stood up to get a better look as steam was rising off the surface of the water.  It was at an altitude much lower than a craft of that size should be and as it approached I saw a dark triangular shaped object with no lights and it made no sound.  I saw the lights from the interstate and city reflecting from the bottom of this object which helped to define its shape.  It appeared to be following the route of Interstate 15 coming from the north and going south.  I live fairly close to the interstate.  My guess was that it might be some kind of experimental military aircraft, but who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just now sending this in as I read an article on rense.com about a man who saw this same object and I wanted to confirm that I have seen it as well.  When I mentiond it to a couple of my friends, they looked at me like I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in February 2002 so that the report sorts to that date.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding reconstructing the date:  Unfortunately I cannot give you an exact date and time, as I said, I did not document this.  I do remember that it was quite early in the morning as I had finished studying - again between 2 - 4 am.  I generally do not bring writing or recording materials out with me when I sit in my hot tub and I do not have a clock outside.  I guess thinking in hindsight, maybe I should.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just remember that it was in the first quarter of the year.  I don&#39;t think this happened before my birthday, which is January 31st, because I don&#39;t remember mentioning it to friends at my birthday<n> <n><n> party.  It was a completely dark night around the time of the new moon.  I had a two-week break from school during the Olympics and this happened after a long night of studying so that would exclude February.   That leaves the time period around the new moon in March.  The weather was still quite cold as steam was rising from the surface of my hot tub.  Sorry I can&#39;t be more specific on that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In answer to your question about why I waited so long to report:  I did not report this at that time because I was not sure who to report this to.  The local police are somewhat less than concerned and professionally responsive (At least in my past experience with former next-door neighbors who had vicious rottweilers and juvenile delinquent teenagers, on one complaint the cop told me to &#34;bake them some cookies&#34;.) about normal everyday complaints so they were not an option for me to report a UFO sighting to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Look at it from my perspective: I had never experienced anything quite this freaky and before and<n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know anyone who has, to ask for their advice.    I was trying to process what I had seen in my mind and I guess I rationalized it as some sort of experimental military aircraft as it somewhat resembled the stealth bomber only larger.  I also live within close proximity to the Salt Lake International Airport so I am aware of normal flight patterns.   Numerous aircraft, although none as large as this one<n> <n><n> flying at the lower altitude, fly along the I-15 corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am single, I have no roommates or family, and I was alone at the time this happened.  As I said, when I told some of my friends they looked at me like I was crazy and from that, I perceived that they did not<n> <n><n> believe what I was telling them, so probably no one else would.  I know what I saw that night.  When I<n> <n><n> read the posting about the recent sighting of this object by a gentleman in Salt Lake I wanted to onfirm<n> <n><n> that this thing does indeed exist.  That is what prompted me to report at this particular time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, now I know who to report this to and am aware after looking through your site that several people have seen this object as well.  I won&#39;t hesitate if I see anything in the future as I have now bookmarked your site.  I found your website address through the article on rense.com, which I read today, September 28th. Prior to this I had no knowledge of your organization or your website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps you to understand.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE))<n>

I&#39;d gone a little ways past the place where everyone was sitting.  All I was thinking to do was sit and ponder about the many things i had on my mind.  As I looked up to look at the stars, I got to thinking that I&#39;d never seen a shooting star.   I hadn&#39;t even had a chance to process the thought when i saw a star moving. At least i thought it was a star.  But it was moving too slow to be a shooting star and it wasn&#39;t shaped like a star, it had a more oval/saucer shape.  it glowed like a star but i knew that it couldnt be.  It soon disapeared.  It couldn&#39;t have been there more than 4 or 5 seconds, but it seened like a lifeime.  My friend, who&#39;d been sitting a few feet from me, startled me when she ran up to me and asked if I&#39;d seen it.  We began to discuss what we thought it was that we saw.

At first nothing was there then one by one each of these 4 or 5 objects appeard.  As I watched them I noticed commercial aircraft passing by however these objects were not in motion.  Each object was blinking two colors, orange and red, and where lit for approx 5 to 6 minutes, then one at a time disappeared.  When I got home I ran to the back yard, with my wife, and the objects were gone.  As I was talking with my wife, I notice 2 more objects off the the west (towards the Buckeye area.)  Both of these objects looked the same as the 4 or 5 I saw on the way home.  My wife witnessed these objects with me as well.  As we were watching the objects to the south came back, in the same area (Estrella Mountains.)  We watched and watched for approx. 5 to 6 more minutes then the objects (all) disappeared one by one.<n>

I saw some very bright lights towards the back of our housing development. Almost like a baseball stadium&#39;s lights. I was so curious about them I continued down the street to see what it was. I looked past a desert field towards Luke AFB to see a GIANT blimp-like object hovering very close to the ground. It had very, very intense spot lights all around the top and all around the bottom. And in the center were multi-colored light much smaller, but they seem to move or &#34;chase&#34; around the middle. I drove away to go get a camera. I ran upstairs hoping my husband could see this object. However all we could see were two glowing reddish-orange balls in a vertical pattern, Directly over Luke AFB. They blinked out suddenly and re-appeared in a Horizontal pattern. I thought I was going crazy. However the next day at work, my husband talked to a coworker who described seeing the same large object.<n>

Something caught my eye out of the driver side window.  I looked and saw two objects floating/hovering in the air.  They seemed to be a little closer then an airplane would be.  They were much bigger in size then an airplane.  They were both circular and a bright orange color.  I tried to pull the car off the road but could not stop before they disappeared.  The object on the right moved quickly left then right and disappeared. Not more then 3-4 seconds later the other object vanished.

It was traveling from the vicinity of Tallahassee in a northern direction at a very high rate of speed. It was dawn and there were no stars visible at that time of the morning. The streak lasted for a second or two. It had a very bright point followed by a trail of light. It streaked across the sky, then made a sudden  90 degree turn to the left. At first, I thought it was a meteor, but then realized that a meteor can&#39;t turn suddenly. There were no street lights or other cars on the dirt road to cause a reflection in my windshield.<n>

My first thought was that Mars was very bright this night.  As I continued to watch it a bit longer it appeared to move from side to side, then swing like a pendulem.  I continued to watch to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things, as I saw it move again I called my husband down to take a look also.  He confirmed the fact that it indeed was moving.  As I watched for approximately half an hour until it moved further away as the reflection disappeared on the ice and then it disappeared over the horizon.  I saw no shape of an object only a very bright reddish light.<n>

I was going  to get up and see it but something &#34;forced&#34; me back to sleep. It was like a ringing sound. I woke up again still thinking about what I saw then the ringing sound occurred again and forced me back to sleep. But I woke up the next morning still remembering the physics of this object. I know it wasnt a dream because I never could have imagined something moving so fluidly.<n>

Unfortunately, they did not see it.  I was on a stretch of the road where there are no street lights, so it was pretty dark in the sky, as there were not many stars shining either.  Anyway, as I was driving, I noticed a blue colored ball shaped light, or object, flash across the sky out of the passenger side of the windshield.  It was going north, just like me.  It was so fast.  There was no trail behind it, so I know it was not a shooting star, or anything like that.  Especially since there were not many stars out that night.  Also, there were no cars in front of me, or behind me; and no cars coming towards me from the opposite direction.  I had never seen anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and she sounds quite sincere to us.

I could not actually see a solid object but rather the impression of an object was created due to a triangular pattern of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were white, red and a third color (blue or green). The lights seemed to be over a major highway (Hwy 400) so I thought it was a traffic plane. When I stopped at the traffic lights and the object didn&#39;t move I thought it might be a helicopter. It was the large outline (roughly hand size) and the triangular shape that made me wonder if it was in fact something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I left the traffic lights and continued to the overpass I was able to watch the object pass from my front to my driver&#39;s side window. I was driving very slowly and the object may have been moving very slowly in the opposite direction. I lost sight of the object as I decended the other side of the overpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of my window&#39;s were closed but my radio was not on. I do not remember hearing any noises.<n>

At this time the two lights were glowing a deep reddish orange (very scary). The lights would turn on and off silently. No other identifiable lights and behavior ruled out airplanes and baloons.  These objects  continued on an easternly path directly toward Phoenix.  As we drove through Phoenix on I-10 the lights again reappeared south of Phoenix, as we headed towards Tucson. Now the lights changed to a bright solid yellow, in formation,and turning off and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached a small town or suburb, to the east these two objects hung in the sky, over the town and this time they were metallic gold and round in shape. They reflected light and appeared to be metallic.  They also lit up the entire sky around them and you could see the clouds above (high ceiling) and were certainly very visible from the ground. You could not miss them.  We had been traveling 70 mph or better on the interstate and the lights not only kept up the pace but were ahead of us and waiting?  The lights then turned again to bright yellow and continued their turning off and on wobbly manuevers as we headed towards Tucson. Then just as we were about to reach the first lights north of Tucson (suburb) the lights turned towards the southwest and disappeared out over the Papago indian reservation and towards the Kitt Peak area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is the second witness.  We were on our way from Seattle,Wa. to a place in New Mexico with a device involved with new technology.  The lights were a bit un-nerving as well as the length of time.

I pulled my video camera out so I could use the zoom to see what it was and as I turned the camera on it vanished into thin air. Now you see it, now you don&#39;t.

I have seen many planes that fly at high altitudes, but ,this you could tell was very high. I was thinking of  maybe a satelite . As I watched this thing it moved at the same rate of speed going from southwest to northeast(slower than a plane ) not taking my eyse off it I banged on the back door to tell my wife to hurry and come outside to see this. She did and saw the light but went back inside. I continued to watch the light and it seemed to speed up, About a minute later it just vanished.The sky was totally clear not a cloud in sight . Did anyone else see what I did ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconsistent with a sighting of a typical satellite.  However, that is only a guess.  PD))<n>

About 20 miles west of Cleveland, OH.  A bright orange, yellowish light in the sky, off to the left hand side caught my eye.  I couldn&#39;t make out much detail at this time, but as I got closer to the object (after traveling 30-45 seconds), I realized that it wasn&#39;t a plane or anything of that nature.  I saw numerous &#34;windows&#34; where the light was emiting from.  The light was also emiting from the bottom.  I continued to watch the object for another 10-15 seconds and then it appeared as though it was sucked into the clouds.  Moving almost vertically.<n>

This sighting has multiple witnesses, three total and took place near the Oregon, Nevada, California border. Many thanks to Jean for passing on this sighting and we will post any further information that comes forth in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eric Byler - OUFOR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jeans report...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two witnesses live in Lake City, Calif. The town is not on all maps and is located approx. 10 miles north of Cedarville and 16 miles south of Ft. Bidwell. The first few sightings were estimated to occur over Fee Reservoir, which is barely in California and maybe partly in Nevada (The state line tends to vary from year to year). The third witness lives in Ft. Bidwell and saw the light over Bidwell Mountain which straddles the state line between California and Oregon (this mountain is NNW of Ft. Bidwell). The lights were spreading out to the north and south from the initial sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sightings reported to me last night, 02-12-02 were large, bright orange lights in the sky. A man was soaking in his hot tub around 7:30 p.m. He had a view to the north and northeast, with almost no lights except for a small town (about 30 lights) 16 miles to the north. His attention was drawn to a bright light suddenly appearing in the northeast, (SE Oregon, NW Nevada or NE California)around 7:45 p.m. It was bright orange, and appeared suddenly about 10 degrees above the horizon over an unpopulated area. It was visible for about 1-2 seconds. It was just on and off...&#34;A light being switched slowly on and then off.&#34; This was followed in turn by two lights, one light, three lights, one light, two lights, etc. Perhaps a total of about a dozen lights. They were miles apart and not associated with any populated area or roads. There is no commercial air traffic in the locations where the lights were seen. There were no &#39;tails&#39; or anything to indicate these lights were meteors or satellites. The man viewing these lights has seen both meteors and satellites while soaking in his hot tub. They were not planets. He called to his wife and she saw three lights appear at once. She also felt they were not naturally occurring phenomena. The last light seen that night occurred when the man was reporting his sightings to me via telephone, at 8:00 p.m. The couple also called a friend that lived in the town to the north and asked them to look outside. The man went outside and saw the 8:00 p.m. light. None of the people that reported seeing the unidentified objects that night drink alcoholic beverages or indulge in illicit drug use. They are credible people and the first couple invited me to their home that evening in hopes of all of us seeing more lights. Unfortunately that was not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is just another in a long series of lights being seen in this area. One such sighting, several years ago, was filmed with a video camera for 2 seconds before the couple tried to zoom in on the objects. The camera lost focus, but the existing footage was sent to Jeff Sainio to be analyzed. Jeff estimated the lights to be from a UFO approximately 750 feet in diameter. Another couple substantiated the sighting, which at times consisted of up to eight unidentified flying objects. UFOs are seen several times a year in this area. Some encounters have been very close-within 12 feet; some with interaction among the objects-shooting lasers at each other; missing time, a crop circle, and other anomalous events have occurred in this vicinity. The first and possibly only photo documentation of UFOs and abductions occurring together was in this area. Many of these events have had multiple witnesses, some with photo documentation. I believe this sighting to be another in a long series of sightings to occur here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Jean Bilodeaux, ultimate source of this report.

It dropped for about 15 seconds from what must have been a great height. It caught our attention because at first it was so small (a pin prick of light) yet amazingly bright, as it dropped/ moved downwards it got bigger and very much brighter, it hurt your eyes to look at it. We were almost under the approach path to Toronto Intl. planes were stacked up in a line approaching the airport, this was much higher than the planes. Ultimately it became a bit bigger than the size of a dime at arms length. It dropped from a height of about 80 degrees to approx 30 degrees in a spastic jerking manner, this took from 12 to 18 seconds. This was not a firework or a flare, the colour was truly very odd, just before it disappeared it moved/jeked sideways and flashed a blindingly bright orange colour, then nothing. We discussed it amongst ourselves afterwards and feel it must have been something burning up as it entered the atmosphere, but as to why it should jerk around and twitch as it fell, we can only speculate<n>

Puyallup. She called to me because she seen it first. She asked what is that? Upon looking I tried to reason that it might be a balloon or fire works. My brain raced with reasonable answers but none fit the M.O. I quickly ran and grabbed my camera. Four or five shots where taken but I am not sure if they will turn out, the F stop was off and I could not hold the camera still. On the last one I braced myself against a pole to hold steady. Maybe that one will turn out. The sky was black, except for the orange glow of this object bouncing and moving erratically around the sky. It would move slow and stead in one direction, then suddenly move quickly about the night sky. It seemed to have no apparent direction in mind. As it moved south we jumped into the truck to follow and see it. We parked on 10th Ave in Milton and watched it moving to the south and east. It seemed to me to be over the Puyallup area at this time. The orange glow coming from below the object was bright, but would at times glow brighter then fade some. It seemed to get pretty far away from our position, maybe eight to ten miles, then it started moving back toward and to the west of where we were. At or about it&#39;s closes point to us at this time the orange glow faltered then grew stronger. As it grew stronger it instantaneously  released a shower of sparks, almost resembling a fire work being shot from the sky toward the ground. This happened twice very quickly. Both pulses of fire could be seen hailing down toward the earth at the same time. There also was a slight audible release when these showers erupted from the object. It sounded like a very soft pop, kind of like popping a finger out of the corner of one&#39;s mouth very quietly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to drive toward the Fife Valley for a better look and to be in a position that we could travel in the direction of the object&#39;s flight path. We turned the corner and parked when the object started to move about very rapidly. It made a quick move to the west, so fast that it was almost as if you blinked and it had moved a quarter mile already. Then we rushed to get to the valley where we could see the whole sky. It was less then two city blocks to the valley. I told her as she started to drive, &#34;It&#39;s gone.&#34; She said, &#34;No way.&#34;  I then told her I had seen it disappear into the southern sky in an instant. We drove down the hill to the valley and seen nothing. We were back at the apartment at 12:11 am. The object looked like an inverted cylinder with an orange glow coming from the bottom of the it. I wonder if anyone else seen this!?!?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Illustration provided by witness.  PD))<n>

Just for 20 minutes. Then would seem to fade (or go further out?). It could still be there - if anyone knows anyone going there who could check on it! If you looked up at Orion, there is a very bright star to the right of it. Then if you go over just a bit more to the right and down, there it was same time very night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You have a lot of contacts - do you know anyone who might know what this is?

I was out on my usual walk with the dog (again) and I caught site of it out of the corner of my eye as it passed overhead. I was walking east (again) about 15 minutes into my walk when I spotted it. The object was passing over me (to the south slightly) on my right at what I thought was a low altitude maybe 1000 to 2500 feet. It was a reddish object, disc in shape. It passed over at a high rate of speed without noise. The dull reddish glow was at a low level until after it had gained a lot of altitude. At this point the glow became very bright like a light emitting diode red. It&#39;s path was to the east for about 5 seconds and then swooping vertical (circular shape became very noticeable) and the streaking off to the south in a split second. I saw whatever it was for only about 20 to 30 seconds before it disappeared. It was very clear and cold last night, the visibility was fabulous... stars all around and no clouds. I made the accompanying files with AutoCAD for documentation purposes only.

The shape was odd. It was long, and one side (the left, from ground view) went upward. As if you were looking at an &#34;L&#34;, only the horrizontal line leaned toward the left. The movement of this craft was right and left movements. It did not move straight down, instead, it moved downward gliding to the right. It was sometimes fast in its longer movements ( lft to rt ) and moved not slow, but slower, when moving shorter distances of left to right. For the most part, it just went back and forth, (lft to rt). I saw no paticular color, it was lit up as planes are, with one light being stonger and bigger than the rest wich covered the craft one side to the other. There was no colored lighting...just white.<n>

I was in the drivers seat. All of a sudden I noticed to orange lights rising up from behind some trees in the distance. My first reaction was someone must have set off a couple of flares. Then I watched to see if they were going to fall like flares do but they didn&#39;t. They slowly ascended up at an angle like planes do on take off. I then said oh shit and told my homeboys look at this shit. Then we all jumped out the truck to get a better look. I noticed that the two lights were independent of each other because of the irregular patterns that they were doing. They were definately flying with each other though. They made no noise at all. Sky was very clear. It seems like they got to a certain point in the sky and kind of stood there hovering. It seems that one of them was kind of bouncing and doing some out the ordinary movements. By this time, we were causing so much commotion that a couple of employess took notice. I remember two gentlemen sitting in a truck in front of Whater Burger as well watching this. Then they got smaller and eventually faded. They definately were not airplanes or helicopters because they didnt have the usual lights that those craft would have. There&#39;s no airport in that area in which it seems they arose from. Just neighborhoods. One of my homeboys described them as being like embers from a fire that kind of hovers as they get caught in the heat waves. This is definately something I probably wont forget. I dont  drink or smoke so I was in my right frame of mind.<n>

A friend and I were outside, maybe six miles east of the Utah/Co. border on what was highway 666.  I looked up and to the north there low in the sky was a huge ship.  I can only say that it was huge possibly the size of 20-25 blimps.  Perhaps 300-400yards up.  I asked my friend, Do you see that?  Oh my god yes I do was her only response.  It had as best as I can describe &#34;a stealth look&#34; to it. It seemed to have uncloaked as some of its basic points were in alignment with certain stars.  I do not remember anything else about this at that time.  I have always had an open mind as to the possibilities of ufo&#39;s.  I think my mind was overwhelmed and shut down instead of dealing with what I had witnessed.  Over the next year I tried to talk to my fellow sighter several times about this event wanting to confirm it.  She, as I recall evaded the issue and would not speak about.  She, on the other hand says she tried to speak to me about several times over the next year or so and I was reluctant to talk about it. We have a mutual friend who says we both tried to get the other one to talk about but had little luck in doing so.  She has added that it got extreemly quiet as this sighting was occuring.  I do not remember that nor do either of us remember how the sighting ended.  The duration of the event and the timeline following it are extreemly cloudy and unsure.  I have no feelings that an abduction occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was, of course, excited and curious; and commented to my friend that it looked like a &#34;hot air balloon that&#39;s on fire&#34;! As I continued to focus in, I noticed that the &#39;intensity&#39; of the orange color frequently changed from near amber to dark orange.  In addition, I could see &#39;spots&#39; or areas of red that came and went.  The object had no clear &#39;definition&#39; or &#39;silouhette&#39;, just roundish and glowing/burning.  I would guess the size of it to be about the same as a hot air balloon.  It slowly drifted north, then suddenly became much smaller.  At first I thought it diminished in size, as if &#39;burning out&#39;, but then realized it was much closer to the horizon...and MUCH further away...that it must have traveled a large distance in a moment&#39;s time.  I continued to observe it until it vanished into the northern horizon.<n>

It&#39;s color changed somewhat from the color of the moon to a soft amber.  It hovered over a distant hill in the state forest, which is unpopulated and a wilderness.  We watched the object move to different positions within the same area without a sound.  At one point we thought the object was coming towards us but reverted back to its&#39; position over the hill.  We watched the object for approximately 20 minutes then it appeared to land behind the hill out of our sight, leaving only a yellow to amber glow highlighting the hill.<n>

It moved from up and down and side to side quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just got off work Saturday and happened to be looking at Orion&#39;s Belt. I didn&#39;t really think of it as being anything special at the time. Just another group of stars in the sky. I started to try to put together other constelations when I noticed a light in the sky. At first I thought it was just another star though I&#39;d never noticed it before. I started to ignor it when I saw it was moving, thinking it was a plane, but realized it couldn&#39;t be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved oddly, to fast to be a plane and it was too bright, small, and it wasn&#39;t actually going anywhere. It continued to pretty well hover just below and to the left of Orion&#39;s Belt. I noticed it was making small swirling movements only to stop, not moving at all, then doing it again. I ran to my friend&#39;s house and dragged him outside. He noticed it was moving as well and ran back in to get another of our friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch it for another few minutes as it moved slightly, maybe an inch in the sky, though it covered that inch quickly. I&#39;m not good at math but given the distance...I don&#39;t know. Planes just don&#39;t move like that, not in so many directions so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We debated whether it really was moving or if we were all just seeing what we wanted to see. We decided to sit for a moment and watch. It did indeed move though only two of us could see it clearly. My other friend had just taken out his contacts so he couldn&#39;t say if it was moving or not. We did take a picture though we haven&#39;t yet decided if we are going to send it anywhere yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran home to get a pair of binoculars but couldn&#39;t find any that allowed us to see it any better. After a while we gave up trying to see what it was and went back inside. When I left the house most of the stars were gone because it looks like a storm is rolling in. That was around 1 Am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say anymore because my friends and I wish to remain anonomous. The only reason I&#39;m sending this is because I have never seen anything like that in 12 years of traveling the United States, on vaction, or anywhere else. Nothing can cover such a distance in the sky like that and not be some kind of air ship or spacecraft. Whatever it was it seemed small, and fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness chooses to remain anonymous.

It was about 8:30MST, pitch black dark with no stars out. The object appeared as a large, very bright, white/yellow ball, with no tail.  It appeared into our view, shot down at about a 45 degree angle and was lost behind the houses and trees.  It looked much brighter than any shooting star I have ever seen, and much closer.  From our view, it looked as if it must have landed maybe 30-50 miles to the west of Cheyenne, Wy.  But I do realize that actually it could have been much farther than that, maybe hundreds of miles? I am no expert on these matters, just speaking in terms of what kind of seems logical I guess. I looked over at my son, he immediately looked at me and his eyes were just huge!  I said, &#34;did you see that?&#34;, and he said acting very excited and scared at the same time, &#34;ya!&#34;  So, just to test him to see if he really indeed saw the same thing I did, I said &#34;what did you see?&#34;  He replied, &#34;that shooting star!&#34;, he being only 6, I knew what he meant, and knew we had both definitely seen the same thing.<n>

I wore my glasses out to the pool specifically to skywatch. While watching the plane, I caught sight of a large lighted object fairly near the horizon and in my right peripheral field of view. As I focused on the object, it followed a curved trajectory right and down and disappeared behind a ridge. The object was very bright, white or maybe slightly yellow/gold, and roundish, though not a perfect orb. It was only in my sight for a couple of seconds, yet the impression was that it was wider than tall. At least there was some shading that kept it from being a perfect orb. It was definitely not a meteor or a star, as it was too large, its length about 2/3 of the distance between the stars on Orion&#39;s belt. Had it been a meteorite of that size hitting the earth, I think we would have heard or felt it, and the trajectory would have been different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we drove south on the highway and noticed a number of drainages cutting back into the ridge behind Boulder Hot Springs. There have been a few reported sightings in the Elkhorns and Townsend area, but this was a little south of the Elkhorns.<n>

The driver&#39;s side window was down while we were heading west through Napa.  A beautiful foothill was directly ahead of the city road we were traveling on.  I was thinking that the foothill was georgeous while trying to keep my eyes on the road.  Then I saw it! Hey, what is that in the sky?  It is straight ahead, noiseless, all white, and oh my, it does not have any wings.  My passenger is an amateur photog and never leaves home without his camera so of course, he started snapping photos of the object.  We were both puzzled.  No sound was coming through my open window, it had no wings, tail, window, no markings at all.  It looked like a cigar with rounded ends.  Actually, it had no end as the front and back were identical.  It was traveling to the right of my car, below the horizon of the foothill, in a steady direction. Noiselessy, effortlessly, smoothly. To me, it appeared to be traveling slowly.  My passenger felt it to be traveling rapidly.  From the first sighting to the end, we estimated the time of viewing to be about 15 seconds.  After looking at a map of the area it appears that it traveled 3 or 4 miles in this time span.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded both sincere, and convincing.

I was looking down and my wife suddendly said &#34;Oooo, look at that&#34;.  I looked up (looked north and maybe slightly west) and saw a brillant fireball heading nearly straight down.  I could only perceive a slight arc.  While probably not a extra-terrestrial space craft, it was still enough to make my heart skip.  I had never seen a metor during the day - what it must have looked like at night!  I was shocked at how long we could observe the object since most metors last just an instant.<n>

It looked like a star/planet except it was about 3 times the brightness of jupiter and it was facing north. I immediatley knew this was not a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;From my upstairs window i have a great view of the sky over Charlotte facing north towards downtown. I can see about half of the sky including the buildings downtown. The light hovered just above the trees for about a minute. It appeared to be about 2 miles away from me. After about a minute the light started to drift a little to the right and then a little to the left. I lined my eyes up with the crosshairs in the window to make sure i wasn&#39;t seeing things. I wasn&#39;t. After drifting further to the left the light abruptly turned and sped off towards downtown. It passed behind the Bank of America (BOA) building a flew off out of sight. As it was moving away from me I noticed a small red light behind the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was astonished at how fast this light moved across the city. I spend a lot of time watching planes and helicopters fly around the city and I have never seen anything cover that much distance in so short of time. I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to convince myself that I saw a helicopter that was hovering with a spotlight on and then speed away very quickly. The only problem is the math. It took the light approx. 5-10 seconds to go from the spot where it was hovering to behind the BOA building. Taking the angle that i saw the light from my window and drawing a line out across the city, the closest point from that line to the BOA builind is 1.75 miles (this is best case scenario. i think the distance was more like 3.5 but i am taking the closest possible distance). 1.75 miles in 10 seconds is 630 miles per hour. That is again using the best case scenario (at 3.5 miles the speed is 1260). I am not aware of any helicopter that can go 630 miles per hour from a dead stop. Also the helicopters i have seen flying around have 2 blueish/white lights on the back not a small red light. I also did not hear a sound from the light. I can usually hear planes and helicopters all the way to downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what i saw but it&#39;s not anything i can explain using rational logic. I can&#39;t believe in a city the size of charlotte, nobody else saw this light.<n>

At first I thought it was a satilite, but satilites do not move this fast.  The objest was covering &#34;ground&#34; at an amazing speed.  I still did not think much of it until the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the North unlike anything I have ever seen and then rocketed out of sight to the North.  I was totally freaked out.<n>

From where I was standing it appeared over my left shoulder and relative to my position on the ground it seemed only about 200 meters up in the air.  There was no &#34;bang&#34; like that of fireworks, it did not make a sound at all.  I live in Renton and the object was moving east-southeast.  I lost it over the trees so I don&#39;t know if it vanished or kept on moving in that direction.<n>

We had no idea how far away the UFO was, but it eventually began traveling in parallel to our vehicle.  When it first became identifiable, it appeared to be cigar shaped, with a lighted opaque dome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From time to time, the object emitted various light patterns consisting of various colored lights in a strobe-light format. As the object came closer to us, it seemed very large.  The object would occasionally stop moving and fall behind our vehicle, then suddenly dart very far ahead.   At one point, the object was directly parallel with our vehicle and began to turn about its axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s appearance ressembled the classic description of a &#34;Flying Saucer&#34;.  Across the middle of the object were stobe lights running in a pattern of red, green, and blue lights.  At various times, white, red, green, blue, and lavender colored lights were emitted, in strobe form, from various positions on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we came into downtown Milwaukee, the object appeared to be over the southern part of the city near the Milwaukee airport.  Daybreak was taking place and the object was quite clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, as an aircraft took off from the airport in a southwestern direction, the object rapidly climbed at a steep angle (approximatley 70 degrees)in the clear sky and dissappeared into a high cloud bank.  This occurred at a speed far in excess of any known aircraft and similar to the O&#39;Hare sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Much to my amazement the light stopped, at this point couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.  Others were in bed and was hesitant to wake them up just in case I was seeing things, continued to watch.  It was white lighted mostly, but would get very dimm and brighten up again.  It seemed to just be hovering with only slight movements X and Y.  It was very still outside with little wind.  After watching it for a bit decided to get a second optinion for another member of the household.  Not sure what that persons thoughts are at this time but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still not totally convinced that I saw what I saw went in the house to warm up for about two hours or so and sat down on the same step and used the same reference points and there was not a star (not at all bright) anywhere close and knew that I had see something.  At this point scanned the sky and 45 degrees to the north of the position that saw the same type light.  Again sat to be in a stable position, got a non-moving point of reference and watched.  The same type bright and then almost dim to nothing type light and slow movements in different directions.<n>

I was in a moving car going about 35 miles a hour (on the passager side) and I was looking straight up at it just sitting there in a pitch black sky. I live outside the city limits of Colorado Springs, Colorado. I was stunned to see this out here because I have heard of the flying triangles, but this one was alone. No this was not a commercial airliner, because I see planes all the time from the nearby airport and they are big with hugh flashing lights of differnt colors and moving in a straight line ( and you can hear the engines). I heard no engines or noise from this object just flicking lights.<n>

It was flying south-east to north-west and was going at least twice the speed of normal aircraft I have seen in the area. As it traveled, it emmitted no sound at all. It had three lights, one at each &#34;tip&#34;, that were flashing in an odd pattern. It also had a red &#34;haze&#34; along one side, so I could clearly see it was triangular in shape.<n>

Appeared to be 2-3 lights close together, side by side. They did not appear to be moving. As we got off the Interstate, heading southwest on 76, saw that the lights were ahead of us, appearing to be over Dutch Fork Elementary School. As we passed to the southeast of the lights, I was looking almost straight up at them and saw they were three white lights in a triangular formation, equalateral, with a red flashing light in the middle. I had not seen the red light until I was looking up at the object from underneath. The lights began moving slowly southeast along Route 76 towards Columbia. The red center light was blinking once every second or two, but as the object moved away it seemed to not be blinking constantly. It would appear to stop for a few seconds and then start. The object was eventually went below the horizon towards the east-southeast and could not be seen anymore. There had been heavy helicopter activity in the area since nightfall. A train was in the area as well at the time, so it was impossible to hear if it may have been a helicopter. It appeared to be, at most, a couple thousand feet up. The pattern of lights seemed too big for a helicopter, unless it had sponsons or wings with running lights. At arms length the pattern was the diameter of a penny, or slightly smaller, when it was seen almost overhead.<n>

The light was actually flame as one would think a pair of rocket boosters would produce.  I watched it move for maybe fifteen more seconds and then the &#39;boosters&#39; went out and as they did an orangish glow remained for an instant (there was a shape momentarily visible in the afterglow that reminded me of a branding iron pointing directly at me shaped like a square with a cross through the center) and then the entire object disappeared into the night.

2/4/02 19:30|Orlando|FL|Light|10 Minutes|UFO's manuever over Orlando, Florida|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22126.html|212|ndxe200202| UFO&#39;s manuever over Orlando, Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects that we saw were about 10 - 15 miles away from our vantage point and looked to be about 8,000ft - 15,000ft above ground level. We only saw the objects as lights or spheres of light from this distance. There were approximately 2 objects, one was stationary and the other manuevered around in a manner which was uncharacteristic of any conventional craft that I know of. It performed tight circles and moved very fast as compared to the commercial traffic in the area, which I used as a comparison. The most dramatic manuever it performed was a tight loop which only took a fraction of a second, then it shot out a thin beam of light to the other object and it seemed to ride that beam up to that object. The light that eminated from the objects was blueish white in color and seemed to flash at different intervals depending on the objects manuevers. These objects were witnessed by myself my wife and two other vehicles that had pulled off to the side of HWY 429 to watch. I am a private business owner with 2 years of aeronautical science course work completed while I was an undergraduate student at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. Additionally I called Orlando International Airport Tower on the day after the incident to inquire as to if they had observed theoccurance, instead of getting an answer I was given a number to call in Washington, DC to report/inquire about the incident.<n>

After submitting my report on 2/02, additional sightings of a more intensly lit object occured later in the evening.  These objects appeared over the western edge of the city of Spokane.  My vantage point is on a hill, aproximately 17 miles to the SE of Spokane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, 02/04/02 the objects again appeared intermittently from about 7:30PM until about 11:00 PM.  Usually, only one object was present at a time, but once three objects were visible - two over western Spokane, and one to the north.  All were very bright, with the lights becoming very bright, then dimming etc., and each sighting lasting between 5 to 10 minutes.  The predominate color of the lights was a yellowish /orange,  but through my binoculars I could see flashing blue, red, and green.  The objects would generally just appear, and after several minutes of being stationary, begin drifting to the North.  At one point. a larger aircraft coming from the SE flew under one of the objects in sort of a zig-zag pattern, but then flew in a direction away from the civilian and military airfields.  At the time the three objects were visible, the two objects which were close together moved in sort of a semi-circle pattern and exchanged general locations.  At times the objects would move behind trees in my field of view, and then out again, so I know they are not stars or planets.  They must be an aircraft of some type, and I hope to hect they are ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I telephoned a friend who lives in Spokane.  This person traveled a few blocks out to a point which has a clear view to the South, over downtown Spokane, and also to the West.  My friend later described 2 brief glimpses of what was described as  &#34;a huge horizontal box that looked like a flourescent light &#34; stationary in the sky, in the approximate areas of the civilian and military airports.  My friend drove out to the airport area, but it was too foggy to see anything.  I asked if it could be a helicoptor, but my friend said that a local medical holicopter was operating in the downtown area, and that could be heard clearly, but there was no sound in the direction of the large flourescent light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an aircraft enthusiast all my life, and I have never observed anything like these lights. There has been no mention of any of this in the local newspaper or television.<n>

It was not a terrestrial aircraft, at least not one I have ever seen or could imagine.  I was going home, eastbound on K10 approx. 6:35pm, and right around DeSoto I noticed lots of aircraft due east, and then more lights to the north.  Only these lights were moving in unison, i.e. they were not separate aircraft.  It was triangular in shape, with a light at each apex--these three lights flashed/blinked red and white at the exact same time.  And in the middle of this &#34;thing&#34; was a row or bank of five lights, which pulsated from right to left, or south to north.  They went from orange, yellowish, red, and then white, all down the row.  So I was watching this from a hill, and then I went down the hill, and back up, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I got off K10 at the exit east of Evening Star Road, and watched for a bit.  Then I saw it again, only this time it was west of where I originally saw it, like it went backwards.  It flickered, and then disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back on K10 again and saw it again, only it was way, way east, almost NE of my location (as opposed to due N of me) and it kinda faded into the city lights.  I also noticed during this whole time many aircraft in and around the area and even more to the east--I mean a LOT, more than one would expect to see, even around an airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure many others saw this, the damn thing was HUGE.  I can&#39;t be sure because it was in the sky, but I estimate it at around 800m long, maybe 500m wide at the base.  I&#39;m not sure of its altitude, but it was fairly low, maybe around 1000m or less.  In all, it was about a 6-8 min ordeal.  It seems weirder today than it did last night cause I&#39;ve had time to process it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar reports for this date.  PD))<n>

I looked at it for a while, since i am quite interested in the sky, and stars and the such, and after looking for a good minute or so, i noticed 2 more of the same circular lights form behind it seemingly out of nowhere.  They then moved into a triangular shape and began to move foward.  They then started performing some type of movements..where the back two objects would split apart from the formation, and the front object would come foward..afer doing this formation three times, the back two lights disappeared completely and suddenly, and the first one took off in a straight line at an alarming rate of speed.  It then turned left after going for a good 10 seconds..then 5 seconds later turned right, headed straight for another 20 seconds, then turned left again and kept going.  This all happened over a little culvasack street, at about 6 at night or so.  It really freaked me out<n>

They had orange/red coulour and were moving to the south in an orbital path. There was one guide star, guiding the other two to the south making a perfect triangle. Sometimes it seems they lost each other and we also lost them, but they suddenly made the triangle again got moved to the same path. There was three stars with the same ligth intensity and colour.

I went outside to the backyard to check the turkey roasting on the barbeque. The day was a beautiful clear day in Phoenix, Arizona. The sky was baby blue and cloudless. As I was tending to the turkey, I heard a very loud jet roar. The sound was louder than normal so I looked up. The first thing I noticed was a very thick double contrail not very high  up in the sky. My eyes followed it to the object making it. It was a white passenger type jet. From where I stood, the craft was five inches long, and it was near enough to make out what airline it was, but there wern&#39;t any markings at all. The thick contrails were emitting from each wing. The aircraft was heading from SW to NW. As I watched the contrails continued unbroken then suddenly each contrail had a short break in it, and then each contrail continued for a very short length and then the entire passenger-type jet Blinked Out! It just vanished into a clear baby blue sky before my eyes! It was nowhere to be seen. I went inside to record the event in my journal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have not received any other reports about the incident, but would like to have anyone who may have been witness to this incident to submit a report.  A typical airliner, that appears to a witness on the ground to be &#34;five inches long,&#34; would, indeed, be at a very low altitude.  Typically, jet aircraft at low altitude do not generate contrails.  PD))<n>

2/3/02 07:00|Inverness (UK/Scotland)||Formation|30 seconds|3 hourglass shapes in formation (2 high, 1 low) over Inverness, Scotland, UK|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22093.html|223|ndxe200202| 3 hourglass shapes in formation (2 high, 1 low) over Inverness, Scotland, UK<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother opened her curtains, then window of her bedroom at 07:00 GMT on the 2nd March 2002 (which she has done for the last 30 years at this location) only to be surprised at what she thought was a partially deflated weather balloon, coming from a west to east direction at about 1-1500 feet and at quite a speed so she presumed it had an engine but she heard no noise from it.  Cloud cover was at 3-4000 feet and no blue sky (it&#39;s Scotland in March???).   It was dark grey with blue and red colours (not lights) on either side and had something trailing underneath it like a re-fuelling rod (DC-10 with 4 F-18&#39;s and a RAF Tornado flew low over the city the day before with DC-10 trailing fuel rod and planes lined up behind it - last time this happened about 8 years ago there was complaint made as to how low aircraft were over city).  Since I have always been a plane spotter since childhood and local airport is about 8 miles and RAF base is 30 miles away she knows what a plane looks like, commercial or Forces, and still thought this was a balloon, however strange it looked, with it&#39;s curvy hourglass look and trailing rod.  She went to get the telescope to have a closer look and ran to the bedroom on the other side of the house as she knew with it&#39;s speed it would be over the house before she got to the telescope even though telescope is in her room next to cupboard by the window.  When she got there she was surprised to see two of the same description flying in the same direction as the other one and about 3 times as high as the one that caught her eye.  She focussed the scope on the lowest one before it disappeared behind the rooftops of the neighbouring houses and still it looked as she described earlier.  She focussed on the other 2 objects and they were going as fast as the other one was which she described as your typical RAF jet speed for the area, about 300 mph with no noise at all.  Our location has a good horizon to horizon view from east to west (about 3 miles west and 1.5 east and RAF fly it every ! day) and we get very strong winds here but rarely exceeding 70-80 mph and that day was only a 15mph breeze.  The more she thought about it the more it seemed strange but if she had to define her sighting she would say it was a weather balloon, the fastest weather balloon she has seen.  NEVER, never have we or I in all my time looking up at planes (even when there are none there) ever seen a weather balloon in our area and if they did fly over this way??? why so low and more importantly, how so fast?  I have to stress that at first sighting she jokingly thought we were being invaded she told me(seeing as object was unknown to her) but as she watched approach a bit more it became clear this was not a normal sight you would see flying in the skies over our city.<n>

It was about 3:45 am doing exactly what I always do . That is to look into the morining sky and watch the stars.It was a slightly cloudy morning , standing in the drive way I could see the usual search lights lighting up the clouds just above it. To my surprize I noticed green light ray breams shining from within the clouds. I took another good look to confirm my sighting. There was scattered clouds nearby the clouds were the search lightup. From within a few clouds( about 4 or 5 ) these green beams where shining towards the search light beams in a &#34;on&#34;  and &#34;off&#34; mode .It would lightup for a quick 1 second or a slightly longer , 2 to 3 second ray of beam pulse. No pattern that i could determine. I could not see any object or hear any noise to suggest a space ship(several small ones) as the beams came from within different patches of clouds ,shining horizonatally towards the reflecting cloud the was light up by the search light in Randburg,Johannesburg,South Africa. You could determine a forward or backward motion of the light as you could see an intense green light from what would be the source and a fading light of that beam ,being away from it . The angle from which  I could see this event allowed me to see the change of direction of the beams from the different small groups of clouds . Just to ensure that this was not my imagination and to have a witness .I got my mother out of bed, after a few minutes later ,assuring myself that this is true and real to my senses. She to had seen the green lights shine from within the clouds too. It seamed to me that these crafts took cover within the patches of clouds. The beam lengths could not be more than 100m in lenght ,shaped more like a rectangular wood beam. The green beam lights would shine at that lenght and  less depending if it was a bright or gentle beam (it varied for each small cloud group)...I watched this for about 20 mins...it was still there when I continued my way to my bed.<n>

I saw the two lights to the left (north) first. I focused on them and then noticed the two lights to the right (south). I have worked the area for four years and never seen them before so my attention was drawn to them. I should also note that the lights were due east of my location and appeared directly above Memorial Stadium. I was unsure what the objects were at first and I thought they may have been a reflection or new lights on the stadium. I also did not think much about them initially because of that reason. I had been scanning the other Police departments in the area (radio traffic) and heard several other officers talking about unidentified objects they were seeing. I then realized the objects I was seeing was probably related. The closer I came to the stadium also made me realize the objects were several hundred feet above it. The four objects hovered in place. I did not see them move or do anything else. I lost sight of them when I turned northbound onto First Street and was close to the base of the stadium. I realized the lights were further to the east and the stadium blocked my view. Later that night, I telephoned METCAD (a dispatch agency) and learned that several people, including other officers, had reported seeing up to ten unusual lights in the sky. Some believed the lights were from skydivers or parachute flares. Others believed it was the military doing some type of menuevers. I also learned that some buildings had been lit up with spotlights from these objects. Another important point that I forgot to include was that maybe five minutes after my sighting, I received a computer message from our front desk personnel that (said) someone from an apartment at 308 East Armory (3 blocks north of the stadium) called-in to report ten airplanes using orange running lights to communicate to each other in morse code. I am unsure of the loca! tion of that sighting. One last point, METCAD advised during my previously-mentioned telephone conversation that they had called the local airport (Willard) to see if they could provide any information on the unusual sightings. The airport&#39;s reply was that they knew of nothing going on and had nothing on their radar screen.

2/2/02 23:40|Urbana|IL|Circle|5-7 minutes|approximately 11 bright orange objects sighted travelling SW to NE at 23:40 on 02/02/02 in Urbana, IL.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21686.html|229|ndxe200202| approximately 11 bright orange objects sighted travelling SW to NE at 23:40 on 02/02/02 in Urbana, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home at 11:30 last Saturday evening after visiting with friends, and at first I saw 4 or 5 objects all travelling at the same rate of speed, all heading the same direction - SW to NE.  I stopped the car to watch.  They were all about the same size, and seemed to be very small objects, very high up in the sky - all orange colored like the embers of a fire.  One of them quickly flashed white very brightly, and then quite shortly after &#39;fizzled out&#39; (there was no sound), and could then not be seen.  After the 4 passed north of where I was, another object exactly the same as the others also travelling the same direction was moving behind first group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I didn&#39;t quite know what I had seen, so I continued on my way home.  I stopped to get some gas and had just left the gas station at 11:43 when I saw another set of the same objects exactly as I had seen a few minutes before.  I pulled over again to watch, and this time saw another 5 or 6 of these objects, and one flashed violently and then fizzled out again like the other, and as I watched one very carefully I could actually see little pieces flake off and flash brightly and then disappear.  I watch this group of objects as I did the previous group, until they passed north and I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do believe the UFOs I observed were pieces of some object which entered the atmostphere and began to disintegrate, breaking into pieces.  I do not know, however, what that object was.  I read NASA Science news frequently, and haven&#39;t heard of anything to watch out for, so I am definitely intrigued as to what objects I saw last weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m currently a graduate student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, studying English.  I studied astronomy in high school with the intent of making this my profession, but earned a degree in music education instead.  Many people were out at the time I saw the objects last weekend, and I am certain there are other observers.<n>
2/2/02 23:35|Urbana|IL|Light|25 minutes|7 to 9 large, bright amber lights moving from southwest to northeast over Illinois|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21656.html|230|ndxe200202| 7 to 9 large, bright amber lights moving from southwest to northeast over Illinois<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occured at night, begining at about 11:30 and ending by midnight.  There were 7 lights that I witnessed, two more according to others nearby.  The lights were amber colored, and would occasionally flash bright white for a moment before going back to amber.  They moved steadily, not zigzagging or stopping and starting.  They were travelling northwest, coming from the southeast.  They each took 4-6 minutes to cross the sky from horizon to horizon.  There were first a pair, moving at the same rate, far enough apart to be distinctly two separate objects.  Before they disappeared over the horizon, a solitary object moved in the same direction.  This solitary one was seen to flash.  About 5 minutes after that one disappeared over the horizon, 4 more came from the same starting point, moving in a line at first.  About 1/4 of the way across the sky, the front one diverged a bit, but they still travelled together.  At about this point, the rear one began to flash white for 30 seconds or so, then went back to amber.  Along the way across, perhaps one or two others did a similar flash behavior.  No sound was heard to come from them.  The objects were very bright and large; moreso than planets, stars or any airplanes.  I am a 26 year old college student in LAS.  Several passersby were stopping in the street to watch and saw the same things I did, and I contacted friends in town who also saw the lights.<n>
2/2/02 23:35|Urbana|IL|Light|5-7 minutes|Orange lights observed over Urbana Illinois|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23746.html|231|ndxe200202| Orange lights observed over Urbana Illinois<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Testimony: &#34;At the time of the sightings, I was walking west down Main Street past my apartment building and to Piccadilly Liquor Store. I just had dinner at the Courier Cafe&#39; aroound the corner. I had not been drinking. I looked forward and up and noticed the light because it was unusually bright. I thought at first that it might be a planet because of its brightness and orange-amber color, though it seemed closer. Watching it as I walked, I noticed it was moving. As I walked past my building and headed down the hill, I saw two men standing at the entrance to a parking lot talking to a man in the passenger side of a stopped car. A woman was driving. I stopped to talk to them. They were all also looking at the light. They pointed me to the northeast where I saw two of the same lights moving off into the horizon. They said the lights had flashed bright white a few minutes ago. The two men walked away and the car drove ahead to the liquor store. I watched the single light continue moving. It flashed a bright white for a few seconds then returned to its amber color and kept moving. I watched it until it was disappearing into the horizon (then proceeded to walk toward the store). In the parking lot, I saw a friend who was leaving the store. He said he&#39;d seen the lights on his way to the store. I went inside (the store) for about five minutes. When I exited, I looked to the southwest and saw four more lights emerge one after the other from the horizon in a line. They seem to be equally spaced apart from each other at first then the first light strayed a little from the line formation. The rear one in the line did the same flashing activity as the first had done. I slowly walked back towards my building. As I watched, one or two others in the line did the same flashing. I watched until they reached the horizon. Once home, I called another friend in town and his girlfriend had seen the same lights fifteen minutes ago. All of the lights appeared the same. All of them seemed to maintain the same altitud! e throug hout their path. They moved in fairly straight lines. If they wavered or altered course, they did so gradually.&#34; In summary, this witness first observed the &#34;lights&#34; in the southwest and last observed in the northeast. The objects were observed approximately halfway up from the horizon. The witness could not begin to estimate the distance of the &#34;lights.&#34; The sighting duration was estimated to be 5-7 minutes in length (from horizon to horizon). The orange-amber lights appeared to be one and a half to two times the size of a star. No sound was discernable.

It was about 10:30pm, the weather was balmy and pleasant. We stopped off at a rest stop for a moment. We both made a comment about a very tall guyed tower off in the distance. That it was REALLY tall. I am aware of these becuase I am in the business. As we got back on the road, the two platform lights seperated and travelled with the car. Then they travelled over the treeline together at superfast speeds. When we became alarmed, we stopped. They did, too. I started back on the highway going 90 and they kept up. I was shocked, so I pulled over again, and again they stopped. We then watched 7 colored, hovering, noiseless balls perform for us in sequence, then four more. They did come closer to the car, but still too distant to perceive completely. They were oranginsh, with a swirling center, and what appeared to be smoke trails or burning coming from the top. After about fifteen minutes of intense praying!, we drove off bewildered and stunned, but okay. We later found out that there was a loss of about 35 miles, or 30 minutes, of which we have no recollection. We were both fully wired at the time. Later, the following evening, we stayed at a hotel in Boca, and became spooked when both the t.v.and microwave began cutting on and off by themselves repeatedly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I experienced truama for several days, as I am a deeply spiritual person. I am by far the most analytical person alive. I have, in desperation, run through every possible scenario in detail. It is impossible. The fact that my wife experienced the same thing is endlessly comforting.<n>

2/2/02 21:35|Moore Haven|FL|Light|20 min|Several bright glowing objects seen by four witnesses in night sky dimming and reappearing and moving at tremendious speed.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21653.html|237|ndxe200202| Several bright glowing objects seen by four witnesses in night sky dimming and reappearing and moving at tremendious speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed two glowing amber to orange objects at aprox 15 degrees on horizion directly north.  Objects hovered for several minutes then one sped off to the west.  The remaining object then dimmed and disappeared.  After several minutes (3-4)both objects returned further down on the horizion about tree top level but several miles distant.  Once again they disappeared. they returned aprox. 2 minutes later over the horizion and one by one six distince objects appeared just  above tree top level equally spaced apart over an aprox one mile area.  The objects dimmed from east to west and five of the objects regrouped just to the west of their orgional position.  They stayed this way for several minutes then one by one the dimmed out and disappaered.  They did not reappear.  This was witnessed by myself, my wife, daughter and mother-in-law.  After observing the two lights at the start, my wife thought it to be a launch of either the space shuttle (which can be seen from our ranch) or a missle launch.  She came into the house, called for me to come out and got our digital camera and we were able to obtain photos of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several years ago, I was working as the head of security for a major corporation.  Several workers brought my attention to a similar incident involving two glowing objects.  These were also witnessed by several drivers and workers at the plant.  The duration of this event was also several minutes (15-20), and the objects also dimmed and reappeared several times, and traveled at tremendious speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from across the U.

2/2/02 21:15|Melbourne|FL|Light|2210|Eleven reddish orange lights appear and disappear in the skey|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21677.html|238|ndxe200202| Eleven reddish orange lights appear and disappear in the skey<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, February 2,2002 at approximately 9:15 p.m., my husbard and I were leaving my mothers house, she leaves in the Lake Washington area.  In the southwest sky my husband observed a reddish orange light.  The light appeared to be standing still.  Living near an airport we first thought it might be a incoming airplane.  We got out of the car and while waiting to see if the light would move all of a sudden a second but smaller light appeared above and to the right of the first light.  As we waited to see what would happen next the first light suddenly disappeared.  Then all of a sudden the light reappeared and then the second light disappeared.  I called my mother out and she brought with her a pair of binoculars.  When looking through the binoculars you could observe the lights pulsating.  The light would take turns suddenly appearing and disappearing. The lights would also change shapes. The continuded for about 40-45 minutes.  When all of a sudden one by one seven lights appeared.  Each light was even distanced except for the space between the 4 and 5 light.  After all seven lights appeared in a perfectly straight horizontal line, to the above and left 4 more lights appeared.  The next thing we heard was what eppeared to be two military jets and a Blackhawk helicopter.  There was also a plane with search lights that flew over the sightings area.  Upon the arrival of the aircraft all of the lights immediately disappeared.  My sister and her friend also observed the unusually busy night sky with the military aircraft. This entire episode lasted for about 50 minutes.  If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would not have believe it.<n>

Slowly one by one the bright light started to disappear (as if the light was being turned off by a dimmer switch) in the first set of 4.  The second set of 4 - the second light from the left slowly went downward toward the earth. and then slowly disappeared. Then the first light, fourth light and third light (in that order) slowly disappeared.<n>
2/2/02 20:30|Spokane|WA|Light|20-25 min|Two bright lights - one danced wildly while the other stood still.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21654.html|240|ndxe200202| Two bright lights - one danced wildly while the other stood still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my home on a hilltop about 18 miles SE of Spokane, WA. At about 8:20 PM PDT I observed a bright light to the NW over Spokane.  This is not too unusual as this is the general direction of the local airport and military air base.  I am accustomed to seeing landing lights, and have observed them appear to hang in the air when the plane is taking off and traveling towards my location.  Usually however, I can detect the motion of the plane after several minutes.  What drew my attention to this light, was the fact that about 10 minutes after initially seeing it, it was still in the same location.  I then thought it must be a helicopter, and grabbed my 7X35 binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw through my binoculars was three white lights in a line, with red and blue lights on top.  The brightness would increase to quite bright, and then fade to dim, and back to bright etc. about every 2 to 3 minutes.  The light then began moving slowly toward the NE.  I then saw another light approaching from the SW.  I thought it must be an airplane coming to check out the original light.  But when the second light got to within what I estimate to be about 3 miles from the first light, it too then stopped and began to get brighter and dimmer, just like the first.  I called 911 and reported what I was seeing, and was told no one else had reported anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now what is still giving me goose bumps is that while I was on the phone with 911, I was still observing the lights in my binoculars.  All of a sudden the second light began &#34;dancing&#34; - it left the impression of what one sees on the 4th of July when you move a sparkler around rapidly at night.  What is most unusual is that the original light stayed stationary, so I know it just wasn&#39;t me getting jittery with the binoculars. This dancing lasted only about 20 seconds. The second &#34;dancing&#34; light then dimmed out and I didn&#39;t see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The original light then continued moving slowly to the NE, but as it got NNE of my location, the white lights went out, and the &#34;object&#34; began moving rapidly to the SSW, and it appeared to be climbing.  I would estimate its speed as that of a fast military jet.  I observed what appeared to be the normal red and green navigation lights on the outside edges, but there were two larger, brighter red lights which glowed steadily on top.  I was outside at this point, but I heard no noise, which is probably not so unusual, because the object was probably 20-30 miles from me at this time.  Its hard to estimate.  At about this time, I again saw what appeared to be an object much like the original, over Spokane, again in the general direction of the civilian and military airports.  This object again flucuated in intensity, but after about 5 minutes it dimmed out.  Again, what bothers me about this is the wildly dancing of the one light, while the other stayed stationary.<n>

The movement was much greater than the shimmering effect on stars caused by atmospheric conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as we watched it we could discern colors. We got binoculars and through them we could definitely see rotating or pulsating red and blue lights on the object. After a few mintes the air traffic in our sector became really heavy. A lot of planes. A ground fog moved in and all activity disappeared from our line of sight. It was not a plane, copter, comet, satellite, weather balloon, star, planet or anything logical we could think of.<n>

There was no noise, although they were only three or four thousand feet up. The lights didn&#39;t change in there appearance while approaching or receding like the lights of an aircraft would. There were no colored running lights of any type. Just a constant titanium white light like a flare. As the objects receded, they entered some very low lying clouds, which filtered out the white light, giving each the appearance of a single orange/yellow pinpoint of light.<n>
2/2/02 03:30|Seattle|WA|Sphere|15 seconds|Three dimly self-illuminated orange orbs travelling due West over Seattle|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22101.html|249|ndxe200202| Three dimly self-illuminated orange orbs travelling due West over Seattle<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four of us who were gathering together that evening for a man&#39;s night out movie marathon in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle. After watching four straight episodes of a Quartermass series (ironically), it was getting really late and we decided to break up the party. Around 3:30 am we gathered in the street to leave, when one witness needed to go back inside to get something. When he returned, the second witness began telling me a story of an encounter he had had recently (more irony). As he was telling the story, the third witness looked up and said, &#34;Look, a UFO&#34;. The four of us looked straight up and saw three dimly lit glowing orange orbs moving from East to West overhead. The details are as follows: The orbs (or disks) appeared to be self illuminated, but not very bright, like a candle flame through a transparent orange balloon; which was a different colored orange than the city-light reflections on the clouds. They were traveling directly above us, just below the spotty checkerboard of cumulus clouds, which were estimated to be about 1500-2000 feet high, and the moon was directly south of us at about 65 degree angle from the southern horizon (my estimate). The two outer orbs (north and south)were flying in a straight vector, while the middle orb was &#34;playfully&#34; zigzagging between the other two, yet more closely to the northern-most orb. There was no sound as they passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and another witness watched the objects the longest as they passed behind a nearby building, which obscured our view at about a 45 degree angle from our viewpoint. After witnessing these objects we had ruled out these objects as being seagulls, common to this area, as there were no signs of wing-flapping, the objects were not oval-shaped as a seagull&#39;s body would be and the maneuvering of the middle object was to fast and erratic for a bird. Seagulls and other birds tend to make sounds when flying as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After talking about this between a couple of us later, we did not seem to surprised by what we saw, nor disturbed. It just seemed to cap off a perfect evening. Though one witness referred to these objects as &#34;piloted craft&#34;, my gut was telling me &#34;critter&#34;, as if they were some yet unclassified self-illuminating lifeform.<n>
2/2/02 02:53|Clermont|FL|Light|1 minute|A blinding light caused an electrical disturbance while passing near my car.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21657.html|250|ndxe200202| A blinding light caused an electrical disturbance while passing near my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After dropping a friend off at home, I was traveling down Lake Louisa Rd towards Lake Shore Dr in Cermont,FL. I had not been drinking that night nor had I been under the influence of any drugs. I am not one who has ever given thought to mysterious objects or paranormal occurences (in fact, I usually dismiss such claims as insanity or stories told by people looking for attention). As I was traveling down the road, I noticed a bright light on the left side of my car down by the lake, which is kind of downhill from the road. The light was so bright that it was almost like a truck&#39;s high beams or a spotlight shining directly in my line of sight. I didn&#39;t give much thought to the object as it was just above water level and was just sitting down in the valley. When I started to pass from its view, the light started to approach up the hill and made a slow move across the road above my car. It was now directly over my car, just in front of my hood, I would say at this point it was about 15/20 feet in the air. The light was so bright that I could see nothing but the light. I coudn&#39;t see anything in front of me. At this point my &#39;99 Ford Mustang completely died on me! The battery and all. I couldn&#39;t get the engine to turn or anything. Dead. I was sitting right below this thing and it was dead silent. I had the window about a 1/4 of the way down and I could hear nothing. It was probably the eariest silence I can ever remember. The light sat there for about 30 seconds or so and finally started moving to my right until it was directly in view of the right side of my car. It took some time for my eyes to adjust and stop seeing spots. But all I remember is having that same bright light to my right and seeing it rise out of view and dart off. It was almost as though it shot off like a slingshot had propelled it at a 45 degree angle. Just like that it was gone. I continued to try and start my car, and, after sitting there for about another minute, it started. It took all I had to catch my breath and try to tell myself ! that I w as okay and to bloc it out as though nothing had happened. I immediately called my parents, and then my girlfriend, and told them each of what had just occurred. They could all tell how anxious and scared I really was. I am 26 years old and I am a collee graduate. I believe in rational explanations to events like these. I cannot think of any, which has me scared. My car is working perfectly and have never had any problems with it. The battery is fully charged. It couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter because the light was at a low level and there was dead silence. With the window down I would have for sure heard the helicopter. I am a religious person, yet skeptical of such modern day claims of supernatural events. I really am at a loss for what to make of this.<n>

They were three sided, but with rounded edges.  It was completely silent, and I am sure that the street we were on is usually pretty busy, even at three two in the morning.  Neither of us are sure how long they were there, we were mesmerized by the bright aqua light we saw.  They figures seemed to glide around, I at first thought they were just airplanes, then they stopped in mid air.  They didn&#39;t hover, they just hung motionlessly in the air, as if time froze.  (Even though this sounds cool, we all know it isnt possible.  Its just awesome to think about.)  They hung for no more than ten seconds then shot off into the air.  Behind them was a trail of light that faded from the same aqua color as the figures to an almost non existant dark black.  As beautiful a sight as this was, we were scared out of our wits!  My friend and I are both big believers in &#39;life out there&#39;, but never expected to see anything!  Later that night we kept thinking we saw them again, but we were just being paranoid, or that is what we have comcluded.<n>

As I gazed out the windshield a streak of bluish white light flashed across my view from left to right.  It was about midway between the top of a hill and the the top of my sight.  It happened so fast, and then it was gone.  I later asked my boyfriend, who was driving, if he had seen it, and he hadn&#39;t.  I have never seen anything like it before.  We were quite near a small airport, but this was  not a plane.  A minute or so later there was a high-pitched screeching noise, almost like the sound of electrical saw sawing metal or something.  It was very loud and both of us heard it.  We checked out his car this morning and found nothing wrong with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder if the witness means a time and date of 0015 hrs. on the morning of Sunday, 03FE02.  We will attempt to clarify the date.  PD))<n>

2/1/02 21:00|Elkton|MD|Light|30 MINUTES|BRIGHT WHITE STROBE LIKE LIGHT WITH A BEAM SHINING DOWN, VERY, VERY LOUD|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21663.html|256|ndxe200202| BRIGHT WHITE STROBE LIKE LIGHT WITH A BEAM SHINING DOWN, VERY, VERY LOUD<n> <n><n> <n><n> ABOUT 8:45 PM ON FRIDAY FEB 1 2 OF MY CHILDREN AND I WERE SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM TALKING AND I HEARD A NOISE THAT AT THE TIME I THOUGHT WAS JUST A LARGE TRUCK COMING DOWN MAIN STREET. IT GOT LOUDER AND LOUDER. I KEPT WAITING FOR THIS TRUCK TO PASS. IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. IT WAS SO LOUD THAT WE WERE TRYING TO TALK OVER IT. WHEN THE SOUND DIDN&#39;T RECEDE I WENT TO MY KITCHEN THINKING THAT MY DISHWASHER WAS GETTING READY TO EXPLODE (THE SOUND WAS SO LOUD AND SO CLOSE). IN THE KITCHEN I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND ACROSS THE STREET OVER A HOUSE I SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT WITH A BEAM THAT WAS SHINING DOWN BEHIND THE HOUSE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A POLICE HELICOPTER SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE. BUT IT WAS SO LOUD (SO LOUD THAT YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL IT) AND THE CRAFT (WHICH I COULD NOT SEE BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK AND THE LIGHT COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF IT WAS SO BRIGHT)WAS NOT MOVING. IT WAS STATIONARY. SO I RAN OUTSIDE TO GET A BETTER LOOK AND THE NOISE WAS UNBELEIVABLY LOUD. I&#39;VE NEVER HEARD A POLICE HELICOPTER SOUND LIKE THIS. MY TWO YOUNGEST KIDS CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS AND THEY WERE SCARED. I TOO WAS SCARED. AT THIS POINT MY OLDEST CAME FROM UPSTAIRS TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS NOISE WAS. SO WE ALL WATCHED THIS THING BUT COULDN&#39;T MAKE OUT THE SHAPE OF THE CRAFT. IT JUST SAT RIGHT ABOVE THIS HOUSE FOR THE LONGEST TIME WITH THIS BEAM SHINING DOWN. AT ONE POINT IT STARTED TO MOVE SLOWLY AND WHEN IT DID WE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE LIGHT UNDERNEATH. I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE A LIGHT SO BRIGHT THAT YOU COULDN&#39;T LOOK DIRECTLY INTO IT. THE LIGHT WAS ROUND LIKE A STROBE LIGHT. A BUNCH OF LIGHTS MAKING UP THIS STROBE LIGHT. THE LIGHTS WERE WHITE. WHEN THIS THING MOVED WE RAN INTO THE HOUSE BECAUSE WE WERE SCARED OF THAT BEAM AND DIDN&#39;T WANT TO GET CAUGHT UNDERNEATH IT. WE WERE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND IT WAS MOVING (NOT FAST) FLYING OVER OUR HOUSE. WE COULDN&#39;T SEE IT ANYMORE BUT THE BEAM STILL SHONE DOWN BEHIND THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET (FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE SKY BEHIND OUR HOUSE) I CALLED MY HU! SBAND AT WORK AND TOLD HIM WHAT WE WERE SEEING AND I TOOK THE PHONE OUTSIDE SO HE COULD HEAR BECAUSE IT WAS STILL REAL LOUD, AFTER HEARING IT HE CAME STRAIGHT HOME. BUT IT WAS GONE. WHAT STRUCK ME AS EVEN ODDER WAS THAT WHILE ME AND THE KIDS WERE OUTSIDE CHECKING THIS THING OUT, NO ONE ELSE CAME OUT OF THEIR HOUSES. I KEPT LOOKING AROUND TO SEE IF ANY OF THE NEIGHBORS WERE OUT LOOKING AT THIS THING BUT I DIDN&#39;T EVEN SEE ANYONE LOOKING OUT OF THEIR WINDOWS.<n>

The unidentified object stayed stationary in the sky for the duration of the time I video taped it. I drove my car east approximately 3/4 of a mile until I reached the end of the street.  The object was further east and appeared to be approximately 1500 feet in the sky.  I was able to get a closer inspection of the video tape on a larger Television.  The object appeared to be floating  in a stationary position.  The object did move slightly up, down, left, and right.  I was unable to determine what the object was.<n>

I ( we ) have never reported this incident to anyone except our buddies at work and family friends, I suppose in fear of our job, would be the reason or our collectivly not being able to describe what we saw. dcpp is a nucular power plant, each year we are constantly trained to be the best in our fields. I am currently a plant insulator, but was a plant operator for a time. On the morning that this observation occured we , myself and 3 fellow insulator/coating spealists, were to clean and recoat insulators on a transformer located at the north end of the plant. While waiting for a qualified electriction ( for safety purposes) an airplane was observed coming from the horizion toward us. As it came closer to our position I, we, all noticed that it was not a normal airplane.  It had no sound coming from it&#39;s engine and no wings, as it came closer(2000 feet away) we noticed that it also had no lights. This being just after daylight was easy to see.  The speed of the craft was approx. 300 mph.  It then disapeared behind a knole approx. 1/4 mile north of the plant. We continued to watch, for a crash and flames, but in 30 seconds it reappeared heading out to sea, West, again at approx. 300 mph, but picked up speed and disapeared over the horizon at a very fast speed. Our eye level was at 90 feet above sea level, so we were able to see quite far out to sea.  Visability was exceptional. The craft was not large, probably 100 feet long and 20 feet in diameter, my best guess. It was shaped exactly like a cigar, color of silver or bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
