It was completely dark. I was standing at the entrance road to the old Averill School on Oakland St. when I looked up in the sky toward the south and saw a round blue circular object. At first I thought it was the moon but it was 3 or 4 times larger than the moon appears in the sky and it was a solid blue color. It did not move at all and there was no sound coming from it. There were no lights on it but it seemed to produce its own light. In other words, it didn&#39;t seem as if it were illuminated by any kind of reflected light. The object was a perfect circle and completely opaque. As I saw it, it appeared two-dimensional in the sky as the moon does. After a few minutes it began to dissolve. I&#39;m pretty sure that it maintained its shape while it dissolved. I noticed at one point while it was dissolving that I could see stars behind it which I couldn&#39;t see a few minutes before. It eventually dissolved completely. I wondered if it might be a natural organic phenomenon of some kind but it seems to me such a thing would not be perfectly round. I would like to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

WE SEEN THIS ICE BLUE OVAL SHAPE CRAFT LANDING IN A HAY FIELD. WE DECIDED TO CHECK IT OUT,SINCE WE HAD SOME GUNS WITH US. AS WE DROVE INTO THE FIELD MY DADS TRUCK STOPPED RUNNING.WHEN WE WALKED CLOSE TO THE CRAFT,I SEEN THAT THE HATCH WAS OPEN. WHEN I TURNED AROUNDED THERE WERE FOUR BEINGS TAKING,WHAT LOOKED LIKE READINGS.THE NEXT THING THAT I REMEMBERED,I STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CRAFT,AS I WALK OUTSIDE I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS SOME OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE CRAFT. SOME IN UNIFORMS. WHEN THE CRAFT LEFT, IT SHOT A BEAM OF BLUE-WHITE LITE INTO THE SKY. THEN THE SKY SORT OF TURNED INTO WATER,THE CRAFT FOLLOWED THE BEAM AND WAS GONE.THE NEXT THING THAT REMEMERED,I WAS HOME IN BED AND MY BUDDIES DONOT REMEMBER ANYTING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We really stopped talking about it much along time ago. It was a white glowing cube shaped box with a red light inside of it in the center. It had when it got close to us 1/4 mile and hovered it had a glossy shine to it. I did some checking may or may not mean anything? But back then at least ours was, T.V. was black and white. T.V. was really,for the most part not around very long. The TV 2 tower near us then first broadcast was on Nov.28,1954. So my thinking that it either picked up the signal with in 10 to 11 light year area from earth. If it came from a nearby star system. Or if it was a probe or ship of some kind that was just passing by and picked up the signal and followed it back to there, then who knows where it came from?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate the fact, but the date of the sighting may be approximate.

9/15/65 21:30|Terrebonne|OR|Light|5-6 hours|Pairs of RED LIGHTS spinning up, down, spiraling, twirling....as if playing.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91178.html|4|ndxe196509| Pairs of RED LIGHTS spinning up, down, spiraling, twirling....as if playing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #3.  During the late summer of 1964 or 1965, my girlfriend and I were on a hilltop in central Oregon doing a little star-gazing. As my car was a hardtop, I was outside leaning on the car where I could get a better view of the cloudless evening sky. It was after 9:30 P.M.,  a warm, calm evening. After a few minutes when my eyes had adjusted to the light-less area and my headlights had been off long enough to allow me to see well, I noticed what could best be described as the red clearance light (strobe)of a commercial airliner overhead and to the east. Then I began to notice several other “red-lights” in close proximity to the first one. Upon closer scrutiny I noticed there was about a dozen small, red lights. It looked like they were in pairs. They would spiral what seemed to be upward, then tumble over each other in a downward free-fall, then level off, and repeat the maneuver. ALL of them were doing this. Both my girlfriend and I were dumbfounded, to say t! he least! We continued watching these lights for over an hour. (Please keep in mind neither one of us were “drinkers”, and definitely NOT pot users.) As my friend needed to be back home before 11:00 P.M., we headed the five miles to her house. At her residence, I borrowed her dad&#39;s single-lens spotting scope and returned to the area to see if the lights were still in the Easterly sky. Sure enough! Still there. Still doing the same pairs of red-light spirals as before. (I believe the mono-lens was about a 4X ) Even with the lens they were obviously quite a distance from me. They were obviously CLOSER, but by no means were any additional details to be seen. I continued to view these “pairs of red lights” until about 2:00 A.M. And went home. When I arrived at my home, about 5 miles North of where I&#39;d been watching the show, the yard lights were so bright I couldn&#39;t see what I had been observing earlier. Next morning I listened for any reports of lights.....but heard of none. A! gain, I didn&#39;t mention much to anyone except my girlfriend, wh! o appear ed to think we were having a wild dream of some type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This was the first time I noticed she would tend to deny something existed if she didn&#39;t have an easy to understand explanation for a given event.) One other note: we/I never heard any type of sound(s) from either viewing. However, it can be difficult to hear a jet-liner if it is at 35,000 feet or higher and at some distance away (not directly  overhead). But red lights, in tandem, “playing”......NOT a commercial plane!  P.S. We were still residing at the same farm/ ranch in Jefferson County, Oregon. The actual “red light” sightings took place in an area called Lone Pine, Oregon about 5 miles east of Terrebonne, Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They could have records,possibly. I was standing outside on  the sidewalk near my friends house waiting for him to come back out.It was dark out and a cloudless sky.I was looking up at the stars when movement caught my eye. Moving across the sky above in a southeast to northwest direction were three triangular objects.They had no lights on them but even though it was dark,I could see them plainly because they &#34;glowed&#34; a lumninous &#34;blue&#34; color.As I said, they were triangular in shape ,but the corners of each triangle were rounded.They were in a triangular formation also,with one being in front and the other two behind and on each side of the lead craft.I listened and could not hear any sound what-so-ever coming from them .They just seemed to glide across the sky.I made sure that even after they went out of sight I listened in case there was a sound like jets going over and there was none. My friend then came back out to tell me he had to do homework and I quickly told him what I had just seen . I said goodbye to him and told him I was going home to tell my parents what I had witnessed. I was a block from my home at my friends house and I ran the whole way which couldn&#39;t have taken more than 5 minutes from the time I saw the objects ,told my friend about and then ran to my house. When I got home ,I ran in and started telling my mother what I had seen .As I was telling her ,a news bulliton came over the local radio station :(my mother was listening to music on the radio) that Erie Weather Radar had just reported tracking &#34;three unidentified objects&#34; on their radar moving in a northwest direction over Lake Erie.Thatwas the only time that the incedent was disgussed.I never saw anything on the news or in the newspapers about it. By the way ,Erie is aprox.50 miles northwest of Titusille.                                                      What really amased me was the fact that no more than 10 minutes had passed since I had seen them and already the Erie Weather Radar had reported it to the local radio stations !! I&#39;m sure what they saw and what I did were the same craft.I&#39;ve always wondered if anyone else had ever seen those same craft. I guess that is why I am finally reporting this.Of course , any time I have ever talked about it to friends ,they look at me like &#34;Wow, what planet did this guy drop from?&#34; . I&#39;m sure you know what I mean . But , ever since then , I have made an effort to watch the skies everytime I get a chance and have had 2 other sightings . But they were different than the ones I saw back then. One was a couple years after that when that same friend and I were &#34;sleeping -out&#34; in a ballfield on a hill so we could watch the meteor showers and the other was in Elk County in October, 1974 when I and a friend saw 2 craft which were later chased by 3 jets. But then, those to sightings are for other reports,I guess.<n>

The rain had stopped and dark gray clouds were skudding overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents went outside with my sister and for some reason I was still in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was going through the dining room area to get to the back door I passed a window looking toward the East.  Something caught my eye in the sky over some trees.  It appeared to be a egg shaped object that was emitting its own brilliant light source.  Not silver but like an egg shaped light bulb in the sky.  It really stood out against those gray clouds.  It was coming toward where I was watching it out the window and it was really moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the movement of it really puzzled me because it was going back and forth advancing toward me until I realized that it was in a zig zag motion horizonally while flying.  Then the object streaked out of the window space while making a sharp turn toward the west where I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I burst out the back door and caught a very quick look at it as it went through the sky at an incredible speed through a break in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object crossed a large part of the sky in just a blink of an eye and made absolutely no sound.  No plane or jet could do that back then or now and be lit up like this thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course I just happened to be passing the window when I saw it but since it made NO sound my family, who were outside at the time, missed it completely because there was no reason to look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The pool was Melwood located in a valley perpindicular -to the south - of the Allegheny River at New kensington. At that valley&#39;s head - close to the river - was New Kensington&#39;s foot ball stadium where a contest between high school bands was being held. Close to the swimming pool where I was was a well lit pitch and putt golf course. The flying object appeared over the stadium and came up the valley to where I was. I saw a cylinder of dull grey metal about 150 feet long hovering above the golf course lights. This appearance was well documented in the Vallet Daily Newspaper the following day on the front page. No investigation was ever done to my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The schoolyard was full of kids playing and awaiting entry into the school. I glanced up and saw an object hovering silently with no markings or lights, about 100&#39; up. It wasn&#39;t darkly colored nor was it shiny, but it was clearly a cylinder. It was oriented as if one had taken a can of vegtables and lifted it off the table and into the air. I looked down to tell a friend to look up and when I looked back up it was gone. I would say the object was 12 feet tall and the diameter on the bottom about 4 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

9/1/65 13:00|Jefferson City|MO|Sphere|2 minutes or so|Mid 1960's in Jefferson City Mo silver sphere descended and rapidly ascended upon approach of a military jet|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41452.html|9|ndxe196509| Mid 1960&#39;s in Jefferson City Mo silver sphere descended and rapidly ascended upon approach of a military jet<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I was about 10 years old at the time, playing in the backyard of our home.  I was throwing a football straight up in the air and catching it as it came back down when I noticed the object in the sky.  It was small at first, about the size of a star but I remember thinking it couldn&#39;t be since it was nearly noon and directly overhead.  It got bigger and bigger and I realised it was coming down.  It made no sound at all.  At one point it just seamed to hover above me, and apeared to be a small silver ball about the size of a dime held at arms length.  It was hard to tell how high it was, my best guess is that it was somewhere between 2,000 - 5,000 feet high.  I continued to stare at it, wondering what it could be.  Then I remember feeling a strange sensation as if my whole body shifted an inch to the right in a matter of an instant as I continued to stare at the object.  A few seconds after that point I noticed a jet heading towards the object.  Thinking back now on the situation, I realise that it may have been a military jet coming from the direction of the Whiteman Air Force base, just west of Jefferson City.  As the jet got closer to it, the object appeared to rapidly ascend straight up until it was no longer visible.  The jet that had been coming towards the object turned around and flew back in the direction it came from.  I remember going into the house and being scolded by my mom for not answering her calls for me, and I thinking she was crazy since I was just outside in the backyard and did not hear her calling my name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Estimated late summer to early fall, it wasn’t cold.  Weather decks were open (nice weather, calm water).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location:  East of the Azores<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted--witness)) was an Electronic Technician ET3R (Radar).  BR did maintenance on all radar on the Albany including SPS30, SPS43, SPS39, SPS10, TACAN, and airborne early warning (AEW).  The Albany is a heavy cruiser, not an air craft carrier, but it do air traffic control (hence the TACAN).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was after dark, after 10:00pm &#34;lights out.&#34;  Not sure if it was 8pm to Midnight or Midnight to 4am watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Russian Bear aircraft had recently been seen in the area and the 6th fleet was on lookout for maneuvers involving Russian aircraft and trawlers (electronic spy boats disguised as fishing boats).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted--witness)) and air traffic controllers were watching 3 bogies on radar, but had no visual contact.  Bogies did not respond to any communication.  They were following fleet at distance of 40-50 miles for over an hour at approximately the speed of the fleet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Decision was made to scramble three jets, possibly F4 phantoms (BR is not sure).  Jet pilots radioed back jet speed on the order of 1350 KTS.  Jet pilots did not get visual on bogies.  ((initials deleted)) could see bogies on SPS30 in height finding radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not normal to have air traffic controllers in CIC (Combat Information Center) at night.  They were officers and would normally be asleep, but controllers did arrive due to unusual occurrence this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Albany used SPA33 Plan Position Indicator display units for multiple radar systems on the Albany but this system did not link into other ships in the fleet.  The important point being that a malfunction of the Albany’s radar system would not affect other ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The task force mission was to protect the air craft carrier.  They were protecting from sub attacks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted--witness)) does not remember the aircraft carrier name.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft carrier also reported three bogies on their independent on-board radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Albany’s radars were set on sector scan to focus on bogies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jets reported over the radio that they had radar contact with bogies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jets never got closer than 20 miles (thus no visual?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jets move about 1/4 inch per radar sweep at 1350 knots.  The bogies began to move away in approximately 3/4 inch jumps per sweep.  Bogies maintained triangular formation.  Bogies disappeared from radar within 7 sweeps. Jets were still visible on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Officer of the watch was present talking the Albany’s air traffic controllers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jets still in flight broke off pursuit and turned back to the air craft carrier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Radar went back to full 360 scan.  Radar operators were to keep a lookout for similar aircraft/bogies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two air controllers (lieutenant two bars) smiled at each other and one turned to BR and said, &#34;this incident never happened.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted--witness)) suspects the air controllers were acting under an order not to discuss the incident but was never personally ordered not to discuss the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
