4/25/67 21:00|Chattahoochee|FL|Light|10 minutes|The two objects left two vapor trails with 90 degree turns in them before they simply vanished.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42213.html|1|ndxe196704| The two objects left two vapor trails with 90 degree turns in them before they simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around mid April, 1967, Myself, Father, Brother, Uncle, Brother In-Law, Cousin and his Wife were on a week long fishing trip to Lake Seminole, where we made camp about 300 yards below Chattahoochee Dam. The Apalachicola River runs free from the dam to the Gulf of Mexico. We were mainly fishing for bass. They lay their eggs in the rock bed below the dam in early summer and are easy to catch when they are on the bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One particular day a storm was passing through in the afternoon and it was not until after dark when the storm began to break. Because most of the day had been wasted, we decided to do some night fishing. All of us loaded into two boats and we set anchor about 50 yards below the dam. We had been there about an hour, catching fish and having a good time. We were not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin got everyone&#39;s attention and instructed us to look to the sky. We all thought it was lighting and turned our attention back to fishing when my cousin said &#34;no, keep looking&#34;. The following 5 or 10 minutes, I really was not aware of how long it lasted, was to be forever etched in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will tell you what I saw only  Even though everyone&#39;s account is basically the same, what I saw will be a first hand account, not what I heard from someone else. This is what I experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What appeared to be lighting was the glow of at least 2 objects very high in the night sky, partly obscured by clouds that remain from the storm. A few minutes later the sky was clear and the objects could be seen clearly. They would appear and disappear, stop and start instantly. Accelerate quickly to speeds unknown. Not knowing the altitudes makes it difficult to guess at the speeds. Near the end of the sighting there were just 2 objects moving in formation, precise formation. What appeared to be at about a 45 degree angle, they began to move downward in our direction. They looked like 2 meteors in slow motion, moving much slower than before. They were round, glowing bluish white with tails like meteors have. Very bright! Then simultaneously they began leaving vapor trails. Very large vapor trails, 4 times as large as known aircraft would make. Then, the unbelievable...a 90 degree turn, then another, taking the 2 objects back and away from us at which point they vanished, leaving the 2 identical vapor trails for the winds to disperse. The vapor trails remain visible for about 15 or 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like very much to know if any other sightings were reported at that time. Others had to have seen what we saw that night in the month of April, 1967. Until someone can explain to me what we experienced, I will consider it a &#34;UFO Sighting&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS: I would appreciate you letting me know if anyone else saw these objects.<n>

However, we soon noticed that we heard no jet sound above us that would indicate that this was what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We commented on how strange this was and watched the object as it moved slowly over our heads to the east and over a hill (in the direction of the Elmira/Corning Airport)  To our amazement, when it reached the top of the hill, it just stopped, abruptly, in mid-air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were trying to figure out what kind of aircraft could possibly be capable of such a thing (and realizing that it was definitely not a jet plane) it took off at a speed that was both incredible and shocking.  We were stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We vowed never to tell anyone about it for fear of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figure that I kept my silence for long enough and this report should be added to the host of others from every corner of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was walking back home from a friends house about 10:00pm.I was about a block away from home when I saw 3 lights up in the sky. I kept walking and it got closer and closer. I could see now that the lights were rectangle and flashing one at a time from left to right. One was white, the middle was red, the other ode was blue. It was close enough to me now that I should have heard rotor blade niose if it was a helecopter, that&#39;s what I thought in the begining. It comming towards me until it was about 50 ft away  and about 70 ft off the ground. Buy this time It was starting to get a little scarry. I heard a humming noise but nothing else. It was colse enough that I should have been able to see someone inside but the lights were too bright. It had stopped at about what felt like mabey 30 ft away, then the lights stopped blinking and came on steady. In about 5 seconds they shut off and one very bright spot light shined down on the ground in front of me and was comming my way. That was it...I ran into a trailer park I was in front of and hid. I sat there shaking for about 20 minutes then snuck back out and had a look. It was gone. If it was a police helecopter it would have followed me and sent a car out to see why I ran, but i don&#39;t think the police had copters back then, and besides I would have heard the blades and as close as it was it should have been pretty windy. I ran home and never seen it again. I didn&#39;t go out at night for a few weeks either. All these years I have been waiting for someone to report the same thing. I never have. Mabey there is someone out there that has. I would like to compare stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The diagram below &lt;e-mailed separately&gt; describes the path of the object, which it repeated every night for the duration of the time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time it took to traverse my limited field of vision was mo more than 30 seconds so it struck me that the object would have been moving at great velocity but it came to a dead stop, just for a moment, each time before changing direction.  I now live in South Africa, I have seen many satellites in the night skies since 1967 but never have I seen one that behaved in this manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There may be a completely rational explanation, but I do not believe that the technology existed on earth to perform these types of manoeuvres at the time.  Certainly, the forces required to stop and change direction like that would not be tolerable for a human being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have often wondered what it was that I saw.  Perhaps someone else has seen something similar or knows what it was?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Not shot forward to the North, but rather straight up into the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Odd thing is, my mother and aunt do not remember this incident, but the four of us kids (adults now) do remember it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

There were dozens of cars parked, with people all looking skyward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how many &#34;lights&#34; there were since I did not see the beginning of the line, but I did observe at least 8, which were yellow-orange in color and emitted no noise.

It was a medium olive-brown or dark &#34;kakhi&#34; in colour, and probably the size of a small bungalow. I do not recall seeing inhabitants, nor any of the group referring to or noticing &#34;inhabitants&#34;. -- We piled into a motor vehicle and tried to follow it; it gradually ascended in a semi-cylindrical pattern, increasing speed, and we lost sight of it. -- I am rather certain this occurred on a Saturday or Friday afternoon, as we were on our way to a party or some sort of gathering at first. One of the boys said he knew about a military person (there are several bases in the area, only one of which was Ft. Campbell, KY)of whom he could inquire whether any other reports had been received. -- This guy and I talked via telephone the next day around 16:00k or 17:00k; he said he was told it was a military &#34;experiment&#34; (I think he said Airforce, but he could have said &#34;army experiment&#34;, too). -- It is interesting that I remember this much of it so clearly, perhaps because there were 10 other &#34;peers&#34;. -- However, none of us have been in touch for the past 30 yrs. at least, and probably none of us would know each other by sight, or even by name in most cases.

This was about two hours out of Dallas. Thinking there had been an accident, we pulled off the road and next to the first car on the right side of the highway. I leaned out the window and asked a guy standing there next to his car what had happened. He simply said, &#34;Well look!&#34; My guitarist was driving, he pulled in a little more and stopped the engine and we both got out and looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three very bright lights at equal distance from each other, in a triangular formation slowly circling around a common center. These lights were about as bright as a very bright star, not Venus type bright by any means, never the less very noticable amongst the reat of the stars. I asked the guy standing there how long he had been watching this, he said, about 20 minutes or so, but some of the people here had been watching for more than an hour! I looked around for a moment and realised that there were alot of people there, and many cars on both sides of the highway. It was hard to keep my eyes from the sky, and I didn&#39;t really try to estimate the size of the crowd at the time. There was very little talking, most of it was in hushed voices when at all. After a few minutes a very small light came out of one of the larger ones and zoomed across the sky to the horizon, at such an amazing speed that it was incomprehensible. The guy next to us said the only other words he ever said to us then, &#34;There&#39;s been a lot of those.&#34; Maybe 4 or 5 minutes later the little light came back from another direction. After that several more from various directions. They would just appear on the horizon and zoom back to the main lights and sort of merge with one or the other. The whole time the triangular set is turning &#39;round and &#39;round in the same spot. When the small lights would appear there was murmuring from the crowd, everyone seemed rather giddy--I know I was, I kept saying &#34;wow&#34;, I don&#39;t know if it was out loud or not, but it was very exciting, simply amazing. It may have been as many as forty minutes that we stood and watched this, until finally, little lights began coming from every direction of the horizon. I didn&#39;t try to count them, I was simply in awe, but there were many, maybe 20, maybe as many as a hundred. They were all moving so fast, impossibly fast, taking maybe as little as 7 seconds from horizon to the main lights. After all of th small lights had converged with the big three, these merged tog! ether into one huge light, now at least as bright as Venus, and it simply went Up and away; like a shot into space. the crowd actually cheered like at a ball game or something! I did to, it was just spontanious, so exciting. I wish this could get posted somewhere, there were so many people out there that night, and I&#39;m sure none of them would ever forget it. Maybe some would read this and write in and tell about it too.<n>

I was in the army at that time, and assigned to an air defense center in Key West, Florida. I spent many of my nights in a radar control center watching the various screens.  My second cousin was also in the scope dope business. He was in the Air Force at the time and worked<n> <n><n> in a radar station in Homestead, Florida, just outside Miami.  We spent many an evening conversing on the air defense net, although our conversations rarely had anything to do with air defense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin called me one night on the net and advised me that something unbelievable was happening in South Florida. He opened the net so I could monitor the traffic regarding the incident taking place. I pulled my headset to my ears as I listed to various NORAD stations tracking a UFO just of the coast of Miami. At the time, Homestead was a SAC base, and any such traffic was a great concern to the Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I was about 100 miles from the target under discussion, I had the capability to observed activity in the area with my own radar. I had only to switch it off standby. As I was bringing up my antenna, the chatter continued, and referred to three more objects in the sky near Miami. It was also noted that civilian observers had now sighted the objects and the sighting was being reported on local commercial radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my scope came up the first thing I noticed was three Marine fighters departing Boca Chica Naval Air Station, heading North. The UFOs were clearly visible just Southeast of Miami.  They appeared to be moving just East of North, skirting the Florida Coast. It only took the Phantoms a few minutes to reach the area of the bogies. I have no idea if the pilots sighted the targets visually, or electronically.  The air channel was not part of the NORAD net.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the phantoms approached the targets they disappeared off the scope. Now there is only one way to disappear when being observed by a PAR (pulse acquisition radar). You must go straight up, or straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This cat and mouse game went on all night. Much to much to type in this report. Visual observations in<n> <n><n> Miami reportedly included the observation of one large object and three small. This I can not verify,<n> <n><n> although I imagine the Miami Herald would have some record of it.  To me, they appeared to be flying a search pattern. The way the Coast Guard would search in grids.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about three hours one of the unknowns began moving South directly towards my location.  The target was really moving, probably twice the speed of anything I had ever tracked, around 1100 miles an hour.  This would provide me with an excellent opportunity to lock onto the target with a different type of radar. This other type of radar, which I probably should not identify, has the capability of bringing back actual sounds of the target .  Turbo prop, jet engines, or the thud of rotary aircraft could clearly be heard with this system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the target approached I brought the unit into alignment with it and  brought the unit on line. For a<n> <n><n> short moment, a very short moment, I could hear a high pitched whine, similar to a jet engine, but<n> <n><n> smoother and much higher pitch.  At this point the target obviously detected my lock and hit my sight with some type of ECM.  It appeared to reverse the polarity of every piece of equipment on the sight. Needless to say this caused an instant shut down of the system and erased a great many taxpayer dollars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after rendering my sight useless one of the guys threw open the door to the control center and<n> <n><n> stated that they had seen the object pass over. It was moving so fast that one of the guys swore it was a meteorite.<n>

Saw something with red lights along the side and a white light in front rise from trees a half mile away.  Rose slowly, then moved horizontally out over the water for about ten minutes at a slow pace.  When it came over land, it moved extremely fast, then slowed down again over water.  It kept up this circular pattern the whole time.  It was visible for over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Made a jet engine whine, but very faint. There was a gravel road built up out of the water (the way they do down there) and the ship seemed to cross it a mile away. My dad drove us down to look. We found an Air Force car and a uniformed man who refused to acknowledge the thing we were pointing at.  He said there were just &#39;some boys out here drinking beer&#39;, and he wouldn&#39;t let us go any farther.  The craft was clearly visible, but he wouldn&#39;t even look over his shoulder.  We drove back to camp, and my boyfriend took a walkie-talkie with him and walked back down the road to see if he could get closer on foot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft crossed over the road above him when I was talking to him on the radio. The radio cut out, and he came running back in a panic.  The radio worked again as soon as the craft moved on. Eventually, the craft dropped down, out of sight, like a balloon landing. It was no balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we asked the campground manager the next day, he shrugged it off. &#34;We see a lot of things around here. Nobody pays any attention anymore.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

WHEN I NOTICED A LARGE BLUE GREEN LIGHT,(MORE BLUE THAN GREEN) IN THE NORTH WESTERN SKY.WHAT MADE ME TAKE A CLOSER LOOK WAS THAT THE LIGHT WAS MOVING AT A VERY FAST RATE OF SPEED,IT TOOK PERHAPS 20-30 SECONDS TO MOVE FROM THE NORTHWESTERN HORIZON TO THE NORTHEASTERN HORIZON,AT WHICH TIME I LOST SIGHT OF THE LIGHT. MAC DILL A.F.B. IS ABOUT 25 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST OF MY POSITION AND I SAW JET AIR CRAFT ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS.THE F4 WAS THEN FLYING IN THE AREA SO I KNOW ABOUT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO MOVE ACROSS THE SKY. THE LIGHT I SAW WAS BIG ENOUGH THAT HAD IT BEEN THE LIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT (JET) IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HEAR THE ENGINES. I WENT INSIDE AND TOLD MY DAD WHAT I&#39;D SEEN.HE ADVISED ME TO CALL THE SHERIFF&#39;S DEPT.I DID SO AND WAS TOLD TO CALL MAC DILL A.F.B.WHEN I CALLED MAC DILL I EXPLAINED WHAT I&#39;D SEEN.THE MAN I SPOKE WITH ASKED ME WHERE I LIVED.I TOLD HIM,HE THANKED ME AND HUNG UP. ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES LATER 3 AIR FORCE JETS FLEW DIRECTLY OVER MY HOUSE TRAVELING FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO THE NORTHEAST WHERE THE LIGHT HAD DISAPPEARED. I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I SAW,BUT I FELT THEN AND STILL FEEL THAT THE LIGHT WHATEVER IT WAS WAS UNUSUAL.I WASN&#39;T ON DRUGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.I&#39;VE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT IT WAS I SAW. I KNOW THE INCIDENT DOSEN&#39;T SOUND LIKE MUCH.BUT AFTER THINKING IT OVER FOR SOME TIME I DECIDED TO TRY AND REPORT IT. THANKYOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION ((name deleted))<n>

4/1/67 13:00|Opa Locka|FL||Hours|Verifying the 1967 UFO landing at a Miami elementary school yard.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64959.html|17|ndxe196704| Verifying the 1967 UFO landing at a Miami elementary school yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not witness this myself but remember it as the strangest event ever in Miami.  This was a highly populated area that the sighting centered on.  Mainly, an elementary school was closed because of UFOs!   It was in the papers, ie, Miami Herald and the Miami News.  The entire school witnessed this event, including teachers and administrators est at 700 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why this concerns me is that I had an Uncle that lived on Opa Locka Blvd at that time.  He could not get home for lunch from work via his normal route because the roads were blocked and detours were set up.  He saw something but would never talk about it to me.  All that he may have talked to have since passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way I remember what happened is that the UFO actually landed.  How in the world could this happen in a populated, modern country and it is all but forgotten?  Just out of curiosity I looked up the date to see if anything was in your records.  Well, I just about fell out of my chair when I read the account of the witness asking if any one saw what he saw and wondering if he really saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My God, how many more of these events have happened and time has just swept them too under a rug.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  We, too, wonder how many unreported sightings have occurred.  I estimate that of 10,000-20,000 sightings of genuine UFO&#39;s that have occurred, only one, or so, of the witnesses have ever thought to write down a description of the event.  PD))<n>
4/1/67 13:00|Opa Locka|FL|Oval|2 hours|1967 3 UFO'S above Crestview Elementary School, Opa-Locka Fla., several hundred witnesses|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79510.html|18|ndxe196704| 1967 3 UFO&#39;S above Crestview Elementary School, Opa-Locka Fla., several hundred witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO&#39;s sighting:  Crestview Elementary School, Opa-Locka, Florida, April of 1967.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the 6th grade at Crestview Elementary School, in Miami, (Post Office, Opa-Locka, Fla,)  During recess in April 1967, I and hundreds of others students from Crestview and a few teachers, witnessed 3 oval shaped objects coming through a few clouds, on a mostly a clear day, directly over our heads.  My teacher gathered our class into a line.  We watched as the two smaller of the three oval objects, appeared to be dancing around the larger oval shaped object coming down towards us. The larger object, seemed to be the size of a cruise ship, but it&#39;s shape was oval and cigar shaped and shiny metal like.  I saw the large object land in the field near our school.  I didn&#39;t see where the other two objects went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What seemed like hours before long, we were told to go home. I was one of the students who rode our bikes to the landing area not far from our school.  We stepped over a burm and found a field of weeds and grass that appeared to be charred and smashed into an oval shape and seemed to be the size of a large boat.  There was no object there, but the remains of something that had recently been lying there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before long, men in uniforms and news press started to interview kids.  I listened to a boy who had the same accounting as me.  The following day, the Miami Herald told the story and said that it was helicopters on maneuvers from the nearby Homestead Air Force Base.  I knew otherwise, and understand now that they had to state that to avoid mass hysteria.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the years to follow, I took my children to the sighting location, as they had heard my accounting for many years.  This was in the 90&#39;s and we found that in the same location, as where I saw he UFO land, was now the location of the Miami Football Stadium (off Miami Gardens Drive and 183rd Street)  which had been built, after they closed the Orange Bowl Football Stadium.  The stadium amazing stands in the very sight where I saw UFO land and come to think of it,  the UFO was about the size of the stadium floor!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate.
