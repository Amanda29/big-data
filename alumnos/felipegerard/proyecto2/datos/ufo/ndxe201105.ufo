We then saw a circle UFO travelling at a high rate of speed.  It was circle shaped and was blinking from red to green to white. It moved across the sky very fast and changed directions.  We saw a total of four crafts all were similar in their blinking colors.  We are not sure it’s a UFO but everything it did was the same as the from NASA website videos describing UFOs<n>

Talking on cell phone when me and my two kids noticed and aircraft to the northwest.  My friend on the other end may now think I am crazy. :-)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Silver and oval, moving extreamly slow.  Its slow speed is what got my attention.  It was moving much slower than an airplane, especially for its size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost view as we drove due to the elevations, but got a 2nd good view ~.5 miles later.  It was hard to tell its altitude as this is a very hilly area, but it appeared to be flying low.  Its low altitude also made this odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the 1st time I have ever reported a UFO.  I saw something I cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My kids are 13 &amp; 10 and they could not figure out what we were looking at.  Should have, but did not, try to get a cell phone picture.<n>

We live around 5000 West and 134th South.  I saw it from the East and it was traveling North West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be low in the sky at about the same altitude as military helicopters that fly during the day/evening.  Unlike the the helicopters, this made no noise, had no flashing lights and had the movement of a floating balloon (non straight line, variable speeds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was orange, almost like a flame, but no fire was visible.  It also produced a big halo and was fuzzy, almost out of focus looking (not a crisp direct light found on planes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was first traveling West kind of slowly and bopping up and down kind of like a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light started traveling North and within a short amount of time, the light appeared far away disappearing in the background.  It didn&#39;t have the appearance that it was traveling fast (no streaks of light or anything).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first my wife and I thought it might be a meteor, but it didn&#39;t travel in a fast straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reading a few entries on this site, it sounds similar to story on 7/27/2010 in Salt Lake City.<n>

These things were not particularly close together and no pattern or movement was observed. At the time I thought it looked almost like &amp;quot;holes&amp;quot; in the sky.  They appeared to be far away to the west and about 45 degrees above the horizon.  They did not seem to be related to nearby Los Alamitos NAS. They were not particularly close together with positions north, northwest and west relative to my position.  It was notable that each of these objects appeared to be the exact same size, shape and color.  The color was the same (or close to the same) as the clouds that were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My original report can be seen at: http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2011/huntingtonbeachca05302011/huntingtonbeachca05302011.htm<n>

Traveling NE @ 4:30 am Eleven Mile State Park CO<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO spotted approx 4:30 am at Eleven Mile State Park in Colorado (Lake George/Hartsel area Colorado.)   2 bright white lights with a translucent veil traveled from overhead to NE horizon just before dawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moon had just risen as a crescent.  Duration of sighting was 3 to 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Detailed description:<n> <n><n> <n><n> White lights at least twice as large and 3 times as bright than Jupiter.  Lights about length of index finger with arm extended.  No noise, observed for anti collision lights; none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Translucent white veil extended beneath, approximate 3 times the distance of the lights.  The veil had a distinctive &#34;J&#34; shape that did not change.  The translucent looked like a nebula viewed through a low power telescope.<n>

No noise,  The craft had a translucent veil or hue that extended beneath, in a &#34;J&#34; shape that did not change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft moved slowly  from south west from my view point the lights looked to be side by side with a hue around it and  extending down.  As it crosses the west the lights look to be one in front of the other  and the hue/veil  looked to be in the shape of &#34;J.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as it got to the north horizon I could make out a distinct triangle shape to it.  Also to note the environment it was very different than normal it was dead quiet not one morning bird was singing this whole time as they normally do at this time of day.  Then as the craft disappeared at the horizon all went back to normal<n>

I was getting ready to go back to bed and looked out our window that faces north and looks out over all of Denver.  I noticed a thin layer of clouds covering the city and also noticed the stars were very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw 2 bright lights moving from west to east.  At first I thought they were stars, then I thought an aircraft, then I realized they were neither.  The lights moved together so we believe this was just one craft.  It was probably traveling at around 120 knots or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One light was slightly lower than the other.  There was also a very odd swirl of light that came down from the other 2 lights and faded out towards the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would normally think this was a contrail or similar but the swirl of light curved ahead of the UFO, not behind it as a wake or contrail would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for 15 minutes or so until the lights were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I both observed the UFO.  I am in aerospace and she is a teacher.<n>

We setup camp at FR44 about 200 yards South of Bloody Basin Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1:30 a member of our party spotted two out of the ordinary round white lights that appeared to be a part of ONE larger craft with a visible (yet dim) tail/trail behind traveling North/Northeast.  It was early morning in Arizona high country, the only thing we could clearly see were the two lights, not the body of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is ASSUMPTION that the lights were joined or attached to the same craft as they moved in complete unison and matching speed.  I can only describe the light’s physical layout as those you would see on a plane, one light on each side, almost the same as you&#39;d see on aircraft with a light at the tip of each of the wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They maintained a very slow (from our perspective) and steady pace and color across the sky, no noise was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last minute of visibility the lights appeared to turn orange in color, fading in and out of view almost blinking, and then eventually disappeared out of site behind the Mountain Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently completed 8 years in the United States Air Force and have never witnessed any flying object in the night sky with these characteristics.  There were other aircraft visible in the night sky which made real time comparison easy especially with no clouds or obstruction, clear visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the source of this report is the individual who telephoned our Hotline.

We first saw what most people describe as a satellite floating way up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I caught a flash in the corner of my eye and I looked up at the constellation of the little dipper.  To the right of it we noticed what looked like a motorcycle headlight coming straight down at us at about the level that most airplanes travel only this object had no red or blue blinking lights like a plane usually does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a bright almost halogen look to it then turned around within two seconds and it had a red glow at the end of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within two seconds it began to speed away straight up into space and became smaller and smaller.  Most aircraft travel from left to right or vice versa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object turned around and went straight up and in seconds was gone.  There were no c! louds in the sky.   We heard not one sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later a plane passed in the same area and we could hear the engines.  To me I have only seen what they show us on television.  This looked like one of those Orbs that people talk about.   It raced away into space after I pointed at it.  It was so fast that I cant describe anything on this earth that moves the way it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a hoax.  We know what we saw.<n>

5/29/11 22:10|Fremont|CA|Light|30 - 60 seconds|Lights that, at first glance looked like a plane that was going to crash.|6/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81589.html|27|ndxe201105| Lights that, at first glance looked like a plane that was going to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I we were coming off the freeway 880 south taking the Fremont/Alvarado exit in the East San Francisco Bay Area.  I was playing with my camera because I just got it 2 nights before and I had been trying to take a still picture of the traffic at night with the lights and stuff because the camera has all these features that I wanted to learn to use...<n> <n><n> <n><n> So coming off the freeway, I saw a &#34;plane&#34; or what I thought was a plane at first and it was flying in an angle like it was going to land on a runway but it was in the direction of the boulevard.  It was dark and 10:10pm and I saw only lights but I thought this &#34;plane&#34; was flying low and going to crash and as we came to the intersection off ramp off the freeway onto Fremont Blvd.  This is a busy boulevard, even at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped at the light and I was just going to tell my husband, &#34;Don&#39;t go into the intersection I think that plane is going to crash&#34;...  But just when we stopped at the light, the &#34;plane, or lights&#34; suddenly stopped mid air and just hovered about a street light pole height above the street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it while we were waiting for the light to turn left onto Fremont Blvd, the &#34;lights or plane&#34; hovered in the direction of Fremont Blvd South direction as if it were waiting for the light to change as well, almost like they stopped and said &#34;hey wait, she&#39;s got a camera&#34; and watching our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And as it was sitting there all of a sudden, while we were waiting for the light the one light on the right, swung behind the other light and came up on it on it&#39;s left and just sat there and when we moved in traffic, both lights started going..  It was weird like they were motorcycles driving in traffic but way up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I didn&#39;t know how to use my new camera very well, the camera had a delay on it and only took two pictures before the light changed and my husband drove off.  I kept telling my husband wait, wait, I see a UFO but he thought I was trying to be funny because I always make fun of him because he ! watches all the alien shows and on the most part, don’t believe in any aliens or anything.  He just didn’t believe me and kept driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got the pictures on the computer to blow it up, you can see a 3rd light behind the two I had seen and didn’t see when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if there was any sound or not because we had the radio on in the car.<n>
5/29/11 22:00|Davenport|IA|Triangle|2.5 hours|Triangle observed hovering over davenport near regional airport|6/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81580.html|28|ndxe201105| Triangle observed hovering over davenport near regional airport<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside my apartment at approximately 10:00 pm CST, to put my car in the garage for the night. While descending the stairs I noticed what looked like two brilliant lights in a spot where at this time of the year there usually aren’t any constellations that are visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two lights were in very near proximity and directly over a prominent landmark, the church across the street.  After putting the car in the garage, I was staring directly at the object on my walk back to the apartment from the garage.  I could see the two lights in close proximity clearly and they were as bright or just a fraction dimmer than other stars in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The North Star, directly at my back while looking at the lights in question, was twice as bright as these two lights visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions were completely clear sky, with no visible moon. The object/ lights observed were approximately 45 degrees over the horizon line.  The compass bearing to the object was 160 or nearly due South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arm’s length the two lights were approximately the width of my fingernail on my smallest finger.  I observed the object and attempted to take photos with my iphone but it failed to capture any images of the object as it was too dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and got a pair of binoculars to better view the lights. Upon focusing in with my Nikon Eagleview 8-24x25mm binoculars, I noticed a third light, forming a triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation the third light was dimmer than the first two and made what appeared to be a triangle object look like a long very pointed craft.  The angles appeared to be 30 degrees and two 60 degree angle near what looked like the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two brighter lights at the ‘base’ of the object looked as though they had a yellow tint to them, much like a car’s headlights would, not a bluish tint as the other stars around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third, more dim light also had this characteristic also.  The yellow color, and the proximity of the two brighter lights, and the fact that usually there are not bright lights in the sky in that area of sky are what attracted my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third, more dim light was approximately double the distance from the first two lights as the first two lights were wide. Together the three lights formed a long, slender very pointed triangle as they appeared when viewed through the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the NUFORC hotline and was advised to submit a written report.  I was also advised to take photos if possible.  My camera is not operational, so I woke a neighbor and borrowed her camera.   After taking multiple shots, I was only able to get one picture that captured the image I was viewing clearly through my binoculars and with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw this object at approximately 10pm, and noted the time as the  10 o’clock news had just come on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The camera used was a Casio Exilim 7.2 Megapixel digital camera. Flash was turned off, and I was zoomed in ¾ of maximum zoom. Was only able to capture one picture showing object.  I tried different zooms, different settings for lighting, everything I could.  I could not get another picture to show the object.  It is 2 hours 17 minutes past time I first noticed object and object is still visible in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my front door, the object was showing on my iphone compass as bearing 160 degrees from true north.  I extended my arm out and estimated the angle to be approximately 45 degrees off the horizon from me.  The horizon is light as I was overlooking the downtown davenport to the east, which borders the Mississippi river. It was much higher than the horizon and could not have been radio towers or anything the like.  There is an Army National Guard Aviation Unit flying ch-47 Chinooks was stationed out of the regional airport to the west.  Looking directly at the object,  the big dipper was at 298 degrees  from my position, to the NW. the airport where the national guard unit is stationed is approximately bearing of 21 degrees, almost due north of my location.  No other constellation was visible anywhere near the object I writing to report.  Usually the Orion constellation is visible in the general area but more to the east but could not see the Orion this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions were clear. Storms were here most of the day but cleared off early afternoon. By 7pm CST all clouds had for the most part cleared off leaving clear skies.   At the time of writing it is still clear.  No meteorites are visible.  No heat lighting is visible.   I am familiar with most known military aircraft, NATO and Soviet/Russian manufacture, both fixed wing and rotary.  This did not resemble any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise, and is still at the time of writing stationary in the night sky. Aircraft have passed underneath this object and have not changed course to avoid it.  This object appears to be much higher than the air traffic transiting below it.  Perhaps this was stellar objects that simply looked like an aircraft?  Perhaps it is unidentified?  Given the proximity of the 3 objects I do not know what to make of this.<n>

I waited, &amp; waited, &amp; waited.

I presumed it was an intersection camera in front of me but when I went through the intersection there wasn’t a camera, I thought it may have been a security light I drove by coming on and didn’t think twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:30 pm my friend and I were standing outside of the yogurt shop (BTO) that had closed at 11:00 pm talking.  I was facing south; he was facing north when I saw the white flash again, very evidently from the sky this time.  It lit up the entire sky instantaneously without a trail or identifiable direction.  It was brightest in a streak however that had a southwest by northeast direction.  Like the gradients you see in PowerPoint  presentations, it was brightest down the middle and slightly darker along the edges ( the horizon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, a pilot, said, &#34;What the hell was that?&#34;  I was stunned he saw it also because it was so quick and he was facing the opposite direction.  It was faster than a camera flash, without the residual blinding effect.  I said, &#34;You saw it to?!,&#34; and he also said he lit up the whole sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no discernable aircraft, no discernable sounds, no trails or residual proof and this was located north of Davis-Monthan Airforce Base.  There were no clouds visible in the area as all the stars were clearly shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have two Bachelor of Science degrees from the University of Arizona and I am two years away from my Doctorate degree.  I am well versed in scientific observations and while I wish I could provide more detailed information the event happened astonishingly quick, on the order of microseconds.  Had my pilot friend not been there in awe with me, I may not have believed I saw anything in the first place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

He also saw it and as we were pointing to it i said get your phone to try and tape it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then was like it started picking up speed and within seconds diminished in size and got smaller and smaller until it was a speck of light and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didnt flash, no colored lights, no sound at all - just an extremely bright ball of that seemed to be leaving our planet almost because it got smaller and smaller then was gone.

Maybe the helicopter was looking for the object?  This had to be a UFO.<n>

I was at a stopsign when i noticed colored lights in the sky in the left field of my vision.  I looked up and noticed a straight horizontal line of 3-4 lavendar purple colored lights with a small red light in the middle of the line.  I watched this light as i drove for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then i noticed a set of simliar lights enter from the right side of my field of vision in the sky.  They were orange-red in color.  As the lights from the right side of the sky moved towards the lights on the left side of the sky, they shanged into the purple lavendar color as the object on the left.  I noticed they stood apart from each other in a horizontal line for a few minutes than abruptly the lights on the right moved on top of the lights on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They began to circle around each other for a few minutes. As i drove along i looked to see if the lights could be emanated from the ground.  They were so high up, and the area so rural it seem! ed difficult if not impossible, for these lights to be shining from the ground.  There was not a light trail that would indicate they came from the ground (such as a laser or spot light).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen any type of aircraft in that same color or manuever in the manner i have witnessed.  My instincts felt these were UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i drove along after 10 minutes of seeing the objects they simply disappeared.  Right before they disappeared i was driving on top of large mountain with a field stretching both sides of the road.  I had a clear view of the objects and could tell they were high up in the sky and some type of aircraft.  I began to feel frightened, and started to drive away at a fast rate.  Shortly thereafter they disappeared.<n>

My son (14) and daughter (17) and I (45) unloading the car around 2300 hrs.  We live in North Aurora, Illinois. While my son and I were inside, my daughter yelled through the open front door for me to quickly come outside.  My son and I ran out to see her pointing toward the northern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Across from out house is an open field, where baseball and soccer is played. North in the sky was a slowly moving flashing/flickering ball shaped light.  As it flickered it appeared to shift shape and color.  It varied from a whitish color to an orange-red color.  The shape seemed to change during the color change, from a roundish shape to a slight horizontal oblong shape with a dome above and below the oblong. It continued to move westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son ran inside for binoculars while my daughter ran in to get my camera.  She was able to take one picture of it.  I called inside for my husband who came out and declared it was an airplane and then went back inside to go to bed.  My kids and I continued to watch, what we clearly knew was NOT an airplane, it move west then arc north and disappear as quickly as it had appeared.  It never made any noise in which we could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took our things back inside and checked outside a few seconds later and saw it had come back.  It began its route in the same area where my daughter had first seen it and called us to join her.  I then ran in for my camcorder and began to videotape this strange moving object.  It did the exact same route, slowly moving west, arcing north and disappearing.  I taped around 1minute and 20 seconds of video, in which I was able to sloppily zoom in to show the clarity of its shape shifting and color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have uploaded the video to YouTube.  You can find it by searching UFO? near North Aurora Illinois.   The video gets a little crazy when I zoomed in because my camcorder is only about 3 weeks old and I am not used to the quick zoom feature.  This object did not jump all over the place as it appears in the video.  That was my lack of control of the camera.  The object only made a slow steady progression west, arc north and disappear.<n>

The middle one went out, the other two hoovered and would flash on and off, move closer together and then a part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was dark and I could see stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went downstairs to get my phone to try and get a picture, but by the time I got back upstairs the other two were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen this, back in 2002 or 2003 can&#39;t recall exact date I witnessed almost the same exact scenario with all my other neighbors also coming outside to see them, they were there for over 1 hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What were these?<n>

We have photos and Details, the object was no doubt a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my girlfriend home after an AMAZING DAY.  It was around 9 or 10:00 at night when we were in this deserted street, I looked up and saw this object, it was a bit fuzzy because it looked like the moon behind some clouds.  Thing is, there was no clouds in the sky, so after a while of staring at it i point at it for my girlfriend could see.  She immediately said it was a UFO, but i was questioning it.  First, i saw a Blue light (which i thought was the clouds) illiminating all around it.  It had the classic UFO shape, you know, sort of like an oblate spheroid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what i saw:  It had a classic UFO shape A bright blue light illuminating it a smaller red lighting under the center and it was actually relively close for us to judge that it was not a plane.  There were many planes flying around us because there&#39;s an airport near by.  But living in New York you can tell what&#39;s a plane and what&#39;s not.  This definetly wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started naming things it CAN be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a hellicopter. Because of the bright light. But what canceled it out is<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  If a search helicopter was out, the lights wouldn&#39;t have been around it, and the chopper would&#39;ve been smaller;<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  If it was a larger chopper, it could possibly be that shape at a distance, but not from this distance;<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  The object was moving VERY slow, almost still, and kept at the same altitude  We watched and walked for 10 minutes or so and it was actually following us, very slowly.  There was this point where we were walking but keeping an eye where a building go in the way, we speed walked passed it and in that time (about 5 seconds) it was already in front of us.  It amazing us because it was going soo slow, but randomly zooms passed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching and i noticed the red light, it would blink not too often.  Also if it were a plane,<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  It&#39;ll blink repeatedly;<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  It would definitely not be as bright as that.  We watched more, till it got smaller, like it was moving away, we watched till it fell behind some tree&#39;s and it was gone, we then saw it about 5 minutes later for a few seconds then lost it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What&#39;s really got me is the bright blue light around it.  It truthfully looked like a force field or energy wall.  It was truly amazing, i really never believed in aliens but this is getting me to question it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S my girlfriend had taken pictures, it&#39;s very legit<n>

It had some kind of blue lighting but i could not discern a shape. there was no sound emanating from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i would estimate that this object was about a quarter mile east of me.  i would estimate that the said vehicle was about 25 ft above the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the vehicle from the position where i was sitting.  I rose from my position which was on the southside of my house, to the eastside of my house to see if i could get a better visual.  At that time I lost sight of the unidentified object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in an area where planes and helicopters fly over.  This object did not display the flight characteristics of these vehicles or any sound and flew at an extremely slow speed. the duration of the observation was about 15 secs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then vehicle disappeared from my view.  I did not at anytime see it accelerate.  Just lost sight of it.<n>

The craft initially maintained a straight forward motion and consistent speed (although it was much slower than a jet plane).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft approached the apex of the sky above me, slightly to my north, it slowed even further, it came to a complete stop, and hovered in that position for about a half minute. then it appeared to lift straight upward at a high rate of speed, still silent, as it lifted away, the lights became smaller and dimmer, until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky conditions where partly cloudy, and I did see jet plane traffic overhead at their normal 30+ thousand feet.<n>

He spotted the object first and I saw just about a second later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quite high up in the atmosphere.  It was glowing bright red and glowing very brightly.  There were no flashing lights, it was just glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately hit the brakes on my car to get a better look and possibly a picture, but as soon as I did, it stopped glowing and just became a red dot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it seemed to take off faster and disappear behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove up to a clearing in the road as quick as I could, but the object was gone.<n>

My granddaughter had left to go back to the house to get something and while she was gone, I turned to speak to my husband and I noticed what appeared to be a ball of fire in the sky above the tree line height, past our field.  It came from the East and turned to head north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband to look and then I heard my granddaughter yelling, &#34;What are those?&#34;  And then we saw two more flying behind the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy night and they were flying below the cloud cover (on line it said cloud cover was at 7000 ft.) and they were silent.  Within the next minute we observed 3 more.  They were on the same path as the previous ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 to report objects flying over Niangua and they transferred me to the Webster County Sheriff’s Dept.  I would say it was close to 10 minutes when 5 more flew over.  Another minute, maybe 2 minutes, 3 more objects flew over.  Then it was a little longer maybe three to four minutes and 3 more flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left my husband and granddaughter watching while I went to the house to get the binoculars.  It took me maybe 5 minutes.  When I came out of the house, there looked to be 5 flying to the North.  My Husband and Granddaughter said there had been maybe 3 or 4 more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the KY3 News out of Springfield, MO and spoke with a Dave Snider; I also sent him the picture my Granddaughter had taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in an area that seems to be a flight path and we see a lot of planes.  We also get to see planes with their landing lights on, preparing to land at the Springfield airport about 35 miles away.  These flying objects did not have landing lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a very good judge of size, but I would say they were maybe an eighth of the size of a full moon.  To me they looked like a ball of fire, slightly elongated.  Slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was reddish-orange.  Not much different than the flames of our fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I previously stated, they flew silent.  They had no apparent formation other than they all went the same direction and came from the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent and objective.

At first it looked like a lantern with a candle in it, the way it was floating, and had a glow of like fire.  But, it wasn&#39;t really twinkling, and it was moving very steadily down the shore line.  To me, I thought maybe a helicopter the way it moved, but there was no noise.  and whats with the red/orange light?   Just today I heard a similar story from someone who had a sighting about 40-50 miles from where I believe I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was quite clear-cut that this object was not part of the spinning debris around the tornado.  It lasted 3-5 seconds and was completely gone.  Telling from the footage, it may have occurred sometime during the recent severe weather outbreak over Joplin Missouri during the afternoon of possibly May 28th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No mention whatsoever, was made of the object during this footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This made a firm believer of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my bathroom window and noticed an incredibly bright shape. Initially it was oddly shaped – best described as &#34;cheeto&#34; shaped--long, slightly curved on right side and indented on left.  But it later changed to a round shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for almost 15 minutes, the time may not be exact, but close.  At one point I left the room to get binoculars (I knew my camera would never capture any detail ) and the binoculars did not add any detail either as it was so bright!  Shortly before it simply disappeared, it appeared to shoot out beams in red and blue.  They were similar to this _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- and shot out from the lower left side, then the lower right side, but not at the same time.  Then it was simply no longer there.<n>

I immediately I saw the first object when I stepped out my door. I called my neighbor when I first saw the object to confirm what I was seeing, but as we were on the phone, it reached a spot in the sky almost directly east of me, hesitated, blinked a couple times and faded away.  (The sky was cloudy, but it did not seem like the disappearance was due to clouds.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were on the phone, as I was expressing my disappointment that the neighbor missed it, another came over the horizon and did exactly the same thing, disappearing at the same spot after blinking a couple times.  My neighbor did see this one, and all later objects.  In all, when we were on the phone, my neighbor saw four, I saw five total, spaced about two to three minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each came from the north, heading south south east.  Each one was round, and very bright orange.  There was no flashing.  They were approximately 40 degrees above the horizon to the east.  Each was identical, and about four to five times brighter than a planet, if not more.  When I first spotted each, it was moving very fast, but slowed down as it reached the exact same spot where each blinked and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each object had the same trajectory and speed before fading away.  I could attribute the slowing and disappearance to turning and heading directly east, but I thought it odd that each disappeared in exactly the same way despite being seen over at least 10 minutes when the cloud cover would have changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did grab my binoculars to look at each one and could see no distinguishing features, just large, round,and bright orange.  Unfortunately I had loaned my neighbor&#39;s kid my camera for a photography class so I could get no images.<n>

I at first thought it was a plane making numerous passes but thought it looked odd so I opened a window to liisten to whatever it was I was seeing. There was no definitive sound coming from the objects as they passed.  I went upstairs to have my wife look at what I was seeing.  She was as amazed as I was so we went out to the yard and were joined by my 18 year old son.  We counted at least 20 of these objects moving silently across the sky in a northerly direction.  They were moving at a rate similar to that of an aircraft however the light emitted from them seemed  more similar to a flaming glow compared to lights I seen every evening from planes in my area.  My son has captured 2 videos of this and posted them to his YouTube account.<n>

5/26/11 22:10|Timnath|CO|Circle|00:00:15|3 circular translucent craft in triangle formation east to west over northern colorado|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81535.html|65|ndxe201105| 3 circular translucent craft in triangle formation east to west over northern colorado<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside at night and looking east. I saw what appeared to be a faintly lit shooting star moving toward me at high speed. I quickly realized there were three and they were maintaining a constant altitude, instead of falling to the ground like your typical meteorite. They passed directly overhead at approximately 8,000 feet and 1500 knots.  As an air traffic controller, I&#39;ve spent twenty years observing aircraft, and feel I have a good gauge for judging altitude and speed; however, it was at night which can throw off your depth perception.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three circular craft where in a perfect triangle formation, and made absolutely no sound despite their speed and passing directly overhead.  Perhaps the strangest aspect of the sighting was the color (or lack thereof) of the aircraft.  They were translucent, and displayed the night sky on the bottom of the craft, that you would normally see behind the craft, as if they weren&#39;t there.  The only reason I saw the craft is because they were glowing orange due to their speed and proximity to the ground.  They had no lights of any kind typical to every other aircraft in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, they were moving fast and I thought that I was going to get treated with a shooting star.  I watched them approach from the east, pass overhead, and leave to the west.  It is possible that it was one large craft with three glowing disks affixed to the bottom in a triangle formation; however, I believe it was three separate craft.<n>

5/26/11 01:00|Augusta|MT|Light|1-2 minutes|ICBM Sites Augusta, Montana, 1:00 A.M.  brilliant lights, greenish red orb, with no contrails on vanishing.|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81548.html|69|ndxe201105| ICBM Sites Augusta, Montana 1:00 A.M.  brilliant lights, greenish red orb, with no contrails on vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event occured outside of Augusta, Montana on May 26, 1:00 A.M.  The area where I was staying is dotted with ICBM sites that are in eyesight of the road leading to the cabin.   The closest site to the cabin I believe was roughly 20 miles as the crow flies from the cabin.  I also believe that numerous other ICBM sites exist in the area that are sub Terra.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Six of us were sitting around a campfire, when a large reddish greenish glow started to crest the hill which leads down to the property.  We were staring uphill from a lower location looking up the road as the light crested the hill.  When a vehicle drives at night, which is rare anyways out there, the light does not crest the hills, the dips between the roads blocks out all night until the vehicle crests the top.  The light we saw was roughly 80-100 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our first thought was that we were not witnessing a vehicle at all, but aurora borealis.  I remember a friend saying its aurora, but i fiercely d! oubted this accusation as the object grew brighter and showered the beam across the 4 acre property.  The object on the hill became glowing with a greenish purplish hue, that flooded the entire area we were staying in.  It illuminated all the trees behind us upwards to over one hundred yards.  The light seemed to expand over the entire area, then began to pulsate with tremendous colored light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Six of us distinctly remember the intensity of the light and its changing color structure.  I remember staring directly at the object, then having the desire to walk towards it.  Not in an abduction sense, but more so a mix of curiosity and some sort of draw towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I began to run towards it with his German Shepard.  As we started running to the top of the hill the orb pulsated and vanished.  No contrails, nothing at all, just turned itself off and vanished.  Since I was running up to the craft, my friend that was stationary said that the object had a center where ! the light was radiating out from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened after the UFO left was also very interesting.  Every single one of us said we could feel some sort of energy within our bodies.  It was a very intense feeling, and it was not nerves or adrenaline.  It was as if my body was charged up or another state of awareness.  Everyone I was with said they could feel this feeling as well, upwards to an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within twenty minutes of the sighting, we noticed two planes flying overhead at low altitude with no lights at all.   Just two planes within a minute of each other, jet black, and not a single emitting light.  One of my friends who was in his tent at the time of the siting, said he felt an intense light pulse through the tent and that he could feel the presence of something hes never felt before.  The dog in his tent, had erratic behavior after and during the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day on the road out, we witnessed more U.S. Government plates on SUV vehicles than I have ever seen in a population of 287 people.  At first I was not going to post my encounter, but after reading countless reports of minutemen and other military personnel that were stationed in the exact same area, and reporting exactly and very close to what I saw, I changed my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe ICBM sites are the main focus of these lights people have been seeing since the Cold War.  The incident at Maelstrom AFB really made me interested, and an avid believer that nuclear power and ICBM are of great interest to whatever is out there.<n>

The object was reddish orange in color, twice the size of Venus, but about the same brightness as Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I instantly called the wife and two kids out to see the object.  It did shimmer a bit, so my wife instantly said it looked similar to a Chinese lantern.  I disagreed; the object moved too fast and steady for it to be in any wind pattern.  It took the object approximately 10-12 seconds to move from horizon to horizon, traveling silently from south to north in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve observed the ISS in the past, and this object was much bigger and seemed a lot lower in the atmosphere.  I’ve also considered that it may have been a meteorite; it certainly moved like one, but the red color seemed all wrong.  We did have some severe weather move through the area a couple of hours later, so maybe the atmospheric conditions gave it the red color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say that its brightness stayed consistent, so I don’t think it was reflecting sunlight; tt appeared to be self luminous.  While I’m sure it was natural in origin, there was just something very odd about its appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought I would make the report with the hope that you might be able to tell me what the heck it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

5/25/11 05:20|Tallahassee|FL|Triangle|10 seconds|Triangular shaped UFO observed hovering at low level on the east side of Tallahassee, Florida|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81553.html|72|ndxe201105| Triangular shaped UFO observed hovering at low level on the east side of Tallahassee, Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 25th, 2011, I was delivering newspapers in Tallahassee, Florida.  I was travelling eastbound on Old St. Augustine Road, about 3 miles east of Capital Circle SE, when, about 5:20am, I turned left (north) onto Grassroots Road to routinely deliver a paper to a residence.  This is a fairly sparsely populated area of homes in a wooded, secluded area.  The road is narrow and unpaved and there are no street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately upon entering Grassroots Road, I observed what I first thought was an airplane and wondered what an airplane would be doing so low and back in those woods.  I immediately realized this wasn’t a conventional aircraft, and since I am a small statured female and was alone, I became very frightened and thought of turning around and fleeing the area.  But the road is narrow and there was no place for me to easily turn around.  I knew this to be a UFO of some sort as I had never seen anything like it.  I will attempt to describe in detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was hovering, nose in an upward direction, not straight up, but in such a manner that I could plainly see the belly of the craft but not the top side of it.  The belly was directly in front of me.  It seemed to be at that angle because it was very low to the ground, from tree top level to slightly below  tree top.  It was in a clearing in the woods, maybe 50 yards at most from my position.  I believe it had attained its position, nose up and hovering with slight, sometimes jerky movements back and forth, so as not to brush against nearby trees which bordered the clearing.  The craft made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will attempt to completely describe this craft.  It is difficult for me to relate the size, but possibly the size of a relatively small passenger jetliner.  It looked very large because of its close proximity to me and its location in the clearing with surrounding trees.  I would say it was a triangular shape with the wings forming a rounded, curved &#34;boomerang&#34; shape.  In other words, the craft was not a sharply shaped triangle.  It had red and blue lights on the wing surface, as I recall, one at the front, one on each side about half way back, and one on each wing tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The belly of the craft which I could clearly see, had about five lights, three in a row, front to rear, with two on each side and below the three in a row, and out toward each wing tip.  It was lit up so as to be clearly visible, but not in a glowing sense that it would light up the area around it.  The belly had several grooves running in orderly rows, front to rear.  I believe the color was gray like a Navy ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so afraid, thinking it may be watching me and I might be in danger since as I said, at that hour there were no other cars on the road.  As it rose upward and begin to move upward and to the left, away from the road, I sped on by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove about a quarter of a mile to throw my paper, and when I returned on my way out, there was no sign of the craft<n>

There seemed to be no lights, rather they were lights.  There were two cars between the three of us, and we both pulled over, thinking we were wittnessing some kind of air trafic emergency.  There was one main object, big, with two smaller objects flanking each side.  There was no noise, and they appeared to be motionless in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing them for about seven minutes, the objects zoomed away for no aparent reason.  They seemed to be right above the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not sure what we witnessed.<n>

I don&#39;t think it was a meteor because it didn&#39;t streak.  The light was diffuse, not directional or piercing, and it radiated outward from a central point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess it&#39;s possible it was a meteor heading in my direction, but it just seemed too distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s important to note the lack of color in the sighting; no alternating green or red lights as you would see on an airplane.  I kept looking at the spot to see if it would re-appear, but the clouds rolled in fifteen minutes later, so I had to stop looking.

I just thought I would report it in case any other reports came in from the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home and noticed what appeared to be an airplane; two lights apparently on the ends of the wings, but they were not blinking like an airplane.  In addition, it was traveling both very low and very slowly.  It was making vast, sweeping circles of the night sky, the two white lights visible from all angles as it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued the entire time I was driving home and long enough for me to find my camera and take several pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still circling when I came inside (more than 30 minutes later).  Like I said, this is very unlikely to be anything more than an odd plane (there is a small airport - Lunken - just a few miles away) but it was unlike anything I&#39;ve seen before, mostly because it was traveling so slowly and in circles (did not appear to be centered near the airport).<n>

I can&#39;t be sure exactly of the size of the object, it was clearly far away as it only appeared to be a quarter inch speck of light.  The light remained perfectly stable, not moving at all, although it flickered rapidly.  After maybe a minute or two, the light got smaller in a linear fashion, until it was a speck, then disappeared.<n>

The red spheres dimmed and dissappeared only to be followed by more red lights appearing and staying staying stationary in the sky but in a different formation roughly in the same spot of the Eastern sky.  This went on and on until we had enough fishing and UFO watching and we were tired and hungry from being out all afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove off home towards Ord from the sandpits we were at west of town we saw one last glimpse of the strange lights and then the trees were blocking our sight of the sky from then on.<n>

5/23/11 01:00|Golden Lake (Canada)|ON|Light|3 min.|Two Red/Orange lights Golden Lake May Long|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81522.html|89|ndxe201105| Two Red/Orange lights Golden Lake May Long<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was having a fire with friends on the north east side of Golden Lake.  We noticed some lightning far to the west.  Shortly after that I saw a red/orange light on the lake’s South West horizon.  I pointed it out to friends.  At that time it looked like it could have been a plane far in the horizon.  Several minutes later we all saw another light appear (same colour).  Within 30 seconds I had the feeling that we were not seeing regular planes.  I grew up beside an airport and my dad flew his own plane.  What I was seeing did not behave the way two aircraft would have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, the lights were too big to be strobes, and their colour looked too orange.  Furthermore, the lights looked like they were wavy (not solid point). although this wavy effect could have been atmospheric effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second, what struck me as odd was how within a minute, both lights came so close together.  If they were in fact far away and high altitude, their convergent paths would require great speeds.  However, if the lights had been closer to us and lower down, it would have been equally strange for the lower object to ascend the way it did. almost straight up.  Simply put, they were moving too fast and too strangely to be aircraft.  In fact, one of the objects looked like it made a few jerky movements (almost like fast zig zags).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, they both faded out.  It was hard to tell if they went into the clouds or not; I suspect they did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouds cleared for a brief period shortly after the sighting (moonlight improved visibility).  It was at that time that we could estimate the cloud cover that had previously been over the sighting; I’d say at least 7000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know there is a military base in the area so who knows.<n>
5/22/11 23:31|Manteno|IL|Fireball|2 minutes|Vibrant, stationary orange light hovering above farmland|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81482.html|90|ndxe201105| Vibrant, stationary orange light hovering above farmland<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my fiance’s house around 11:30 PM on the 22nd of May, 2011.  His house is essentially in the middle of nowhere and is surrounded by corn fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a clear night, you can see every star in the pitch black sky, as it is void of air pollution and smog.  Tonight, however, we are expecting serious storm systems so the sky was extremely cloudy and overcast.  Dark grey clouds blocked any stars or airplanes in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, looking to the eastern part of the sky, I noticed a vibrantly glowing orange light hovering in the air.  Having avid interest in UFOs, I pointed it out to my fiance, asking him if there was a streetlight or radio tower in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He quickly brushed off these possibilities, as his house is surrounded by farmland as I mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood staring at the UFO.  It hung stationary in the sky, glowing a bright orange.  It didn’t waver like an airplane- in fact, it didn’t move whatsoever.  The object was VERY still.  It seemed to flash a li! ttle bit of red in the lower right corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the most part, it was entirely orange- a very vibrant orange.  The UFO captivated us since it stood out so sharply against the cloud-covered sky.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  [I took careful note on my drive home- I couldn’t even see any airplanes against the heavy cloud coverage.]<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 minutes of observation, the orange object began to get smaller and smaller before it disappeared.<n>

It looked like a fire ball.  The light would travel at very high speeds, then suddenly disappear.  Would re-apear 5 minutes later in the exact same flight path it took before and go a bit farther and disappear again.  This happened 3 x, then never saw the light again.  It was silent, and no where on it were there any flashing light to indicate that it was a plane or helicopter.<n>

It looked like an upright object gray in color not shiny kind of dull.  It did not make a sound that we could hear but there was a lot of background noise from traffic turning away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of what looked like fire or an orange light began to dim as it got closer to the track.  We reasoned that it was not a plane or a chopper since it did not have flashing or front facing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the light went completely out and we still saw the solid object in the air steadily moving in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my friends got spooked and demanded we leave.  I continued to watch it for a minute or two with no fire/light just moving along.<n>

It was a clear and windless night. I noticed something out of the corner of my eye and looked up.  What I saw was extraordinary. The UFO was heading exactly due north at moderate speed.  I watched the UFO for approximately 10 seconds until it went completely out of sight.  I estimated the UFO was at a high altitude from 20 to fifty thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:  The UFO had at least a dozen to fifteen strings of solid, soft white lights that appeared to be along the front in a crescent moon shaped fashion.  I could not fully tell if the lights were attached to a solid body, or were separate entities flying in a bowed formation.  The lights appeared to be spaced equally apart along the front and were not blinking as with most aircraft.  I estimated the sixe from one end to the other to be at least several hundred yards long.  It was massive, but graceful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO made no sound as it moved across the sky almost directly overhead.  There was no sound after the UFO passed either.  The speed was constant and it did not change course.  It stayed due north until it vanished out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I noted the time, I called the local police and made a formal report with a detailed description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college educated, 49 year old male who works for state government.  I am married with children and live in a gated mid-class neighborhood.<n>

As we were cleaning up the backyard, I looked up into the sky and saw these three bright lights.  I said to my boyfriend, &#34;What is that?&#34;  He didn’t look up just yet, but answered me by saying &#34;Iit’s just a star.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, &#34;There is no way that is just a star.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked up and saw it, and started screaming for other family members to come outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As everyone gathered in the backyard we all stood in amazement and watched these three amber colored lights slowly form into a perfect triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they glistened for about two minutes, the one in the right bottom corner started to slowly fade, almost as if it was getting further away from us until it disappeared.  The light on the bottom started slowly getting smaller and smaller until that one was gone.  Then the last light on the very top also faded slowly and within a minute the triangle was gone, into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn’t believe our eyes.  None of us have ever seen anything like it in our entire lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I have always believed that there are other forms of life out there, and this just confirmed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded quite sincere to us.

I may have taken unknowingly a photo of what appears to be a massive UFO hovering over Mecca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are so many lights in the mosque at night that an object regardless of how big may pass unnoticed over the massive building.  It appeared in two of the pictures I took.  It is a little further in one but had moved closer in the other (picture above).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took this photo in the evening of May 21, 2011. I was in Mecca for an &#34;umrah pilgrimage&#34; with my brother and his family.

I did, and what I saw can only be described as two pairs of triangles of 3 floating yellow lights. They look orange in the picture, but that&#39;s because my camera was adjusted to the cloudy blue light of Western Washington sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son came out too, but he was convinced it was some sort of flare system and went inside pretty quickly.  He wouldn&#39;t have thought that if he had seen the one pair slow down then speed up (not typical of a flare, which uses graduated release). He did have a point that there were only lights, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, not being a very big believer in aliens, am pretty privy on cloaking and I know that it is nearly impossible to cloak emissions meant to propel an object relative to another object (in this case the ship would have been pushing against air).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter pointed out that it had a &#34;watery look&#34; which I assume was the lensing effect a cloak might have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after, my friend called up and asked me if I had seen the &#34;Lights in the sky&#34; and if my lights had flickered (which they hadn&#39;t).<n> <n><n> <n><n> He, unfortunately, didn&#39;t have a camera near enough to catch a picture in time.<n>

Now with all this end of the world hooey going around I was starting to get a bit worried.  Then I realized this event probably wouldn&#39;t include me.  So I paid more attention to the object.  It was really fast and left no contrail, so I don&#39;t believe it was a plane.  I nearly had to lay down on the parking lot to keep a track on it!  It eventually moved out of my field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything move that fast!  I am not a spring chicken and have seen a lot of stuff in my days, but this takes the proverbial cake.  I went on the party and didn&#39;t say a word about it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what it was, but thought I&#39;d report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening.<n>

The sun was a bit dimmed and I think this is the main reason we were able to see these crafts since they didn&#39;t have much of a distinct shape/matter, but several lights (my guess would be about 8 of them) created this triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like mentioned this passed by very quickly, but a few friends also mentioned that they had seen something out of the ordinary.  Something they, as well as I, were not able to explain.  Can&#39;t be a helicopter, not an airplane, since there was no sound of these conventional flying vehicles to be heard.<n>

There are a handful of planes in the area, so I didn&#39;t think much of it.  The lights I saw didn&#39;t move though.  There were 4 lights all together, in a circle or oval shape - they may have be separate, but I don&#39;t know.  They all stayed still. of the 4 lights, 2 were changing colour.  They started yellow and then turned blue like a minute later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my cell (LG KEYBO) and tried to take a video, but nothing showed up.  I took two pictures, and you can sort of see it.  The changing lights were green then.  The others were white.  It&#39;s pretty noisy here, but it had a droning noise, like &#34;loooooooooooooooooooooo&#34;, not like a ghost or whatever, it was a deep drone.  The sound pulsed a few times, and the lights seemed to get a bit brigher, but I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to wake up my girlfriend, and we could see it from the bedroom window, but when we got out to the balcony, it was gone.<n>

The rumbling noise was very very unique and I&#39;ve never heard anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After standing in awe for a few minutes or so I grabbed my phone in my pocket and tried to get some pictures of it but the quality is horrid and you can&#39;t even make out the lights at all.  I&#39;ve tried taking pictures of the moon and stuff before with my phone camera but it never comes out right on the black and the quality of the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute later the lights disappeared behind the trees and the rumbling was slowly getting less and less prominent.  Soon it completely stopped and I just went back inside in pure shock.<n>

So, as always, I was skeptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited and watched the object and it was not flying like normal air traffic.

I noticed a back porch light on and flipped a switch near the window of my upstairs window to turn it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then, I noticed a very bright light on the other side of a stand of Poplar trees to the east of our property and very close to our house.  The trees were blocking my vision so all I could see was the light.  I have never seen anything like it.  The light appeared to be coming from something very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the foothills along the Wasatch Front in Davis County, Utah.  We are on the north edge of a gully on a ridge that drops several hundred feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to be coming from something hovering like a helicopter with its search lights on just to the east of our property.  It was not high in the sky, nor was it on the ground.  I thought at first that it may be a truck on the service road that hugs the mountainside with its headlights turned west in my direction but the light was much brighter than what light would filter across the gully at such a distance.  It was like a spotlight had been turned on.  A huge spotlight, big enough to produce a light that fill! ed the neighbor&#39;s yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no loud sound like a helicopter would make, although the windows were closed.  Suddenly the light went out.  This whole thing lasted about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to the next room where there is a huge window facing south east and overlooking the mountains.  Along the &#34;bench&#34; or base of the mountains there are power lines connected to towers strung out across the mountain from north to south for miles in each direction.  On this bench I saw a pillar of light as if a power line tower was suddenly aflame although the light was white-yellow and not orange like a fire.  Other lights flashed close to this pillar, possibly emergency vehicles for these lights were much fainter than the original light and in whites and reds and they moved like cars would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In seconds, the pillar of light seemed to pop and then all the power went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called the police.  The 911 dispatcher told me that &#34;they are taking care of it.&#34;  The power stayed out for 2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a helicopter about 15 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I posted a comment on Facebook.  Several of my friends responded.  One said, &#34;OK so strange!  I totally saw a flash of light then we lost power.  And one of our satelite recievers will not work. Hmmmm&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another said, &#34;I was up watching tv when the power went out.. It was weird that it took so long to come back on.  Usually it comes back on in 1 hr...

We were next her car kissing out of the corner of my eye I seen a very bright light it was moving quite slow bout 30 40 mph.  It got closer and I literally got this feeling that I started to freak out I was crying and felt like I should just run just pure fear I think.  When it got overhead it made no sound silent as hell which dumbfounded me I grew up in a military family and my dad was a green beret I have never seen anything like this.  It was a triangle complete even on all sides this thing was huge exactly the size of my neighbor’s house because it flew overhead.  It had 3 bright lights even on all sides.  I was so scared I woke up my dad and called the cops. Because it was a damn craft so low to the neighbor’s house I was like if the military is doing that next time I am shooting at them.  But they actually called air traffic control in which I kid you not about five minutes later the law enforcement left and military jets came flying by low and loud.  I spent most of my life trying to figure out what this was and why the cop couldn&#39;t tell us what was going on.  Apparently the cop never documented this. I knew that cop we live in a small enough town to know most people.  The officer ended up getting relocated.  I know what I saw that night and personally I am frightened.<n>

5/20/11 22:30|Woodland Hills|CA|Oval|5 Minutes|Oval, single craft, 2 white lights, 2 multi-colored lights, within 500 feet.|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81335.html|133|ndxe201105| Oval, single craft, 2 white lights, 2 multi-colored lights, within 500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:30 PM, I was reading a novel and drinking some coffee when I felt a strange wave-like movement under my feet.  At first, living in California, I thought I was having vertigo so I stood up and walked around a bit to get the blood flowing, but I still felt the distant rumbling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I realized that it might be an earthquake.  I&#39;ve been through the Northridge quake and quite a few others, but it didn&#39;t seem too serious so I went back to reading, but after about another 45 seconds it intensified to the point where objects were tipping/moving/falling etc., and typical earthquake events such as car alarms going off and my electricity shutting off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shaking was accompanied by what could be described as a military jet flying over very low at subsonic speeds.  This is also a common occurrence due to the numerous air bases in Southern California (Edwards, March Air Base et al.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was terrified and so I went outside as I was on! a second story of a building and fearful that it may collapse beneath me (Which would make the first floor even less safe) and when I emerged from the building I could notice quite a few trees shaking on my property as in a strong gust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked up the road a ways (I live in a semi-rural area albeit somewhat close to the city) to my neighbor&#39;s house to see if he was okay since he had just began rebuilding his outdoor second story patio and only half of the wood beams had been installed so far.  He was also standing out in the road and he yelled to me as I approached and was pointing at me, but I couldn&#39;t hear him over the &#39;jet noise&#39;.  As I got closer, however, I could make out that he was saying &#34;Look.&#34; and pointing not at me, but behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at that point that I turned around and saw what I believe to be a single craft.  The reason I say it was a craft was that it was moving slowly about 300-500 feet off of the ground and the noise was relative to it spatially, i.e. as it passed over the road, moving perpendicular to our view of it, the noise followed it.  It was shaped like two contact lenses attached to one another with the side that would be placed on the eye as the welding point, or what ever.  For the brief time I saw it (about 15 seconds) it appeared to me to have similar mass to about one city block.  There was a multi-colored light on the top and the bottom and two white lights on either side of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved to where it was obscured from our view by two oak trees so both me and my friend pursued it. When we were underneath the trees we heard the jet sound disappear in what I can only describe as a &#39;sucking&#39; transition to silence.  It went from very high volume and intensity to an anti-crescendo and by the time we emerged on the other side of the two oaks it had disappeared from sight.<n>

I looked up at the sky and I saw 3 circles in a triangle formation, they flashed pulsivley,the light was so bright it was hurting my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have only lasted for about three seconds maybe and then it was gone.<n>

The time was approximately 21:40 central time zone on the 20th of May, 2011.  The sky had already been night for over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling from the south and heading due north.  There was no clear shape to the object and it was emitting a brilliant green light.  The best way I can describe it was a small green ball of light that changed several different levels of intensity from very bright to dim, then back to bright, then dim, and back to bright and then complete darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also what looked to be a green cloud around the object.  I am not sure if the light was producing the cloud or if it was just traveling through water vapor in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object maintained a steady altitude and my best guess would be that it was one and one half miles away and traveling at approximately 600-700mph.  The object did not produce a sound that could be heard from my vantage point.  It was only visible for probably four seconds before going completely dark, which is a fairly decent amount of time to observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that it was not a meteor because the way it was changing to several different levels of intensity from bright to dim and back to bright. It was also maintaining a steady smooth altitude and going much slower than a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were faint clouds in that section of the sky obstructing the view of the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how far away or high the clouds were.  It was not navigation or strobe lights from an aircraft.  I have spent half my life dealing with aviation and have seen thousands of aircraft in flight in daylight and in darkness.  I have certainly seen over one hundred meteors in my life and this was much different.  I have seen green meteorites illuminate and then burn out. This was much different and slower and maintained a steady altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way the light changed intensity to several different levels was very interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This concludes what! I saw.<n>

The largest craft seemed to be in charge and moved first to each new location in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately two minutes the three craft made a sharp turn directly upward at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time the craft were in the area, they either changed color, or light reflecting from them looked differently due to different angles of view.  The objects made a low pitched humming sound, but this sound could have been coming from the U.S. aircraft that were scrambled due to the suspicious objects entering airspace over a military installation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide little contact information.

It would instantly switch from one position to another in a snap of a finger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First it was in a up right position and then suddenly it fliped on its side. Then it went back to it&#39;s upright postion and  started to spin suddenly at high speeds and looked like an oval.  It stopped spinning as soon as a passanger plane passed right by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it began spinning again and then started to move left to right at high speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one had a clue what it was, but all we know is that it is a UFO.

5/20/11 01:30|Kansas City|KS|Disk|?|Possible abduction, witnessed several hovering discs from the ground.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83575.html|140|ndxe201105| Possible abduction, witnessed several hovering discs from the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night this happened, my husband and I were up pretty late watching a movie. It ended about 1:30 AM, and I went up to bed. My husband was crashed out in the basement, so I decided to leave him there. I climbed into my bed next to my daughter (who frequently sneaks out of her bed to sleep with me). I must have been exhausted and just crashed, which is odd for me, because it usually takes several minutes to get to sleep, even when it&#39;s late. The next morning, I woke up extremely dehydrated and recalled a very startling and vivid “dream” of being around aliens and UFOs. This was so startling, and unlike any other dream that I’ve ever had, so I decided to explore other options, such as an actual abduction. I’ve heard of the UFO/alien phenomena, but had never given it much consideration till this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall being &#34;beamed up&#34; but I clearly remember being taken somehow to a place with a lot of hallways. Then I remember feeling like I was being instructed to urinate in a long and wide tube with strange markings on the side. I think the markings indicated measurements or something. The last thing I remember was being on the ground, outside, in what looked like a vacant/abandoned parking lot. I remember the concrete had lots of cracks in it like it was old and worn. There were evergreen trees surrounding this place. There were other people standing around me with cages of small animals, like house cats, birds, dogs, etc. I got the feeling like these people around me were going to release them. I remember feeling like it was approaching morning, but it was still dark outside. I looked up in the sky and noticed several (at least four) UFO craft very near above the ground of this parking lot, just hovering. There were three red lights coming from the bottom of them that ! blurred or blinked till they became one light beam. It&#39;s very hard to explain. These craft were larger than I’d have expected for what you see on television. I guess I’d always pictured them being the size of a small bus, but these were the size of a large home. I don’t remember ever being inside of the craft, but being inside of a building or structure near this lot. The other people there, like me, weren&#39;t completely in reality. It was like we were in a trance. I remember standing in this lot, looking up, and seeing one UFO fly high, stop, fly a little bit to the left, stop, fly higher, stop, and then flew off and vanished. So, after looking up at these UFOs from the ground, I remember it all of a sudden clicking (like a switch had been turned on) that this wasn&#39;t normal... And I remember taking off running as fast as I could. I had just snapped back to reality. As soon as I started to run, I recall the others, which I assumed had also been taken, almost clicking too and ! scattering in all directions. The last thing I recall is some ! kind of luminescent &#34;beam&#34; of sorts encasing me as I ran.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up very dehydrated, a bit weak, and still tired, but I remembered this almost like it had really happened. After that night, I had a minor sore throat and occasional minor pains in my abdomen. This lasted about two weeks, off and on. Ordinarily, I would have chalked this up to just being a dream or my subconscious manifesting my fears in an odd way, but the next day, my daughter said something extremely startling to me...&#34;Mommy, who were those boys that came and took you when you were sleeping?&#34; I questioned her a little, but I didn&#39;t want to push it with her, so I sort of left it be. She didn&#39;t seem particularly worried or concerned about it, just curious. (She was just shy of 4 years old at the time.) I’ve since asked her about it off and on, and she doesn’t appear to recall much more than she already said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I’ve started to attend MUFON meetings and I joined a group for experiencers and have been speaking with the leader, who is also a regression therapist. I haven’t shared this with anybody outside of this small group about this experience. I’m pretty sure my peers, family, and friends would think I’m crazy, so I would like to keep this somewhat anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reflection of this event, I started to piece together a few of my memories from childhood, and start questioning them more. For example, I remember a period of missing time when I was about 12 years old, where there were several hours unaccounted for. I had never even thought to question the “missing time” or even heard that phrase till after this last event occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If any of this seems relevant, please feel free to contact me, but I would appreciate my name being withheld from any public report.<n>

The radio was playing the song &#34;E.T. (Futuristic Lover)&#34; by Katy Perry.  I told my roommate, &#34;I think this song is about an alien.  Listen to the lyrics.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned up the radio for us both to hear the lyrics.  That happened for about ten to twenty seconds before both of us saw strange yellow lights up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can describe what we saw is that there was a cluster of yellow lights together in what formed a ball-like shaped formation.  Underneath that cluster were three more yellow lights spaced farther away from eachother, in what looked like an angled triangle shape.  All the yellow lights seemed to stand still in the sky together as either a formation of different lights or crafts, or as one craft with many lights (I am not sure which).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing it, I asked my roommate, &#34;What the hell is that?!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommate responded similarly saying, &#34;That does look weird!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided that I would park my vehicle somewhere to view it.  I parked my vehicle on the side of a street, and we got out of my vehicle to view it.  Once we saw it again, the ball-like cluster of lights was gone, however the three lights that were underneath it before were still visible, and were still in an angled triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights that were left then started slowly dissolving or disappearing one at a time, till there was one light left in the sky, and then that last light then dissolved or disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a bystander walking near us.  I told him, &#34;We just saw a UFO.&#34;  He said he saw it too.  I asked him what it was.  He told me, &#34;You just said it.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also asked my roommate if he saw what I saw, and he said yes.  He is just as amazed as I am on what we saw.  He is also willing to serve as a witness to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO, when all the lights (ball cluster lights plus three triangle lights) were visible was very large and took up a good size portion of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For me personally, this was the third UFO I ever saw in my life, and the most amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Supplement to Yellow Light Formation Sighting on 5/19/11 (Arcata, CA)<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a supplement to a report I entered yesterday on 5/19/11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object(s) my roommate and I saw was approximately in the East direction, and we saw it at approximately a 35 degree angle up in the distance.  The object(s) appeared to be approximately 200-250 feet up in the air, and approximately 400-500 feet away from my roommate and I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

Looked like a net or a grid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommate and I were sitting on the porch stargazing (two 20 year-old females).  It was a perfectly clear night.  We were out there for about 40 minutes when suddenly she pointed to an object that came into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a cloud or a haze of smoke -- looking closer, I realized it was composed of individual objects, maybe 50 or so.  They were dark grey in color, just light enough to be seen against the night sky.  I don&#39;t believe they gave off their own light, but rather were reflecting it.  It was flying at about the height and speed of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept staring at it, trying to figure out what it was -- she suggested a flock of birds, which seemed to fit for a moment, but the longer we looked the more we realized it was definitely not birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects weren’t moving independently, but as a perfect cohesive unit.  It was flying in a formation, but the objects remained perfectly spaced from one another, to the point where it looked like a grid or a net in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the objects began to shift and change positions.  It gave the appearance of a morphing, shifting net.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 3-dimensional in the way that it moved, and very geometric.  It drifted directly overhead and then slowly out of sight. We didn’t take our eyes off it the entire time.  I have no idea how to properly describe what I saw, the movement was so strange and foreign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure if this is related or not, but about 2 minutes after we saw the object a very loud plane flew by in the same direction.<n>

It happened at night (around 10:30 pm) so I could not tell if it was a rectangle or an oval.  The shape of the windows lead me to believe that it probably had the shape of a rectangle.  I honestly don&#39;t know how long, large or what the shape of the object was outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I saw it until the time I pulled into my garage took about about 5 minutes, max.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached my house I lost sight of it because my home is at the bottom of a small hill and the trees blocked my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sorry to say that I did not leave my garage to further investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my attention was that it was not moving and that it had, what appeared to be, four, rectangular windows that were lit up.

5/17/11 17:20|Omaha|NE|Triangle|20 minutes|Triangle Object|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85417.html|155|ndxe201105| Triangle Object<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported numerous Discs sighted back on June 22nd 2003 (see Nuforc.org). Since then I have constantly watched the sky with binoculars or naked eye and have seen numerous objects over the years. I dont have the best camera but decided to try and take zoomed in photos now and then of objects I have seen. The camera that took the photos in regards to this report is a Digital with zoom that uses a floppy disk for storage. I have debated wheather or not to file this report and submit the photos since I want to be absoultly sure that what is reported is accurate and not a waste of anybodys time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only manipulation that I have done on the photos submitted is to invert color &amp; or zoom in &amp; or sharpen in order to try and get the best view possible of the objects. I would love if Mufon or someone could enhance them better. This was a clear sunny day late afternoon. Sitting on my deck looking up at approximately a 60 - 80 degree angle - approximately 5 or 10 degre! es to the west of South. Offutt AFB is 10 - 15 miles to the SE. Millard Airport is 1 mile straight south. Omaha Eppley is 15 miles to the North East.  I was a jet mechanic in the Navy and am quit familiar with military and commericial aircraft. I have learned the incoming and outgoing flight paths for the above facilities.  I am guessing that the objects I observed and took photos of are approximately up around 30 - 40 thousand feet as they were hard to see with the naked eye but able to watch with binoculars and they still appeared to be distant. When I took the photos - I didnt know if the pictures would turn out or not let alone capture anything since the objects seemed so far distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most common factor in the photos is the small green circular light. I first noticed the triangular object (which was hard to distinguish its shape at the time) and took its picture which I was supprised to see the triangular shape and more important to see a cicular area on the bottom o! f the craft which appears to be some sort of propulsion emissi! on. The two object photo - was one object then two, were there and then were gone. I know what I saw, I know what I took pictures of and I know what the pictures are showing; I know that the objects are not any type of commericial or military aircraft that I have ever seen before. No matter if you are a skeptic of UFO&#39;s or a believer in UFO&#39;s as I am - here are the pictures for you to view and decide for yourself what the objects are. Mufon or NuForc are encouraged by me to analyize these photos in depth because I would like to know what they decide the objects in the pictures might be. Mufon or NuForc are welcome to contact me for any additional questions or investigation.<n>

Having heard that this is a indication that you might possibly be struck by lighting I looked up in the sky out of fear. There about 10 o’clock from my position I saw what appeared to me at first to be street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon closer examination I realized that the figure was to far away to be streetlights and it appeared to be drifting lazily toward the twelve O’ Clock position.  It was a pizza shaped outline in the clouds with about 8 spheres of light lining its shape evenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This shape continued to drift for about 5 seconds more in complete silence and abruptly was enveloped in the clouds.  The light spheres lining the shape were eventually enveloped in the clouds and I lost sight of it at which point the static electricity feeling left me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood around dumbstruck for about 15 more minutes before I realized that it wasn’t coming back and headed on my way back to home.<n>

This caught my attention and I looked up and to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up I saw a craft moving due West and completely silent.  It appeared to be about a block or so away and 150 feet above the treeline.  It was circular on the bottom and seemed to look slightly smaller than a house in size.  There were no lights on it, but the bottom seemed to be highly reflective and appeared to be reflecting a few street lights from below. The bottom surface did not appear to be smooth, as the reflections of light moved on it irregularly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it move slow and silently for about 1 minute before it went behind a building I was close to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think I would have seen it at all if I had not been in the path of the shadow it cast as it went by.

He has been very generous in sharing 23 e-messages, with 32 attached photographs of objects he has captured with a camera.  Most of the objects he did not witness, at the time the photos were taken, but rather later, as he inspected the photos.  NUFORC has looked at all of the photos, and although we cannot identify all of the anomalous objects captured photographically, but most of the objects we believe are birds.  In most of those cases, we are even able to determine the type of bird involved, and its position in flight.  We believe that none of the photos is of a genuine UFO.  We, nevertheless, express our gratitude to the source for his having shared the information with our Center, who has had to use a computer at a public library, in order to submit the information to NUFORC!

It was much larger than any aircraft I had ever seen and it had eight bright lights along the two forward pointing edges, the back had no lights on it.  It was bigger than our house and it flew directly overhead, it made no noise at all.

5/15/11 09:00|Janesville|WI|Triangle|5 to 8 minutes|Waiting at a bus stop, a lot of strange stuff happened only a minute before witnessing an object I will NEVER forget!|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85453.html|171|ndxe201105| Waiting at a bus stop, a lot of strange stuff happened only a minute before witnessing an object I will NEVER forget!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gone to the library after school and spent a few hours there.  After I missed the bus, I sat by the bus stop for the next one.  About 20 minutes after I got to the stop, two of the street lights flickered slightly and one burnt out, I figured it was just a little strange but something that could still happen.   Only a minute or so later, a passing car had to stop from a sudden battery blow out.  I thought again that this was weird, but I tried not to think much of it.  To pass time, I looked at the sky to find some constellations which takes some time, I thought the bus would come when I found a few, but instead of stars, my eyes were directed at a triangular shape making absolutely no noise.  It was made of three yellow lights, one at the top, one on the bottom left, and one on the bottom right.  I heard the person in the broken down car say &#34;what the hell is that?&#34; and I figured they were looking at it too but I didn&#39;t check.  I stared at it until it ! was out of sight, it moved slowly so that took about 2 minutes.  In that time, I noticed the lights were changing once in a while from yellow to blue, then to red.  Once it was out of sight, I saw about 7 of what looked very much like planes flying together, but of course spaced out, towards the direction the object had gone.  When the planes were gone, I looked around to see if the person in the car had seen what I saw, but they were gone along with the car, and somehow the broken light had turned back on.  That freaked me out, mostly because no one was around to fix the light (no one can fix a light in that little time anyways) and no one gave the car a jump.  I didn&#39;t even hear it start.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were driving down Woods Chapel Rd going west towards 470 Hwy.  The driver noticed the UFO first and pointed it out to us. It was staying neutral in the same spot directly in front of us.   We only saw it for maybe a minute or two and then it got smaller and smaller really fast like it was moving away from us directly west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it was the same shape as this one,<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_gNYZsIqXB30/SlyKKRQd1zI/AAAAAAAAACk/gGAwRDUUOHE/s400/ufo_picture_2.jpg<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a bright circular white light on the right side of it.  Then along the bottom of it there was a line of white light.  The light was very bright, then dimmed slowly to nothing, then back bright again before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.  Everyone was asking, &#34;Are you seeing what I&#39;m seeing?!&#34;  I kept saying, &#34;Oh my God, Oh my God&#34;  I&#39;m so mad we didn&#39;t pull over and take pictures.  Although I&#39;m not sure how well the pictures would&#39;ve turned out because we didn&#39;t have actual cameras, just our phones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course lots of people don&#39;t believe us and are assuming that it was a blimp or a helicopter.  All of us saw the exact same thing.  There&#39;s no doubt in our minds that it was an ET UFO.  None of us have ever seen an aircraft like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The friend&#39;s apartment that we were heading to, that&#39;s located right where we saw the UFO, said that they&#39;ve seen some apache helicopters flying around the little airport that&#39;s right by them in the last week.  We were thinking that maybe the authorities know something that&#39;s going on and they&#39;re monitoring or something...<n>

A very large neon green circular light hovered close to my window for at least 3 seconds.  I got up from the couch, walked to the window to look out through the partially open blinds to see outside.  The light disappeared in the time it took for me to get to the window.  I went outside with a flashlight to discover where the green light had come from, but couldn&#39;t find anything and all.  The proximity to my house has me spooked.  We live a ways from the road, which is shielded by trees.  It is very dark outside, and we have no outside lights on. After I couldn&#39;t discover anything I went back to reading.  Then I saw it again outside a different window (the one next to where I saw the first light come from). I think I saw a cone shaped light towards the second circle, but I can&#39;t be sure.  As soon as I saw the second circular light it disappeared about 1 second later.  This time I had my husband go outside t! o check.  He didn&#39;t find anything. It has unnerved me a little, since there doesn&#39;t seem to be any simple explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Immidiatelly I notice what it seemed I line of orange lights traveling at a slow speed and almost steady and a very high altitude,so it seemed to me.It lasted maybe for about one minute and then disappeared.  Since I live very close to MIA, I noticed air traffic was diverted towards the south.  Also I heard sounds like a interceptor in the vicinity,I live very close to Homestead Air Force Base.  As a final comment it was the same type of orange color as the ones we saw on the night of 12/31/2010, but this New Years Eve sighting was of various UFO and every 8 minutes interval.<n>
5/14/11 21:38|Bayamon (Puerto Rico)||Unknown|about 5 minutes|Two triangular formation groups (for a total of  eight red lighted objects) were observed southwest of where I live moving west.|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81510.html|176|ndxe201105| Two triangular formation groups (for a total of  eight red lighted objects) were observed southwest of where I live moving west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in Bayamon, Puerto Rico at the time of the sighting.  I was speaking to my sister (she was also in Bayamon, Puerto Rico)on the phone when all of the sudden she told me to run and look at the sky towards the southwest.  I saw three red lights in V formation that were heading west.  I called out to my husband,a retired air traffic controller, to come immediately to witness what I was seeing.  Just as they were beginning to disappear we spotted three more in V formation and were identical to the ones that had just disappeared but these were seemingly lower and closer to us. They went in the same direction as the previous ones. My husband called the FAA CERAP (air traffic control radar facility ) in San Juan, Puerto Rico to report it. The supervisor on duty stated that the objects flying in our area were NOT on the radar. Therefore, they truly were unidentified flying objects.  I then called my son to see them and grabbed a pair of binoculars.  As I focuse! d on one with the binoculars I could only see the bottom of one which had red lights all around the bottom rim.  Then two more appeared at a distance from each other and followed the other three.  We did not here any noise coming from them.  This was witnessed for a fact by the people that were next to my sister in the parking lot at Rexville Towne Center in Bayamon (a local strip mall) and by people that were on road 167 in Bayamon heading south as there are reports that many stopped their cars to observe them in the sky.  My sister saw some use there cell phones to either photograph or record the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/14/11 17:30|Aventura|FL|Oval|20 seconds|8 oval objects traveling in a loose formation at approximately 500mph.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is airline pilot.  PD))|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81266.html|177|ndxe201105| 8 oval objects traveling in a loose formation at approximately 500mph<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in daylight, and they were definitely &#34;solid&#34; objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were exactly eight of them, and they were in two groups of 3 each, and then there were 2 more trailing behind.   They were traveling pretty much due north, and I spotted them when they were due west of me.  Unfortunately, they were actually at their CPA when I first saw them, and so the best part of the sighting was right at the beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky beyond them was a pale yellow, and consisted of a smokey overcast back-illuminated by the sun, which was fairly low in the sky.  (We&#39;ve been having huge brush fires out west in the glades, and so for the last three days or so, the sky has been a brownish overcast most of the time, and you can smell smoke most of the day...)    The objects themselves were between 1 and 2 miles away.  (It&#39;s hard to estimate the distance because they were just silhouetted against the sky, and there were no buildings or mountains or anything to use as a gauge.)    Similarly, the altitude was between 2000 and 5000 feet by my best guess.  If they were 1 mile away, then they were at about 2000 feet.  If they were more like 2 miles away, then the altitude was probably about 5000 feet.  (If they were any farther than that, then they were HUGE.  But by the way they were moving so deftly around each other, I got the impression that they were only about 30-40 feet in diameter.)    Their color was indeterminate, and as they were silhouetted against the yellow sky, they appeared black or dark gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their speed was MUCH faster than any aircraft would be normally traveling at that altitude.  Of course, if they were high and far enough away for 500 mph to be a &#34;normal speed&#34;, then their size would have been in the neighbourhood of several hundred feet across.  There was also no sound whatsoever.  And if by some chance they were propelled by air-breathing engines, then there would have definitely been a substantial sound made by eight aircraft at that approximate distance, moving at that approximate speed.  As it was though, there was no sound whatsoever.  They moved completely silently, and with a sort-of &#34;slippery&#34; type of motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not travelling in perfectly straight lines.  But instead, they were zig-zagging slightly, which was causing their relative positions in their loose formations to change substantially as they moved across the sky.  Each of the groups of three remained &#34;intact&#34;, although the relative positions of the various crafts within each group seemed to change, almost as though they were &#34;trading places&#34; with each other within the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total length of time of the sighting was about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were dark, ominous clouds to the north, and about halfway through the sighting, the background changed from pale yellow to a bluish-gray color, and they became harder to see at that point.  They were not only getting farther away with each passing second, but there was much less contrast between them and the background sky once they left the pale yellow area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former airline pilot with approximately 12,000 hours, and I&#39;ve flown equipment ranging from Cessnas to Boeing 727&#39;s.  I have 20/10 distant vision, and I am absolutely certain that the objects I witnessed were not helicopters, balloons, blimps, birds, floating debris carried by the wind, or any type of fixed-wing aircraft.<n>

I was in the back seat, right side, of my friends’ car travelling west on E. Speedway Boulevard, Tucson, AZ.  I believe I first spotted it near the intersection w/ Craycroft.  I saw one silvery-golden cylindrical metal craft that was shaped like a cigar or a cigarette ( long and thin).  It was flying in the same direction as we were travelling (westward) in the sky north of us. It was flying fast.  It was not all that high in the sky which made me think it was taking off or landing.  It was flying fairly level so it didn&#39;t appear to have just taken off or preparing for landing.  It appeared to have a thin stripe of an orange metallic color at the front and another thin orange stripe in the center.  There were no wings and we didn’t her any plane noises.  I pointed it out to my friend who was in the front passenger seat and she also saw it.  I don’t know if the driver saw it.  We watched it for a few blocks then it was ou! t of our view.  My friend and I are college counselors.<n>

I was lying in bed staring at my window when all of a sudden a bright light flashed by followed by a huge burst of wind followed by absolute silence.  Not a minute later the police sirens stopped.  I’ve lived here since December and have become quite used to cars driving by at all hours in the evening.  I’m a fairly light sleeper as I easily awake to people talking when walking by my apt.  I know what the sound of a car sounds like because I also work on a busy drive street.  You can make the sound of tires across pavement out just as easily as blinking police lights.

The lake being about a 1/2 mile from my home. I noticed a bright white light coming from the South, starting from what appeared to be about 15 miles away.  There are still very few leaves on the trees, so I was able to track this as it went from South to North at a very high rate of speed following the bluff along the coast of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keeping in mind that there is constant air traffic over Lake Michigan, I am aware of what commercial, military and Coast Guard craft are capable of, not to mention where most of the flight paths over the lake are near my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unless this was a very close traveling comet, an explanation of a shooting star or a satellite would be ridiculous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was piercing white, traveling at a high rate of speed from the south. It seemed to be approximately 10 miles of the shoreline at an altitude of about a mile, maybe less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It grew much larger in size as I was now seeing it pass me and start to veer to the North/East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A trail of light followed, but as a smear of the speed of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially the color was a white so bright that it seemed fluorescent. Upon passing, the front and lower front of the comet like object turned a deeper shade of electric blue, while the mid bottom and start of the tail became a fierce orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I noticed that the front of this was not rounded but had a slope of about 45 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the duration of this passing, the size of the object grew much wider, taller and longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not from perspective either. It was as if the object grew while it was moving and then disappeared on a different course. Possibly even an elliptical course, brushing the shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can easily rule this out as being a shooting star, satellite or even a commercial aircraft due to the enormous size. If this was a comet, it was ridiculously close to earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot put an estimate on the size due to the fact that the light intensity and even density of the object is that of which I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to guess...  4-5 times larger than a 747.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire showing lasted maybe as long as 7 seconds, but like glancing at the sun, the image was imbedded in the sky and in my eyelids for at least 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen aircraft, shooting stars, meteor showers, Northern Lights and even comets in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything in my life of this color, intensity and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pretty cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Credibility - I was alone but I don&#39;t drink.<n>

I said to him do you see a haze of light around it he said yes.  I went for my binoculers and had a look.  It was not a star ,yet it looked like it was that far away.   As he looked at it I called a freind with a teleascope to look at it and call me back.  He called back and informed me that he was not sure what he was looking at and in turned call a friend that had a bigger telescope.  He said that it was no star, no air planes, satelight, weather baloon. his discription was  It was a large silver object surounded by a super bright haze of bright white light.I was up untill 3 am and it did not move at all.  It was gone the next night<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

These dots were red to bright orange in coloration.  From the start to the middle of the event the dots of light would show up in groups of anywhere from 3 to 5 and move rather quickly across the horizon in the fashion i previously explained.  These lights did not blink and were too bright to be the lights present on plane wings.  It was overcast weather which eliminated the possibility that they were satellites.  Halfway through the event what appeared to be a conventional aircraft appeared and flew perpendicular to the lights into the horizon.<n>

It made no sound and somtimes it looked more green then blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the light make a complete circle around our niegborhood. My daughter tryed to get a picture but it didnt turn out.It flashed every once and a while then faded untill it was out of sight.    A few mins later we herd jets flying over and my daughter said she herd them on and off for an hour.  We have seen this light befor just last week and also last year.  My husband an niece have also witnessed this light.  I read on here that another person reported seeing last month.  I dont know what it is my husband thinks its boarder controll helicoper.  I dont know what to think.

It&#39;s late on Wednesday night, and my associate spotted a strange formation of lights outside his window in the northeast sky.  He lives several miles out of town.  When he went to look out a different window, the lights had gone from a horizontal formation to a vertical one. then he lost contact with the craft.  He called a local resident and informed him of the sighting.  He went outside and saw it, facing north towards Davenport over highway 28.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He proceeded to pursue the craft down the highway as it flew in line with the highway at an altitude of 150 feet AGL.  He couldn&#39;t see it while driving except for when he turned around, it was vaguely visible in the distance.  He estimates it was 20 to 30 miles away at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later, an intrigued young man heard of the sighting and accompanied the truck driver to a point near the Star Barn Road which is west on the way to Sprague.  We watched for a while from the field we were in and saw nothing! at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while we noticed a flash in some large dark clouds. Its about 10:30 pm at this point.  We thought the flashes were lightning but there was no thunder. It was more of a slow strobing light. And it was moving through the clouds in a northeasterly trajectory.  It emerged from the clouds and was the same craft that was spotted earlier. It was flying very low and unnaturally slowly and was perfectly silent.  Especially considering its low altitude and large size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My associate is a pilot and he agreed that it was no airplane.  It continued flying towards spokane and continued into the distance.  In the direction of spokane we spotted a strange light hovering over the horizon. (separate from the craft.  It was also visible in addition to it.)  There was a strange pulsing red glow on the horizon.  We estimate it was located several miles away.  The original craft appeared to be directly over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly another light appeared over the craft and was darting to and fro li! ke a firefly but miles away. the light on the horizon wavered for a moment and slowly lowered until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove in the general direction of the lights to investigate when suddenly all the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After searching again, we gave up and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the two gentlemen who submitted this report, and they sounded to us to be sincere and credible.

Then it proceeded to flash and fly in the field behind my house.  It also went across my neighbor’s fence, and back into the trees.  It seemed like it was taking it’s time in the field when it was flying.  I only noticed an orange/or red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this three times this week the 11, 10, and 9th of this month.  The first time I witnessed it was in my fence it flashed lights in the trees.  I got scared and went in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 10th of May 2011 I saw it about 15-20 acres away in the field about 20 feet above the ground within two seconds it crossed the 15-20 acres and was at the corner of my fence.  It moved about 20 feet and flashed in my trees.  A second after that it was two houses down from me in the trees and flashed every second the light on it was a yellow/white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will try to capture these UFO’s tonight again.<n>

We were their around noon time. I was the first one to look up and see three orangeish spheres hovering above us about 100 to 200 ft. above. They seem to be watching us close. They were hovering in a triangler formation. everyone watched for a few minutes untill some got scared and went back to the truck. i was so amazed,that i watch for a good 20 minutes untill they shot off in three different directions. Their was no sound of any type of propulsion of any type. What was strange,was that you could hear a jet fighter or some type of jet coming in the background. I will never forget this oppurtunity for the rest of my life. I am a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No cars were wrecked but we were all very shaken up, I talked with the other drivers that also said they didn’t see what the flying object was but it startled them and cut out their electronics as well   After the 3 minutes you began to hear cell phones turning back on and our cars were able to start back up we got into our vehicles and continued our travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former army mechanic and I worked on several air bases, never have I seen something move so fast a and silent, the other witnesses said it was a low flying jet and the sonic boom made the electronics go out.  But I know that you can not fly a plane that low at that speed, and a sonic boom would have blown out our windows and ears.  Nothing that I know of other then an E.M.P. could have done what this aircraft did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the incident I called several media centers to see if anyone else has reported seeing anything but they refused to tell me.<n>

We thought that it could be a meteor. There were other people traveling on the freeway at that time and they would have seen it also.<n>

I did my daily walk around work, and I found a nice quite &amp; dark place to lay on the pavement so that I may gaze at the stars.  Well it was pretty hazy/cloudy up in the sky, with clouds rolling in from the West.  These were the type of Clouds that are very ripply, the ones that have been reported as Haarp Generated.  Although it was some what cloudy I could still se stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After awhile of gazing, all of a sudden two dim orange objects drifted over my head, going from North to South.  They looked to be in the clouds or above them because they were pretty blurry.  They were probably about 300 feet apart.  (It’s hard to tell being on the ground but that would be my guess)  They were both traveling at the very same speed, which was faster than your normal airplane or jet.  They had no blinking lights and no noise.  One of the Orbs seemed to be rocking back and forth coming closer to the other and then back away.  They did not take off super fast and disappear like most UFO sightings, they just kept on drifting by at a steady speed until I could no longer see them.<n>

(I have a ruler for this, as I do look at the night sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, saw it with 7 X 26 binoculars while watching planes, birds and the moon.  Then it could be spotted by eye, once I knew where it was, as it had lots of brilliance (white, not metallic - much brighter than the moon).  It was definitely round.  At times the brilliance seemed to change somewhat but that might have been an illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get my Celestron SkyMaster 25 X 100 binoculars, and although it was handheld, the view was quite striking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, my wife was in the kitchen, and I went to tell her to come and see - she did see it also, through the 7 X 26 binoculars, after she was told to go “from the moon, then up and slightly yo the left”.  She told me that I needed the tripod, and I showed her the 25 X 100 binoc. and the camera which I also had by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo takes with (cheap) camera - Sony (5.1 Megapixels) DSC-P93A, zooming ~12X.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near the end of the sighting, I had again switched to the 7 X 26 binoculars, and suddenly, it got smaller, zigzagged very fast, became a dot (still zigzagging at that point!) and disappeared.  I kept looking, as if it was a balloon, the fabric could perhaps be spotted, but I couldn’t see it coming down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please, if you know what happens when a balloon reached a high altitude and blows up, please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, a few years ago I saw something and regrettably failed to report, so this time, an effort is being made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am working on a tripod with screw drive mechanism to go up and down, etc., but it was not yet ready today - otherwise, there would be a fair photo, with the camera through the 25 X 100 binoculars.<n>

May 09th and Tue. May 10 2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched through my kitchen window an object glowing red to yellowish red, changing colors as it hovered, flitted up and down, from side to side, irradically but staying always in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s size and shape seemed to change as it moved around. It is in the general direction of where the sun goes down and just over a bit which would be in the northwest of me from where I am standing looking at it.  My husband and I drove up the rural road and on up to the main highway in that direction this morning to see if there might be a tower anywhere in the area of where I saw it both nights to explain why it was always in the same area the whole time and red.  We saw none There are no witnesses either night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off all lights inside and outside the house to make sure that what I saw and am seeing again tonight is not a reflection on the (crank-open-outward-type) window (screen located inside) of something lit up inside or outside that could be causing it.  This moving, glowing object I&#39;m seeing at least 5 miles away(?) is fluctuating from what looks like to be treetop level to higher.  I am certain that the red ufo is in fact there in the night sky and is moving around in a darting manner as if searching for something. I feel anxious and cannot go to bed.  I keep going and looking out to see if it is still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed also that it will stop abruptly, stay still for a second and disappear for an instant, reappearing in a different spot very nearby where I last saw it.  It keeps doing this back and forth, up and down in no orderly manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw a smaller ufo of the same description over to the left of it higher up and flitting about in the same manner. Hard to judge how far away it was from the other but if I was to hold my arm across in front of my face bent from the elbow looking out at them, it would be that length apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I lived at another town nearby in 2008 I saw a similar ufo around the same time of night, hovering, but was a white color, with a faint, unsteady red glow.  On the first night I kept watching for over an hour from midnight onward until it suddenly dropped straight down behind a small mountain where a red glow emminated upwards and all around the whole area where it went down.  The reddish glow was fainter but still visible at dawn the next morning when my husband and I both saw it from our sixth floor balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second night, the white starlike ufo did the same thing, just hovered at the same time of night for over an hour, to my recollection, and then it just suddenly, like a light being turned out,,,,disappeared into thin air.  I did not see it again after those two nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I was the only one who witnessed it the both nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to add that the area where the ufo sitings took place in 2008 are very concentrated with uranium mines which are no longer active.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My present sitings are located about 35 miles southeast of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s now 01:15 hr Tuesday morning, the larger, brighter one is still there.  I am retiring for the night and will look again tomorrow night to see if any have returned.<n>
5/9/11 22:46|Radford|VA|Unknown|1minute 30 sec.|Bright bluish green lights that illuminated the NW sky with no apparent source for the light.|5/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81204.html|216|ndxe201105| Bright bluish green lights that illuminated the NW sky with no apparent source for the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a church softball game my son and I returned to our house in East Radford.  I went back outside to my vehicle after being inside for several minutes.  In the NW sky there were huge flashes of bluish green lights.  These lights seemed to originate from the ground and shoot upwards from there.  It was not a beam of light.  It reminded me of welding flashes, but magnified by hundreds of times.  It lit up the whole sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no houses, buildings, neighborhoods, or roads within 5 miles of my house and the direction of the lights.  It is just farm land over the ridge.  That is why I could not see what the object was that was producing the light, because of the ridge.  There was no sound and I never saw a craft or anything, however I was expecting for one to just shoot up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted for about a minute and a half and just as I pushed the record button for my camcorder it stopped.  Just wanted to share my story.  It was truly the craziest thing I have ev! er seen that I could not explain.<n>
5/9/11 22:45|Nice|CA|Light|15 minutes|Flashing Light Sighting 5/9/11 in Nice (Lake County) CA|5/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81194.html|217|ndxe201105| Flashing Light Sighting 5/9/11 in Nice (Lake County) CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting was in Lake County California, driving north on Hiway 29 from Lakeport to Nice (pronounced niece), and continued as we turned onto Hiway 20 heading east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north on 29 with my son and his girlfriend riding in the vehicle, as well.  We all noticed the lights about the same time as we drove up onto the hiway from 11th street in Lakeport.  At first we thought it was lightening strikes but I realized that the flashes were not from the sky to the ground but in fact were coming from the ground and shining into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove north along Hiway 29, it actually goes up hill somewhat, so as we gained altitude we could see that the lights were actually coming from behind the foothills, behind the town of Nice along Hiway 20.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not seem to flash with any regularity or pattern but seemed to be very random and the intensity would shift, as if the direction of the craft emitting them was changing angles or manipulating the lights in some sort of search pattern.  There are no roads along the ridge that the lights were traveling; this area is far to steep and jagged for any wheeled vehicles to have traversed so easily and as quickly as we saw the lights moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights continued as we arrived at home in Nice.  At this point we got out of the vehicle and walked to the front of our property and we saw the lights flash several times more.  We wanted to see them but we also were attempting to listen for any noises, like a possible rotary blade &#34;whooping&#34; sound, you would expect to hear from helicopters.   We saw the lights but heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son spoke with some of his friends the next day and several others from Lakeport to Upper Lake to Nice, all saw the lights but heard no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a very rural area with only small towns (the entire county of Lake has just over 62,000 population) and the entire northern area of the county is like a big bowl, so sounds and noise travel easily over a great distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If these light emitting UFOs were making noise at all we would have heard it.<n>

And in the sky appeared a light probably half the size of a full moon in the shape of a circle, it was a whitish yellowish mix in color.  To the left of it appeared another one exactly the same and also another to the right also exactly the same, within seconds the middle one split into two separate &#34;balls&#34; and then the one to the left did the same thing and then the right to follow, I jumped and ran to the door to call for a friend to come and see and when I turned around they were all gone.  As we sat on the porch and I was stressing to her what I had just witnessed I saw another one in the same area in the sky I pointed and just freaked out as did she when she turned around and witnessed it also.. But this time it was just one and it never split.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also that night my dogs, as well as the neighbor’s dogs were barking and going crazy.  We also heard faint unusual noises for where we live, one sounded like a screaming baby, and the other was hard to explain, almost like a &#34;shuttering&#34; sound.  I am not trying to be funny but it almost sounded like that &#34;clucking&#34; noise the &#34;creatures&#34; on the movie Signs made, I’m serious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time my NOAA Weather Radio kept going off for no reason, there were  No watches, or warnings in our area at all.  This was a very unsettling situation…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere and credible.  PD))<n>
5/9/11 20:00|Riddle|OR|Rectangle|10-15 minutes|Very large craft with five large lights moving slowley over ridge line, with out any sound of engines.|5/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81223.html|219|ndxe201105| Very large craft with five large lights moving slowley over ridge line, with out any sound of engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m really unsure what I saw.  I was looking to the south on the ridge line just before dark, I seen what appeared to be a large plane moving slowley to the east along the ridge line flying very low at a best guess I would say maybe 500 feet above ridge line.  It had five large lights spaced along the front of the craft. I thought at first it was a military craft, but I have never seen one like it.  It moved along the ridge line and appeared to be about a 2 football lenghts so somewhere around 500-600 yards long.  It was absoutley silent not sound of engines at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife and told her what I was seeing.  I watched it for about 3 minutes then the craft changed course and started heading due south.  I could no longer see any lights just the back mass of the object.  At this point I would guess it to be about 1 mile maybe a mile and a half away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to my truck and grabbed my binoculars darkness started to set in, I looked at the object through my binoc&#39;s and at this point could only make out lights like a amber or yellowish hugh and could no longer see the craft.  What made me feel that what I saw wasn&#39;t a plane was one no sound, and just at dark five fast moving jets raced across the sky from the direction of the my last spotting of ther craft.  I could easly tell that those were planes and I could see the strobing lights along the wings of the jets.   They moved from one side to the other side of the horizon in about 10 seconds and then everything was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not beleive that something of that size and unusualness was not seen by other residents in the community.  The craft appeared at Nickle mountian and  moved along the ridge line due east.  This is an old nickle mine called Hand and Nickel.  Which is now owned by Green Diamond and is where I work and was able to see what ever it was I saw.  It is not possible for me to see a craft that close and not hear the sound of it, I have looked all over the internet for a craft similar to what I had saw but as of yet I haven&#39;t found one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess best description it was rectangular very long it hade five large lights evenly spaced alonf the front bottom of craft.  The aft of the craft was very unusual as the plane headed due south I could make out aft it was very large and its mass shape was not cylinder but rather more like  2 tear drop shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever seen anything that I could not explain away.  I have never really bought into the whole UFO sighting.  I am still unsure of what I saw and would hope that it be easy explained away.  I doubt it.  I feel I am a person of good intuition and intellagent enough to know the differance from a plane, Chinook, gunship, jet, or blimp.  It was none of these.<n>

To our left, in front of us (not sure how far away) we saw two bright lights moving vertically then horizontally across our range of vision.  They moved very fast and manouevered very easily.  They could be horizontal one second and 90 degrees vertical in another split second.  We watched two of these for quite a while, then another couple joined in the games.  The whole sighting lasted for about ten minutes.  We have it all on our cellphone video and my son described what we were seeing, but when you view the video, you can&#39;t see the lights (of course).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reported this to my brother who is an OPP officer and he viewed the video.  He agreed that we must have seen something because of how excited my son was on the video.<n>

(At first I thought the object to be a shooting star, or crashing plane) It then shot back in the direction it came from (now upwards and to the left diagonal), however this time in a big spiral motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then changed direction completely, flying towards me and past me on the left-hand side, at very fast speeds.  It appeared to be flying at a distance of 200 yards away, and varying from 100-300 ft high.  It seemed to change speeds from very slow to very fast, and once it past me, it had blinking lights on the back (red blue and white).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object changed direction again, tracing its path to in front of me, and then flying along the horizon, where it split into two white lights.  The (seemingly) original light came back my way, while the ! new second light trailed off to the right and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the light was so far behind me, I could no longer track its flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I have seen some weird stuff in the past few years in our skies but nothing to this extreme.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on route 3 where the road is parrallel to 95 South. I saw this big white light in the sky. Now mind you, the sky was in overcast so you couldn&#39;t see one damn star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I saw this white light, it wasn&#39;t moving. It kinda just pulsed. So i slowed my car down to watch it. All of a sudden the white light disappeared, it went into a red and blue lighted sequence. Then it dropped straight down in the sky and shot over the highway directly OVER MY CAR. I started freaking out, so was my dog. My dog was out the window smelling the air making whining sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt this weird pull at the top of my head. It felt fuzzy. I was also on the phone, freaking out.... and i couldn&#39;t even speak. my mind just froze it seemed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft started to drift away but stream lined through the trees along side my car.. all the way into Charlestown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was a diamond shape, the lights of what I could see was only in the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel pretty crazy even reporting this because i don&#39;t believe in this shit, but i&#39;m telling you right now.... What they are doing is some sketchy shit. I have no idea what they did to my head, or why they chose to follow my car into Charlestown.

Around 10:30 my friend noticed a bizarre flashing in the sky to the northeast looking towards Willits, CA.  It appeared to emanate from the ground up.  She ran inside and got her partner to come witness it.  They watched for about 2 hours as the light pulsed and flashed rhythmically almost like a heart beat.  They called the radio station and their neighbors on the other side of the mountain (2 of them) were also witnessing it.  That night the sky was perfectly clear without a cloud in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Move forward 2 weeks to May 22,2011.  Another beautiful night without a cloud in the sky and my friend contacted me to say it was happening again at the same exact time 10:30.  I drove to the top of my mountain which is about 8 miles from her house and witnessed the same thing.  My neighbor was with me and also witnessed it.  Again from our vantage point it appeared to the NE.  The light pulsed and would flash and light up the Northeastern sky and appeared to be emanating from the same spot from the ground up.  The flashing is so large that after it pulses for a bit the flash lights up the sky.  I witnessed it for 45 minutes and when I went home it was still occurring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very next night on May 23, a different friend of mine contacted me to say that she and her brother were watching it again.  From their vantage point they could see the flashing lighting up the sky approximately every 3-4 minutes in which she described it like a heartbeat.  They watched for around 30 minutes before going home to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every time this has been witnessed it was a gorgeous, clear night without a cloud in sight.  It happens at the same time and in the same direction in a very sparsely populated area.  I tried to video it to no avail.<n>

Initially, it looked like a single, white light, an excessively bright light, in fact.  It’s hard to explain, but it was really, really bright  - WAY brighter than any other plane or star.  However, as it drew closer the white light seemed to separate into three smaller white lights in a perfect line with a red light hovering above it.  Presumably, this was the top of the craft as it seemed to be descending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The truly interesting thing about this craft was that it was incredibly low, perhaps even 500 feet or less above our heads.  It flew directly overhead and seemed to bank slightly before disappearing into the south - perhaps over Vallecito Reservoir.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed overhead and banked it became clear that this was a diamond-shaped craft.  Small lights lined all four sides, delineating the diamond shape and showing the outline of the craft.  From our vantage point we could see the underside of the thing which seemed to have four or five red lights (one at each corner and one in the center) and a series of three or four round white lights in the front and four slit-like lights toward the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly and took about thirty seconds to travel across the sky.  It made a low, rumbling roar, but did not resemble a plane in any other way.  I have no idea how large it was, but it seemed pretty big, at least as big as a jet, maybe bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour and one-half later another craft appeared from the same general area and traveled the same general path.  It seemed exactly the same: appearing as an extraordinarily bright single white light and then showing us the three white lights and single red light as it drew near.  As before it was very low.  Once again there were small, white lights around the perimeter, three or four white lights at the front and three slit-like lights in the back.  The only difference was that the five lights at the corners were green and not red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  This object was not on the same flight path as any of the planes that we had observed in the sky, and, most importantly, it was far, far lower.  I did a bit of research and discovered that there are nearby airports that could support a craft of that size.<n>

To the northwest we saw what appeared to be a star with a bluish light.  I joked and said, “Look, a space ship.”  My friend said it was just an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it carefully but it didn’t look like it was moving at all.  Then suddenly it moved horizontally very fast to the west.  It only went a short distance, then it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment  later, it moved  again horizontally to the east, this time not as fast, but a further distance.  I asked my friend if he had any binoculars.  He brought them out and we were able to see the lights were two identical blue circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The circles would vanish and be replaced by three bright white lights in a triangular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched through the binoculars the lights rose very quickly diagonally to the northwest.  The white lights went back to blue, but this time I saw three blue lights horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stayed in that position! for about a minute, then the lights turned to a vertical position and the three blue lights dropped straight down over the horizon.<n>

The color seemed to glow, changing from yellow orange to a reddish orange.  It was stationary at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my daughter to keep it in sight, while I went inside the house to get our binoculars.  We took turns looking through the binoculars, always keeping this glowing object in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5-6 minutes there was more reddish orange color and the object went straight down about 1/2&#34;.....(This measurement is the best I can come up with because I have no way of estimating distance.  Our viewing was from the West side of the city, looking West).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object continued to glow and remained in this position for about 5-6 minutes...then all of a sudden it projected left horizontally about another 1/2&#34; and remained in this position for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching, mesmerized and wondering just, &#34;what is it???&#34;  for about 30-35 minutes.  During this time its position changed several times from straight up or straight down, horizontal either left or right, until it went straight down below the horizon and we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued looking West for a few minutes, wondering if we&#39;d see it come &#39;up&#39; again, but it didn&#39;t.<n>

After a few shots, i noticed this red spot in the camera that looked like a red eye with a white dot of light in the middle.  I kept taking shots of the sun and each one taken had the red spot whit a dot in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each picture showed the spot in a different location around the sun.  Depending on how close the dot was to the sun determined how much red it had around it.  If it was far from the sun there was no red, just the dot of light.  If it was close to the sun there was a lot of red around the spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are a few pictures that I took of the sun behind the clouds, and in the ones where the sun is behind the clouds completely there is dot but you can see the dot and when the sun starts to come out from behind the cloud the dot of light is there and the red is slightly visible through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red pretty much stays consistent in shape, yet in a few pictures it looks as though it has a &#34;bump&#34; on the top, like the traditional UFO shape.<n>

It appeared to be a military aircraft (not a helicopter),- but it was not moving... at all. It&#39;s elevation was low enough to be descending to land.  I understand that only a rare marine aircraft can do that for a maximum of 90 seconds and then only when the wind is considerable.  There was no wind. This sighting, my first, was noteworthy mainly because the craft look like a photograph of an airplane in the sky.<n>

Then all of the sudden it seemed that the entire night sky just kinda lit up if you will, almost like a huge explosion had taken place but with no explosion.  The light just seemed to come from no where, just the sky was bright.  It was from the ground to the clouds and even the car we were traveling in lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all started to &#34;freak out&#34; started asking what the **** was that and just were in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it got a little crazier.  There was a &#34;craft&#34; of sorts?   It was hovering very close to the ground and just sat there.  I feel like this didn&#39;t happen but it did, I know it did, all 3 of us seen it.  It was nothing like I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served in the 101st airborne infantry division so I&#39;ve been around lots of military craft and have never seen anything like this.  It was long and flat and the freaky part was it had a green glow.  Like if you were to imagine an old carto! on and that person had like bio waste on him how they would make it glow green?  I don&#39;t know it was to weird to explain with words, but it was glowing green and sat there for around 5 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This worked us into a freak out of epic proportions we couldn&#39;t believe our eyes what the heck was this and just like that it like disappeared and left this outline of &#34;fire&#34; in the sky.   It looked like a child&#39;s drawing of a Christmas tree but orange to redish in color and then that just kinda just went away as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;craft&#34; moved so fast it was wild, almost like it &#34;hopped&#34; or somehow just went from one spot to another I don&#39;t want to use this word but &#34;teleported?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have any explanation of what we saw nor do either of my brothers and I can&#39;t explain it with words my mind just doesn&#39;t want to comprehend it but I do know we seen it.  My comments to the entire thing were &#34;If our military has a craft that can do that I feel sorry for the other countries.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother stated &#34;That was paranormal&#34; and my other brother said &#34;What ! the hell moves that fast and leaves fire tracers?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a crazy night/morning and I just wanted to see if anyone else has ever reported something similar because I kinda feel crazy!<n>

It was again a red flickering fireball type object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another 25 minutes later it came again but this time I brought my stepbrother out to see it and at first when I told him he thought it was a meteor or something but after he saw it he agreed it was not that ora plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no flashing lights that would indicate it being a plane and I could see no definate object. just the same red fireball moving in a straight line all three times.<n>

It moved around like a RC Helicoper (sort of wobbley).  Then my two brothers and a friend came out and they saw it as well and had the same opinion.  It kept moving down in the same part of the sky and then back up.  It would move to the west and then back to the same spot where it would raise and decend.  Then it just appeared in the sky high above were it decended and disappeared.  Then about midnight I was driving home with my brother and we both saw this thing moving back and forth changing shape.  It was over the ASU West parking lot at 43Ave and Thunderbird.  I was driving so I could only take side glances at it while driving.  It looked sort of like someone was flying a two cord kite that had a bright blue 400W light attached to it (if this was a hoax or someone who had a bizare hobbie of flying kits at night).  It seemed to change shape while it moved back and forth.  I ju! st wondered if anyone else saw this wierd blue light over ASU West?<n>

The lights were slightly smaller than the size of a full moon; they were white with a tinge of red and appeared as though a 747 was making a crash-landing in my yard. I yelled to a friend and ran out of the front door to look at the approaching lights.  I quickly realized that the two lights were two separate flying vehicles very close together; in fact, it appeared at one moment that they were going to touch but did not.  As I looked upward, I could see two distinct triangle shaped crafts flying just over the treetops perhaps 150-200 feet above the ground. They were moving about the speed of a person walking—they approached from the east and as I stood in my yard, the first triangle moved slightly toward me in a northward direction about 20 feet.  Both the vehicles had very bright whitish lights ! at the tips of each triangle that seemed to be moving in a searchlight motion.  When one of the craft was directly over my head, a beam of white light surrounded me as if it were daylight, yet a slightly different frequency of light, one that seemed like neither sunlight nor any type of headlight. From the vantage point I could see up into the triangle, appearing a bit like a pyramid shape, the points were evenly space; I think it is called an isosceles triangle. Between the bright lights on the tips were smaller round shaped lights perhaps 8-10 of them on each of the three lines of the triangle, I could notice shapes inside each of these lights. (I thought later that they might be telescopes) There was also a green and reddish light but I could not from this perspective see the direct source of the colors. At that moment, I believed I was witnessing something that was “Other-Worldly”. I felt no motion of air despite the closeness of the vehicles nor did I smell anything lik! e exhaust fumes. There was the sound of an engine, more like machinery , a very low frequency rumble, not very loud, yet I could feel the power.  The crafts continued the slow flight over the treetops and turned slightly south heading south, southwest out of sight.  My friend was now outside with me; she was also in disbelief and said that I seemed to be in the middle of the beam of light as it passed over me. The entire encounter lasted perhaps 80 seconds, yet it seems longer. I made an effort to be more observant, however, I was paralyzed with fear and astonishment; it was two days before I could get to sleep. I called my neighbor and the phone rang and rang and she ran into the house picked up the phone and said, &#34;Yes I saw the lights over your house!&#34;<n>

The sky was clear and the weather was mild and calm with absolutely no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon looking southwards I noticed a large object moving in the sky at an altitude of roughly 5,000ft.  It was arc shaped and appeared to be made up of individual spherical objects (really tough to say how many, but I would estimate at least 10) flying together in perfect formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was slightly smaller than a Boeing 737 aircraft, and had no lights on it.  The object crossed the sky in a SW to NW direction at a relatively quick pace maintaining the arc formation without changing shape.  It appeared to be moving slower than a traditional airplane.  The object had no lights and made absolutely no sounds as it passed overhead.  The moonlight reflected off of the object giving it a greyish appearance but it was difficult to make out any specific physical details of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 seconds after first spotting the object cross the sky it came to a complete stop but remained in the arc formation.  It hovered in place for around 2 seconds.  The objects then began to “swirl” around each other, taking on a more luminous white glow but were not brightly lit.  They “swirled” around each other in an apparently random pattern for about 3-5 seconds and then shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, there was no sound from the object at all. The total duration of the sighting lasted around 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first sighting I have ever seen in Southern Ontario.  I am from New Brunswick, Canada and have seen UFO’s there when I was very young but nothing has ever looked like what I saw on May 7th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I did not have my camera on me at the time to get a picture of this event.<n>

Missed the inital pilots report, but continued:  Pilot:  &#34;I am a hunter and I can tell you they looked like group of ducks- but ducks flying at 25.1 ?&#34; (25,100 feet AGL) &#34;It was pretty fast, whatever it was !&#34; &#34;I know this will sound wierd, but I&#39;ve seen jets flying out of Cold Lake(Alberta) and it did&#39;nt look like that&#34;  Pilots signal goes out of range and no longer heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nature of conversation in quotes is from my brief notes taken while driving and memory (8 minutes before writing this report). I have no doubt that the pilot&#39;s tone of voice was one of consern and wonder and he seemed very baffled about not being able to identifying a strange looking object formation that flew very quickly by him at slightly higher elevation. He announced he was at 24,000 feet just before I lost his signal. ATC could not identify it either, judging by pilot respones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This should not be difficult to research/confirm with Toronto Centre ATC. (133.300 Sector)  Mhz<n>

We were sitting around a fire in our backyard.  We seen two jets fly by going really fast.  We did not think anything of it until someone noticed something strange hovering over our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all turned in the direction of this object.  I was not the first to see this.  The person who did said after we all moved to get a better look it looked alot smaller.  It resembled a hot air ballon, but not right side up.  It looked sideways instead of up and down, left to right.  Its really hard to find the exact words to describe it.  It looked like a fire burning on the end of the object but inside.  Like a candle would flicker, I could see this at the small end of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really couldn&#39;t believe that this thing was right there in the sky.  It almost looked like a lantern like the outside of it, or the material it was made of was sheer.  Like I said you could see a flame or something flicker inside.  ! No sound was made.  It looked to be an off white color, then a reddish, last was an orange color. The colors were throughout the object at the same time.  It didnt change color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weirdest thing about all of it was when I tried to take a picture of it, my camera malfunctioned.  It took about seven tries to get a picture taken and by that time it was almost gone. All you can see is a red dot in the sky.  I will eventually try to have these magnified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also my camera low battery light started blinking when I tried to take the picture.  Later it stopped and still has the same batteries with no problems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am quite unsure about what good this report is going to do.  I feel very disturbed by what I have seen and I believe that no one will ever be able to explain what I saw.  I am scared that I will be laughed at or ridiculed if I speak to others about this.  I would love to learn more about what I have seen or talk to others.  I&#39;m sure you probably get alot of reports but I assure you that this account is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen shows before where people say they have seen things and I was never decided if it could be true or not.   Now I know how they must have felt.<n>

We first thought it was the moon but it was a weird orange color and abnormal looking.  The left side was a round darkened area and the right was glowing orange.  The lights throbbed, and then dipped down on the horizon to the left.  They then moved upwards again and got brighter before dipping back down again below the horizon.  We had no further sightings.<n>

I we were chatting outside, I was sort of looking north, when suddenly this object entered my field of vision, instantly i pointed it to my friends and we all saw it but my brother who thought i was joking.  It was a V-Shaped Triangle UFO formed of lights.  The Lights intensity could be compared to those of stars in the sky.  The object made no noise. It was very low in altitude, around 300-500 feet right above us. We saw this object around 3-5 seconds before it faded in the distance going north.  There was no clouds in the sky and the visibility was clear if it wasn&#39;t of the time of the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object couldn&#39;t had been birds, hang-glider, balloons, paratrooper, flares, chinese-lantern or any planes i know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object can&#39;t be from black projects because i have no idea what the US Army would be doing in Sherbrooke, Canada.<n>

At approximately 2:00 pm eastern standard time on 5/6/2011, I was in my back yard.  I looked up, and saw a black, triangular shaped object flying from south to north.  It was not a perfect triangle, as the rear part of the object sloped in toward the center, creating the appearance of wings.  The object was very similar in appearance to images I have seen of the B-1 bomber in silhouette.  There was some cloud cover, and the object remained visible as it passed beneath the clouds.  Its size appeared to be slightly larger than an average propeller driven airplane.  It was  completely silent, and moved at a rapid steady rate in a straight path until it passed out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One side seemed stretched.  It had a shimmering red grey light.  Had a tumbling pattern of movement but straight motions.  It changed directions in a fast movement unlike a plane.  Was about 500 hundred feet above ground.  If you had put a softball up to the windshield of my vehicle looking through the glass was the approximate size is the best way I can describe it.  I lost site of it above the tree line along side of the highway.  It was traveling East at the time.  Was very visible, and would be impossible for anyone driving on the highway at that time to not see this object also.<n>

Most of the objects he did not witness, at the time the photos were taken, but rather later, as he inspected the photos.  NUFORC has looked at all of the photos, and although we cannot identify all of the anomalous objects captured photographically, but most of the objects we believe are birds.  In most of those cases, we are even able to determine the type of bird involved, and its position in flight.  We believe that none of the photos is of a genuine UFO.  We, nevertheless, express our gratitude to the source for his having shared the information with our Center, who has had to use a computer at a public library, in order to submit the information to NUFORC!

I inititally only saw one because of a tree line so I thought it was just a satellite.  I took a few steps to the side and that&#39;s when I saw all three brillant white lights in a perfect triangle formation.  As I was looking due south, they were moving across the sky on a heading of about 030.  I wasn&#39;t sure what to make of it at first, one, I&#39;ve never seen three satellites in such a formation, two, I&#39;ve never seen a satellite so brillantly bright, let alone three in such a formation.  The lead point on the triangle stopped and the other two lights caught up and also stopped forming a perfect line.  They hovered there for about 30 seconds and then the lights went out completely.  About two seconds after that two, red, chevron shaped craft in near perfect formation entered heading approximately 220.  I was just letting my dog out, I own a C! anon 20D and 40D and obviously, that late at night, simply letting the dog out, I didn&#39;t have my camera on me.  I wish I could have gotten a picture for you.  In all my years in aviation I have never seen such a thing.  There was zero commercial, general aviation, or military aircraft around at the time, not a single port or starboard light, no anti-collision lights, just the event that occured.  The wind was light and variable at the time, visibility unlimited, and I did not hear any sound, the altitude they were at had to easily be above 40,000 feet (FL400).  I&#39;ve seen countless meteors, during the summer, my kids and I lay outside on the grass and watch.  Our favorite is the Perseids showers in August, these two red chevron shaped objects were not meteors.  We&#39;ve also seen the space shuttle begin its rentry into the atmosphere over California and Nevada, it was nothing like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After I noticed that it was flashing and diming, I retreived a bionoculars for a closer look.  It was a swirling ball of lime green that would flash red in the center, and then go dark, and occasionally the cirlce would be yellowish.  It stayed in the same place for two hours before I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The light was many times brighter than the stars in the background. The light was proceeding in a southeast direction and traveling very slowly.  As it came closer to me it appeared to become as bright as a city lit up in the heavens.  The object had a triangle shape to it with immense bright lights down each side of it.  This ufo was about 3000 to 4000 feet above me and slowly glided past me without making a sound. I could not gauge the deminsions of the craft but suspect that it may have been hundreds of feet long.  It went directly over my head and then. zip it was gone.  I am now a firm believer in ufo&#39;s.<n>

I previously reported the other sighting on March, 19th, 2011. Below is my latest sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside my home to take out the trash around 9:45 PM (CST).  I was walking down the driveway and looking up at the night sky again around 9:45/50.  As I went back up toward the garage I noticed the sound of several passing commercial jets traveling from east to west just south of my location.  As I looked up at the louder of the two passing jets, a bright light came into my field of view from behind my head. (I was looking up facing east-southeast, looking off and up to my right.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was another jet with some really bright landing lights on, but there was no sound and no blinking or flashing lights.  The light appeared round, about the size and brightness of Venus as my previous sighting, but this time it did NOT slowly pulsate.  Instead, it gradually faded completely out, leaving only a tiny dark red sphere (about 1/10 the size of the original bright bluish-white light with an even smaller dark green light beyond the red light.  It was as if the rear b! right light source went out and you could briefly see the middle much smaller dark red light with the equally small dark green light at what would be the front or end of the object.  Now, I am calling these “lights”, but the tiny red and green spheres have more of a reflected metallic look to them.  They did not flash or blink.  This view of this object was quickly obscured by some of the very tall pine trees on my property and I lost sight of the tiny red and green light spheres after only a few seconds.  It appeared that all these “lights” were part of one single object which would have been either round, discoid, or cylindrical in shape.  Also, the size of the tiny red and green lights was about the same size as a passing satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, there was no sound, so I suspect it was at a very great altitude. Could this be something we have in orbit? Do you know if there are any NEW conventional aircraft lights that would behave in this manner? Also, this object was moving very fast, so my view was not very long. The speed was similar to my last sighting in March. There was no exhaust, flame, or contrail visible. I am also sending you a drawing of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looks like we are starting to see these objects more frequently over the greater Houston/Tomball/Hockley, Texas area. Keep looking up! Keep reporting!<n>

It was at dusk, the sun had set below the horizon for only a minute or two. The sky and clouds were still somewhat illuminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the west, near where the sun had just set, I witnessed a stationary, hovering, illuminated, white oval shape. It appeared as if the entire shape was illuminated evenly. From my observation, it did not appear to be reflecting sunlight, because the sun had already set, and the object appeared to be in Earth&#39;s shadow. At the time, the object was the brightest thing in the sky. Although the moon was not visible for comparison, I would estimate the object to be about 1/3 of the full moon&#39;s size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared as a white oval. It may have been a lenticular shape seen on edge (like a white Mentos candy), but I could discern no 3D shape to it. It did have a clean edge. The object was also perfectly symmetrical, with no bumps or irregularities in the shape. I observed it for approximately 15-20 seconds, all the while using my powers of logic and reasoning to determine what I was looking at, but was unable to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the object began to disappear. It did not shrink in size, recede, blur, or blink out. Instead, it appeared to become gradually more and more transparent (evenly, while retaining its clean edge) until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though I am not trained in aerial observation, I am reasonably intelligent. In my opinion, what I witnessed was not any sort of cloud, celestial body, or other natural phenomena. Nor was it any type of man-made aircraft that I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other, more subjective notes:  I was outside shooting a firearm at the time of the sighting. I was shooting at a target to the north.  A thought entered my head, something along the lines of, &amp;quot;What if you saw a UFO right now?&amp;quot;, then I looked to my left, and there one was. I feel as though I was somehow compelled to look in the direction of the object, and perhaps it had something to do with the fact that I was firing a gun.  This is purely speculative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I thought about the fact that I was in the town of Ovalo, Texas.  Ovalo means oval in Spanish.  What I saw would definitely be described as an oval.  Not sure what the connection is there, if any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Got up and looked and saw a UFO.  Round or oval in shape with lights that seemed to rotate the object or go back and forth on it.  I have seen three of them together over the skys of Port St. Lucie.  At times I saw beams or a dot of light that would shoot out from the craft and shoot back to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided this was not a plane, planes are not stationary like these were, this was not a Harrier either. The next time I saw it I decided I would try and get a picture of something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I did and the photos showed lights colored lights but one photo had what I thought to be two beings on it.  One whitish blueish in the upper left corner of the photo and the other to the right and top of my flash reflection in the photo since I was taking it through a window on my patio.  The clearer of the two is greenish, has horns and like a collar of sorts but ! he looked to have a mustache.  Some friends I have shown the photo saw the being too,some could not.  On another occasion I saw same shaped ufo with lights hovering with a white light beam going straight down to the ground from it it was there for quite a while I was watching but then fear gripped me and I stopped watching.  I have not really talked about this due to the craziness of it. I also tend to here a sound of something hovering it is very distinct like a frequency of some kind.<n>

I am going to try to get a neighbor outside if i can or maybe even contact the police to come look at it.

The craft was an extremely bright orange at the center, with a strobe light on both the right and left sides.  It moved along at a slow pace as it crossed the sky from one side of the horizon, to directly over me, then onto the hill.  As the craft was moving from left to right in the sky slowly and passed, I saw a commercial airliner going from right to left, which explains the dull hum of the airplane engine I heard (sorry about not knowing the cardinal directions from my location).  The aircraft was so bright that it was almost hard to look at, but the orange glow didn&#39;t appear to be fluctuating, but a solid orange mass.  The sky was extremely clear, so the objects were very visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Might of also observed one or two very feint red craft which one craft may of intersected with the main UFO.  As with first sighting commercial aircraft may of been diverted from regular flight patterns when taking off from SFO.<n>

I looked up among the stars and one of them caught my eye because it slowly started getting brighter.  Then I noticed it was moving slowly.  It got as bright as the brightest star in the sky and then slowly started dimming back down.  I noticed the movement was not consistent in direction or speed.  It seemed to slow down and speed up slightly, and it seemed to drift as if not on a straight course.  It got very dim and then eventually faded out of sight.  At times I have thought that maybe it is a satellite or the ISS that is casting an inconsistent reflection from the sun due to its angle, but that is just me speculating.  I see planes in the sky at night often, but their running lights are very easy to spot, and their speed and direction are consistent, unlike this object.  This is also the first time I&#39;ve ever made this kind of report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was talking to a friend on my phone when I noticed in the dark bluish skies a stationary changing light.  It was quite familiar to me, because over the past couple of years family members and I have seen these lights.  But, the difference this time was that these lights were much closer than previous sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly ended my phone conversation and ran inside to tell my Father and grab my new camera (Canon Powershot ELPH 300 HS) that I had purchased about a week previous.  Both of us went to the back porch overlooking the Great Salt Lake and Antelope Island.  I attempted to take a still picture of the object, but was unable to capture anything visible.  Not having used my video feature yet, I tried recording a video which I did with much better success.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recorded six segments of video on my camera from lengths of about 1:30 to 8:00 minutes long.  We both made observations on the closeness of the object (approximately 75 miles from our location).  Because of the closeness of the object we could see a better view of the rotating lights and movement  of the craft from previous sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see the distinct rotation of the craft that made it look like a tumbling Rubix&#39;s cube.  It seemed to stay stationary in the night sky.  If there was movement it was slight and westward.  The lights on the object changed frequently between reds, blues, oranges and greens.  It looked as though it was moving in a Disco light fashion, very fast and very rapid.  Occasionally the middle of the object would pulsate into a black circle and then retract.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this object for approximately 25 minutes until the light got more and more faint into the night sky.  We couldn&#39;t determine if the object was moving westward over the Great Salt Lake or Dugway Testing Center.  But, there were no sudden movements or set orbit during those 25 minutes.  We couldn&#39;t imagine this was an aircraft even though the Salt Lake International Airport and Hill Air Force base are nearby.  We ruled out a planet, because of the tumbling rotation and brilliant lights.  It could easily be a drone observing something, possibly towards the Dugway Testing Center?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was we have been seeing this object over the west skies of the Great Salt Lake and Dugway Testing Center the past couple of years.  Nothing as close as we saw on the night of May 4, 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love any logical explanation.<n>

I have seen this on three ocassions to date. It moves very steady and does not waver in its direction.  I would estemate a hight of about 5 to 10 thousand feet.  I have only seen this at night about 9:30 pm.  It&#39;s heading was NW by E to SE .<n>

May 5th 2011 5:30pm  I was outside putting a brick walkpath in the front of my parents house, and I heard a very strange airplane flying, I looked up and there was a japanese zero (had the rising sun symbol on both wings) flying directly above my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking at this plane, I noticed a strange white or silver object in the sky alot higher, and behind the plane.  The object looked like it was leaking water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I raced in the house to get my camera (sony dcr-trv140 digital 8mm) and my mom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on the camera and focused on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting sunlight very well indicating it was very reflective.  It was possibly round or sphere shaped and possibly spinning, but I cannot confirm this because the sunlight made it look like it was changing shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was zoomed in on the object to 20x optical, and could clearly see what appeared to be a vapor, or steam, or something leaking out of the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I could imagine it being is a weather balloon, and the leaking portion just an illusion, quite possibly a long tether?  I recorded as much of the event as I could but my lens fogged up badly due to my sweating face, and could no longer see the object with my eyes.  I have about 5 minutes of high frame rate video of the object, in digital 8mm format.<n>

It was extremely clear last night. I always watch for satellites.  It&#39;s a fun thing I like to do. I noticed a satellite coming from roughly north north west moving south south east.  As it was coming by I noticed another going the opposite direction.  This is when it got weird.  The second satellite slowed down, I could actually see it swoop around and tail the other back.  Then both satellites stopped mid air at stand off distances from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up my girlfriend after I found out my camera will not take night video or photo.  I thouhgt it may be helicopters but I could hear no rotor chop and a helicopter at the altitude they appeared to be at??  I don&#39;t think so.  Also Harrier jets cannot hover very long before there engines overheat.  Very strange.  Even more strange is the one further north didn&#39;t move hardly at all after it stopped but the one further south kept on swooping around and stopping and hovering, like it was taunting the other.  Finally I had to go to bed but this went on for an hour before I went inside.  I assume it kept going on after I went in.  Frickin weird.  Do you guys have an idea what we seen in the sky last night??<n>

As soon as I opened the door, I noticed three orange dots in the sky in a triangle formation.  Initially, they did not flicker, but all three were moving together horizontally across the sky neither raising nor falling.  They were at about a 40 degree angle off the horizon.  They traveled steadily for a few seconds and I could tell immediately that they were nothing I&#39;d ever seen before so I called my wife to come look.  As she stood and watched, I ran to get my camcorder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as soon as I got back, the three lights began to flicker and fade.  I turned on the camera and began to record but by that point, two of the lights had gone out and the third was so dim, it could not be picked up by the camera.  I set the camera down and went outside to put the garbage on the street, that&#39;s when I ran into my two neighbors.  I asked if they had seen any orange lights in the sky and their expressions lit up and they told me that they had seen a triangle of orange lights rotating in a circular pattern just a few minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally did not see the rotation but clearly, I didn&#39;t get there until the end.  Over the next few nights, I have gone outside looking for the lights at the same time of night but haven&#39;t seen them since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Approximately 150 feet up above the rooftops flying southeast I watched it for ten seconds before it flew beyond my field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had no loss of altitude, and made no sound whatsoever.   The craft was totally silent, with no lights.  Appeared to be a dark blue or black chevron shape, like the top of a triangle with no base, with yellow painted circles under each &#34;wing.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not discern any texture to the bottom as it flew by; it was seemingly flat and smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also did not see anything on top of the craft - there were no ducts that I could see at the back of the craft for propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were a cloudless sky and it was a new moon! night.

It wasn’t flashing, and you could tell it was very high up in the sky.  It glided across the sky, and there was no sound like the usual sound you hear when an airplane goes by. It glided, and yet you could tell that it was not anything like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the light, since I thought that it looked very interesting. I watched it for about a minute, and then it just disappeared! It completely disappeared!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes after that, an airplane landed at Burbank Airport, then a minute later another airplane landed. After about 20 minutes, a total of 15 airplanes landed at Burbank airport.

Another 3 airplanes landed, and then high above my head, really, really high up I noticed a stationary star th! at seemed to get brighter.  I watched the &#34;star&#34; until I noticed that it too was moving and at a very fast rate.  It went halfway across the sky, until it completely disappeared.<n>

A few minutes later we were on the highway driving west. I was in the passenger seat and looked out the side window at the buildings and houses spanning the side of the small valley.  That’s when I saw a small white but translucent oval or spherical object in the sky.  As I looked at it a little bit longer an orange flicker began to appear and get bigger inside of the object, which I first took as a fire, but then realized as I watched that it was not burning and looked more like sequenced flashing lights. As I was watching the object, I was describing it to my mother, who was unable to witness it because she was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights were flickering or flashing, the shape became more apparent and looked a bit like this: The bottom appeared to be rounded, but fatter than the top, kind of like an egg. There was a horizontal line that looked like it opened to the inside, in the sense that the lights looked brighter there, in that bar it was pure dark fire orange and black. Above and below that horizontal bar or line the color looked different, it was obscured and looked as it does when someone holds a piece of plain white printer paper close enough to a flame that it blocks the view of the flame, but you can still see the color and flickering through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I was thinking that maybe it was a project or something that someone was doing, floating a small paper object using a candle to make hot air and all that and I was asking my mom if that was possible. After a few seconds of discussing that with my mom, I observed something that erased all doubt in my mind and confirmed to me that this was indeed a UFO. What I observed was the object suddenly jetted westward a short distance, then jetted eastward, stopped and wobbled for maybe a second at the most and then jetted north and upwards so fast that I completely lost sight within a second. I continued to exclaim to my mom what had happened as I opened my window to see if I could hear anything. I heard nothing but our car on the road, surely if this was an airplane it would have made some sort of noise going that fast, but there was none, and if there was it was quiet. This all happened in an approximate time length of 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was heading east, but looking north at the light fog over the pond caused by the unusually cold May temperatures.  Suddenly, a round extremely bright white light darted above the pond just above the tree tops going at a speed equivalent to that of a car on the highway.  I witnessed it travel north approximatley 250-300 feet.  Relative to a star, it was about the same size.  But since it appeared so close to the ground, I would estimate it was about the size of a fist.  It appeared the object was flying level, neither gaining nor losing altitude.  By the time it reached just past the end of the pond, the light abruptly disappeared.<n>

It did this several times.  It did not have the same type of motion as a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another one similar to it to the right of the original light (quite far off from the first one) doing the same things.  I watched both lights for about 15 minutes and they were still there when I went into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife came and looked at them both too and noted the same things I did.

5/2/11 21:30|Santa Monica|CA|Formation|40 minutes|Mulitple successive nighttime formations of round unlit objects in V formations at speed.|5/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81094.html|306|ndxe201105| Mulitple successive nighttime formations of round unlit objects in V formations at speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returning home at around 9:30 P.M., I unlocked the door to the open deck which leads to my (top) 2nd floor apartment.  The deck provides a generous view of the sky, and my gaze was momentarily drawn toward several aircraft transiting nearby.  As we are within 2 miles of the local airport, this is not an unusual occurrence.  What was unusual was then noticing what at first appeared to be a V formation (the point toward direction of travel) of balloons flying rapidly over my apartment and disappearing beyond the roof-line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were round or oblong objects, silent, non-illuminated, but visible because their somewhat matte surfaces reflected ground light.  They appeared to be at an elevation of anywhere from 800 to 6000 feet - difficult to judge in the dark night sky, but even at the lower elevation extreme would have been traveling at a velocity considerably in excess of balloons, birds, or even private aircraft.  Of course as there were between 12-14 round, discreet objects in this formation, they were clearly not planes and obviously not birds.  Passing overhead, the formation was about the size of 4 fingers held at arms length, flying West to East (from the ocean to inland) and they were visible for about 8-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first spotted at about 60 degrees above the horizon, they appeared to be a rigid, single, solid object with dim evenly-spaced lights defining a 90 degree angle V, but as they came toward my location I realized they were individual objects, some of which suddenly seemed almost to cavort with one another while still maintaining a loose V formation, though at an overall constant velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly moved to a more unobstructed area of my deck, and was rewarded several minutes later by another formation flying in the same West to East corridor over my home.  Several more minutes and a third formation.  There was no wind at ground level, so I thought if these are balloons then the jet stream must be mighty low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the fourth formation, each one of which varied in total size from approximately 9 to 15 objects, the flight path was no longer overhead and was now Northwest to Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another 5-8 minutes, and a Southeast to Northwest formation.  I realized then that these could not be balloons as they were flying in opposite directions and at quite a good clip.  A sixth formation, now after 10 P.M., flew exactly South to North.  Some of these had maintained a fairly fixed, evenly spaced ninety degree formation, while others exhibited the peculiar pooling and scattering behavior as they transited in a looser formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusion: it was a busy night overhead.   What I saw eludes a conventional explanation i.e. birds, balloons, private or commercial aircraft, known military aircraft - hence this report.  I don&#39;t therefore assume these to be of extraterrestrial provenance, although that remains one possibility. Secret military aircraft?  Possible - but that would be a lot of secret aircraft to throw at one relatively small section of sky in such a short period of time over a densely populated area.  Not likely.  And not likely I&#39;ll ever find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I&#39;m going to bed.<n>

Going approx. east to west, started 80 deg from horizon.  I saw object as a bright star at first, it then changed to a red star, then to a black sphere in the span of about 15 seconds.  I have witnessed this object multiple times in the past, so i was prepared and grabbed my camera from my desk.  Just seconds later i was outside my front door with the camera, at this point it was almost directly above me.  Again it appered as a white star but changed red, then a few more times from white to red, but not always a complete change sometimes only half way. I do take pictures as it slowly floats over my house.  I go to my backyard to get a better view and it now apperars much higher/smaller and is now just a white dot in the sky, and it is now almost stationary. I observe it for another 10 min, then it slowly faded away, i tried to take more pics but was largely unsuccessful.  It is very difficult to see with the naked eye! so its twice as hard to get on my cameras view finder (cannon 10x optical zoom digital camera).   I do my best and snap pictures anyways most of the time i see this thing, most dont come out and the ones that do usually just show a white or red dot in the sky.   Needless to say disappointing, however this time two of the pictures came out with some good detail if zoomed in.  When i witnessed the object i didnt see the detail that shows in the picture.  I think its because the pictures were shot when the object was changing colors, and in real time it happens almost instantly and the change is self is not really visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> p.s. I just found out as i was typing this report that Usama bin laden is dead at the hand of US forces. An interesting day for sure<n>
5/1/11 12:00|Schaumburg|IL|Sphere|15 seconds|Three small spheres come together to create the shape of a triangle|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84902.html|316|ndxe201105| Three small spheres come together to create the shape of a triangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my lunch break at school (The Illinois Institute of Art, Schaumburg) on a clear sunny summer day at the schools parking lot I witnessed three white spheres appear out of thin air, move around each other and then form a triangular shape in the sky.  I was in my car with my door open eating lunch when I witnessed this.  I was looking up at the clear blue sky watching some airplanes fly by in the very far away distance when I saw these spheres appear out of nowhere.  It’s almost as if they appeared just for me, and I say that because they appeared in the exact area that my line of sight was at the entire time I was looking at the sky. After they appeared in the sky they &#34;danced&#34; around each other and then finished off with a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After these spheres made that triangular formation in the sky I thought that they would be visible for a bit longer so I tried to take out my cellphone and try to get some video footage of the spheres; but as I was reaching in my pocket to pull out my cellphone I saw them disappear into thin air the same way they had appeared.  I also believe that the mood that I was in might have played a factor in their appearance.  I was in a peaceful mood with a clear head, meaning that I did not have many if hardly any thoughts going through my mind at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

5/1/11 03:00|Destin (near)|FL|Cigar|10min.|What i saw was not of any thing made by human hands as we know them.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84904.html|317|ndxe201105| What i saw was not of any thing made by human hands as we know them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about 6/2011 around 2:30 to 3amC.S.T. i was traveling east bound on u.s.hwy 98 when i looked to my left across the west bound lane into the woods and noticed green light emulating from the woods, the first thing i thought was what is a shrimp boat doing in the woods because of the green lights. I looked for the next place i could do a 180 to have a closer look.as i got closer i could tell that the lights were round.I parked my truck on the side of the hwy. and there was about a 3 foot embankment i walked down to get a closer look. My ex wife got out of the truck but stayed next to it.  As i walked down the small embankment and got closer approx.40 yards i stopped and noticed five lights a little smaller than swimming pool lights emitting a light green light.there was approx.3 to 4 feet of space in between the lights that was totally blacked out,also about 3to 5 feet above the first green light closest to me was a 6th light that was more intense and emitting! a bright orange color as i took another step or two closer,the orange light got brighter at the same time my ex told me not to get to close,it was almost as if the orange light was warning me not to approach any closer so i stopped in my tracks and just stared at this craft,something made me look up into the trees above the craft and i will attempt to explain what i saw.What looked to me like thousands of darker green laser lights were shining like laser lights thru every open space between pine needles and oak leaves and as God is my wittness in the dark green laser beam lights going up these lights rather slowly were what appeared to be minute bubbles or tiny metal flakes going up,not down in these laser like beams,as i looked back at the five round lights i noticed that the black out between the lights was so blacked out that you could see that it was blocking out the trees behind it only up to the height of the lights and that if the craft had turned all it&#39;s lights of! f it would have been next to impossible to know it was there e! xcept fo r the fact that it blocked out the shape of the trees up to 5 or 6 feet above the ground,i took 1 step closer to get a better look and the orange light jumped up another notch in intensity so i went back to my truck to see if i could flag some one down and there was no traffic.What i would have given to have had a camcorder that night.Ive often wondered what would have happened if i would have stayed until the sun came up.Would it have taken off or would it have simply slowly disapeared as the sun came up.<n>

5/1/11 00:55|Pocatello|ID|Light|three minutes|I saw several bright red lights in the WNW sky that didn't blink and faded in less than three minutes from the time I first spotted the|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81066.html|319|ndxe201105| I saw several bright red lights in the WNW sky that didn&#39;t blink and faded in less than three minutes from the time I first spotted the<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 12:55 A.M. I looked at the sky in the WNW and saw what looked to be a bright constellation similar to the big dipper, but it was in the wrong part of the sky to be the big dipper.  The lights were about twice as bright as most of the stars in the sky and they has a definite red tint and didn&#39;t blink.  They seemed to be moving slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house to get my camera and turned out the porch light (that took about two minutes) when I came out to look again most of the lights had dissipated.  The one or two that was left faded in about a minute.  There is very little air traffic in this area, I know they weren&#39;t planes.<n>

I saw many lights rotating in a tight circular formation.  The circles kept getting wider and wider.  I contacted my son in his bedroom to look. At first he said it was a light.  To which I said there was not a significant degradation in light pattern as it spread wider. There was zero sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
