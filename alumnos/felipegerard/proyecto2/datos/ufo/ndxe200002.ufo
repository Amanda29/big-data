It appeared to be close like seeing an airplane with its shape just barely visible.  Then the UFO&#39;s shape started to fade where only the light was visible.  Once it got further away, it started to run parallel across the mountains.  It continued to run parallel to the mountains until we could no longer see it.<n>

The one i see on and off throughout the years usually dissapears towards the west as soon or tight after i notice it. I tried to drive towards it about 3 years ago, but i could never get close to it. they usually don&#39;t show up until about 10 pm(when it gets dark) and just sit in the sky with no sound. i can see the switching lights around it with the binoculars, but not with the bare eye.<n>

She advised that the light was very big. It was green in color sphearical in shape was only visible for a short while then disappeared.  The weather conditions in the area were cold and windy the sky was clear but 25 miles north it was snowing. I asked officers out on patrol if they saw anything they advised negative.

2/29/00 13:35|Hawaii's Volcano National Park|HI|Sphere|50 min.|Bright metallic spheres that split into to smaller spheres and hovered for 50 minutes......|4/1/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12412.html|6|ndxe200002| Bright metallic spheres that split into to smaller spheres and hovered for 50 minutes......<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aloha from the Big Island of Hawaii, I would like to share a series of sightings what I believe to be UFOs or advanced life form spacecraft, firstly I am your average man with a open mind, of sound mind and body, and I have nothing to gain from my observations other than to share what I saw with all people who are enterested, I was staying with my very close friends, my Hawaiian family, at there house which is adjacent to Hawaii&#39;s Volcano National Park, 19.5 Deg. Latitude, on the Island of Hawaii, my friend had been telling me for some years that he had spotted a metallic sphere that hovered at a fairly high altitude over his house, I hoped that I too may be lucky enough to see this object, On Feb. 28 2000 we where looking up at the stars at about 9.45 p.m. that evening when I spotted what looked like a flash bulb going off, we continued to watch , after a few minutes there was another flash in the same basic location, this continued with several more flashes until we saw no more, the next day on Feb.29 at  1:35 p.m.  HST my friend had awaken from a nap and walked outside, he said a little voice in his head said &#34;look up&#34; and there it was, he yelled for me and I ran outside and it was straight up in the sky, the object was a round sphere shape which was very bright and reflective,emitting no sound, and hovering at a altitude of roughly 30 t0 35,000 feet, it&#39;s size was comparable to a jet liner, easy to spot with the naked eye, so we quickly grabbed two pairs of binoculars and laid flat on our backs and focused in on it, we watched the craft for close to 40 minutes, with the field glasses we could see the object very clearly as it moved ever so slightly from side to side, the suns reflection would move from left to right on its metallic surface as it hovered side to side, at this point we had my friends wife and mother in law watching with us, they to confirmed it was not a balloon, aircraft, or a satellite, this thing hovered, then while we were watching this thing with the field glasses it looked like! it expl oded for an instance, a fairly large vapor like cloud engulfed the craft, a perfectly round cloud, and you could see two smaller round spheres emerging from its center, two craft where now visible, they too where metallic and round and exactly one half the size of the original object, as the two craft split apart they to hovered and separated more, we continued to watch them for 5 to 10 minutes longer until they made there slow ascent into the sky, we watched them move indepentitally upward until they were out of sight, what a buzz!!!!!. The next day we rounded up a telescope and watched for the next few days, with no sightings in the day, but observed the Flashes in the night sky most every night and in different locations, some flashes where very bright, in random locations, we spotted satellites and these were totally different. Then on March 5 Th. at about 8:30 p.m. HST I was looking at the moon through the telescope and had my friends son was with me, he is 7 yrs Old, I had him standing on a tree stump so he could look into the telescope, I was holding him while he looked, as he was looking I looked up and saw a very bright light in the sky above the house, I thought what star is this, then it moved slightly, I quickly moved the boy from the telescope and asked him if he saw the light, he responded, &#34; YES UNCLE &#34; we quickly moved to a better position to view it, the light was like a headlight shinning down, then it started to move away, flying a squirrelly type flight path away, again not a sound coming from it. Then on Feb. 14 Th. At about 11:30 p.m. my Hawaiian mom came up and got me, I was packing my suitcase, we went outside only to view another bright object move across the sky, with more flashes, in the 5 weeks I was on the Island we viewed  flashes in the night sky, from random locations, there is no airports close to where we  where, or any flights at night at all, no air bases or anything of that nature, this brings me to one last sighting we had in July or Aug of 96 on the Big Island with my wife, my same friend and his wife and the same little boy, only 3 yrs old then, we were returning to H.V.N.P. from Kona after a day of fishing and it was dark about 8:00 p.m. HST, we were just before the turn off for Southpoint on the main HWY. When my friend says &#34; LOOK &#34; out the right side of the car coming in over the ocean we see a flat disk shape object with a small half round dome in the center top of it with rounded edges front and back of the disk part, it was coming in over the ocean at a very low rate of speed, what you would expect to see if it was a jet coming in on a landing lets say, and its angle of decent was nearly parallel to the land, it was trailing a beautiful day glow green color, a meteorite would be very fast and most likely a steep decent, this was not, as it passed by us it flew into the side of Mauna Loa,  just behind the town of Na&#39;alehu, upon impact it  emitted a large bright flash of white light, and  no sound, we continued home and ! slept th e night. The next day we made some calls to the local police, they heard of nothing, the newspaper, nothing, we call the observatory at Mauna Kea, nothing, we drove back to the town of Na&#39;alehu and asked the locals, they heard and saw nothing, there was a fire burning up in the hills that had started that night and a fairly large fresh burned grass fire next to the road, we looked around the area for awhile for wreckage but found none, had the men in black already been there!!!! . If you have had a sighting similar to what we saw either in Hawaii or elsewhere, please post it in this site.<n>

On the night of Monday Feb. 28, 2000 at approximately 9:30 pm we were called by two of our members.  They had spotted a strange light hovering over some turf fields next to the Chario High School.  We called a friend and the three of us headed for the area of the sighting.  Upon arriving, we spotted the light hovering above the submarine base at Groton,CT. The light was very bright and unchanging.  The light then moved up and down.  It then bounced to the left and bounced back to the right.  The base at Groton, CT is a nuclear submarine base.  We watched it for approximately 5 minutes then it faded and disappeared.<n>

It stayed bright for two minutes then faded in about 30 seconds. It then changed to red and green flashing lights. A plane came into view and got closer to the object. The object then rapidly accended. It then started moving diagonally upwards south east. It then stopped and began travelling vertically south east. As it reached the middle of the sky we noticed the object was saucer shapped and the lights were flashing alternately circular around the rim off the object. Shortly after the sighting of the shape it disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother, a friend and I were arranging to meet two other friends in our village and so left our house at 8pm to meet them. We were walking down our round when i noticed a blinding bright yellow light in the sky, and it was much larger than any stars by a long way. So we stayed and watched it wondering what it could be. As it was not moving we assumed it may be a satellite reflecting the suns rays from space. After two minues the light faded completely and was now a set of green and red lights flahing alternately. We then noticed a plane coming towards the object. When the plane became closer to the object, the object rapidly accended upwards at an incredible speed. By now our two other friends had joined us and they too saw the object at this point. The object then accended diagonally upwards in the direction of south east. After 20 seconds of this diagonal accention the object began travelling horizontally at the height it had now reached. As it rapidly crossed the sky we had a clearer view of the object and it was saucer shaped and of dark grey colouring. We also noticed that the green and red flashing lights were totating in circular fashion around the rim of the object.The object was also enourmous compared to any other aircraft i had seen. Shortly after we noticed this about the object it disappeared from our view. This was now 8.11pm.<n>

The objects either had orange lights on them, or were orange and glowed.  They were too far away, and moved too fast to be certain. The &#34;lights&#34; weren&#39;t as sharp, or distiguishable as other airplanes in the sky at that time.  They were definately round and clearly visible, but not bright, it seemed.  They were clearly unlike any of the other aircraft or stars in the sky.  They flew in formation: if you were to number them 1-5, top to bottom, you would see 1, 2, 3, and 5 in a diagonal line, spaced evenly apart, and 4 just offset, inbetween 3 and 5 and off to the left.  They retained this formation as they flew from the south west to the north east at incredible speeds.  I witnessed the objects for about 3 seconds, while they sped out of sight.  For the record, I have never seen anything like this before; it was the most incredible thing I have ever been witness to.<n>
2/28/00 14:00|Olancha|CA|Sphere|5 min.|from my vehicle, I spotted dozens of small silverey spheres high above the mountains in a group that looked like birds, or how bats fly|3/7/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12221.html|10|ndxe200002| from my vehicle, I spotted dozens of small silverey spheres high above the mountains in a group that looked like birds, or how bats fly in groups and turn in and out as a group. They would disappear and appear, as the flock would turn, like one side was silverey and the other dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> while driving on Highway 395, northbound, around the town of olancha, ca. south of Bishop, Ca. in the eastern sierra mts., I spotted from the passenger side of the vehicle what i thought was a flock of birds above the mountains to the east of the Highway. They were turning back and forth in the same location in the sky not going any direction. They would appear and dissappear as they turned and my reasoning was one side of the birds must be silver and the other side dark. They would dissappear in a wave motion and as I looked harder for them I couldn&#39;t see any sign of a one. Then they would appear in a wave motion and be in a flock pattern. I was thinking that I was seeing some native birds that live in the mountains, since i live in the L.A. area and wouldn&#39;t see this type of bird there. But as they appeared again, I&#39;ll be darned if the flock started to make a big circle, with other birds staying in the flock. Then the circle broke up and they started making horizontal lines , 2 or 3 at a time and at different levels in the flock and still staying in the same area above the mountains. The driver also saw this and stated that &#39;&#39; that&#39;s pretty strange&#39;&#39;. As we drove into the beginning of the town of Olancha, I spotted a couple standing in a lot off the hwy. looking at the same flock and pointing towards them, so I felt better that someone else had noticed the same thing. The flock continued this movements untill we drove northbound and couldn&#39;t see from the cab of the venicle the flock anymore.<n>

One bright light and 4 smaller and less bright lights. The lights were in a &#34;V&#34; shape equadistant from each other with the bright light at the point of the &#34;V&#34;. The lights were moving together at the same speed. As I watched the lights moved north at a slow rate of speed and the &#34;V&#34; seemed to stand on one &#34;wing&#34; as the lights turned east from the former northern heading. As I watched all lights moved together and kept the same relative spacing. The lights were fairly low in the sky and if connected would have outlined a fairly large craft. I would estimate several hundred feet per side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5 lights in a &#34;V&#34; formation (appx 90degrees), one bright light at the point of the &#34;V&#34; and 2 smaller less bright lights on either side. The lights were low on the horizon and were moving slowly in a northerly direction, then turned and began to move in an easterly direction. In executing the turn it was as if the lights were connected as the lights seemed to execute a steep bank to the right with the &#34;V&#34; seeming to stand on one leg as an airplane would to make a sharp turn. The lights did not change speed as they turned. The lights were white and round. The distance to the lights I would estimate at a maximum of one mile The size of the &#34;V&#34; I would estimate to be several hundred feet per leg. I could not see any connection between the lights. There was no sound associated with the sighting<n>
2/27/00 23:00|Portland|OR|Unknown|3 minutes|Four bright lights with blinking light in the middle seen over Cornilius Pass|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38098.html|13|ndxe200002| Four bright lights with blinking light in the middle seen over Cornilius Pass<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this strange thing over 4 years ago, but I didn&#39;t tell anyone until just recently about what I saw.  I am a 50 year old woman and didn&#39;t want my family to think I was crazy.  It wasn&#39;t until I mentioned it to someone I know about my experience that they told me that they also had seen a UFO in the same area.  This is what happen to me.  I was driving home over Cornilius Pass in Portland heading to my home in Scappoose, Or.  I had been over at my parents home in Portland.  As I neared Cornilius Pass just before a corner I saw 4 large lights in each corner of this object with a blinking red light in the middle, hanging above the Pine trees.  There was no noice even though I was with in 150 feet of it.  The lights were very bright yet my car was not lit up by the lights.  I would say that the lights were at least 30 feet from light to light.  My first thought was that something was going to crash on the other side of the trees.  As I got closer and went around the corner in the road to the other side of the trees, I looked to see if something had crashed.  I didn&#39;t see anything at all.  I suddenly got a feeling of dread.  I knew I had seen something I couldn&#39;t explain.  I continued down the road through Cornilius Pass Road.  Which is dark and not too many house are there, I kept looking through the trees to see if I could see it again.  I wanted to stop on the road and look better but I was by myself and the road has no shoulders or driveways to pull into.  About 1 1/2 miles from where I first saw the lights I saw through the trees a V shaped row of lights now hovering above the hill on the other side of where I was driving. I would say there was about three to four lights on each side of the V with one light in the front middle.  There was also a spot light coming down from either the front of the V or just behind the V.  It was spot lighting the ground below.  After seeing that I hit the peddle to the car and got out of there.  It was probably a year ago that I mentioned it to! a friend of my daughters what I saw.  She told me that she has seen a dish shaped UFO following her on the same road.  This has happen to her twice.  I am sorry but I could not tell its shape because the lights were so bright but I can tell you it was big.  I grew up with my dad who was a pilot and have seen many different kinds of planes and helicopters but I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was out taking my dogs for a walk, and my attention was drawn to the sky because there was something moving very rapidly there.  At first, I thought it was a meteor, but then I noticed that there were 4, evenly-spaced, seemingly artificial lights on what appeared to be the bottom of an aircraft.  It was too high to make out any shape other than that of the lights, which were in a straight, narrow line (like a cigar).  I didn&#39;t hear any noise.  I do know that this craft was going way too fast to be any sort of conventional aircraft.  I was following it very closely with my eyes as it streaked across the sky when it suddenly disappeared.  It was a very clear night, so there is little chance it went behind a cloud, etc. I had just about convinced myself that I had imagined the whole thing, when I noticed about five planes circling the area.  That&#39;s when I decided to submit a report, to see if anyone else in this area might have seen the same thing.<n>
2/27/00 20:40|Perth (Western Australia)||Unknown|15 Seconds|OK, I saw a flashing at very high altitude with a faint red light moving with it.|2/27/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12132.html|15|ndxe200002| OK, I saw a flashing at very high altitude with a faint red light moving with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my back yard doing weights to keep healthy, and a flashing caught my eye. The moon was not present, neither were than any clouds in the sky. I immediately fixated on the flashing and it continued to flash about every 3 seconds while moving, then a second object caught my eye but was extremely hard to see but it was a red light. The red light was moving with the flashing white light but then did a 180 degrees turn and proceeded back the same way when i first saw it. The flashing stopped and disappeared from my sight, even though it was only visible while flashing, and the red light faded from my eyesight, it was actually hurting my eyes trying to focus but that was it and it lasted about 15 seconds. My opinion is that there was some kind of conflict because it looked as though they were aggressive menouvres by the objects. About 8 minutes after, a sattelite orbited exactly near to where this conflict took place as i kept looking near the area for any more activity. Quite incredible and i felt kind of scared and nervous after seeing such a thing happen, quite scary.<n>

Watched light for estimated 10 minutes when it got dimmer and faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As reported to me by my mother.  She looked out her back window (east) around 23:30 on 2-26-00, and saw a milky-white light low on the horizon that approximated a full moon.  It appeared to be just above the tops of trees that are about 200-300 yards from her observation point. Thinking that it was a reflection, she moved to another window for a different angle of sight, but found the light was still apparent from her new vantage point.  She continued to watch the light; it gradually became dimmer and eventually completely faded away.  She approximates that the sighting lasted for 10 minutes.  She reported a haze around the light, and a milky-white color.<n>

The light was approximately 20 degrees above the south horizon on an overcast sky. The light grew in intensity for 3 seconds then went out. 15 seconds later it light back up quickly then went out. There were no other lights such as running lights on an aircraft. The light came back on 1 mile west of the first location lit up for 1 second 3 times then off. 1.5 miles west it lit back up 2 times for 1.5 seconds. Always a orange-gold color. No other aircraft were seen in the area.<n>

Around 6:27am I went outside for a cigarette break leaving my fellow associate to run the machine alone. After a few drags something caught the corner of my eye. I immediately looked up at it to see it was an orange egg shaped object with a bright white glow around it travelling on an upwardward diagonal course at a steady fast rate of speed with a bright white tail or trail of sparks behind it. Then within milliseconds it accellerated 2 to 3 times faster and then accellerated about 5 times faster than that and dissapeared with a small cascade of the white light from behind it either breaking the atmosphere or disintegrating. Puzzled I took a few more drags of my cigarette coaming the sky with my eyes then looked to my far right (which would be the direction where the egg would end up had it warped or jumped) and I saw a black triangular shaped shadow of an object about cloud level or slightly above fly at a very fast rate of speed in the same direction as the egg. The black triangular craft flew out of site as it was obscured by the warehouse part of the plant. Niether object made any noise. I immediately told my foreman of the incedent and he had a compass on hand. There was a magnetic disturbance at first as his compass read approximately 90 degrees off (the general direction both objects had travelled.) After my shift was over at 7:00am He came outside with me to the exact location I was standing to figure out the location of such crafts in the sky. His compass seemed to work properly then and we came to these conclusions. I was facing 330 degrees. The first egg shaped object travelled approximately 30 degrees North by NorthEast. The second dark triangular craft flew in the same 30 degrees NNE from the east.<n>

The UFO&#39;s (numbering at least 75 in number) had definitive patterns and actions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 2am, my 19 year old daughter came running anxiously in to the house to tell me about 5 *crafts* that she originally thought were stars, until she watched them closely and they began to move; moving in a V pattern, until they stopped overhead (at a very high level). (My daughter is taking an Astronomy class in college this year, and is interested in &#34;space&#34;.)  I frankly didn&#39;t think a great deal about what she had told me, thinking they were probably planes from Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, until I felt I should go take a look for myself; at which point I witnessed one of the most amazing unexplained events I&#39;ve ever seen.  From North/Northeast to South/Southwest, the *lights* came, one after the other.  At times, the *lights* were in a V pattern (mostly consisting of 3 *lights* ~ sometimes 5).  The V pattern *lights* were mostly in the middle of the huge number of *lights*, while the outside edges of the majority of the *lights* were lined with patterns of 2 *lights* ~ one closing following another, or running parallel to each other. At times, the outside *lights* appeared to be moving exceptionally rapidly, as though chasing one another; but could and did come to a complete halt at times, in mid-movement.  The *lights* appeared to be quite high in altitude, although at times, we could see them move through the clouds, as a small airplane would do if flying at a lower level.  Time and time again, 10 to 20  *lights* would move in this southerly fashion from the north, and stop directly overhead (over our home ~ my neck is still somewhat stiff from leaning my head back to watch them.  I saw a UFO once before, up close and personal, during the daylight hours on the campus of the Univ. of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky, in 1973, which I have never forgotten, nor have seen anything like it since: immense cigar-shaped craft with 4 huge square windows of brightly colored flashing lights).  Anyway, then as now, I never in my life witnessed anything like what my daughter, my husband and I saw several nights! ago.  T hese *lights* could stop~completely at rest; other times they would *flash* a pale sea green color; at times, they&#39;d flash and disappear, only to flash again in a few seconds (appeared as communication between 2 craft); there were 2 much larger *lights* which flashed different colors so swiftly (blue, green red) and they could turn very quickly (a 90 degree turn on a dime, so to speak).  These *lights* just kept coming and coming over a 2 or so hour period...unreal.  At one point, next to a group of 2 V shaped patterned lights, there appeared, as if through a cloud, a much larger object (possibly cylindrical?) ~ on which I could not make out a distinct pattern...flashing all colored lights at once ~ a mix of lights, not specific light colors at separate times.  There wasn&#39;t any noise from these *lights*...completely silent.  My husband witnessed these *lights*, and this man does NOT believe in easily in anything out of the ordinary.  About these lights, he merely states &#34;I&#39;m not sure what I saw.&#34;  This is the first time my daughter has ever witnessed anything like this, and when she first told me about what she had witnessed outdoors, she was startled and scared.  After I went outdoors with her, she was exhilarated, and her fear calmed.  Since my experience in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1973, I have never had any fear of UFO&#39;s.  Note:  My daughter and I checked a constellation map for February evenings, and these *lights* were in the area of what we believe to be the Orion Constellation ~ flying directly under it, and on either side of it.<n>

Lights were bright and being slightly diffused by clouds.  Would grow dimmer as clouds moved, (i.e. NOT projected from below).  Weather cool and overcast w/rain earlier that day.  Heard no sound. Stationary lights in approximately the following formation:  .. :  . .  Spanning roughly five degrees in sky (I measured one fist width at arms length), almost directly overhead, outer lights white, center two lights orange, roughly parallel w/Sunset Blvd.  People were coming out and staring up overhead.  Some even called friends on cellular phones asking them to go outside to look.  Absolutely no movement, and we walked approximately a block to our car and the lights remained directly overhead, (so they must have been at very high altitude).  Clouds gradually obscured until invisible.  We drove quickly home, as it was my intent to photograph them from my home, (though they were invisible by then). I am an amateur astronomer and I can assure all that this was NOT any standard celestial phenomenon, (not stars, planets, etc.).  These lights were several orders of magnitude brighter than any night sky objects, (except the moon).  I have never seen or reported anything like this before.  We were surprised to see nothing on the news in the following days.<n>

This time it had moved down to where I had to look through the tree tops to see it and it lasted for another 4 or 5 seconds and went out. As I stood out side for a while (15 minutes) I noticed 2 military type jet aircraft at high altitude which seemed to be involved in some kind of dog fight training, as I watched these aircraft I saw the light again and several more times through out the next one and one half to two hours. Each time I saw the lights they (some times 1, sometimes 2) appeared a few seconds after the jets passed over and due to the apparent size difference the lights were either a lot closer or a lot larger than the jets, the jets appeared only as a small speck of red light (pea sized) while the white or yellow lights appeared as half the size of a basket ball. The duration of these lights varied from 5 to 15 seconds and 3 times the light went out for 2 or 3 seconds and then came back on for a few more seconds. My impression was that of flares but I can&#39;t understand why fighter aircraft would be using flares at least in this area which is extremly dry right now and prone to fire. I have wittnessed similar lights in this general area on 3 other occasions with-in the last 4 weeks but did not notice the jets on the other occasions. I am a 48 yoa disabled  Army veteran with 7 years 9 months as a military policeman another witness is a 25 yoa construction worker and his 23 yoa wife, all witnesses are high school grads.    Since this seems to be an on going thing I now have a camera and will be taking photos<n>

The object was east of them going south, and then crossed over the highway as it made a sharp 90 degree turn to the east.  The daughter thought she saw a green light when it went into the clouds.  When they arrived home the father said that he saw a triagle with two orange/red lights and one blue one over the pond, which was just 80 yards away from the house.  When it was over the pond it became four wlights in a diamond shape.  It also emitted white beams, according to his testimony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When dad whent out to turn on the hose the dogs were barking.  He notice, directly over the pond, two orange red lights and a blue light at the point.  It changed to four white lights.  The pond was 80 yards away and his son, who he called to report this to, said that he reported beams of light coming from this diamond shaped object.  However, the (step)dad said when the son called at 7:45 pm, that it was 6:30 pm EST that he went outside, yet he said when his wife and children came home and after they reported what they just saw down the road from the house, that he saw the same thing just &#34;five&#34; minutes ago, when actually it was 2 1/2 hours earlier.  The object made a whoosh, whoosh sound as it crossed over the mother&#39;s car.  There is a discrepancy in the time that he thinks he first saw this and the time that the family said they saw it, the dad thought it was just five minutes earlier.  The son called me, MUFON of Hillsborough, Pinellas and Manatee counties from Tampa, to report this incident.<n>

I waited a while before I radioed main control and reported what I had seen because I knew they would think I was crazy,she laughted and wanted to know if I needed to be relieved even tho I had only been on duty one hour.I have no idea what this thing was, but it could hover, it made no noise,moved off very slow and was the biggest thing I have ever saw.You may contact me if you wish to do so.<n>

It moved very slowly but clearly, taking maybe 20 minutes to disappear behind trees. It lost luminosity while it moved, at first looking like a very bright star and finally quite dim. I also saw a very similar moving star-like object near Kauhava around 12/22/99 6 am (date and time uncertain) for maybe five minutes before it disappeared behind trees. It was by far brighter than the brightest planet or star I have ever seen. Neither of the objects was certainly not an airplane, satellite or meteorite.<n>

Location: Eastern Kern County, near Ridgecrest, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer Coordinates: 35deg.,35min N Lat.; 117deg.,42min W Long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vehicle Flight Path: Over undeveloped desert, managed by US Bureau of Land Management (BLM).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was late afternoon, about 1 hour before sunset, clear visibility. The day had been blustery - moderate wind, partial cloud cover. I was inside, sitting at my computer when gunshots from a wash about 1/4 mile away diverted my attention. I gazed out my 8&#39;W x 4&#39;H picture window to the south to see if I could see the shooters. My house borders undeveloped BLM desert land; the view is unobstructed except for some low-lying bushes in the foreground. The desert floor slopes gently upward on an alluvial fan for about 2/3 to 3/4 mile, backed by low hills known locally as the Rademachers; a topographical map of the area indicates the crest of the nearest peak is 1.1 mile distant and 430 feet higher in elevation than my vantage point inside my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t see the shooters, but after a few seconds my attention was drawn to a rapidly moving object at the right-hand-side of the window. My first thought in the first fraction of a second was that it was a bird. Quickly I realized it was not a bird, but rather some sort of aircraft. It followed a straight horizontal path - no flapping or deviation which would be typical of birds in flight. We do have soaring birds in this area, but this was obviously no soaring bird either. The object traveled from right to left (generally west to east) across my field of view defined by the window. It was low in altitude, staying below the crest of the hills at all times, so lower and closer to me than the 1.1 mile, 430 foot elevation peak mentioned earlier; but apparently near the base of the hills where they transition to the alluvial fan. So with the aid of the topo map I have been able to make a good estimate of the object&#39;s distance and elevation: I estimate it was 2/3 to 3/4 mile distant and no more than 100 - 200 feet above the terrain it was flying over.  It is unusual for an aircraft to be flying so low in that area - certainly in violation of FAA regulations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I saw only a profile view at a distance, I can&#39;t say much about the appearance of the craft. My sense is it more closely resembled a small private plane than a military jet in size and profile. But it seemed thinner in profile than a private plane. My sense is there was a vertical stabilizer at the rear; I am not very sure of that. I can make a rough guess of the length of the craft. Its angular length was no less than 1/8&#34;, no more than 1/4&#34; at arm&#39;s length (30&#34;). At an estimated distance of 3/4 mile, this would be equivalent to 16.5 to 30 feet in length for the object or about 23 feet +/-7; at 2/3 mile the estimated object length would be about 21 feet +/-6.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Field of View: My view through the window can be determined quite accurately from the dimensions of the window and my vantage point. It is close to 36 degrees. Scaling this on the topo map yields a distance of about 2500 feet or just under half a mile that the object was in my field of view, assuming a nearly west-to-east flight path near the base of the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration of the sighting: This is my worst data point. It was all over in a few seconds. But was it 4 seconds, was it 8? I guess 5 to 6 seconds from when I first noticed the moving object on the west end of my window until it reached the east end. Let us assume a time of 5.5 seconds in my field of view. For a 2500 foot flight path this results in an estimated speed of 455FPS or 310MPH for the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short lapse (2 - 4 seconds?) I thought: &#34;I must get outside to see if I can see this thing continue its path.&#34; I rushed out of the house to look toward the east (have timed it since - takes about 8 - 10 seconds). I saw no more evidence of the craft, nor was I aware of any aircraft noise in the vicinity. My biggest regret is that I didn&#39;t hurry over to see if the shooters had seen the craft. They were closer to it, and of course outside so could have heard sound during its passage. Sadly, I did not attempt to contact them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer is a retired physicist, amateur astronomer and one-time private pilot. He is a long-time resident of the area and is well aquainted with the terrain over which the craft was observed to fly. Observer has 20-20 vision when wearing corrective lenses, was wearing glasses at time of sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE added 23 Sept. 2003: It wasn&#39;t until 16 Sept. 2003 while starting to document this sighting that I realized it has characteristics similar to a Tomahawk cruise missile; in other words, perhaps it was a Tomahawk at low altitude. Since the sighting occurred a short distance from the boundaries of the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS), this may not be an unreasonable hypothesis. A web search revealed several unclassified press releases of Tomahawk flight tests which have terminated at China Lake, but none were found for any time in February 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few days later, at approximately 06:00 hours on February 22, 2000, My husband was leaving for work.   All of the sudden, he darted back into the house and told me I had to come look. I saw two cylinder shaped objects, rotating in a circular motion at the top only, with orange X-shaped lights on the base of each one.  They were traveling about 20 m.p.h. northeast across Prescott Valley, towards Mingus Mountain. We could only see the X-shapes with binoculars and I also grabbed the camera to take pictures, but they only captured a single &#34;orange light&#34; for each object. One at a time,the objects eventually dissappeared out of sight as they neared a mountain full of low lying clouds. My husband 35,is a machinist, and I, 35, am a secretary.

They appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away and about 200 feet off the ground.  I am a commercial pilot and flight instructor and can judge altitude and speed well.  they were in the shape of a cylinder much like a soda pop can.  I judged them to be about 15 to 20 feet in height and 10 feet in diameter.  The bottom had lights on it in the shape of an x.  The bottom stayed stationary while the top oscillated in a circle.  It was moving at about 10 miles per hour at first, but as it got higher, it,s speed increased.  It climed to an altitude of about 1500 feet above ground level and a speed of about 40 to50 miles per hour.  I watched it through my 10 power binoculars for about 10 minutes.  Finally one disappeared and then about a minute afterwards the other one disappeared from sight.  It was very cloudy and could have gone into the clouds.<n>

No sound. In and out of line of sight in less than 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke a few minutes before 9:45 pm, looked out the bedroom window (facing East) through a 3-foot open area where our drapes were open. I was watching the sky, fully awake, when IT appeared, swooping down in a &#34;lazy J&#34; pattern, ie from 12 o’clock to 3 o’clock, then continuing straight across my line of sight (East to West). (Only 1 object.) I believe IT was at 1500-2000 feet, below the usual approach altitude of commercial jets to SFO. IT was backlit by the moon, which was at that particular time hidden by the clouds producing a diffused background glow. IT appeared to be gunmetal dark gray/black, and I had the impression of IT having a muted red glow on the lower half. I also had the impression of panels or planes on both upper and lower halves, and in the center at the equator, a row of windows. I also had the impression that the bottom half had an internal ring which was rotating. Nothing on this craft was bright, there were no blinding lights. Size is indeterminate, however holding a 25-cent piece at my arm’s length gave me an estimate. Notable was the flat top and bottom, exactly like two inverted china tea cups. Going from right to left in my &#34;3 foot window-of-view&#34; it took less than 2 seconds. The movement was smooth, without any sound. I did have the &#34;impression&#34; of subliminal sound, kind of like the Jetson’s car, but it may have been purely overactive imagining. It was at that time I looked at my bedside clock: 9:45 pm. I was shocked. I didn’t move for a minute or so, but then I ran to the window to see if IT was hovering anywhere around. As I checked out the sky (lit up by the moon), a commercial jet flew by at the usual approach altitude to SFO (maybe 3000 feet?), making the usual noise. Quite a contrast to the silent passage of IT.<n>

It was about 8PM when I noticed a Bright light flickering in the distance out of my bedroom window to the Northwest.  I called my family into the room to take a look.  We watched it for a few minutes to try to figure out what it might be.  It certainly had no characteristics of an airplane or helicopter.  It remained pretty stationary for the few moments we watched, then I decided to get the video camera.  On the closeups the bright white flickering light became what appeared as a spiraling fireball with it still white in the center with two dots in the center and a bluish green tint around the perimeter.  As I was video taping my son noticed a second light identical to the first to the south of the first. Moments later as I turned my attention to the second light, there was a third to appear, right in the center of the first two.  All appeared to be at different altitudes. But all three lights had the same overall appearance from a distance, and all three lights are exactly the same shape on the closeups, and all have the exact same characteristics. The strangest thing is that the sky was very busy with aircraft flying across the lighted objects from south to north, as the 3 objects were in the west northwest sky.  When the lights disappeared the sky became quiet with not an aircraft in site for over 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed to us quite serious minded in his description of the event.  No other reports from Chicago for this date.  We wonder whether he might have been looking at landing lights of distant jets approaching Chicago for landing at O&#39;Hare Airport.  Just a guess.

Soundless in its passage and no sonic boom.  Heard jet aircraft engine sounds from the N approx. 30 seconds after the object disappeared moving toward the NNW. Travelling in a straight line, it trailed a red-orange tail.  It did not leave any contrail or sparks in its path.  It did not appear to to be giving off sparks or breaking up.  Total length of object and colored trail equal to a fist&#39;s width at arm&#39;s length. Out for a cigarette and watching the night sky, the object caught my peripheral vision as it brightly flared into existence to the SE of Corvallis about 70 degrees above the horizon.  It flashed overhead passing to the East of Corvallis and winked out about 30 degrees above the northern horizon. Total viewing time was less than 10 seconds.  Just a question of being in the right place at the right time. J. Allen Hynek was my astronomy professor at Northwestern University in 1963 and I&#39;ve enjoyed Peter&#39;s reports over the years.  Keep up the good work.  Hope this helps.<n>

Object was clearly seen but appeared and disappeared quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling north on Highway 99 north of Lodi, CA and while traveling adjacent to the local airport which is alongside and perpendicular to the west side of the highway I briefly saw a rod shaped object. It hung directly over the freeway above the treeline. Although there was nothing in the sky to compare it to, my sense was that the object was about 30 feet long and about one quarter of a mile away at an altitude of maybe 100 to 150 feet. What first attracted my attention was a series of 4 to 6 sequentially flashing bright white lights, with possibly one or two smaller non-flashing lights inbetween the flashing lights. The object seemed to be in fairly sharp focus and I could see a thin gray or black rod that the lights seemed to be mounted to. The rod was at an angle of about 60 degrees, like a clock arm pointing at the number 11. It did not appear to be moving. My first thought was that it was a plane approaching the airport, although if it was approaching from the north it would be perpendicular to the runway. This was quickly followed by the thought that it might be a radio tower with flashers on it, although as I said, it hung directly over the freeway. Then it just simply disappeared as though someone threw a switch. I couldn&#39;t believe it and kept staring at the spot in the sky where I saw it. It made me wonder if any of the other motorists saw it. The whole sighting lasted about 2 seconds. The sighting occurred just as the sun was setting and the sky was still light colored. There were no clouds in the sky in the area. I have traveled this route weekly for the last eight years and am very familiar with objects along the highway.<n>

The sky was bright and clear with high wispy clouds.I was on the roof of&#34;O&#34;Bliness Memorial Hospital in Athens Ohio working on a large water chiller.Out of the corner of my eye i noticed a silvery white object moving slowly across the sky directly overhead.At first I though it was a jumbo jet but on closer observation it was cynlindrical in shape.There were no wings,tail assembly,contrail or sound. At mid point on either side of the body was a half circle of light grey hase that was tranparent to the bright sky.A wedge shaped area of the same colored hase was at the posterior end of the cylinder.It was moving East to West in a dead straight line.I observed it for approximately 30 sscs. to 1 plus minutes across a 20 degrees arc of sky,horizon to horizon.I carry a small 6 in. pocket rule.While holding it at arms length above my head I measured the body at approximately 1 inch long.While taking this measurement the cylinder vanished!Its altitude could have been 3,000 to 6,000 feet.

My position was on Seatac airport, the night was a rare, clear, cold night and no one else in my area saw it that I know of.

There are C-130&#39;s that fly around here so that&#39;s what i thought it was. But we got closer and the lights weren&#39;t moving. At the light of lod kings and baymeadows we noticed that the object wasn&#39;t moving. There&#39;s a bridge just East of the light and I stopped near the top in the median. I turned off my radio and rolled down my window and heard a quiet hissing, like engines but almost like rushing air. My friend and I looked at each other and I yelled &#34;Do you see that! Do you see that! It&#39;s HOVERING! It&#39;s not moving!&#34; He shook his head and continued to watch in disbelief with me. I proceeded to say it wasn&#39;t a harrier cause they&#39;re smaller and much louder and that was the only plane that I knew of that could hover. I at first thought it was a bomber because of the size but it was hard to get a good look cause it was dark out and I believe the craft was too. Would make sense. There were 4 lights in the front but they didn&#39;t help with seeing the rest of the ship. My friend said that it looked like a tringle, more like a bomber and I said yeah but they don&#39;t hover. After about 2 min it started to move away slowly westward. We continued on our way lokking back several times but lost site of it within a minute. It was approximately 70 ft in the air and we were as close as a football field, actually closer. I asked the person at the establishment that it was over(a couple days later) if anyone had mentioned anything and they said no, not that they knew of. When we had gotten to our destination the night of, we talked to a couple officers and told them what we saw and they said they thought they heard a similar sound but couldn&#39;t find the source. I don&#39;t know what it was-an advanced plane was my first thought. Hope it&#39;s helpful.<n>

It was already quite dark out so they were very easy to see. They were heading strait for us coming from the northeast and heading southwest. They were moving quite slow, much slower than a small airplane and in a strange synchroniced formation. I would guess them to be between 5 and 10,000 ft. elevation. I continued to watch them for about four minutes while my wife went into the restaurant. They appeared to be flickering as if they were burning. I watched them till they were directly over head. By that time, a few people had past me woundering what I was doing and I told them I was watching some strange lites, they looked up and saw them also. The lites were about 5 times as bright as the north star and from where I stood, looked about 2ft apart. After watching them for a few minutes, I went into the restaurant and told my wife she should come back outside, that they were still there. By the time we got back outside, they had vanished. They had no colored lites and maded no sound. I&#39;m a refrigeration and air conditioning tec and own a mobil food concession business as well. My wife teaches 6th grade and we have lived in the Prescott area for almost 4yrs. I&#39;ve seen all different types of flares in my 44yrs, theese lites could not have been flare.<n>

When we were driving down the road we spotted two blinking lights (one yellow, one white) alternately blinking in the sky.  My girlfriend asked me what it was and I told her it was a tower and not a plane because it was completely motionless in the sky.  Then I remembered that there was no tower there, so we both took a second look as we drove closer.  This became more frightening because there was only space between the two lights and the ground, and a boomerang-shaped craft came into focus.  We were driving approximateley 35 miles per hour.  &#34;What the #!@! is that?,&#34; we both repeated.  I began to slow down but the driver behind me didn&#39;t even notice and was beeping at me to keep driving. Finally we got closer and I saw a black metallic ship between the two lights in an extremely aerodynamic shape (almost like a bug, almost a V shaped pattern).  I do not know what was scarier, the fact that the color of the metal was a glossy black and grey (unlike any kind of metal I&#39;ve seen) or the fact that it hovered motionlessly as I drove under it.  When I drove past it I turned back while I was driving and saw the shape of the ship along with it&#39;s meneacing metallic parts.  It couldn&#39;t have been even more than 3 blocks above us.  It was the most unbelievably amazing technology and I still can&#39;t believe the way it looked.  What the hell was that thing? I rendered this image for you using Photoshop.  I am a comercial artist and I believe this is as close to realistic as what I saw, minus some detail.  I&#39;ll do a 3d rendering later.<n>

I kept watching one while driving and as it was moving east it suddenly disappeared. I know it was not helicopters - they do not move like what I saw and unless it was an experitmental aircraft I saw some UFOs<n>

It looked just like the back taillights to a car, so i keeped glancing at it till it was out of sight wich was about 40 seconds . My girlfrend was with me but could not see the light, it happend to fast, and was up to high over the car on my side for her to see it.It did not blink, or made no sound.There was not many cars on the road, it was partily cloudy , and went straight, and fast, i think it was more like 15 or 20 seconds i absereved the object.<n>

Due to train on track parallel to C St--drove about 10 more seconds until I was able to see the eastern sky again, but it was gone. There was a light on the end of each angle--one red and one green and unsure of 3rd--think it was another red or green, not white or other color. It was so fast--and the low altitude was what drew my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a lot of traffic, since the train was passing (notoriously long events in Auburn) so people were continuing North on C St instead of waiting at the intersections with train crossings. I had just crossed Main St and saw this plane flying very fast and very very low. I thought it was a plane due to red and green lights--but then I looked after it whizzed by and thought it looked like a triangle shape, with a light on the end of each angle. Because of the train, I couldn&#39;t see the eastern sky (the direction it was going) and pulled over just past Del&#39;s Farm Supply, at the next intersecion--by then there was nothing to see. I thought it might have been a stealth craft, but it didn&#39;t have that swept back look--it seemed more of a true triangle. I couldn&#39;t tell if there was any sound, due to a lot of traffic noise, but can usually hear airplanes even above the traffic--we are right on the flight path for Sea-Tac--as low as this seemed to be, I would have thought it would have made a huge noise, but there wasn&#39;t anything noticeable but traffic.<n>

I noticed it again from afar, then the light faded away.  It was one of the strangest things I&#39;ve ever experienced.<n>

The formation changed from time to time.  2 of the objects seemed to nearly touch and then darted apart.

I went to the window immediately thinkin someone might be messing around with my car. I went up to ask my brother about if he had seen anything he said no. So I went back down stairs and on my way back I looked out the window were I saw an object just hovering above a tree line. it sat there for a minute and turned off the 3 white lights then I could only see 1 red light which looked to be about the center of the object. I asked my brother to get out of bed to come take a look at it which was 10:00pm EST. We both looked at it then it moved to the right and turned on the 3 white lights again. Then it moved back and forth as if it were dangleing from a string. Then it turned off it&#39;s 3 white lights and started moving towards the east I went out and got in my car and tried to follow it. but once I got to it&#39;s location it was no where to be seen...<n>

I saw this flying object flying over the tree tops.  It was acting as though it was having problems staying in the air.  The shape of the object was about the size of an automobile with 2 wings front and black all lite up and flickering.  The lights were shining on the tree tops.  Somewhere between the wings there was a red light.  It kept a forward motion at about 5 mph, it moved to the right and left and up and down in the blink of a eye.  It crossed the road, turned right and the lite wings went out. The red light shot forward and down very quickly.  At this point, I think the light went out.  There was no sound.<n>

Moving in formation of a triangle with remaining crafts in a vertical semicicle to the right<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 9:30 pm on 2-16-2000. Earlier in the day another person and I were joking about seeing UFOs all day there were white lights that moved stranged but we concluded they were helicopters. Well as I walked out of a building on E.State Street near Rockford College. I saw the real thing. When I saw the lights I knew they were something different. They looked like the lights I had seen on TV from an earlier sighting in Arizona in May of 1997. I froze. Another person was walking out with me and I said &#34;look at that, what is that?&#34; We told two other people who were talking by their car to look at the sky.  The objects appeared as bright orange fireballs hoovering just above the east southeastern horizon in an upside down shaped L. They were in the process of moving into a triangle formation.They crafts moved horizontaly into this traingle formation with a craft above it. The reamaining objects fromed a loosely curved line to the lower right of the fromation ( see figure at bottom).I was so scared I got in my car. Then I got out to take other look. They were in the triangle formation by now. I looked long enough to see if the fireballs were crafts. I noticed that they were traingle shaped crafts with a brighter light on each point of the triangle and in the center. I got in my car and went home. Leaving the parking lot there were several cars parked with people looking at the objects outside there from the end of the parking lot. On the way home I saw two contrails running from east to west in the sky and a few small aircrafts. In the western sky I saw a larger low flying aircraft. When I got home about 10 minutes later. People were standing outside the house across the street. They saw the objects too. I overheard them say that they were calling 911. Twenty minutes later a  police van appeared the people left in a black car with the van they returned 45 minutes later. The objects were still in the sky in a formation but it was harder to see the fromation because of trees. We called the local police! departm ent and left a report. A half an hour later from the first sighting, I looked outside and they were gone. I am not saying they were spacecrafts but it was very weird.<n>

I placed my groceries in the van and|2/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12076.html|77|ndxe200002| On Wed. Feb.16,2000 I had just come out of the logli&#39;s grocery store on State st. in Rockford, IL. I placed my groceries in the van and turned to return my cart, that is when I saw four amber orbs in the night sky. Three of the orbs formed a triangle, while one was positioned down below.The orbs were a very bright amber color, a bit larger then the north star at it&#39;s largest. The orb  that formed the left point of the triangle was a floater. It floated between the top orb and the bottom orb. The moon was 3/4 full and it was a cold,clear well lite night.I called to a gentleman getting out of his vehicle and he stood for a couple of minutes and watched them with me.... he had also never seen anything like them.I was not sure of there altitude so I got in the car to drive closer. After only a short distance they began to leave, so I pulled into a quiet paking lot behind Khols on State st.and watched. They would blink briefly then zoom into the southern sky. I watched until all you could see was a pin point and then the orb would be gone. Each one left individually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the wife of a pilot/airplane mechanic and I have speant much of my adult life with my eyes pointed toward the sky, but never have I seen such a sight as I saw on Feb 16,2000. As I said before it was a very clear well lite night. The stars were beautiful and the moon was approximately 3/4 full.... but nothing compaired to the four amber colored orbs that floated in the night sky over Rockford,IL. When I first saw the orbs it was 9:30 pm, I had just looked at my watch upon leaving the store that I was coming out of. After placing my groceries in the van I saw the orbs glowing in the night sky. I quickly scanned the surrounding sky and discovered several aircraft flying in other parts of the sky, but none around the orbs. The orbs did not have any other colored lights on them that would indicate that they were an FAA approved aircraft.After observing them for several minutes, I also ruled out hot air balloons due to the fact that I could see stars all around the orbs. They also did not make the tell tale sound that a hot air balloon would make.I am confident that this was not one solid craft due to the fact that stars shone through the center of the triagle shape that they were forming.The orbs were very bright, but not too bright to comfotably look at with the naked eye.The orb that formed the left corner of the triagle was a floater... It first blinked a couple of times and appeared to float toward that top orb... paused...blinked... then floated to its original location. Then the whole process started again only this time it floated toward the bottom  right orb. At this point I was unable to determine what altitude all of this was taking place at, so I thought to get a better look. I got in my van and started to drive closer to them. Unfortunately as I did this one by one they would blink and disappear into the southern sky.So I opted to pull over into a parking lot behind Khols on State St. and watch.As I sat there I decided that if they were the size of a jet liner I would guess them to be at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Now I do not claim that this was their size or altitude. I am only stating that it is my best guess at an approximate altitude if they were the size of an airliner.It actually looked liked the orbs were suspended in air... I watched the last orb rapidly blink and then zoom out of sight into the southern sky. I looked down and the time was 9:40pm. I sat for a few more minutes wa! tching t he sky for any other signs of the orbs, there were none... so I headed for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness did indicate a time in the Event Time box.

About 9:30pmCST I looked out my window facing west. I saw 8 orange lights in two clusters. The 2 clusters were of 3 together in a broken line with 1 lagging behind. They were fairly high in the sky with no noise. They were moving very slowly and started to disappear as they moved over my house. They were moving west to east. I went to the windows facing east and they were gone. Other people in Rockford saw them also as this has been on the news last night and tonight.<n>

It appeared they were at an alttitude comparable to what a small plane would fly at. Three of the objects were in an triangular formation,they rotated postions,and circled around the other two and fell back into position. The other 2 objects stayed to the lower left of the triangle,like they were observing. The 3 objects movements reminded me of watching a group like the Blue Angels perform, it just seemed to be practiced, like a routine. I had stopped the car and watched all of this occur,this happened in about 5 minutes. I then drove about a quarter of a mile, parked my car and got out, and watched them again. They acted in the same manner as stated before. I entered a store when I exited 30 minutes later the objects were gone. Besides myself,my wife,mother and grandmother all witnessed this occurance.<n>

It was as bright as Saturn, which was also clearly visible as the night was very clear.Looking due West, the star (?) was almost half way between the Pleiades and the constellation Auriga. Then, as I was looking directly at it, it disappeared. It took about two seconds as it faded from view, dimming in brightness and then disappearing. I&#39;ve spent thousands of hours looking at the sky and this was no jet or plane. This does however, mark the second time I&#39;ve seen a star like object behave oddly.What could it have been?<n>

I noticed an unusual formation of two bright stars quite close to each other in the western sky. Just as I began to realize that I was seeing something out of the ordinary, one of the &#39;stars&#39; suddenly blinked off. It took several seconds to completely fade out. It reminded me of a searchlight being turned off, where the filament can still be seen faintly glowing. I believe this is the same incident as the one listed for Seattle, WA. What eve it was must have been at great altitude. I&#39;m glad someone else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites also fade out as they enter the shadow of the Earth.  Hence, it is difficult for us to know what the individual may have seen.  PD))<n>

The lights were greenish blue.  We observed the object for about 5 minutes before getting close enough to it to see that it was not 4 lights but two sets of 4 lights forming a triangle.  As we got closer the object rotated about 45 degrees and floated directly over head.  I slowed down to get a better view.  My friend and I stuck our heads out the window, but heard no sound.  The object was the size of a football field or larger.  There were no means of propulsion visible.  I could see some kind of round portal on the bottom side along with a tubing underneath.  The object looked metalic and you could see shadows above the object showing depth.  Two days later, My friend and I both had red noses with a small sore on the tip that blead for several weeks.  I watch a lot of tech channels and no one will ever make me believe our planet has the capability to create an object that large that can hover without a propulsion devise.<n>

Each object had a bright white blinking light. However they were not blinking in sequence. Indicating to me that they were independent of each other. The objects seemed to move very slowly and as I observed them I believe that I saw the same type of lights somewhat dimmer and as I think about it, it seems they were in front of the brighter lights.<n>

The location was on Sunset Ave. between Howard and Weir roads about 300 yards west of Howard. I have two photos. The appearance was like the many mutilation photos I have seen. I commute 80 miles per day (rt) on rural road and see many dead animals. This is the real deal. The two adults both had circular cuts in the anal-genital areas. The udder are of one cow was removed. The stomach was visible and the viscera possibly was removed or consumed. Perhaps you can contact some interested in this who can contact the farmer or myself. Although I work as newspaper reporter, this is not the type of story I normally cover. I usually work with sources who are known to me and/or familiar with the publication, and I am not interested in investigating something like this myself, although I am very interested in these kind of subject. I will observe that one has followed the topic you deal with, it is transforming, and a little scary also, to see something known only through published or broadcast accounts firsthand.<n>

It is very dark out in the country as there are no street lights. I was out on the porch, standing on the top step,  the sky was very dark that night, and I was smoking a cigarette and talking to someone on the phone.  For whatever reason I looked up and saw this enourmous, silent object moving slowly over the house heading north.  The object was jet black and never seemed to end...it just kept coming and coming over the porch.  I could make out that it was rectangular in shape,flat,solid, silent and black, like a parking lot in the sky.  It was so enormous that I could not tell if it was 20 feet above the house or 200 feet or even more.  I was in such awe that it didn&#39;t occur to me to be scared.  I was describing it to the person I was on the phone with but they were saying that it had to be some large military plane or something, but I know it wasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s not the type of thing you run around telling people about because I couldn&#39;t even get the person on the phone to believe me as it was happening.  I saw what I saw and there is no explanation other than it being a ufo.  It slowly made it&#39;s way north, over farm land and other homes toward hwy. 99E at the town of the town of Canby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I missed the exit that I would have normally taken to get to his house so I ended up going a different way.  As I came up to a 3 way stop that was well know to me it began to lightly hail.  I was listening to a cassette on my tape player the song was Lifeboy by a band called Phish.  Then I saw it.. a dark shape about 50 ft long hovering silently about 30 ft in the air above the house directly infront of the stop sign I was stopping for.  The object had three clear white lights that were attached to the bottom of this giant floating object and they were searching the ground for something.  I could see the lights themselves not just what was eminating from them. I was confused by what I was seeing because I was not seeing something that I did not think it could be real, but it was as real as anything i have ever seen before or since.  The experience did not last long because I turned a hard left to go to my friends house not knowing if I was about to be abducted or something.  I returned to the same location as I drove home about 3 minutes later and it was as if nothing had ever been there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seemed to have a dome shaped area on top of it on the larger end, and the bottom appeared to be flat.<n>

Coming out of the craft away from me, behind the craft was an incredible light shining northwards, it was so bright that I could see the top of the plains, I&#39;d say about 1 mile away from me.  It was brighter than any spotlight or headlight I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned by what I saw and at the same time afraid of something so mysterious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I passed by and as I did so, I passed a semi trailer heading west.  I know he saw it, as I looked in my rearview mirrors, I could see his brake lights come on for an instant, and I&#39;m pretty sure he got the heck out of there like I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Space Traverlers Object came throgh a circle in space  then emitting  smaller objects .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a truck driver and was heading east on route 97 heading toward Rocky Mount N.C. It was clear and a million stars were out when I happen to glance up through my windshield to see what seemed to be flickering sparkles of fire, the kind you see flooting down after a firework goes off! This went on for about 15seconds and behind the flickering I saw a perfect circle of gray so I pulled to the side of the road! NO TRAFFIC was coming as it was a country road and late! I stepped out on my running board to get a better look. I know the gray hole in space was there because it blocked the view of the stars that were just there! When the hole dissappeared an object, completely black began moving notheast at a slow speed not making a sound or non that I could hear. Once again I know it was there because it black out the stars as it moved only to see them reappear as it moved forward! Size was hard to tell but it seemed big with no lights and distance was hard to judge because of night. Then after about a minute 12 objects seemed to come from the object at fast speeds.They were or seemed to be just balls of light that race out in all directions from the craft! I stood amazed as I watched these objects do fast sprints away and back to the object! They could stop on a dime and excellerate to high speeds in as instant! Some would circle the craft as I could see then go behind the craft only to re appear on the other side ! I will never forget it as Long as I live!The big craft just moved slowly toward the northeast with the smaller crafts manuvering back and forth around the craft! this went on for at least 20 mins and I could still see the stars blackening out and re appearing as I stepped back into my truck and drove on to our yard! I should have written to you before now but I know what I saw! I listen to coast to coast and have an open mind!I was just setting here at home watching about oufo coverups on scifi network and felt compelled to write you! I know because of the time factor involved theres not much you can do with my account But i know what I saw was real ! I believe that space travel can be achieved by bending space or worm holes like the one I think I saw that night !Thank you for your time! Firmly a believer since that night. Just wanted to finally tell someone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was 1/2 the size the full moon.  it seem to slightly pulsate.  after looking at it through binoculars i went back to bed, it was 2 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i woke up and saw this bright gold orb through the trees about half the size of a full moon.  It puzzled me because i knew there should not be any thing that bright or that size in the sky at this, time about 2am.  there should not have been any thing even remotely that size there. Jupiter had set and the moon was well west, venus was not up yet.  I looked at my charts the next morning.  I am an authorized investigator for VA MUFON.  as i was looking at it through my binoculars i saw a jet fly behind it!!!  i then figured it must be a light from the nearby power plant and went to bed.  the next day i was some what unsettlted about it, i still knew i saw something that should not have been there but was sure it was something explainable.  after dark i went to the other side of the trees i saw the orb through and expected to see some light that would explain what i saw, but nothing. i have not seen it since.  a couple of days later my wife mentioned having strange vivid dreams that night (she sleeps in another room), i also had some strange vivid dreams that night, and a neighbor mentioned the same thing.  this still bothered me but i decided to forget about it until i saw this page and the mention about all of the orbs sighted during february at various locations. so you can make of it what you will, but let me know if anyone else saw this in my area, i would like to talk to them.<n>

At first i didnt think anything of it but i realized there was no one behind me. As we rode at about 15 miles an hour the light hovered above us. Im not sure how long it stayed above us but if i guessed id have to say  15 - 30 seconds. Then the light accelerated extremely fast ahead of us. When it got ahead of us it rocketed to the left then back to the center of the skyline dissapearing in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its hard to describe the intensity of the light but it was extremely bright. Also im not sure how high the light was above us.( if i was going to make an accurate guess id saw about250 yards when it was hovering and i couldnt estimate how high it was when it accelerated away). The light accelerated faster than any airplane could as it crossed the skyline in a matter of seconds it was like the speed of a shooting star or a meteorite. It also cornered very quickly  when it changed directions( first to the left then back to the center)I dont think any aircraft is capable of that type of cornering. After the light dissapeared my friend ahead of me (about 20 yards) stopped to let me catch up. Before i could ask if he saw it he said &#34;what the hell was that&#34;. I was glad he saw it too. My friend that was on the back of the atv with me witnessed it also. All 3 of us had the same description of the sighting. I have no idea what the light was but i am positive it was not an aircraft of any type or a meteorite or shooting star. The way the light accelerated and turned was not possible by man or nature. I would also like to add that there was no other visible light of any kind except my headlight and the one on the vehicle in front, a big difference from the intense blue light. This was a remote and wooded area not easily accessable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were, from my location on the 2nd floor apartments balcony, just above the tree tops but very far away. They would appear for 15 to 30 minutes and then fade out only to reappear a little while later. On more than one night I saw them while driving South on Highway 27 from Clermont towards my apartment which is about 15 miles South of Clermont. I have lived in this same location for 5 years and am familiar with the towers and other aerial lights in the area. I am also very familiar with aircraft and the lights associated with them. These were very different from typical tower, aircraft or other lights I am use to seeing. They were also not the typical color of military flares that are claimed to have caused the &#34;Phoenix Lights.&#34; After seeing them every night for about a week they disappeared. I still check every night hoping I can catch them again and get some neighbors as witnesses. I wouldn&#39;t have reported this if I hadn&#39;t found three reports listed for the same time period by people in Florida. All of those sightings confirmed to me the location and strangeness of what I saw.<n>
2/13/00 18:55|Yuma (20-25 miles West of) near I-8/Mexican border.  Proba|CA|Unknown|3 hours 10 minutes|I saw 2 unidentified craft performing up and down and around movements over the course of about 3 hours between Yuma, AZ and El Centro,|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12001.html|112|ndxe200002| I saw 2 unidentified craft performing up and down and around movements over the course of about 3 hours between Yuma, AZ and El Centro, CA on Sunday night, 02/13/00 (7:00p.m. - 10:p.m.).  I was hiking and camping by myself in a generally unhabitated area about 10 miles east of the city of Glamis near the Imperial Sand Dunes/Pichacio State Park (CA).  There is no doubt in my mind that these were unconventional aircraft.  I am reporting this because there must have been alot of people that saw this for there were many snowbirds and others camping out in the area or riding offroad vehicles at the Sand Dunes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, February 13, 2000 I was camping out alone about 10 miles east of Glamis, CA.  There were many people in the area however and somebody else must have seen what I saw.  At approximately 6:55 p.m. I observed some kind of craft which at first was simply going in what appeared to be circles.  I thought it might be a Border Patrol airplane or helicopter but then it started to go straight up and then straight down, not very quickly, but very noticeably.  I couldn&#39;t figure out what kind of craft it was because of the up and down and circular manuevers it was making. The exact location of where I saw this craft initially was about 20-25 miles West of Yuma, AZ (or Winterhaven, CA right next to it on the CA side) and appeared to be hovering right over Interstate 8 near the Mexican Border.  I was probably about 8 to 10 miles away North of the object (looking directly South).  The longitude it was initially hovering at would be 115 degrees and the latitude about 32.75 degrees (Mexican Border). I could not really tell the shape of it even though I had binoculars. It was not very large though. I could clearly see it emitting a steady white and green light and a flashing red light. The colors seemed to be very similar to airplane lights but it definitely was not a plane. It was probably no bigger than a small airplane. Initially it was circling a specific area.  After about 5 minutes of watching it it started to go up and then go down, not very quickly, but it was noticable.  Sometimes it did seem to accelerate quickly and it was then that knew that this was no Border Patrol or other conventional aircraft.  Sometimes it would go up or down diagonally too.  It seemed to be intent on hovering over a specific area however which had to be viewable for people driving on Interstate 8. About 25 minutes later, at 7:20 p.m., I saw a second craft about a mile Southwest of the first object.  It&#39;s light simply seemed to turn on and it became viewable but for only about 10-15 seconds.  It started moving towards the first craft.  The first craft started to move away from it until the second craft&#39;s light faded away. There were airplanes flying in the vicinity while this was happening. Whenever an airplane seemed to get to close to this object the object would move away from the airplane and then eventually would go back to the spot it seemed it wanted to hover over.  At one point an airplane seemed to fly right at it at a normal speed.  The craft then started to fly right by it at a lower altitude at about the same speed of the airplane.  With it&#39;s flashing red light it probably looked like another airplane to the airplane, but after the airplane passed it, it doubled back and went back to hovering over the &#39;spot&#39;. At about 7:45 p.m. the lights from the craft dimmed to about half of it&#39;s original brightness.  It continued the up and down and around and diagonal movements for about 5 more minutes and then disappeared at approximately 7:55 p.m. I kept looking at the sky waiting to see if one or both of them would return.  At about 8:15 I saw one them (they both had the same colors and size) about 5 miles West of the original sighting location.  It seemed to be hovering in the same manner as described earlier over a specific &#39;spot&#39;.  I believe that there is a hydroelectric plant over the spot that seemed to be hovering over.  It hovered over this spot for about 15 minutes and then disappeared. About 8:45 one of them reappeared again about another 5 miles west of the previous spot (10 miles from the original spot).  A couple of minutes later the other one reappeared and I could clearly see both of them continuing their up and down manuevers about a mile or two away from each other.  At about 9:00 p.m. one of them slowly disappeared and then about 5 minutes later the other one slowly disappeared. The location of this would be about 5 miles South of Glamis and maybe 10 miles East of Holtville.  The people near Glamis must have seen this if they were looking in the sky.   There is a train that goes right though Glamis from Brawley to Yuma and the craft may have been noticeable to anyone on the train. At about 9:30 p.m. I saw what looked like one of the craft hovering over the Colorado River about 10 miles North of Yuma.  It seemed to be doing the up and down and around and diagonal manuevers over another &#39;spot&#39; for about 5 minutes and then slowly disappeared at about 9:35 p.m. At about 9:45pm I saw the craft back at the original sighting location but it&#39;s light was only about half of it&#39;s original amount.  It would alternately dim and disappear only to reappear again.  It seemed to be doing the same manueavers over the original &#39;spot&#39;.  This stopped altogether at about 10:05pm and I didn&#39;t see anything else for the rest of the evening (I went to sleep at about 11:00p.m.). I only other thing I could add would be that at times the flashing red light seemed to change to a flashing white light.  This was the only change of colors that I observed.  I had the feeling that the objects were trying to make themselves noticeable to any onlookers on the ground but they did not want to be noticed by the people in the airplanes. There is a Marine Air Corps Station in Yuma and there is a large AWACS observing station about 15 miles Northeast of Glamis.  This object should have appeared on radar at both locations.  I saw no fighters dispatched from Yuma. That&#39;s it. Mark Levy P.S. - I am a computer programmer and longtime resident of California. This was my second sighting.  I did not report the first sighting I had because I wanted to see if history would repeat itself so I could be absolutely sure about what I saw.  Now I am.  I could only provide sketchy details of my first sighting at this time but if you want me to describe it please call me or send me an email and I will do my best.  ((initials deleted))<n>

We observed a bright light come over the horizon above the tree line, moving at a tremendous speed. Initially we assumed it to be a low flying jet aircraft (rarely are any aircraft other than small private planes seen in this area at all)due to the extreme speed. The light came from a true north bearing of 268 degrees (my husband deals with map and compass locations on a daily basis), travelling almost due east (true bearing). As the light approached us, we expected to hear the engine of a possible military aircraft due to the fact that Fairchild AFB is approx. 80 miles SW of our location. When the light was directly overhead, it began to fade and finally disappeared. In spite of the fact that we waited a number of minutes, there was no sound whatsoever. It should be noted that our home is located in a very rural area, and the ambient sound is almost non-existant. We have absolutely no idea what we saw, but we have never seen anything like this before. We have lived at this location for 11 yrs.<n>

It was a clear night with a bright moon so I could make out the crests of the Cascades. As I looked at this light it seemed to &#34;wobble&#34; in it&#39;s posion. As I continued to observe it;it seemed to move toward me. I continued to watch it inch toward me for another 30 secounds or so when I decided to go inside and tell my wife about this. I went inside, and told her, were upon she said &#34;I&#39;ll be right out&#34; as she was not dressed. I returned to the back of the house where upon I saw that the orange orb was still present and still appeared to be slowly closing in. After a few more moments of watching this my wife came out in her bath rob and saw it immediatly where upon she blurted out &#34;call my sister&#34;.  I had forgotten that I had our &#34;Cell Phone&#34; in my coat pocket as we had only had this device for a couple of months. I handed my wife the phone and as soon as she started dialling her sisters number the object gradually diverted its direction away from us and toward the south. As the phone conection was made the orange &#34;orb&#34; began to move in to a cloud bank that was South and East of us. Unforunatly, her sister was notat home, and her niece ansewred the phone who was not willing to look out the window and was only &#34;mildly amused&#34;. Eventually the orb disappeared after moving in and out of the clouds as it slowly moved sout.<n>

This was near a supermarket so this does happen sometimes. However, this thing (judging by its distance and height) was far too large to be a balloon, also its stillness was strange enough to capture my attention. After about ten minutes planes began to appear, one with the black exhaust trail. Within a  minute of the planes&#39; appearance the object began moving away in an arc, and was gone within a minute or so. I thought I may have seen some movement on the sides of the thing, not unlike the movements of a bird&#39;s wings (this is perhaps the strangest part of the whole affair). My initial thought was weather balloon, yet this was in a very populated area and no where near the airport or weather stations. Also, the absence of lights on the object, to me, disqualified it as a plane. I had been pulled over in the parking lot of a supermarket, when I came out there were planes all over the sky, six all at about the relatively same altitude and running parallel. Does this sound like a military excercise?<n>

I happened to look up in the sky and saw what looked like a really thin ribbon floating sideways through heading South.  I ran inside and told my brother to come outside also, and he saw it too.  It was a silver color, and I could not tell how high it was.  It could have been from 100 ft. to up in space.  The sky behind it was black, with few stars because of pollution.  There were very few clouds and no wind.<n>

Suprised by this, we immediately pulled off the road and My son just so happened to have his 8mm videocamcorder with him, and he jumped out the vehicle along side the road and began video taping this flying objects for about 10-15 minutes.  My wife and I sat in the car with our windows down and intently watched as these objects not only flew in intelligent formation but at times changed formation as follows:  First..  They were flying staggered vertically..  Then two of the lower ones flew directly along side each other.. almost touching each other.  Immediately after that, One of those objects flew below the other then in a counterclockwise rotation.. arced up and around the other object, then resumed position again along side it.. shortly after this four of the objects began flying in a straight line vertically one over the top of the other flying east to west.. almost seemed to be hovvering at a slow speed.. so it seemed.  The highest object which will call the fifth object appeared to always stay a little bit ahead of the rest of the objects below it.. almost as if It was the lead object, and always stayed to the left of the objects.  After the lower objects flew a couple of arial acrobatic moves , the next too above them also made a few arial moves then the lower objects appeared to one by one rapidly speed away till they disappeared..  From the bottom one by one..  While they&#39;re was still three of the objects visible the very top object none as the fifth object or the lead object either seperated into two objects or actually appeared to have dropped another object out the bottom of it.  We observed this for a few seconds.. and then systematically one by one the appeared to speed away until no! n visibl e.. At that time we could no longer see anymore objects.  We came home and the first thing I did was call the rockford airport because these objects appeared to be almost directly over the airport vacinity. The airport me in direct contact with the control tower, I told the conrtol tower that we had seen some  u.f.o.&#39;s and wondered if anyone else had reported anystrange objects, He said a few people had called in.  I told them what we saw and asked him if they had any aircraft around that time on radar flying in formation like that..  He said absolutely not, he suggested we contact National UFO Reporting Center which we did.. and we also contacted a few local news agencies.. and also were told by these sources that other people were calling in and reporting similiar stories..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The event was reported on the 10:00 p.m. newscast by WRAX-TV.

I knew immediately that they were out of place and were acting in a way that there was no label that I could put on them from previous experiences.  My daughter and I pulled into the parking lot where we were going and to my amazement they formed the big dipper one star short.  Then they started to dissapear one at a time slowly then there was only one left.  I looked in the paper but could find no accounts and it was a full week before accounts began to appear along with someone in So.Belot who has a video tape. A stream seem to come down from one object<n>

Another flew off into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flying over Rockford were 4 or 5 unidentified orange colored lights.  It was about 8:15pm on the city&#39;s southeast side. These were low flying lights.  Flying in formation, some smaller (what appeared to be &#34;fire-ball&#34;) lights shooting out from one of them.  Then formation broke and one of the orange lights just took off into space.  I&#39;d estimate air speed at about 50 miles per hour although this would be hard to judge not knowing how far away they were from earth. There were many sightings throughout the city.  It made the local radio station and local news. This is not the first sighting of the strange orange lights in Rockford. It was reported in the news that on NEW YEARS EVE there were eyewitnesses who described similar orange lights hovering over the city.<n>
2/11/00 19:20|Tucson|AZ|Unknown|15 MIN|A series of 4 or 5 lights, blinking and moving in a westward direction. No pattern at all to the lights.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61570.html|123|ndxe200002| A series of 4 or 5 lights, blinking and moving in a westward direction. No pattern at all to the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay, I&#39;m standing out on the patio, smoking a cigarette and up in the sky I see these lights. Here&#39;s as best a description I can give:It appeared in the southern sky. the lights looked like twinkling stars almost or like plane lights but they would get bright for just a second and then disappear completely (normal planes do not do that you can still see the plane). There would be like 4 or 5 of them going off but not in any sort of order. The area they covered was pretty big, like the area of 5 or 6 planes but there wasn&#39;t a distinguishable shape like a circle etc. Really you could not see anything behind the lights it was the lights themselves that let you know something was there.It could not have been different planes either because of the way the lights were moving the plane would have to have the ability to zig up and down and back and forward at a rate of nano seconds. The whole thing was moving west at a pretty rapid clip. I called my husband out, who was annoyed I took him away from a show but as soon as he saw it he also commented, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; I was speaking to a friend on the phone who lives a few blocks away. I asked her to go outside and look at the sky. She and her son went outside,her son said it looked like asteroid dust. He is 13. We had to run out to the parking lot to see past the building in front of us but by the time we got to the parking lot it was gone. We live near an air force base so we are used to seeing planes in the sky all the time. This was NOTHING like anything I&#39;ve ever seen flying in the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this helps.<n>

2/10/00 04:20|Kirkland|WA|Other|8 SECONDS|Driving to work at 4:20 am I saw a green light and trailing left wingtip angle over my car at 200 mph & 100-200 ft altitude.|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13091.html|127|ndxe200002| Driving to work at 4:20 am I saw a green light and trailing left wingtip angle over my car at 200 mph &amp; 100-200 ft altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving Southbound on Interstate 405 on my way to work at 4:20 in the morning. Suddenly I noticed a green light and what appeared to be the trailng left edge of a wingtipof a Cessna-sized aircraft. It was traveling the same direction I was, angling slightly left, but about twice freeway speed. It seemed to be really moving fast at a very low altitude (100-200 feet). I know a little bit about aviation, and what struck me as odd right away was the fact that if it was a small plane, and I was indeed looking at the end of it&#39;s left wingtip, it should have a red light on it and not a green one. I looked for a red light or a rudder beacon light, but to no avail. It traveled away from me for about 5 to 6 seconds and then the light went out or vanished. I heard no engine sounds because of the ambient noise of my own vehicle at 60 mph. Scanning the sky for several minutes after the event turned up no further sightings.<n>

The latter could have been an optical illusion, though. As it was mistaken for Venus, you can imagine that it was a long-distance sighting - and thus are there unfortunately few details to report. I think &#34;Venus&#34; will have to suffice for a description. Light pollusion and aurora borealis are out of the question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I called a friend a few streets down, she saw them also, but looked at them in a different direction, meaning they must have been closer than I ever thought! She didn&#39;t heard any sound either.

A little|2/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11951.html|131|ndxe200002| While stargazing, a dark black object entered into my line of sight and headed toward the city. Very fluid and fast. No sound. A little bit of light seemed to be reflecting off of the forward section of the object. Then it disappeared into the city glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time of my sighting is quite an odd coincidence and coincides with many events that are happening in my life. That particular night I was just feeling the cusp of a new contentness and so while hanging out with my friends in their upstairs apartment, I decided to go outside for a quick breather to be alone with myself. On the balcony (note: the balcony is only 2 feet of the ground), I was contemplating all the coincidences that had happened that entire week and even up to that day. I had no idea that something bizarre was also going to be added to the rest of them. Well I guess I felt frisky, so I hopped the balcony and walked over to the sidewalk and layed back to stargaze. We live in the Kinnear section of Queen Anne (the west side of the hill). And our apartments look out over Magnolia. I was only out on the sidewalk for a good five to seven minutes when the sighting occured. I want to stress the fact that I did &#34;ask&#34; for a sighting that night like so many other times I&#39;ve done in the past but have been so awfully disappointed. My family does have a UFO/e.t. history so I thought I was being neglected, I should say. Before that night I had never seen a UFO or a visitor contact. To continue with my sighting; I noticed a good amount of planes that night and I noted that they seemed to have more blinking lights these days. They may have always been that way, but maybe just now I realized it? I could hear all these planes just fine, but the object I saw made no sound at all. I must have been staring out into nothingness (basically straight up) when a dark object entered into my line of sight. I want to note that I did not see it coming out of the corner of my eye, but rather it entered very near to the exact spot I was looking at. I was a dark shadowy object that emitted no light and was heading sort of in a SSE direction toward the city. I believe when I first saw it, it was completely dark. But as it flew in toward the city I think it did start to reflect some city light (I only speculate here) on ! the forw ard section of the craft. As it drew near the glow of the downtown area it sort of faded away and disappeared. I&#39;m not sure if it merely flew into a misty pollution of the city lights or if it purposely made itself invisible. Anyways, the object made no sound and I really have nothing to compare it&#39;s size to, since I was looking straight up. Compared to the other planes I saw that night it did seem like it was flying about as low as the normally can go, and it seemed more solid, as the object I saw was circular in shape. Also, when comparing the object I saw to all the rest of the planes that night. This object sort of &#34;swooshed&#34; in and was not using a direct line of flight. All the other planes up there seemed to be stiff and rigid in the flight plans, while this was like a bird swooping on in. That&#39;s about it. The important thing that this sighting has taught me is that, despite my family&#39;s history of seeing UFO&#39;s and E.T.&#39;s, I am even now doubting my sighting. And unless an E.T. comes up to me and taps me on the shoulder, or a gov&#39;t agent comes up to me and explains the entire truth behind the whole enigma, all of us will have doubts. Descartes was really on to something I guess. Thank you.<n>

I suddenly noticed a cluster of lights floating in the sky. I ran into the house and got my video camera to capture what was going on. I filmed the object for aproximately 5+ minutes(tapes should be in your possession at this time.) The object whipped in a jerking motion from one side to the other, coming in close and retreating back again. Then it went from a cluster of objects to appearing to be one spherical object. This happened several times. It then took off straight up into the sky and out of view, came back, hovered in the southwest at about a 9:00 position, turned into 2 spheres one on top of the other. At that point it had what appeared to be very tiny red spheres circling the top sphere and left a visible red trail around it. We watched it until it clusterd up again and took off.

Object appeared to be about the size of a Pea held at arms length. There was Northbound commercial air traffic visable in the sky, estimated to be in the vacinity of Olympia, Wa., and the object appeared to level off at or near the altitude of the air traffic and stopped and hovered for about 15 seconds.  Object then accelerated in an easterly direction, appearing to pass behind the air traffic, and stopped approximately 1 second later having transversed an estimated 45 - 50 degrees of arc.  Object hovered there for about 30 seconds.   Object then reversed direction and accelerated in a zigzag pattern to the West at about half the speed that it had traveled to the East.  There was no tail during the period after the first stop and hover.  When object reached a point that appeared to be at or near the location of the first stop it began a sweeping turn to the North, accelerated to what appeared to be the velocity traveled upon first observation, the tail reappeared, and the object began a climb at what appeared to be the same angle as the decent.  Object was visable for about 1 second then blinked out.  Color of object was approximately the same green as the exit signs posted along the road.  Speed and actions of object tend to eliminate possibility that it was any type of known aerospace technology availible today.

When the light faded another one appeared a few degrees to the left (east).  The second light did the same as the first.  It bightened then faded after about two seconds.  Neither light appeared to move or have any vertical motion.  Approximately thirty seconds later I exited the Loop onto I-20 and was then west bound.  I noticed another of the light to the southwest of the previous light by approximately 20 to 30 degrees.  The same happened with this light, when it faded immediately another appeared in the same fashion as the first set.   I did not see any other lights after this.  I also did not see any craft as the lights appeared to be more than a few miles distant.  All the lights seemed to be at the same altitude.

As we looked up we both noticed a silver/reflective object in proximity to an airplane we had been watching. The plane was obviously moving to the west and leaving a big billowy trail, while the object to its north seemed staionary in relationship to the plane and did not have a trail. I pulled to the side of the road and we watched.  The plane moved on but the silver object seemed to not be moving.  Then a little wisp of cloud passed in front of it.  We waited to see if it would reappear, but it did not and the cloud floated on. The sky was basically clear and bright blue.  There is no way to tell how big the object was, but it seemed to be close to the same size as the plane. the plane.<n>

White and brilliant in a formation. The sky apeared to have some high clowdyness and I did not see a complete circle as it seemed there must have been 20 or more lights. The arc must have covered a 20 mile (estimated area) unless it was closer than I perceived it to be. I did not see any material object but just lights and the outline or formation of a huge area of the westwern shy. If it was not for the semicircular formation I could have easily mistaken it for just an atmospheric phenomena that caused a number of brilliant twinkling lights. My neighbor came out of the house about that time and I called him over to see. Some of the lights were starting to dissapear by then but several were remainig. (Strange flares?)<n>

Object changed to four distinct lighted objects, travelling in a straight line, two by two formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Arrived home, got out of my car and looked up at the stars,as I do almost every night.  Straight up, moving to the Northeast, I saw a very large triangular sploch of light.  Hard to say it was a fixed shape, more like a luminous cloud with definate shape.  Brighter at the edges, stars could be seen, faintly, through the object but it did dim the background.  Seemed way up in the sky, but was huge, using big dipper as an indicator each edge of the shape was about 1/3 the length of the distance between the last two stars of the handle.  I watched for a few minutes, let my eyes adjust, then called my wife to come out and see.  She did see the object, although by this time it had moved to the Northeast, slowly, and had dimmed.  She went back inside, and I continued to watch, using low power binoculars.  Followed the path of the object to the horizan.  The object went from its original shape to a series of four objects in a straight line, two, then two, that acted and moved like any other satellite you may see.  The original object was not a satellite.  I remember a few years back an experiment that had been run where they released something in space to create a luminous cloud, for some type of research.  Could be similar project?  I have observed the triangular weather satellite formation that occasionally passes overhead, and have always enjoyed looking for satellites.  This was not a standard satellite.  I certainly do not have any idea what it was.<n>

The &#39;large&#39; ball was yellowish in color and the smaller light adjacent to it was no larger than a street light(at least from my perspective). The lights appeared to be in the NW Tucson/Oro Valley area, approximatly 15 to 20 miles from where I was driving. They appeared to be 2000-3000 ft. off the ground. As I drove further into Tucson, I lost sight of the object(s).<n>

Driving down I-37 South when noted that passenger was watching intently out the window on his side of the car.  I looked where he pointed and saw a series of flashing lights, though location was entirely stationary for the entire duration of watching time.  It was in roughly the SW sky of San Antonio...too high for towers, etc...light pattern and stationary status not consistent with plane or helicopter.  There were eight lights in the pattern, bluish, regularly spaced.  ... ... .   . It immediately reminded me of a &#34;something&#34; that I&#39;d seen over 35 years ago (that shape can be seen in several of the Budd Hopkins books, in fact), also in Texas.  My head immediately drew that other shape in my mind&#39;s eye. The flashing was at approximately 2 second intervals...very regular...all lights flashed off...on...off...at the same time.  After about 10 minutes of observing, it was simply not there...though did seem to reappear once we got home...over the far southwestern edge of Brooks AFB (further than the base, but that was the direction). Though the pattern was one I recognized...one that had caused me trouble in the childhood incident...I found myself merely fascinated and not in the least bit upset by the sight.  Otherwise, though, the emotional feel of the whole evening was that &#34;creeps up the spine&#34; feeling...accompanied by a rather &#34;foggy&#34; feeling.<n>

Turned head approx. 110 degrees.  Noted classic saucer shaped object glowing a whitish green.  Object was clearly defined as to shape and not distorted by light intensity.  Ojbject appeared stationary.  Estimate evelation - 4-5 thousand ft.  Could not retain sight of object lor a longer period because of driving coniderations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Center - I have followed Mr.Davenport on Art Bell&#39;s show for years, but never expected to be writing such a report. Notably, I only consulted the Center&#39;s website last evening because I thought what I had seen on 2-8-00 was some form of elaborate prank.  What was incredibly sobering for me, however, was 2-8 report from someone in North Hollywood California, of an object slowly moving east at 17:47. North Hollywood California is located approximately ten miles to the west of the location where my observation took place. Basically, it was dark and a storm was clearing.  There was a modest amount of broken cloud cover to the west.  I was heading north up the #2 freeway at approximately 65 mph.  This location placed me about seven or eight air miles north of downtown Los Angeles and almost directly to the east of North Hollywood. This time night traffic monitoring helicopters and other aircraft are not uncommon overhead, but I noted enough light from three or four sources (I think at least one or or two of the other sources were aircraft) to turn and look 90 degrees to my left.  Turning this far, I picked up a light source further to my left and then turned my head to near maximum.  Doing such, I was visually able to scan an object perhaps 35 degrees above the horizon and 110 degrees to the left and west of the direction I was driving. I only maintain this object in my vision for perhaps two seconds before safety required a return to the roadway.  I was unable to look again for another 30 seconds because of traffic considerations. However brief the observation time, the object observed was very clear. It was cleary disc or saucer-shaped.  The sharpness of its features were not diminished by clouds or weather. Dimensions are difficult to estimate, but my best estimate would be from 60 to 80 feet in diameter and perhaps 20 feet high in the middle.  The object glowed in a soft neon-type of manner and almost appeared transleuscent - - about the consistency of a jellyfish (!). Perhaps the best indicator of authenticity of my seeing this object was my immediate emotional reaction - laughter.  I could not believe this object to be any type of &#34;genuine&#34; UFO - - After all, it was so obviously a &#34;flying saucer&#34; and over a large urban area during commuter time, with sufficiently good enough visibility for it to be easily seen from both the ground and from the air.  I thought it to be a prank - an elaborate one, mind you - - cooked up by USC, UCLA or CAL TECH science students to measure societal reaction to such a blatantly obvious object.  The fact is there is a good part of me that still feels it to be a prank and that the joke&#39;s on me. Approximately 3/4 of a mile north of where I observed the object, the #2 FW begins a straight-graded climb into the San Rafael Hills.  When I reached this area I undid my safety belt and tried a couple of quick body turns in the seat.  I saw lights, but nothing distinct. In retrospect, that I didn&#39;t pull over as soon as possible after the initial sighting is pretty much explained by my laughter - that this object was clearly and distinctly there is a fact - - that this sighting was also defined as a joke or a prank by me at the time is also true. Concluding comment.  I am convinced that this object must have been seen by hundreds of people.  -Those driving south on the #2 FW and down the grade would have been afforded an exceptional view when this object was in the location it was when seen by me.  I made no special effort to monitor the local news for sighting or prank related information at the time.  I&#39;m inclined now to go back and do some checking.  I admire the person who reported what was probably the same object - seen fifteen minutes earlier - in North Hollywood.  Had that report not been earlier made and published by the Center, I would not be making this report at this time. I would certainly appreciate any additional information the comes to the Center on this matter.<n>

It would fade out and and glow back in another position in the sky. As i reached hwy 27 i turned south and saw toward the eastern sky three (same color) fireballs. Theses three fireballs would be as far apart from each other as two miles, and as close as 200 feet. The last one I seen that night was @ 8:45 South of Lake Placid, Fl. There is a Air Force bombing range nearby, but I know of no activity going on there at night. It is mostly a reservist base. I also hunt the land there through their lease program, and I never have seen any activity at night. Also two years ago when a friend and I were going to go hunt there, we saw the same thing (two orange fireballs) east of Wauchula, Fl. nowhere near the bombing range. I think this in my mind rules of any kind of military flares. I am a truck driver so I headed South towards Miami, and did not see anything else.<n>

We could see perfect detail on the jet like the wings, rear tail, etc. We then noticed after looking 20-30 seconds at the jet a circular object that at first I thought was an escort jet. I realized that it was completely circular, metallic in color, appeared larger than the jet, and left a very short tail maybe 2 object lengths long. The trail was not smoke. The object was alongside the object at 3:00 and stayed there for the duration of the sighting. I could not make any out any detail except completely circular that seemed to glow a bit.<n>

There were 10 lights all which were yellow/white in color 2 of the 10 lights were strobe lights color blue at the rear middle of the craft, lights were located on the 3 corners and located at the bottom middle of the craft 2 in the front side by side and 3 at the bottom middle side by side across the back. As it passed in front of my truck I rolled down the window and stuck my head out to look closer and heard not a sound and this craft was at a height that when I extended my arm out at the craft my hand just covered it, a jet plane at this height would have been loud but no noise.

It was completly dark around me so I couldnt see very far away but it was as if the were shadows of people around me. I cant describe it. I watched the light for about five minutes when it began to move. It moved back and forth like a pendulum. It move like it was floating it move in all direction up, down around it didnt appear to have any real direction for about 10 minutes. The lights color seemed to change from white to blue. I watched the light until it went behind a fog bank out of sight. During this whole time I had the chills and goose bump all over yet I was quit warm. I dont know what I saw but I was hopping that someone else might of seem the same thing I did.<n>

They were triangle shaped with three lights at each point of the triangle and one light colored dot-like thing (maybe it was a light) in the middle.  We were driving in the car traveling east towards Ionia.  It was on the southside of the car, directly above me.  I was thinking about the game and I happened to look out the window to try and see the big dipper.  And then I saw the 2 objects.  They flew together about 20-30 ft. apart, never breaking their formation.  It was kinda scary, so I stopped looking at them for a little while.  Then I had to look at them again, because I was interested.  And amazingly they were still there, as if they were following the car or something.  At first no one believed me, but then my sisters saw the same thing a few nights later and then they started to believe me too.  Now whenever I&#39;m alone I get this insecure feeling that someone or something is watching me.<n>

It was almost over head and I could tell it was not a star.  It was motionless &amp; silent  As I I continued to watch it I could hear aircraft approaching.  They were coming from the direction of Phoenix (possibly  Luke AFB).  I saw two, what appeared to be jet fighters, approach the object.  Then the object disappeared just as if a light switch had been turned off.  The jets turned around and went back the direction they came from.  I was shocked! I have been a registered nurse for 25yrs and thought I had seen everything. I know I should have reported this sooner but I felt sort of wierd about it as I was the only one I knew of to see it.

The lights were between 5-10 thousand feet above lake surface, on a clear night sky. One of the lights faded and suddenly reappeared and multiplied into 5 separate lights in a diagonal formation. The second light did the thing minutes later, upward and then downward diagonal formations. Both lights dimmed and reappeared at different points above the lake. We saw a small streak of light shoot out of one of the glowing lights to the ground. We took pictures but they did not come out. A helicopter passed by the lake while the lights were stationary and must have seen them.<n>

The ship had 3 very bright lights, one at each corner. The ship was a little over the tree tops, moving very slowly. I was driving down the road at first but pulled over and shut the motor off. It passed right over me and I couldn&#39;t hear it. And also there was a blinking light but I,m not sure where. I was trying to see the ship it self, between the lights, but the light were to bright, they were all I could see. From were I first saw the ship to were I lost sight of it, the ship almost seemed to be following the course of the Mississippi river, as it never strayed very for from it.<n>

When we got back she had messages on her phone message machine and returned a call. I was sitting on the couch when I heard a very loud helicopter. It was so low it sounded like it would land on the house. Mom couldn&#39;t hear the person on the phone anymore it was so loud, and she hung up. Meanwhile, I ran out of the house to take a look. The chopper was just passing overhead flying from E to W. In front of it, and off to its left side, was a grey, box shaped craft. It had no lights. It was 7:30 p.m. and very clear that night. It was easy to see the color because mom&#39;s house as the crow flys is about 3 mi. from the strip in line with the light that comes up from the Luxor Hotel. The only noise I heard was from the chopper and there were lights on it. The object appeared to be about twice as wide as the helicopter and about half the length. But as it had already passed overhead I can&#39;t be sure about the length. By then my mom came outside too but the craft and helicopter had already passed over the neighborhood and out of sight. I was so upset that I hadn&#39;t run out sooner when I first heard the noise. Also, I wear driving glasses (for distance) which I wasn&#39;t wearing and wish I had been so I could have seen more detail of the object. I watched the news and papers but never heard anything about it. I wonder if you received other reports on this date from this area. My mom&#39;s house is near Tropicana and Eastern.<n>

The neighborhood we live in is well populated and along the Kanawha Valley in WV, although there is alot of &#34;country&#34; around here.  Me and my friend had been up all night and we were talking on our walk home when we noticed what appeared to be a plane.  We noticed that it had white lights.  I saw a light appear to come on on the front of it like a light you would see on any regular plane, but I found it rather odd that the light appeared to go off and dissapeear.  When the light went off I thought the plane had left somehow but then 3 lights came on and the object then appeared to be triangular, with a light on each corner, one red, one green, and one white.  The lights were blinking and then appeared to dissappear totally.  It should be noted the duration of the entire event we never heard any sound as to whether there was an engine in the craft or not. We were stumped as to what happened but knew we had witnessed something incredible.<n>

When i got home i had a closer look on my PC and was puzzled. I thought it may have been a smudge but it was the only picture with anything + it was a close to perfect circle + the bottom decends below the cliff on the opposite headland. As usual the weather in Sinai was dry, warm and without strong wind. I will send an encompanying Email with the subject Egypt.

While I was driving my girlfriend looked up at the sky where she noticed two non-flashing white lights in front of us and a little to the west. As we continued driving southbound we noticed that the two lights were not moving at all and were too bright to be a plane. After about two minutes of driving southbound we began to move to a vantage point that was beneath the stationary object and noticed a third light completing an equilateral traingle on the underside of the object.  The lights remained perfectly round from the side (headlights) view as well as the underside view. The object produced no sound and held its position as we left it behind us.  Afterward, we noticed a large amount of air traffic in the Houston area.<n>

I was pointing out some constellations when all of the sudden he grabbed me and yelled &#34;look&#34;, I turned and looked as he pointed to a light that looked like a star, but it was moving at a constant speed across the sky kind of fast. It went for about a minute then disappeared I was kid of freaky and cool at the same time. most of the people we told tonight have laughed it off, but I swear with what ever I can that this happened tonight, And it&#39;s not the first time neither.

The light was turning colors from white to blue to red and then to white again.I watched for a few minutes and noticed it was slowly moveing to the south. I also seen it begin to move up then down then back to the southeast then back to the south. Then it would make a circular loop clockwise. I yelled at my wife and daughter to see the object. They came and watched with me not believing what they were seeing either. I then called my nephew and a coworker each living in different parts of the county to see if they could see. They did and also was at a loss as to what it was. They both seen it do the exact samethings that I was seeing. My coworker Scott Duran Used a tree limb  to line the object up with to see how it was moving and told me that it would be in one patr of the tree limb then suddenly be in a different part. There was little to no wind that night so we knew the tree limb wasn&#39;t moving. We watched until it got to the south were it stopped moving to the west and just sit there moving up,down,left, right, and doing a loop every once in awhile.It would always remain back at the same location but appeared to be going away from us. I watched until 2330 and needed to go to bed. ((name deleted))watch it out his bed room window until he fell asleep later. We also seen it Friday and Saturday but it was closer to the horizan but always moved to the south and stopped. Then moved away from us.<n>

The object was coming from the east, star-like object in the sky. The object was coming from the east, traveling in a westerly direction toward us. (We are 6 miles from the west coast of Florida) The object grew larger in size as it approched us. The only way to explain it is that it was a large mass of light, white in color. Our first thought was that is was something launched from the cape, but as it got closer we could tell that it was traveling at a rather low altitude. Suddenly it dropped something from the bottom of it like glowing embers that rained toward the ground. When it dropped the embers, the color of the light mass turned to a more reddish color. It continued to move closer to us, and turned to the south. At it&#39;s closest point to us we could see that something large was projecting from the light mass. I believed it to be a flat beam of light however my girlfriend believes that it looked like it was of substance, and not light.  It slilently moved by us slower than a plane, but faster than a balloon. As it traveled away from us to the south it&#39;s color slowly changed back to more of a white color. When it was a couple of miles away it again dropped these embers, which again rained down through the sky, and it again turned to a more reddish color. The object was visible for about 10 minutes until it was just a small red star in the distance, and then we lost sight of it. I&#39;m not good with altitudes, but if i had to guess I would say that it was only a couple of thousand feet up. As far as size, the light mass seemed to be about 100 feet in diameter, and whatever was prjecting from it was three times that width. I am 38 years old, a college graduate, a business owner, and until now, a non-believer in UFO&#39;s.  Whatever this was, it was like nothing that I have ever seen before.  It prompted me to call law enforcement, and my local newspaper. But to my dismay, my girlfriend, myself, and one neighbor were the only people to wittness this event.<n>

However, the glowing trail could be observed, looking like a &#34;glowing worm&#34; for at least a few minutes longer. Then nothing but pitch black sky could be seen. There was no sound at all. No vibration at all. and no electrical problems were noticed. This was seen from a car as we drove past the I-95 bridge and went towards the coast. I am e-mailing a map of the area for clarification. I am a registered nurse. I have never seen such an object in my life. My mother also saw this and even drew a pictue of it when we reached our destination. There was a nearby airport; perhaps they could have seen this on their radar. Whatever it was was burning up, slowly, as it traveled.<n>

The teardrop shape could have been from an aura.  I am not sure about that.  At this time, I thought maybe it was something falling into the atmosphere and burning up and the outer shape was the heat from it burning up.  Either way we didn&#39;t know.

Then a  a fifth light appears on right and drops in a curve toward ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was just reported to me by my wife.  I was watching a UFO documentary on the History channel (Sunday, 5Feb) and mention of a diamond pattern was made.  My wife had walked in the room and heard that and stated &#34;I saw that&#34;.  When I asked what she was talking about she told me of a diamond shaped lights peering through the overcast sky, as she was outside looking up between treetops.  She said her first thought was an aircraft, but noticed that the lights were stationary.  While she continued to observe the lights, very quickly another light that was as bright as the four being observed, moved directly from the right of the diamond pattern, arced downards, and dropped straight down towards the ground (in a matter of seconds).  She lost sight of that light when it went behind trees.  She then looked back up and the diamond pattern was gone.  She told me she was expecting to hear of an aircraft crash on the news latter that night.  I asked her when it happened and she stated Wednesday of last week.  I work at night and was not home at the time, but I do remember of a reporting over Seattle, presented by Peter Davenport on the Art Bell radio show.  I went outside and had her point out to me where she saw the lights.  My handheld GPS gave a compass reading of 168 degrees South/SouthEast from my location (N47.53.918/W122.11.989) and I scaled the position to be approx 30 degrees up from the horizon.<n>

As it|2/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11871.html|182|ndxe200002| Out stargazing, I noticed an unusually bright yellow light just above the eastern horizon It proceeded to climb accross the sky. As it crossed overhead I could make out two seperate lights side by side. With the absence of navigation lights, and lack of noise it appeared not to be an aircraft. It proceeded to disappear below the western horizon, being visible to the naked eye during it&#39;s entire five to seven minute arc accross the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Bagdad, AZ {N 34.34&#39;18&#34; x W 113.10&#39;47&#34;} at 9:30 pm {21:30} AZ time. Being an amateur astronomer, I was out stargazing like usual. I immediately noticed an unusual object on the eastern horizon, it was approximately a magnitude -2 and yellow in appearence. It was very out of place. Having once lived next to an airforce bombing range, it reminded me of a flare dropped by a military aircraft. It slowly rose above the horizon heading straight over me, heading due west.  As it approached I realized it could not be a flare as flares do not travel from horizon to horizon. Upon my realization that it was not a flare, aircraft, or satellite and that it was something I have never observed, I retrieved my binoculars. By the time it was directly overhead I could see that it was two individual lights {approximately 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch apart at arms length} with the aid of 10 x 50 binoculars I could see a 3rd light slightly ahead and 1/8 of the size of the two outer most lights. As the object headed towards the western horizon the two outer most lights appeared flicker once about every five seconds. It had no navigation lights, made no sound and took approximately five to seven minutes to travel from the eastern horizon to the western horizon. It did not fade out of sight, it just disappeared below the western horizon.<n>

Each had two very bright headlights and they appeared to be flying one on top of the other. They passed over the house seemingly skimming the trees; it was then apparent that one was flying just behind and above the other. On the left underside of each were bright green letters and/or numbers, large enough to be read. There was a sound like an airplane, but not as loud as a jet that close. These crafts looked man-made, but I&#39;ve never seen this large of a craft fly so low, slow or close together. I almost grabbed my daughter and ran from the house because they were so low. There was a small airplane flying above and east of the crafts, heading the same direction.<n>

They reappeared ten minutes later going the exact opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my bedroom watching television, when I noticed some lights going through the sky.  My bedroom window faces south, so I get a good view of planes landing at Boeing Field, and lights moving outside don&#39;t usually get me thinking.  This time, it was different.  The lights were moving too slow and their altitude was too low for them to be on a landing path.  At first glance, I thought they looked like Boeing 777s.  But at a closer look, things didn&#39;t seem to add up.  There were two craft, both moving at 200-250 mph.  Their altitude was approximately 2000 feet and they were lined up precisely one behind the other and about 1000 feet distance.  Their running and strobe lights were all green, which I know does not comply with FAA regulations.  They were noisy, just like any commercial jet aircraft. Their course never deviated at all, until they were out of sight.  What puzzled me the most is that they came back in the exact same formation ten minutes later, moving at the same speed, altitude, and direction as before, until they disappeared into the southeastern sky.  My home is located in the Panther Lake area of East Hill in Kent, Washington.  I don&#39;t know if this has any relation to my sighting, but earlier in the day I saw four white helicopters circling the area between here and highway 167, which is about two miles to the west.  These craft had no markings at all either.<n>

My mom and I were listening to the radio when suddenly the DJ made that annonuncement that people in and around Charlotte, NC (30 miles away) were seeing balls of light flying through the air.  I immediately drove over to my best friend&#39;s house and we watched the sky light up with brilliant flashes of light.  I don&#39;t know how to describe them except to say they definitely weren&#39;t lightning.  Later that night the government let out a release saying that it was transistors blowing up (all at the same time, during a 50 mile radius; mind you I could drive in this weather).  The next day they said that it was heat lightning (in the snow) caused by the strange change in weather (it was hot the week before).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So many people saw it, I figured somebody should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same witness.

2/2/00 19:49|Seattle|WA|Other|aprox. 2 min|Watched two flying objects headed NW, very low, very slow, at junction of Duamish River and West Seattle Bridge.|2/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11903.html|186|ndxe200002| ((NUFORC Note:  The objects were C-17 military transport a/c flying in formation.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched two flying objects headed NW, very low, very slow, at junction of Duamish River and West Seattle Bridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 1949 hrs I witnessed two large low flying objects. These objects appeared to be less than 2000&#39; in altitude. Unknown speed, but very very slow. I work in an environment that is located right on the water of the Duamish River, and adjacent to the West Seattle Bridge. As this employment results in working all shifts day or night, I physically see numerous aircraft arriving and departing Boeing Field which is very close by. The ONLY two times that I have physically seen ANY aircraft in this area that were as low as the two objects sighted was the departure of Air Force 1, and the Blue Angels. Even Air Force 1 was travelling faster on dearture (which went directly over me) than these two sighted objects. Although the shape was hard to discern, there were two distinctive white strobe type lights on what appeared to be the outer edges of the objects, both had the same lighting structure, which I also will state I have never seen this type of lighting on commercial aircraft landing at Boeing Field. NOTE: C17 link below has a excellent pic of a up close wing tip, I cannot see a large type beacon/strobe that would simulate the type of strobe I witnessed. Both objects were (to my experience and location) too far east for a Boeing Field departure, and were almost directly above the River. They then passed over the West Seattle Bridge and did not appear to change altitude or speed, they continued this heading until my view was blocked by buildings, and cargo cranes on the north side of the bridge. I did not see these objects again, however, listening to Art Bell and hearing Peter speak of this event at the end of the 10:00 hr, my shift change took place at 11:00pm, I then immediately turned on KIRO 7 Eyewitness news @ 11, newsperson Hutchinson addressed the sighting and to the best of my recollection she stated that the DOD informed their  office of 2 F117A&#39;s, out of McCord Air Force Base. Can military aircraft fly low level night missions in populated civilan areas in peacetime??????

While waiting at the stop sign to make the turn, I saw two large airplanes traveling east over the NorthCity area, coming towards LakeCity. After I made the turn onto 30 AV NE I tried to keep an I on them as they where flying VERY low and very close together, one following the other. Both planes had numerous lights on. When they got over LakeCity they banked to their right, about 90deg. It was not a sharp bank but a slow bank over a few miles, where they then continued south out of my view. In this area we see a lot of planes flying low due to the numerous large airfields around. I have just never seen two large plane in this close a formation this low before. If I had to make a guess as to altitude I would say between 1500 and 3000 feet max. Distance between planes 1/8 of a mile. I am making this report because I was listening to Peter on Art Bell&#39;s Wed., night show when he reported this. Since I saw the two objects that where reported, I thought I would say what I saw.<n>

A few seconds later,in same area, one bright amber light appearred in the same place. We were between Milepost 13&amp;14 on Plomosa Rd when this happened.  At 19:37 at Milepost 16, two amber lights appeared then disappeared about in the same area.  Just as we turned onto Joshua Rd off Plomosa....a third set of lights appeared at 19:39, this time 2. When we got home in Bouse, I called Peter to make the report when my daughter came in from outside and reported seeing one more appear in the NE towards Prescott at 20:10.  At no time did these move in a downward motion as if flares or change color. We could see flashing lights from aircraft all over but our area is well within several commerical flightpaths and the closest military base is the Marine Corps Airbase in Yuma. Nothing looked like it was chasing these lights as far as we could tell.<n>

IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS MOVING BUT THEN SO IS THE EARTH. WHEN I CAME BACK, WHICH WAS IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES, I LIVE UP THE BLOCK. I SAW A LONG CIGAR SHAPED LIGHT GRAY TO WHITE OBJECT. THIS WAS IN ADDITION TO THAT ALMOST STATIONARY LIGHT. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE CAUSE BEFORE I WENT TO GET MY CAMERA I SAW 3 HIGH FLYING PLANES WITH THE DUAL TRAILS OF SMOKE IN THE SKY. I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THEM. I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS. IT WAS THE LENGTH OF ABOUT 7 COMMERCIAL JETS IF YOU LINED THEM UP. IT WAS MOVING REALLY SLOW FOR SOMETHING THAT BIG. IT WENT BY THAT OTHER LIGHT. I NEW IT WASN&#39;T A PLANE WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE IT SEEMED TO TURN TOWARDS MY DIRECTION AND THEN IT TURNED INTO A BALL. ORIGINALY IT WAS HEADING EAST. THEN WHEN IT TURNED INTO A BALL IT STARTED TO HEAD BACK WEST. THE GUY AT THE UFO CENTER ASKED IF THIS MIGHT OF BEEN A BALLOON. IF YOU LISTEN TO THE TAPE YOU CAN HEAR HOW WINDY IT WAS. NO WAY WAS THIS A BALLOON. BALLOONS DON&#39;T FLY AGAINST THE WIND. I ONLY GOT ABOUT 90 SECONDS OF THIS CAUSE MY HANDS STARTED TO FREEZE. I WENT BACK TO MY CAR FOR GLOVES.

We used the superbowl as an excuse to go and after the game, we again drove to Mercury to see if the stars were still &#34;dancing&#34; in the skies over Grooms Lake. We witnessed these bright lights that looked almost exactly like stars except they were brighter and seemed to change colors, from a blue, to red and to silver. They &#34;wobbled&#34; or &#34;Jerked&#34; across the sky in Zig Zag patterns and looked just like a &#34;heany&#34; beam (a &#34;focusing&#34; beam found on most ophthalmic lasers) I questioned my husband on the possibility that these lights were nothing more than military experiments and that maybe they were laser lights.....like pointers being shone into the sky.  We brought the binoculars and these &#34;stars&#34; seemed to look like they were &#34;scattered&#34; JUST like a laser pointer being shown in air...we watched these &#34;stars&#34; for about an hour and then headed out to &#34;Area 51&#34; where we saw lights that seemed to be lower to the ground, more smoother in thier movements and VERY close. They seemed to &#34;dart&#34; back and forth on the horizon and seemed to &#34;blink&#34; or &#34;wink&#34; out, going from bright to dim. They got so close at some points that my husband and I were too scared to set up our tent and slept in the car. They seemed to stop around the time the sun was about to come up.  The next morning, we had a very unpleasant encounter with 2 men in desert military fatigues driving a white SUV and carrying weapons....they never got out of the truck, but followed us until we left the &#34;area&#34;....(we had attempted to go across the desert towards the &#34;forbidden&#34; areas by following a cattle trail) We have since moved from the west but are very curious if many others have been chased off area 51 by mean looking guys in SUV&#39;s..... Both my husband and I are not prone to hallucinations or delusions and hold professional positions and were NOT under the influence of drugs or alcohol during our encounter.<n>

I have not taken the opportunity to report this to any official agency only because of local redicule.  But anyway, here is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the late evening and my wife worked the grave yard shift so my son and myself went out to start and gas up her vehicle.  As we stepped out of our apartment doorway we just happened to look off to our upper left at the sametime.  What we saw was unbelieveable.  What ever it was, it was quite huge according to my recollection.  This thing was partially cloaked.  The only way I can describe is when you would watch the Romulan spaceship on Star Trek cloak itself.  You can see almost right thru it, but at the same time you kno something is there.  This thing flew at a high rate of speed going from SE to NW with absolutely no sound at all.  Nothing. In the movie, Aliens vs Predator. There is a seen that reminded my son(now age 23) of that time.  Its the seen where the Antarctic Team is looking down the tunnel in the ice and all of a sudden the Predator spacecraft flies over head with no sound at all.  The duration of that particular seen was about the same duration as my son and I! &#39;s encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could safely say that this UFO was approxiamately a football field or two long.  As to the width. We could&#39;nt tell only because of the angle we were at.  I felt stunned after what we saw.  I sent my boy to bed and decided that I should stay up late in case of any occurances.  I&#39;m full blooded native american.  I have seen things that would turn alot of other folks&#39; heads completely around.  This is one of those things that I&#39;ll remember for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Its taken me awhile to come forward cuz it was a very scary experience, and many people would question my sanity.  It was shortly after 11:00 pm, and i was reading up in my living room by myself.  We lived on shore property of a lake at the time, and our living room was an upper story room directly overlooking our lake.  My recliner was right next to our huge picture windows, and it was a great view...anyways, i simply saw a beam of light shoot into my house.  It didnt just &#34;appear&#34;, it seemed to grow from a point i could not tell over the lake, and expand into the room.  It was about the diameter of a softball, and very opaque white in color.  The most incredible thing though, is that when it reached its furthest point, it actually hit the lamp kiddy-corner from me in the room!  Immediately the light turned OFF and the &#34;lazer beam&#34;  just withdrew.  I was so completely stunned that i just sat and stared-i mean this beam had passed no more than 2 feet directly in front of me and turned off one of my lights!  So i tried not to freak out, and decided to stay where i was and watch.  No more than a minute later the same beam shot back in, hit the lamp, and turned it on!  At this point, i was beyond scared.  So i got up and ran into my bathroom, crouching low to my floor so i wouldnt get hit.  The bathroom was directly to the right of the lamp that was being hit, so i partially closed the door to &#34;protect&#34; myself and still watch. For the next 5-6 minutes the beam continued to shoot in, turn on or off the light, then recede.  After those 5 or so minutes, it didnt happen again, the light just remained off.  So from there i booked it downstairs to my mother&#39;s room.  She was trying to sleep of course so when i frantically woke her and raved about &#34;lazer beams&#34;, naturally she  was a lil&#39; peeved! But my mom sat up with me to look out her window (same lake view as upstairs) ! for a couple minutes.  We actually saw different beams of white light shooting horizontally in various directions. By the time 10-ish minutes were done, the lights were done.  I (carefully) went upstairs to make sense of it all attempt sleep.  I must add to this that When i went back up there, i heard a very low-decibal sounding hum, that kind of vibrated inside my ears, and it seemed to be all around and above our house.  I figured i was only hearing the refridgerator, but i know how that sounds-quieter and higher piched than this new sound-plus i heard it shut off short after.  The low humming continued a few more minutes, but i was so spooked i went to bed!  I should also add that there were other instances when we lived on the lake that we had seen diagonal light beams, discs, and strange sattelite-type lights.  I was 15 at the time, just a home-school student getting ready to go to college early, and always an honest, intelligent person.  I was most definately not on any hallucinogenic drugs either!  My mother can vouche for what i saw, and i&#39;m happy to share it w/ u.  But i do have a ?:  has anyone else seen these?  I really havent heard anything quite like what i saw, inspite of the fact that i listen to Art Bell and Whitley Strieber religiously! O- almost forgot to add that the next morning when i examined the window the glass was fine, the screen looked sorta burnt, and there was a perfect circle melted out of the weather plastic!  WHY?<n>
2/1/00 23:00|Paraparaumu||Circle|10 minutes|A steady white light approaches from the north, dances erratically overhead then fades and disappears|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15108.html|197|ndxe200002| A steady white light approaches from the north, dances erratically overhead then fades and disappears<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small bright object similar to a passing satellite appeared in the distance, approximately half way between the horizon and ourselves,the direction of the object was travelling to the south.It was a steady white light that moved towards us and finally directly above us where it appeared to stop and move very erratically from side to side within a small diameter. The object was easily seen through the naked eye on approach and was very high in the sky. As the light stopped directly overhead and danced for around3-4 minutes, it then began to fade as it appeared to gain altitude until it finally disappeared.The object did not make any sound or if it did, it was too high in the sky to hear anything and the night was silent! The event occured above the Paraparaumu small domestic airport. You can find that easily on a map of NewZealand. Other eye witnesses, include my sister and her husband who live in Tauranga and my brother Michael who works for yhe NZ fire service. I spent nearly 4 years in the Royal NZ Navy and I am quite capable of determining the difference between an aircraft, a satellite and an unusual sighting.<n>

I remember thinking what I woulden&#39;t give to be the pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/1/00 02:30|Lynn|AL|Triangle|15 minutes|In February of 2000, I was on routine patrol at approx. 0230 hrs CST.  As I drove behind the local High School, I observed three lights|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84837.html|201|ndxe200002| In February of 2000, I was on routine patrol at approx. 0230 hrs CST.   As I drove behind the local High School, I observed three lights in the distance behind the local Elementary School.  These lights were close together and a equal distance apart.  The color of the lights would change from white to orange (amber?) and back to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were moving in a west to east direction.  As the lights got closer, I observed that this was in fact an object with three lights of equal size spaced equally apart.  The moon was to my south southeast full or nearly full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the drivers side door of my patrol car and stood on the ground observing this object.  The object was going approx. 50 knots and there was no sound.  I could hear my police radio and the motor in my patrol car running.  The object, which was now just west and south of me appeared triangular and black or a dark color.  The object passed above and behind the High School football field and wa! s slightly longer than the field.  The altitude of the object was approx. 800 - 1000 feet AGL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason, I reached into my patrol car and activated my emergency lights and grabbed my Bushnell 10 X 50 binoculars.  Observing the object through the binoculars, I could see a couple (I don&#39;t remember now if it was 2 or 3 rows) of windows similar in shape to commercial pressurized aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These windows were in staggered rows.  I could also see artificial light coming from inside the craft through these windows.  I could see the moonlight reflecting off the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my Maglite rechargeable flashlight, which is 30,000 candlepower, and shined it at the object.  As the object moved from my right front to left and passed above and behind the south end of the High School, it instantly made a 90 degree left turn (there was no bank when it turned) and moved northbound until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These three lights I have mentioned always faced me even after the object mad! e the 90 degree turn from west to north.<n>

Not much traffic was on the road, which made this incident questionable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was driving, I was completely lite up by a pure blueish light, that stayed with me for several miles, and I do not recall any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My question has always been. Is there a helicopter that flys in that area, up to or about 20 to 30 miles out from Flagstaff?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked in law enforcement for several years, and I&#39;m even a Chief of Police now.  Does anyone have anything to add?<n> <n><n> <n><n> This felt like it was just yards from my truck.  Being a cop, I thought it could have been a search for some one, so I didn&#39;t stop to interfere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being so long ago, I believe that this could have been the correct time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
