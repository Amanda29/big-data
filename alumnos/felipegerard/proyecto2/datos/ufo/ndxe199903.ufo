Baker area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:45PM I was returning from a visit and driving along Lake Washington Blvd. headed north. I was about a mile south of the Pits when I looked up to the left and saw a slowly moving huge triangular craft with a white unblinking light in each apex and a red light centered in the middle slowly pulsing. The white lights illuminated the bottom of the craft which reflected a light grey triangular shape against the dark sky. The craft was clearly triangular. The craft was heading slightly east of north so I was expecting to be directly underneath it when I rounded the bend to the Pits, but instead, the craft was now seen to be heading hard west of north. It was so low that it disapeared over the small hill west and parallel to the Blvd. I went up over Mt. Baker and then Capital hill to try and catch it in the distance, but there were no objects-airplane or other-flying west or north west where it should have been. As an oddity, before I lost sight of it,  I saw one horizontal dim white light beam cross over and above me in a west-east direction on two occasions just before it disapeared over the hill.  This may or may not have been associated with the craft.  My first impression was that  I had been shot at with something and I jumped in the way someone would jump if you threw something at them, then I realized that the streak going overhead was a beam of light.  I grew up in the area-I have never seen a triangular craft before. I have no idea what kind of plane is like this!<n>

We were about 3 miles west of Post, TX, driving eastbound on US HWY 380.  It had been a clear day, while I was smoking, I caught a glimpse of light due south of us, nearly all the way to the horizon.  I made a comment to the effect of &#34;wonder if we&#39;re gonna get wet?&#34;  I had time to say that and roll up the window of the 4spd manual Jeep Cherokee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately this thing was right on top of us, it turned everything red, like we were driving inside a laser, I could feel weightlessness, specifically I recall feeling my penis lift up off of my testicles(sorry to be graphic).  Guy driving jumped out of his seat, over the center console, and into my lap.  He did so exactly like Scooby Doo jumps into Shaggy&#39;s arms.  Then it was all over.  Maybe 5 seconds from seeing the light on the horizon to everything being normal again, and the Jeep having righted itself, with my coworker behind the wheel.  I have no idea if time was lost or not.  if it was, it wasn&#39;t very much, because it was still around 9pm when we stopped at the gas station in town, a couple minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other thing, is that I went in to the store, and mentioned what had just happened to us.  There was a lady in the store that said she lived about 3 miles west, and her son and daughter had the same thing happen to them going the other direction(leaving Post) after a light night school function.  To be honest, that made me feel a little better, but I have always regretted not forcing my coworker to come into the store and hear the woman&#39;s story, just to validate it for him, like it did me, but whatever.  By the way, my coworker was a 19 year old professional motorcycle racer, and I was a 21 year old paramedic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what to make of any of that, I just know it happened, and it was life-changing for me.  Everytime I think about it, I wonder why, if, whatever that technology was, does exist, why have we not figured out how to desalinate the oceans and make the deserts fertile, etc.  I lost a lot of respect for my government/world community.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The object appeared to tack through the air in a south easterly direction; it would vertically float down in a straight line, and move up-wards at about a 35 degree angle to move through the air.  Out of shock, I disregarded where I needed to go, and proceeded past Wilmington Ave to follow the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of fear as I neared Willowbrook Ave I discontinued following the object (ironically not one person was outside).  The object eventually fell out of site and appeared to land in an industrial part of Compton in a South-Easterly direction near what I would approximate to be east of Santa Fe &amp; Alameda.  This is when it gets really strange.  I was initially going to church for a “new couples” marriage counseling session, so I turned around ! with my wife, proceeded West on El Segundo Blvd, headed South on Wilmington Ave, made it to church and proceeded with the counseling session.  About 1 hour later as we exited the church I excitedly informed the pastor as to what I observed, crouched down only to notice the object outside of the church to the north, hovering and rotating behind a tree.  At this point I got in my car and drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Airport)|CA|Disk|20 seconds|police helicoter crew see unknown object as it flew at their helicopter and then north at a high rate of speed, out of view.|4/26/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/006/S06277.html|6|ndxe199903| police helicoter crew see unknown object as it flew at their helicopter and then north at a high rate of speed, out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 0039 hours: A Police Helicopter crew, cosisting of one pilot and one observer, working a call in the city of Carson, Los Angeles. The pilot tells the observer, &#34;Hey! You want to see a UFO? Look at that!&#34; The observer and pilot see a orange ball of light in front of the helicopter, heading from west to east at the same altitude. The object is at 2 miles and closing. The helicopter is in right hand orbits over the call at approximately 400 to 500 AGL. The object was moving at a normal speed for the area ( under 200 knotts) at what the crew estimated at around 150 knotts or so. the object was at the helicopters 12 O&#39; clock postion as the nose of the aircraft passed through the west (270- 280 degrees) while in the orbit. the object was moving slower relative to the nose of the aircraft while it continued to orbit. As the nose of the aircraft came to about 360 degrees (north) the pilot began a straight and level flight path. The object was moving across the wind screen from left to right (from 10 O&#39; clock to our 2 O&#39; clock). As it got to the 2 O&#39; clock position, the object changed direction and did a wide right hand orbit to the south.the pilot adjusts the aircrafts flight path puting the object at the 2 o&#39; clock position again. the object then changed direction again, accelerated, and headed directly at the observers door (right side) of the helicopter. Startled, the observer, thinking he was pressing the intercom button, said to the pilot, &#34;Oh SHIT!&#34; as the object came at them. The observer had acually pressed both of the foot switches, activating both the intercom system and the radio transmitter. The object got within about 200 feet of the aircraft and then changed direction again, flying to the north at a very high rate of speed and out of view. The ground units call the office after the crew had landed and wanted to know what happened and why the crew left with out saying any thing but, &#34;Oh SHIT!&#34;. They did not see the object. It should be noted that hte object was able to change direction with out any ! type of turning manuver. it just changed direction. If you were to draw its&#39; flight path, you would draw all right angles. the only time that it turned semi-normal was when it started the right hand orbit to the south but even that did not look normal. The movement almost looked like a Hollywood special effect. I hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;m a nut but I&#39;ve been around/involved in aviation for a long time. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. The texture, the shape, the movement, the speed changes and the drastic angles all add up to it NOT being anything that I have ever seen. PS I would like to keep my name and agency out of the report but would be more than happy to speak to anyone from your organization that would be interested in this event. It was a bit un-nerving. I was the observer.<n>

It was a dull shine, not like the stars or the moon.  I looked much bigger than a star and was also closer than stars.  Went to tell someone else and of course it was gone.  I told the security gaurd we saw something weird.  He said that thing in the sky, I know, I saw it too.

It moved straight up and winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up at the sky last evening in Pittsburgh PA at 20:23(3/30/00). I was observing the stars when a bright white light(eastern/north eastern sky) caught my attention. The object was larger than a star, circular or semi circular (it happened too quick) and at first I thought it was an aircraft, since it was sitting in the usual airline flight path for landings at Pittsburgh International airport (Planes land from east to west). Then I noticed that the object was not moving. As I tried to focus harder It suddenly and without sound quickly moved straight up into the sky and winked out. I only saw one object and the whole event took place in about a 5 - 10 second period. I was the only witness. I am a 37 year old, college educated(liberal Arts), web designer and part time bartender. This is the oddest thing I have ever seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We find this to be a very interesting report.  Not only was the source a seemingly very serious-minded witness, but also, a very peculiar object was seen over Interstate 10, near Casa Grande, AZ, approximately 17 minutes later.  The witness in Arizona is an engineer, a very technically skilled person, and an excellent source of information.  He has been known by the Director of NUFORC for 32 years.  Please see that report, as well.))<n>

In a stationary position its lights would change position,intencey, and turn to a red on ocasion. I watched for about 5 min. then the light faded and showed back up over the river with in a min. My self and the others were on our way in to a class we are takeing so that we can be confermed on Easter.It was unexpected and we did have class so we went in for about an hour. When we came back out it was, to our surprize, across the river above the hill moving back and forth Still with the patern of bright lights changeing intentcy and ocasionaly turning red because of the odd movement and light we knew it was the same object. I got in my car hopping to catch up to it and get a better view but by the time I got down to the river I saw the lights one last time about a 1/4 mile away over the river they got realy bright then nothing. That was the last time I saw it.If some one could e-mail me I would like to know if any one else saw it. This is the first time I have seen any thing like this. I just want to know what it was.

Sphere was to the west of Howell Mill Rd./the Atlanta Waterworks. I stopped my vehicle and tried to find out what this object could be. Then the sphere stopped in mid-air and hung underneath the clouds. I only saw the object with my naked eyes, but it was round/circular and had no wings or rotors or tail or tailwings ... it was just a round sphere. Observed it for about a minute just hanging there. The size of the sphere was at that distance about 1/16 of a full moon. Distance to sphere was about a mile. Dark/black in color. I then very quickly left the area to pick up a camera and binoculars, but the sphere was gone by the time I came back ... (from now on I will try to keep a camera with me at all times). I am a professional commercial photographer in Atlanta, and this is my fourth observation of an UFO over Atlanta. Previous sightings include spheres/stars moving, and a &#34;meteor&#34; fireball.<n>

Hovered for approx 5 minutes, then began to move in an upward northeasterly direction stopping periodically and dropping at least two balls of light.  Stopped again and hovered for approx 4-5 minutes witnessed by both myself and my wife through binoculars. Brightness intensified approximately three times and them dimmed and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10:20 pm PST I began my nightly walk heading south.  Immediately, I observed an orangeish/red glowing object in the sky southeast of Foothill and Garey in Pomona, CA.  Kept watching the object for the next 10 minutes making my way back to my house.  As I walked north, it seemed to move north along with me.  It stopped, the light intensified and it dropped a sphere of light out of its bottom.  When I reached my house, I grabbed my binoculars and called for my wife to come out and see it.  I observed the object through the binoculars and saw red and white blinking lights on each side of the object. One more sphere of light dropped from the bottom as it hovered there. I then gave the binoculars to my wife who also observed the same.  We watched for approximately four minutes during which time the light intensified greatly several times before dimming and disappearing.<n>

I grabbed a pair of small binoculars and ran outside on my deck, at that point, to the naked eye, I watched these two sheres, come together and forma a &#39;Triangle&#39;.  I was excited, because I read so much about these type craft.  In my sight line, thru the binoculars, I could make out the shape with a white light on both sides and a red type light in the front, I am an ex-pilot and live directly under the flight approach path, for the &#39;Monterey Peninsula Airport&#39;, I know what different aircraft come and go at all times of the day.  There was no sound at all, I watched the craft go out over the Bay towards Santa Cruz, Calif.  It was heading due North to NW. At about 2 to 3 minutes, another aircraft was in the distance coming towards it, it seemed like a small propeller, private plane.  And then there was a normal commercial jet that was over my head about 8,000 feet in the approach path for San Jose International Airport, I could here the regular engine sound as it went over my head.  At that time the Triangular Craft had gone out of sight.  From the time I viewed it, there was no sound at all and there was no other activity over the Bay that was making any sound at all, except a high tide, with normal ocean noise, (as I live a block from the beach).  I did not report any of this to any Police or Airport tower agenccies, as I was excited and at the same time watching the Nat&#39;l College Basketball Game on T.V. I called one friend, who is interested in this type of data, after my sighting.  Keep up the good work, as I am always interested in your fine Web Site and continuing coverage on &#39;Art Bell&#39;s radio show. Thank you, have a great day!  Ciao,  J.F.<n>

The craft then would completely stop and travel side to side or up and down. It travel out of sight and would come back into view until finally it stopped. Then my Daughter came out and noticed the exact same lights behind us a few miles away. I got my Binoculars and verified that they were vertically shaped lights that rotated in an intelligent fashion. We then saw tiny red lights and white ones exiting the craft from the top and re-entering at the bottom. We observed the sighting at about 9:50 and it was at 12 o&#39;clock high facing SOUTH with the other craft doing the opposite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> See Above<n>

I obseved the light, stationary in the sky with binoculars,  for approximately one hour, before the cloud cover concealed it.  Three nights later I observed the same object in another part of the sky.  I summons three of my neighbors, who saw the light also.  We observed the light through binoculars for approximately 45 min before in moved below the tree line.  The entire time the light continued to change from red to green to yellow.  Through the binoculars it almost appeared the red light was rotating around in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw this light on 032699 at 2330 hours.  The thing that caught my attention is the red light that was ommiting from itt.  I got my binoculars and through them I could see the light was changing from red to green to yellow.  It also appeared the red light may have been rotating around in a circlet.  My wife and I watched the light for approximately one hour, before the cloud cover concealed it.  The light appeared to be stationary and was as bright at the stars in the sky.  Three days later on 032999 at 2300 hours I again saw the light in a different part of the sky.  Through the binoculars I could still see the light changing from red to green to yellow.  This time I summons three of my neighbors who also observed the light and the changing colors.  It also appeared this time that the light was moving.  We watched it for approximately 45  min before it dissappeared below the tree line.  We are not pranksters.  We are reporting this because we would like to know if any one else in the area has reported this thing.  We would also like to know what it is.  Two of us are police officers and  another one of us is in the  U.S. Air Force.  My dad was in the Air force for twenty five years and I lived on Air  Force Bases for much of that time.  I know what an air plane looks like and this was not a plane or a star.  None of the other hundred stars in the sky on these two nights was doing what this particular light was doing.  Tonight I&#39;m going to try and get pictures if i can.<n>

I was stationed in NORAD Mountain Complex and knew that the goverment had information about UFO&#39;s when I was working there. I have never told anyone about that until now.  I&#39;m not someone looking for attention, the reason I&#39;m writing....I have been having dreams of late that are very strange.  Let me say that I don&#39;t watch si-fi shows..well I have seen old Star Trek shows, but that was years ago.  I&#39;m someone that believes that if you can&#39;t prove it logically why talk about it.  In fact one show I really enjoy is Arthur C. Clarks show.  Anyway back to the dreams..I have seen several different kinds of spacecraft and they don&#39;t look like any thing thats been shown on tv.  I have also seen them with military aircraft that have been retrofitted.  I know they have been retrofitted because I know military aircraft designs that exist, (due to the fact I lived on a military airstrip in Colorado Springs (Peterson Airforce Base).  The planes are working with the spacecraft in going after us.  To tell you the truth, I&#39;m starting to feel very stupid telling you about this, but what the hell..I&#39;ve already started.  I relized in my dream that the military aircraft had some type of spray comming from them that made myself and the people around me sick..I can&#39;t really explain why..it just seemed that way in the dream. Last night I saw a new type of spacecrat,again, nothing like I have ever seen on tv.  The dreams are starting to bother me, do a lot of people have dreams about ufo&#39;s?  Are my dreams a result of to much tv? Like I said before, I&#39;m not someone who is a si-fi nut. I can&#39;t disclose my identification due to the fact that it could cause me problems.  I will say that I am a CEO of a non-public company that does around 2.7mm in net revenue.  I will look again to see if anyone has responded to this posting.<n>

It was definetly not an airplane. It was the shape of a saucer and had lighs going around it.  I had to rub my eyse because I could not beleive what I saw.  I watched it for a couple minutes, then I ran down the stairs yelling for my brother. I knew he would love to see it. I was screaming that there was a UFO outside and we both ran together outside to see it.  It had disapeared. I was the only one to see it.<n>

We turned easterly onto hwy 130 and stopped apprx. ¼ mile form jct of hwy 101.  We stopped and got out of the car and saw an object with lights front and back.  After a few moments I realized it was three separate objects flying in tight formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were appproximately 5 to 10 feet in diameter and flying at about 1,500 to 2,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lead object was a bright star color and appeared to be slightly larger than the two rear objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rear objects had an orange tint.  None of the objects made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects came from the west off the ocean and traveled easterly over the Nestucca Bay and began to travel east up the Little Nestucca river.  As the objects became almost parallel with us, one of the rear objects did a 90 degree turn and headed south at a faster rate of speed than before. The other rear object also turned 90 degrees, but headed straight for us in a northly direction.  After traveling apprx. 1/8th of a mile and was directly above us it did another 90 degree turn and headed back westerly toward the ocean.  This object maintained a constant speed of 5 to 10 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rear object that had headed south  was now apprx. 1 mile away.  Suddenly it mad a huge arc easterly, then across the path of the lead object, and then westerly, stopping  on a dime apprx. 5 feet behind the object that was traveling apprx 5 to 10 mph  heading back toward the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that made the large arc traveled at least 2 miles in apprx 2 seconds.  In other words 3,600 to 4,000 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two orange tinted objects continued to toward the ocean at apprx 5 to 10 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they approached a thick fog band along the ocean, I turned my attention to the lead object which was still traveling easterly at apprx 5 to 10 mph.  As I was watching it, My son yelled that he saw a huge orange explosion in the fog bank. It lasted just a brief moment and had no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we again turned our attention to the lead object, it started suddenly flashing very bright lights from underneath.  These bright flashed occurred apprx every 15 or 20 seconds.  It almost appeared as though it were taking photos of the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued easterly up the Little Nestucca river canyon (hwy 130), we decided to drive over to the coast at Pacific City to see if the fog bank had cleared for a view of the orange objects  which were now out over the ocean.  After apprx 15 minutes of driving, we realized that the fog bank was to thick for any visuals.  We then drove back to  hwy 130 and up the river to see if we could catch up with the lead object.  At apprx 6 miles up the river,  we encountered the object still flying at apprx 5 to 10 mph and flashing a bright light from underneath every 15 or 20 seconds.  We followed the object another mile, then stopped our pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other note: Within a minute of when the two orange tinted objects entered the fog bank, we could hear 2, maybe 3 fighters jets flying very low and roaring up the coast line from the south.  We thought they might be chasing the orange objects.  There are no air force bases anywhere near this location and people who live in the area almost never here jet fighters flying around, especially at very low elevations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects appeared to be able to fly from 5 mph to 4,000 mph instantly and make 90 degree turns at will.  I  honestly do not believe humans have the capability to construct  these type of flying machines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We say an odd looking craft come out of the east flying at about 600 feet. As we turned to gead west toward home, the craft was running parellel to us (but not following us or anything). It was moving at about 50-60 miles per hour. The craft has three bright, non-blinking white light on the front underside giving it a triangle appearance, but there was also a bright white light at the back of the craft giving it a kind of long square or elongated diamond appearance. My daughter said it appeared to be square shaped to her. The body of the craft was not visible, so we determined the shape by the placement of the lights. There was also a bright red, once again unblinking, in teh very center of the under- belly of the craft. We followed it in our car heading west, and then it turned sharply to the north and continued on that wasy. We trie to follow it in the car, but traffic was unusualy heavy for that time of night (even on the side streets) and we lost it after a few minutes. I had my window down and there was no sound coming from this thing.<n>

It was about 7:00 p.m. and overcast - no visible stars, in March. My wife and my daughter noticed a very, very bright light flying very low coming along from the passenger side at high speed. In a few seconds it came into view in front of us. It looked about the size and brightness of a streetlight at about 100-150 yards away. There was just one bright white light, not strobing or flashing. We were approaching a hill, and the light definitely went over the hill. We arrived at the crest within about 10 seconds.

Traveling South/soughwest to the North/northeast, I thought it was a military airplane, possibly a T-38 because I&#39;ve watched them do touch and go&#39;s from the airport, which is approximately 2 miles west from my location.  I noticed that the object was slowing down and at one point during the sighting, the object stopped.  The difficulty of the sighting was that I was in a vehicle and the driving conditions would not permit me to stop the vehicle and go outside.  But while I had stopped and was waiting for the traffic to clear, I looked north and I located the object in between a grove of trees.  I turned north on 1st Street, towards the object.  Directly in front of me, a car was turning left on a side street, therefore I lost the view of the oject.  I located the object once the car had turned, continuing on there was a bicyclist in front of me, so therefore once again my attention was diverted from the object.  When I safely cleared the bicylce, I then located the object once again, and at this time it was moving rapidly to the north/northeast.  The unique feature of this sighting is I believe from my advantage point, when I first saw the object, it would have flown through the Lincoln Municap Airport Corridor.<n>

Sphere was bright blue and translucent. Size could not be determined, but smaller than an automobile. I first thought the light my be a reflection in my windshield; I looked back to see if there were such a light and there was not.  I then thought it might be a small meteorite, but because of it&#39;s translucence and because I have witnessed several of these in my lifetime, I knew that it was not.  Further, it&#39;s trajectory was not consistent with all the other meteorites I had seen previously. Lastly, I can also state that the weather was such that I knew it was not ball lightning. The object travelled very slowly and as it started to descend over and into the city of Newport, the light simply blinked out--it was definitely the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  It was definitely NOT a &#34;alien aircraft&#34;, but rather I believe some sort of atmospheric event that has yet to be explained.  I would compare it to the same sort of events that appear to precipitate seismic activity on the West Coast.  Of course, I can testify that Cincinnati doesn&#39;t have quite the same seismic activity as Los Angeles.  I was alone, so nobody can verify my claim.

It left a contrial and moved across the sky at about the same speed as a passenger plane<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:15 on Wednesday, 3/24/99, I was taking out the garbage. The sun was still shining. I looked up and noticed, what I thought was a very strange looking aircraft. I have an Air Force Intelligence background and I have never seen a plane like this. I ran inside and got binoculars to get a better look. The UFO, jet or whatever it was, was flying at about the same speed as a passenger jet, but was much larger than a regular jet. The object was a very highly polished silver. The only way I can describe it is like a cylider with what appeared to be two smaller cylinders attached to it slightly below. It looked like the fuselage of a jet, without wings and the jet engines (much larger than normal)attached to the bottom with a small piece of connecting material. It appeared to have a small canopy at the front of the craft. I observed it for at least 5 minutes until is flew out of view. There was no sound at all. I think it may have been an experimental aircraft.<n>

At the edge of the parking area was what looked to be the head of an elk.  Little or no decomposition, flies present.  The top of the skull was removed by what on casual observation looked like 2 laser precise cuts exactly perpendicular from each other. No brain present.  Given the rather public and dramatic location, my first instinct was to think it was some kind of prank or satanic ritual.  But this layman considers the cuts (if produced by humans) could only occur with a high powered laser or a circular bone saw moved either by a precise lathe or someone with exceedingly steady hands.  Quite alot of trouble and expense for the job.  Laser perhaps not likely, as there was no burn marks on the bone. I didn&#39;t enjoy the sight nor the smell, so I made some mental notes and drove off.<n>

I woke my wife and asked her to look out to the northwest.  she saw the object too and advised me to report it to the local airport.  It moved like a kite in the wind and changed from a light green to yellow-white, to red every few seconds. it gave the appearence of moving away from me and eventually faded from view.Using binoculars, I could dissern an oval shape tilted on its edge at a great distance from me, maybe 50 miles. I waited until it faded away behind the trees.  the light source looked like a gas-filled oval tube on the object&#39;s edge. I WILL be watching again tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ioriganally saw an object changing colors around 01;00 hrs but dismissed it as some kind of sattilite or maybe a planet reflecting light.  I looked out again 1 hour later and saw it contnue to chane colors. I waited 20 minutes then went to wake up my wife. We both watched   it from inside for about 1 hour.  I called around until i got the phone number to report it.  Afterwords went outside with binoculars to confirm my suspision.  There were no other objects in the sky exhibiting the same color or movement.  It appread to h0ver and dip in the same part of the sky until about 04;00.<n>

Viewed from a sailboat on transit from Puerto Rico to the Turks and Caicos islands, heading 315 magnetic, date 03/22/99, time 22:15 island time, position 20 44 26/71 26 00, about 40 NM SSW of the Turks islands. The left group of lights consisted of 5 steady white lights in close position, the right group consisted of 2 simular lights. The two groups traveled close together, keeping the same position to each other. The steady white lights were round, maybe the size of a baseball, with short tails trailing. There was absolutely no noise. The lights travelled across the sky at an elevation of about 40 degrees, from west or northwest to east or southeast, at a steady speed, taking about 20 seconds. The sky was clear, with a few tropical clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was off watch and resting, when my mate called me up on deck, and we watched this phenomina together, looking over the right side of the boat. I wrote down the information about this observation right after, but did not report it earlier, due to not knowing this web site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an optical engineer, but have no explanation how lights like this can travel at this high speed, without any noise. These were not meteors, which I observed many times before.<n>

Heading east along the backside of my apartment complex.(This faces DFW airport which is approx 4 miles away)  I walk my dogs this direction on a regular basis and am quite familiar with the flight paths of the airport.  I noticed a multi-level bank of lights approx 500-1000 ft above the ground.  At first I thought I must be seeing a top of a building.  However, I realized that there was no building of that height any where in that location.  As I continued to observe the object I noticed that it had some kind of blinking lights.  I attempted to climb a fence to gain a better vantage but was unable to gain any better view.  The night sky was clear.  I continued to observe the object for several more seconds.  At no time did it move.  I would estimate it was 20 times the size of a commercial aircraft. At no time was there any movement.  At the time I was unable to really comprehend what I had observed.  I began to return with my dogs to my apartment.  Before I arrived I began to shudder and sweat. Realizing that I had witnessed an unusual occurance I return to the location where I had observed the object and it was gone. I walked around the complex seeking to find anyone whom might have observed the same thing.  I couldn&#39;t find anyone.  I spent the next hour or so returning to the site where I had observed the object, I also drove to the area I felt it had been located to see if by chance there was a building or anything to explain what I had seen.  There was nothing.<n>

The said that it had moved from side to side very quickly. I ran inside to retreive a pair of binoculars and spotted it again. I did observe it to dash to the south faster than any aircraft that I had ever seen. Then it zipped towards the northeast before continuing it&#39;s west to east heading.<n>

I woke up and saw the room I was sleeping in however, there were two beings in the room.  I could sense that one was a male and the other female.  The male was tucking me in bed and was a dark brown figure around 5&#39; 10&#34; with pointed ears.  I could not make out a face.  I was not afraid, but somehow felt that everything was ok.  The other one that I could sense was female was around the enterance of the bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I fell back asleep as he was tucking me in.  When I came to awake again in the middle of the night, I jumped out of bed since I had remembered what had happened and ran to the kitchen to see what time it was, it was around 2:30 AM.  Maybe a week or so later I had a scoop mark in my right top hip, about a inch and a half was the circumference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen activity in the sky prior to that night, perhaps a few weeks prior.  There were many star like crafts moving around in the sky.  I had somehow gotten crazy enough to get a flashlight and shine it up at the sky to see if any would respond.  Well, one started coming closer to the house from where I was shining the light.  Well, I was so freaked out by that and had run into the house and turned off all the lights and was frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sort of had a connection since I was around 8 years old.  There was missing time when I was 8 or 9 years old.  I remember going to bed and my bed was centered in front of a window on the second floor.  I shared a room with my two other sisters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I closed my eyes to go to sleep and I just blinked them open and it was the next day.  Maybe it was some weierd sleep thing.  But I never had anything like that happen to me since.  I remember telling my mom about it after I woke up and how strange it was to me, but she did not think anything of it of course.  But I still remember that.  I have dreams about seeing ufo&#39;s.

I went out for a closer look and saw &#39;something&#39;, and it appeared to be above the clouds moving around.  I only saw it for a slight moment before I left for my sister<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please be aware this could have been a misidentification.  I have a few possiblities as to what I saw. 1. It could have been a effect of a searchlight maybe above the clouds or below (I didn&#39;t see any visible &#39;beam&#39; (like a search light) going to the illumination in the clouds). 2. Maybe a helicopter above the clouds (account for the searchlight). I really don&#39;t know what it was.  Im not rock-solid on the time.  I know it was near 11pm.. but still 10pm.  The skies were overcast.  I could see maybe 4 stars to my southeast.  I was about to go in the house (from a short walk.. few days ago my step-mother mentioned a bright light outside, though this might not have anything to do with this whatsoever) when I saw a helicopter to my west.  I ran out near the bank and I noticed it had its searchlight on.  It looked like it was looking for something on the ground.  I looked up and noticed that there was a &#39;circular&#39; form of light either above or below the clouds (I thought it was above).  It was moving smoothly with no jagged movement, but fast.  I noticed that as I sat there, just after I looked, it nearly stopped to a halt.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing so I ran for the house to get my sister.  When we got outside the &#39;circular light&#39; was too far to our east.  We could still see &#39;flashes&#39; and the helicopter.  We both noticed about 4 flashes.  They were very fast, and very bright.  Kind of like lightning, but faster.  I thought, at the time, the flashing was coming from our east, where the helicopter and &#39;light&#39; were.  I thought I saw this &#39;light&#39; above the clouds a few times, but by this time they were miles away.  I really wish I had stayed outside and not ran to the house, I could have deffinately in my mind determined what it was... I wasn&#39;t given enough time.  The light above/below the clouds was about the size of holding an orange at arms length... and I remember it moving, but not the exact movements.  I don&#39;t know exactly how fast it moved because my &#39;sighting&#39; wasn&#39;t given enough time.  Me and my sister drove up onto Wickiup to see if it would return, but till&#39; 2:02 am we saw nothing.  It seems like the object was heading east, near the Columbia river, atleast relevant to my area.  I must also note that during the duration that the helicoter was visible we were talking about it, so we didn&#39;t keep constant eye contact with the area where th! e &#39;light&#39; or the helicopter were.  As I said, a few times I thought I saw the object moving around in the clouds ahead of the helicopter.  And once I thought I saw a &#39;beam&#39;, but I was unsure (in the vicinity of the helicopter).  I want to know if anyone else saw it so that I can understand it better.  I would also like an explanation for the flashes that my and my sister saw.<n>

The size of the lights were very small and circled one another in a counter clockwise direction.  It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky.  I cannot estimate an altitude, however, I feel that they were fairly close to the ground; less than 2000 feet?  There was no sound eminating from the objects. At first I thought it was a swarm of birds, yet these objects were illuminated and slowly disappeared from sight to the South.

At mile marker 28 all occupants in our vehicle noticed 4 circular shapes with very bright yellow lights.  Shortly after noticing this, the lights quickly dimmed - as is you were to turn out the lights.  Within seconds, two short burts of light appeared on the ground below. I have not been one to firmly believe in UFO&#39;s but after seeing these lights, I will not doubt them.<n>

I saw a triangle shaped craft moving from south to north-northwest.  There was a white spotlight at one corner and a green light at the two other corners. After about 20 minutes I went out my front door to get a better look.  It was a cold and windy night but the sky was clear. I stood on the sidewalk and saw the triangular craft again and then I noticed the other two craft and the lights were the same on them.  Now they didn&#39;t seem to be moving.  A man and a woman came by and I asked them if they believed in UFO&#39;s.  The man said they were in a hurry and they kept walking down the street.  Then a couple of minutes later another couple, a man and woman, came by and I asked them what did they think the lights were up in the sky.  After a minute the guy said he thought it might be a comet.  The woman said she thought she saw blue or green lights.  Then they left after a few minutes.  The craft still didn&#39;t seem to be moving and after about fifteen minutes I saw a small airplane, flying from north to southeast, fly under the large triangular object.   In comparison to the plane, the object seemed to be at least five times bigger than the plane.  After another 15 minutes observing the objects, the clouds started to move in and I went inside my house and didn&#39;t see them anymore.<n>

Craft was rectangular and long with rounded corners. Not a cylinder, but long. Longer sides had an illuminated rectangular red panel centered on the side. There was a series of bright white lights that appeared round in shape. The series of these lights were comprised of 4 or 5 lights. Was hard to be sure due to their extreme brightness. Craft rotated slowly and co ntinuously in a 360 degree clockwise direction. Belly of craft was not illuminated at all, but couldn&#39;t get cear view of it due to white light brightness.  Ends of craft were not illuminated at all.  No noise was detected. My car was parked on the southbound side of RT. 94 in Vernon Township, NJ across from main parking lot of ski resort. I stood in parking lot to view craft. After 10 to 15 minutes of this, the craft simply vanished.  There was no discernable take off, so I can&#39;t say what direction it went to The craft was located in an easterly direction when viewed. I have never before seen a craft like this.  Could not distinguish any markings or what the craft was made of.  Red panels on sides appeared to be backlit, like a taillight on a car.  Appeared to be a lens covering of some sort.<n>

I drove a few blocks and parked across from the mostly dark cemetary. The light grew brighter as I attempted to determine if it was a large jet coming in from the south. Then the light appeared to stop and grow brighter and a heat ripple was visible around the light. I watched closely for any side movement to indicate a plane was coming at me on a direct heading with a landing light on. I saw none. Then the object moved sideways or at a slight angle away from me as the light dimmed after 3 minutes. I could now see small red lights at the tips of a triangle and hear a slight air whooshing sound. No tail assembly was visible. I thought it might be a B-2 bomber but then for a second I could see it was complete triangle with the red lights at the tips and a large stubby silo shaped front ahead of the triangle. The bright white light was now clearly positioned on the bottom middle of the triangle and quite large. The craft then proceeded straight north at about 100 mph. and maybe 600 feet off the ground.  A few years ago I visited the control tower of the C.R. airport and was given a short lesson of a half hour in the radar room and know what the flight paths are. This object did not seem to be on the normal approaches to that airport which is 21 miles away to the northwest.<n>

The system would not let me enter it.  This happened at 8:35 p.m. above a Hotel swimming pool, in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  I was there attending a NAMES Project seminar (AIDS memorial quilt) and the last class of the day had ended prior.  Everyone else in my group went out for the night, I opted to stay at the hotel, swim and eat.  It was evening and I was alone in the pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the far end of the pool, was a bar with bartender and a man and woman having drinks.  They were the length of the pool plus some away from me, they were on stools, laughing and talking with their backs turned from me slightly.  They were under a canope and could not see the sky from where they sat.  I had done a few laps and was leaning up against the shallow end of the pool, looking up at the sky.  There were other hotels on either side of me.  If I looked directly up and a little to either side I could sky..until seeing the next tall hotel building.  Perhaps you are familiar with this strip of hotels along the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I was leaning back against the back of the pool, relaxing and looking up.  Mind you, I don&#39;t drink and see well at night.  I need glasses for seeing up close at night, but I could see the stars just fine.  I noticed, suddenly, to my right (the direction of the beach)  there was were 3 &#34;stars&#34; moving in an exact triangle shape above my head.  TO describe their pattern it would be two on the left and one on the right... so that it made a triange shape.  I hope that makes sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them move across above my head, slowly until the shape was directly over my head above.  I remember thinking &#34;my gosh, look at that.. and I looked down at the people at the end of the pool and looked back up again thinking.. if I stop and call them, I may miss this.  I want to see what this is...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, the triangle formation (the star looking objects) stopped then (it was almost as if I knew it was going to do this before it happened) the two stars on the left came together and touched briefly, made a slight spark and then went back into the original triangle shape.  Then slowly moved back off the right, the direction it originally came in.. until it disappeared over the hotel roof tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a solid craft, but three distinct &#34;stars&#34; for want of a better word, that were travelling, slowly, in a triangle shape.  There was no sound associated with this at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I told my friends of this the next morning, they say &#34;ya, right ((name deleted)), were you wearing your glasses?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I am wondering, is was there any other report of this being seen, in March in 1999 in that area?  I can&#39;t have been the only one looking up in the sky that night and seeing this..  What I didn&#39;t realize is how close Fort Lauderdale is to the Bermuda Triangle.  I hear things like this happen a lot in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I live in Salt Lake City and have only been to Florida that one time.  I have wanted to have someone document this.

A small silver ball was flying through the contrail not too far behind the plane !!!!  A UFO !!!!  It stayed in the contrail for about 7 seconds then moved to a patch of blue sky between the contrails and hovered for about 3-4 minutes then went straight up at incredible speed! This is no BS!!!    I saw the UFO in the contrails !!! It was too cool !!! I grabbed my camera to no avail, I had no film....!!! The UFO was not visible without the aid of Binoculars and it appeared to be much smaller than the plane it was following.<n>

It was apparently over Sunnybrook Rd. when 2 seperate cars, each with 3-4 inhabitants, spotted a huge object moving across the sky.  The kights, as far as I can remember, were said to be light green.  The object itself was barely visible, its size was only known by the portion of the sky it blocked.  One car tried to follow the object, but sunnybrook ends by the interstate and they could only go so far.  At the same time, on the same day, 2 kids were skateboarding at the bank on Main Street in Hurricane when they saw the same object.  They described what they saw, and it was in the same area.  There was no realation between the two groups of people.  I am not sure of the exact date or time, and the people who did see it were either too hysterical or too embarrassed to report anything.  The one thing that was most commonly used to dismiss this sighting was that it occurred on the night of a meteor shower, however, the object was around for too long, contained multiple lights, and was absolutely enourmous.  I am posting this only because I happened across this site during a project for Marshall University and hoped that someone else may read this who saw what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We are usually talking really in-depthly about life or philosophy and I was on a rant, when independently from each other we begin watching a light in the sky (keep in mind I was continuing to talk thinking nothing of the light at first). The next part is were it gets weird because I have heard no one ever describe the movement or actually the speed of the movement of a U.F.O in such a way: There are plenty of trees and power lines that acted as reference points and we were not shifting our positions or even our heads (certainly not to the degree the object moved)... As I continued to talk (on my rant, we still had not made it known to each other we were both watching it), this pure white light that was pulsating slowly seemed to move up (up like into the upper atmosphere, not North), and it moved back down, what is strange is the following: The way it moved was kind of odd because it was a keen to watching the minute hand of a clock (you can not really see it moving but you know it has by it&#39;s relation to other things on the clock face). It moved in a weird pulsating slow way up and down as I said extremely slowly. I used a utility line that was right in front of my windshield as a reference point, and the light would move above and below the line by some distance (the power line as I said is a reference to knowing the thing moved not a reference as to how big or how far away it was, because the power line was extremely closer to us than the light was). By this time my rant had ceased as I was watching this light move up and down in nonsensical ways. I asked my friend if he was watching the light (his head had been pointing in the general same direction mine had been) and he said yes. So now both of us had watch independently the light move in this weird way. We got out of the car and stood at the front to see it better and it continued briefly doing what it had been doing, before it began to pulsate, I guess you could say at a slower modulation (meaning it wasn&#39;t just blinking on and off for longer duration&#39;s of time but rather it pulsated at a slower rate almost like a heart beat slows down but more smoothly and of course visually). When the pulsating change to the slower rate, it seemed to be losing it&#39;s consistency and actually seemed like you could look through it if you were close enough. It would come back a little strong then go back to being weak but never as strong as it originally was. It did this until it pulsated slowly into nothingness (meaning it looked kind a like how a candle does when the wax builds up so much that the flame is just barley flickering slowly and then goes out very gently). I thought it was all over when the next thing I knew, an airplane, flying extremely fast and low (keep in mind, we live reasonably close to an airport and there are always planes in the sky, passenger jumbos and smaller personal planes, as well as helicopters. So although I can not be for certain because all I could see were its lights and speed (and hear its roar!) but my guess is it was a military plane. The lights on the plane were brilliant blue and red on each wing (a blue light on one wing and a red on the other) and they alternated VERY FAST (faster than I had ever seen lights blink on a plane before), it was almost like a strobe effect. The plane made a beeline for where the light had been at, in an almost perfectly straight line. The plane came out of the West/Northwest sky where Fort Cambell army base is about a county or two to our West (the object was in the North/Northeast sky). I can not state enough how fast the lights strobed from wing to wing, back and forth (I do not know if that is a sign of a military airplane or not, but it&amp;#8217;s the only plane I have ever bore witness to whose lights strobed that fast). I and my fiend do not do drugs, we had not been drinking, and although we have expressed interest in U.F.O. and &#34;Art Bell&#34; related topics, the last thing we thought we would ever be witnesses to was an actual U.F.O. If you e-mail people back about their requests, I was wondering if there had been any other sightings in our area similar to this. My brother supposedly has seen a similar object but did not pay as much attention to it as me and my friend had.<n>

First I have to say that I NEVER believed in any such thing as a UFO. Never - until last night. It was about 1:30 am and my husband and I were getting ready for bed. My husband decided to let the dog out to do its business before we went to bed. Thats when he saw a bright white light (similar to a star) in the sky. He began yelling for me to immediately come to his side. When I came he asked me to look up in the sky and tell him what I saw. I was in complete shock. There was a light flashing at approx. 1 second intervals with a red light on the left and a green light on the right. The red and green lights were also flashing but not in unison with the white light. My first thought was that it was a dying star, but why were there red and green lights? Then the object began to move in quick speeds, first moving vertically up and then vertically down. The speed of the light was simply amazing. It was not something humanly achievable. Then the light began moving at an angle (approx. 70 degrees NE) with quick speed and again resuming back to its original location. Anytime the light would resume back to its original location, the light would slightly oscilate until stability was reached.  At times the light was at a stand still and did not move. It appeared that the light was not in our atmosphere, but slightly above, hovering over it. Then the light began to move in arch like motion across the sky with great speed and again returning with great speed back to the original location. This was no airplane, helicopter, or any man-made craft. The speed of this light was very quick and swift. There are no airports near me, nor any lakes (this was not a reflection of any kind). I must also add that NO sounds were emitting from the light.  It was silent. The light maintained this pattern for approximately 3 hours. I would also like to add that I was not drunk, under the influence of anything, nor am I an insane person. I know what I saw - believe what you want.<n>

I pointed it out and said&#34;What the hell is that?&#34; ((name deleted)) said he had no idea, then it abruptly vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about a mile in the distance, judging by familiar landmarks. It was, guessing for distance and altitude, about fifty feet in diameter, spherical, silver, and NOT a weather balloon. It moved rapidly about one mile in a couple of seconds, parallel to the ground, then stopped. Then it was gone, no explosion, no descent or ascent, just gone. Thats about the extent of it. Not very exciting, just odd. However, in 1970 in Eau Claire, WI, My sister and a friend were walking to my parents house from her friends house. The walk, at a leisurely pace, takes about twenty minutes. My sister noticed a large brightly lit saucer in the sky, as did her friend. They observed it for a couple minutes, then got scared and hurried home, running most of the way. Upon arriving home, my sister was grounded for being 2 1/2 hours late. She said that she couldn&#39;t be late, she ran home and it only took her about ten minutes. My mother didn&#39;t believe her, so the grounding stuck. For the following 15 years, my sister was afflicted with stange buzzing sounds in her head. She also remembers that when they started to run, the saucer was no longer there. Deputy Sherrifs in Eau Claire County obsreved a similar object over a hill near my parents about a month prior to that, but that one was a couple hundred yards in diameter. It scorched the tops of the trees on the hill, which was observable for about ten years after. I remember the trees being burned, as I grew up with the hill visible outside my bedroom window, about a half mile away. I was born about 9 months after these events took place.<n>

They were floating in space with a slow motion on straight lines, with abrupt change in direction, constant motion with the same pattern while they were gaining altitude, tll we lost the sight of them. At first they were under a low cloud [3,000 feet] making them very easy to see, then they moved on a Westerly direction away from the cloud and we were able to follow them clearly even with the stars on the background. At this point we stopped the car, turned the lights off and got out to get a better view of this weird sight that last for about 5 minutes. What we noticed was a constant size with the increase of altitude, we lost the sight because the brightness and color went less and less. The location was the city of Lihue on the island of Kauai, Hawaii and the lights were SouthWest from us, moving on a Westerly direction. They were not a conventional aircraft [nothing can fly like that so far] or something orbiting the hearth. We are both Airline Pilots and we never seen anything like that before and we were unable to give an explation to it. This is the main reason why we decided to report this strange episode.<n>

I was out filling my bird feeder in the back yard. The night was mostly clear and being an amatuer astronomer I alway look at a clear sky. The lights appeared to be shining through the misty clouds, not on the clouds. Most aircraft in the area can be heard from about three to four miles up since I often measure time seen over time heard  parameters using my ears and eyes. There are about 10 to 12 lights total making up the object with half of the lights(5-6) making up one line of the V and the other 5 or 6 making up the other line. The angle in the V would be closer to  90 degrees than 45 degrees. The lights very much resembled typical 3 to 4 degree magnitude stars and each light remained equidistant from one another suggesting they were fixed upon a structure. They did not flash.    I would estimate the wing pattern to be about the size of a typical  727-737 jet at about 6,000-7,000 feet high which do fly overhead during the day and early night in the area which are always clearly heard. I had no idea until I looked up your web site that 3/13 was an aniversery date of a sighting. This sighting was 45 minutes past 3/13. I am quite shook about that.<n>

When I walked into my bedroom I saw I&#39;d left the drapes pulled completely back, so I decided not to turn on my lamp just yet. I stepped to the window instead just to look out at the street and the sky.  And standing there in the dark of my room, I see what I&#39;d best describe as a luminous green object, shoot downward from the southeast. It headed in a mostly western direction and slightly to the north. It was larger than the Hale-Bopp comet had been when it appeared in out skies, with an appearance similar to a comet, having a tail. Quite good sized, considering it was under the cloud cover.  You know how fast a shooting star is?  Well that&#39;s how this thing moved - *that fast!  It disappeared from my vision when it passed the roofline of the 2-story building across the street. I turned to my clock to see it was 11:00 p.m. Since I&#39;m not sure what the definition of a &#34;green fireball&#34; is, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what I saw. But I can tell you I was kinda dumbfounded.  I just stood there and quietly said, &#34;What was *that&#34;. This was nothing like any of the other craft I&#39;ve seen over the years, that&#39;s for sure.<n>

Traveled from N - S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think this was a sattellite, HOWEVER, I don&#39;t think it was one of the Iridium sats. They are geostationary.  I saw a brilliant white flash out of the corner of my eye and looked up to see a white light with a corona at extreme altitude. It had a corona.  The light appeared to make a slight &#34;J&#34; turn, but I am attributing that to atmospheric distortion. The object remained brilliant for 4 seconds, then faded rapidly. I was able to track it with the naked eye from approx 70 deg azimuth to 55 deg.  It died out and I was no longer able to see it after 55 deg. There was no red or blue shift to the light.  It did not twinkle or shimmer. It was harsh and brilliant white.  It did not illuminate the surrounding area, nor did it hurt to look at it.  It was at extremely high altitude, possibly in orbit/space. Hypothesis: This must have been a sat, however it went from N - S.  Sats move in an equatorial orbit.  Possibilities:  Russian BrightStar: sat that tried to illuminate remote areas?  Killer Sat Victim:  Derelict sat being destroyed by new orbital weapon?  Space Craft: making turn in high-altitude sunlight?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  Iridium satellites are in low earth orbit, and are not geosynchronous.  Fifteen degrees of arc in 4 seconds tends to rule out any kind of satellite.))<n>

This made me look harder due the fact that it was so low and not on the usuaul flight path of the planes coming from the New Jersey Airport (the flight path brings the planes straight towards my house not from the side as this thing flew). I paused and looked closer and noticed as it passed it blocked the takeoff lights of the planes from a distance and the treeline on Staten Island.  I yelled to my 7 year old son to look and he stated he saw it too.  We watched as it flew over the horizon towards Coney Island. I see planes, traffic-copters nightly around here but this was  definately diffrent. I explained the event to my wife and she stated I was visibly shaken.<n>

I am very familiar with aircraft off all types and I am an amateur astronomer with 20 years of experience of celectial events. This was not a shooting star or meteorite.

I stopped my car to releave myself on the side of the road when I saw a fairly medium size object, which was sphere shaped, come out of a valley region of the canyon.  There was a haze around the objact that reflcted it&#39;s gray-silver color.  A humming sound was coming from the object and the sound resonated in my ears to the point where I felt some pain.  Note that the area was very dark and the only light that orginally was there was from my headlights.  The object slowly began to rise from the valley and then suddenly accelerated when it became level with me.   It shot straight up into the sky and then it was gone.  I was fairly calm but was still troubled by what I saw.  Later when got to my dorm in la Mirada, I had much trouble sleeping and had a tremendous headache.  I woke up the next morning ok but still a little shaken.  Just for the record, I had not been drinking and in no way have I ever used drugs.<n>

I happend to look up into the sky as my eye caught some motion. I saw, looking northwest (more North than West), about 45-50 degrees up into the horizon, a moving object going from North to West in a steep, downward, diagonal trajectory. It was an ORANGE  fireball, which went by very quickly. After but three seconds or so of viewing, it then disappeared (and not behind any object, nor did it appear to even come close to the ground. The size was about a dime at arms length, maybe slightly smaller. The object appeared sperical at it&#39;s head, with &#34;sparkler&#34; like, multiple  tails streaming behind.I tell people it reminded me of the Los Angeles Laker&#39;s jersey logo (an earlier version - last few  years), which featured a basketball whizzing (at a different angle) with streamer lines following it much like a cartoon would depict motion with speed. The orange ball that I saw was very pure in color, and I did not notice any hot (white spots), or any other colors, nor did it seem to have any gaseous or particulate streams associated with it. I didn&#39;t call anyone, or any organization as I thought in my mind I had seen a meteor, and, it&#39;s no big deal.... but what got me - thinking about it afterwards - was that it&#39;s spakler tails appeared to be even in shape, and intensity. There was no sound.No aircraft apparent, to recollection. It wasn&#39;t fireworks, I am sure, nor was it a plane. Could it have been the reentry of a space object (junk) into the atmosphere? I don&#39;t know. I tell you this in full confidence and honesty, with the exception of the date (it could be a range of a week or so). I am a writer, and film editor. I was 45 years years old at the time. I am a college grad, and I also have an avid interest in the UFO phenomena, however, I would be loathe to fabricate anything for the sake of attention or novelty. Above all, I am beholden to facts, to reality. That is my report, as I am the sole viewer (to my knowledge) of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

And boy was it moving fast .all i saw then  was a dim blue type outline as it went on a angle from low west to straight up and east toward lake michigan.it was then gone so i went to get gas at a station up the road and i just couldnt keep this to myself so i mentioned it to the clerk and he really did not understand me because i dont think he could speak english to well. He just looked at me took my money and said ,thank you. so i came home and sat here a few and i went crazy thinking who do i tell and who dont i tell. dont want to be in a rubber room .so i went to my web tv and used the search mode to find this site.i also want to say that i did drive past are airport just to see if i could see anything strange .we do have a base here but they dont have the stealth bomber as far as i know and that is what this object kind of looked like but made no noise and no lights besides the dim blue outline.<n>

It was moving slowly through the valley down towards Big Fork Montana. One small, tiny cone shape with a yellowish orange top and bright white bottom zigzaged over the radio towers above camp Misery. The small one seemed to be going in and out of the valleys up and down the side of the mountain and darting around the large triangular shaped craft. The large craft turned and started moving north over the mountains and we lost sight of both of them. No lights were ever seen on the large one. It was kind of a purplish black glow. No sound from either of them. The smaller one went into a cloud and it looked like small lightning the way cloud lightning looks and reminded me of those things globes you run your hand around and the electricity follows your fingers around the globe. The lightning made no noise. We heard a faint rumbling sound a little time later. And heard aircraft about 30 minutes afterwards. Gary took pictures but don&#39;t know if they will come out said he got a shot of both of them around the radio towers together and a closer one of the smaller one as it went in the clouds and of the lightning.<n>

All I could see was 3 very bright white lights in a triangle shape.  It must have been far up in the sky and made no noise at all.  It stayed for about 30 minutes and then headed in a south-east direction.  I followed it but it disappeared when I got about 1/2 mile down the road.  It didn&#39;t move very fast, but I really couldn&#39;t tell because I don&#39;t know how far away it was.  It made no noise and did not move for approx. 30 minutes.  I was going to get my videocamera and videotape it but I didn&#39;t want to leave it because I thought it might land and I wanted to follow it.  However, other people in Glen Burnie and Pasadena, MD saw it, and they videotaped it and took a picture of it.  This occured 10 miles away from BWI Airport.  UFO watchers in this area contacted the airport about this UFO and many others spotted in the area but they claim they didn&#39;t see it on radar.  UFO watchers group also contacted military and government about this and many other UFO&#39;s and keep getting the same answer: They have no knowledge of any of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped and observed it traversing the sky from the NE to the SW.  It was triangular shaped with a light at each apex.  I&#39;m guessing that it was at approx. 2,000 feet because I saw a small private acft fly under it.  If my estimate in distance is correct, than this thing had to be the size of a football field.  The sky was clear and their was a decent amount of ambient light.  The one thing that struck me as really strange was that as soon as it flew out of sight beyong the treeline, we then saw 2 Blackhawk helicopters flying back from the opposite direction, travelling SW to NE at treetop level.  I was a naval aircrewman, so I know what I&#39;m talking about when it comes to aircraft, and I&#39;ve never seen any configuration like it before.<n>

There were no overcast conditions and my attention was drawn to a lighted object which looked like any other star except that it moved in irregular patterns.  These patterns were a continuing sereis of short movements up, down, left and right with 90 degree turns.  Occasionally the object would move in a semicircular fashion.  When viewed through an 8 power binocular the object appeared no different than any of the many stars visible nearby.  The object first appeared approximately 40 degrees above the Eastern horizon. I called my next door neighbor, who is a NASA engineer, to confirm my sighting.  She observed the same object as I and had no explanation as to what it could possibly be.<n>

After five or six minutes it turned from orange to white and seemed to close like a camera lense, or rapidly move away from me. It was too far away for me to tell. I am not a crackpot or looking for fame in any way and am reporting exactly what I saw. There were the usual stars twinkling in the dark sky and I am used to seeing them every clear morning because I always have to get up at 4am to go to work. As for the size of the object I can only hazard a guess but I would say that as it was apparently some distance away from my position, it was at least ten times larger than the largest star I could see.  I hesitated to fetch my video camera, binoculars or still camera in case it dissapeared whilst I was getting them from my study. If I see anything like it again I shall make haste to get my binoculars and camera and risk losing sight of whatever it is.<n>

Suddenly the entire village was illuminated by a flash of white light, this was immediately followed by another even stronger flash of light.  The light was so strong that the street lighting was no longer noticeable.  I looked up see where the light was coming from but could not see directly because of the buildings in my line of sight.  All of a sudden a massive florescent green cigar shaped object (about the size of a train carraige) flashed across the night sky at approx. 35,000ft.  It was travelling in a downward diagonal from northeast to southwest, such was its speed that it traversed the entire sky in a matter of seconds.  All the while there was no sound, no vapour trail and it maintained its colour and form. Immediately after this object vanished the birds started to go wild in the trees.  I would be greatful if anyone with a similar experience could email me.<n>

During this account abject will stand for the &#34;UFO&#34; and jet will stand for the chase planes.  Me and my roomate were laying on top of our apartement&#39;s roof.  We lived on the top floor of an old two story house and it was easy to step onto the roof from our stairs.  We were laying there talking when I first noticed a light VERY high in the sky.  It was coming from the west and didn&#39;t blink or change colors.  It was white and moving fast across the sky.  I know how to spot a satalite and this wasn&#39;t a satalite.  I pointed it out to my roomate and we both were watching it.  Then we noticed anouther craft flying behind it.  We both had been in the US Army and we could tell it was a jet.  You could just barely make out the wing&#39;s light&#39;s on the second craft.  After the first one went over we never heard a sound of the engine.  At first we thought it was due to the hight it was flying.  But after the one we knew was a jet got passed us we heard the second craft&#39;s engines.  The plane had already gotten almost out of sight when we finally heard it so it had to be going suppersonic!  But it never got close to the the first object.  The jet was definately giving chase to the object they were on the exact same flight path.  After both craft were out of sight we sat there and talked about what we had just seen.  Neither of us could hardly believe it.  A few minutes later we saw coming from the north a repeat of the first account!  But after the second &#34;object&#34; got passed us we noticed a second jet coming from the south on an intercept course for the second object.  The object blew right past the plane from the sout and the jet performed a high speed turn.  Neither jet ever got close to it. The first jet that waas chasing the the second object was also heard after it passed over us.  The second chase jet from the south never flew over our position so was never heard.  All three craft continued south until out of site. While I was in the Army I personally got to view many aircraft on the ground, taking off, and in the air at night.  The two objects were nothing I had ever sean before.  I was a Combat Medic and went all over the world.  My roomate was a Missile Specialist and also had seen many aircraft and had traveled greatly during his military career.  The only thing either of us could come up with was that the two objects were UFOs (I don&#39;t mean that they were Alien nature, just that they hadn&#39;t been Identified) and that a total of 3 jets had given chase.  Also that atleast two of the jets  were traveling at supersonic speeds and never got close to the objects. Object description --  The two objects were extreamly high and just looked like a white light. They never changed shape or color and never changed course. I wish to stay anonymus and do not want to be contacted by phone or in person.  I will consent to emails.<n>

The object slowly crossed the western sky, moving from north to south, paralell with the horizon in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. One of the strangest things is that shortly after that, the planet Jupiter??? (there are two planets in line with one another and this is the one nearest to the horizon and is very bright)&#39;disappeared&#39; for a minute or two then reappeared.  The owner of the 4 Winds hotel (in Puerto Vallarta) has reported the same thing occuring night after night. I have taken pictures of the object and will send them to you as soon as I have them developed.<n>

It was flashing very fast, from red to orange. I looked back and forth from the object to the road for approx. 15 mins, twice stopping to see if the object was moving. It wasn&#39;t. When I looked up at approx 21:05, the object had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When driving home from a cclass in the town of Eagar, AZ, I looked up to see a very bright light, almost exactly the same brightness as Jupiter, which was somewhat nearby. I slowed down to look at the object, and I saw that it was flashing and not moving perceptibly. However, it may have been moving toward me and I would not have known. I repeated this twice, each time noting that the light never moved. In the space of approx. fifteen minutes, I glanced from the object to the road and back every fifteen seconds on average. At approx 21:05, I looked up and observed the object again. I glanced down at the road and approx. five seconds later, I looked up and the light was gone. I slowed the car again and looked out of the windows in every direction, but could not find it. The light was approx 30 degrees elevation, and, perceptibly, two inches, when holding my finger at arm&#39;s length, above a ridge approx. eight miles ahead of me. Thhe direction of the sighting was almost exactly east.<n>
3/4/99 20:45|Phoenix|AZ|Other|Five Minutes|We saw a very bright light that looked like a comet, with a smoke looking trail coming from behind the light.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05821.html|131|ndxe199903| We saw a very bright light that looked like a comet, with a smoke looking trail coming from behind the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We viewed the light while traveling West on Interstate 60, the Superstition Freeway at about 8:45PM.  My brother saw it first, as I was driving.  He remarked something to the effect of &#34;What the hell is that a comet?&#34;  I looked up and saw an extremely bright light traveling at a very slow rate of speed in a north to south direction.  It looked exactly like pictures of comets that I have seen, a very white part, followed by a long smokey trail. It appeared fairly close to the ground, perhaps 2,000 feet. It was very bright for about twenty to thirty seconds and then it went out.  You could see what appeared to be a smoke trail after it.  It did not have any type of blinking navigation lights like an aircraft.  The bright light was at the aft end of the object as it traveled south.  It could not have been a search light from a helicopter or a landing light as it was pointing in the wrong direction(unless some crafts have landing lights on the rear of them).  We continued to look at the apparent course of travel for about 2-3 minutes.  Suddenly the light appeared again, perhaps 3-5 miles south, south west of the first sighting. I viewed the first incident through the front windshield.  I wanted to rule out reflections so I rolled down my window and viewed the lights clearly through the drivers side window. It exhibited the exact same characteristics, very bright, no Nav lights, &#34;smoke&#34; trailing from behind it.  It stayed illuminated for about fifteen or twenty seconds and went out again. You could clearly observe some type of &#34;smoke&#34; trailing from behind the object.  The smoke did not swirl or appear to move as if acted upon by rotor blades, jet engines, etc.  The object could not have been a jet, as if in afterburners, as it was moving far too slow to be a jet in burners.  Further, the color exhibited was very pure white and had not blue colored flame to it like a jet engine does.  It could not have been a balloon as it was too low, you could have easily seen the balloon being illuminated by the flame, furt! her it was moving too fast to be a hot air balloon.  It obsolutely was not any type of flare as has been reported by many in the past.  It was moving too fast to be a flare floating in the wind, and it would have been low enough to see a parachute suspending it.  Further, I am unaware of a flare that can relight itself after traveling five miles at a constant altitude.  There were no aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the light which could have released a flare.  The closest airforce base would be Luke some twenty miles to the north west and no military aircraft of any type were seen.  However, there were about a dozen commercial aircraft in the pattern around SkyHarbor.  They were very obviously aircraft with Nav lights.  Several were traveling south of the airport in an Easterly direction.  It would have been very easy for them to see the lights, at a lower altitude and directly in front of them.<n>
3/4/99 19:55|Phoenix|AZ|Cone|2 X 2 min.|Possible rocket launch unknown to Air Traffic Control.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05797.html|132|ndxe199903| Possible rocket launch unknown to Air Traffic Control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Departing PHX flying westbound sighted over SW PHX area at approx 16000&#39; what can best be described as a large bright comet shaped object.  It resembled a rocket lauch contrail and I suspect that is what it was. Unlike other rocket lauches I have seen it was traveling horizontally at a relatively slow speed (200 kt est) and the contrail was fully lit up with a bright white light uniformally.  At the front was a single point of bright white light.  As we got close to the dissapating contrail we thought that possibly an aircraft in front was dumping fuel and the residue was being lit by the city lights below.  We asked PHX tracon about this possibility and they were very unhelpful and almost argumentative.  The only known traffic was another aircraft 15 miles ahead that we also had in sight. The object was in view for approx. 2 min from a point I would estimate over Goodyear AZ traveling WSW originating at 15000&#39; and climbing to possibly 18000&#39;.  Several aircaft reported it and queried ATC.  We flew through the extreme tail end of the contrail with no odor.  The object faded from view after approx. 2 minutes and the reappeared after another 1-2 minutes at a point I would estimate as 20-25 miles SW of PHX again traveling WSW at an estimated 18000&#39;.  It was in view for approx 2 minutes at that time also and at least one other aircraft reported it.  We were then in contact with ABQ center ATC and queried them about the object. They had nothing on radar they reported. I have seen rocket launches before and this was different in several regards.  First the point that would be the rocket and the contrail were both uniformally bright white.  Not bright at the origin and fading to orange as would be expected.  Second the contrail was very wide and had the shape of a fan or as I said it had the shape of a comet but was very large.  Third and very unusual was the fact that Air Traffic Control had no knowledge of a launch.  They always give prior alerts to any such launch. I would appreciate any feedback on this object.<n>

Got out of the truck and watched the very brilliant light hover over us at approx. 1000 ft. for 2-3 min. It did not appear to move, their was no sound, bright light spherical, could not discern outline of any aircraft. The light then began to travel at rapid speed to the west(no sound), gaining elevation as it went. Watched for several minutes as it gradually faded from view over high mountain peaks approx. 50 km. to the southwest. A haze developed around the light as it travelled away from us.<n>

Second object, same as first -- but moving due South. Elapsed time, 8 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 34 year old Technical Writer, employed by a defense contractor at Edwards Air Force Base, California.  I served one tour of duty in the U.S. Marine Corps as a field artillery, fire-direction controlman.  I have spent a total of 10 years on or around military bases. 03/04/1999, 1900: Sighting occurred while driving Westbound on Avenue J, in the vicinity of 5th Street East, Lancaster, California.  The sky was full dark, clear with no clouds.  This road is two-lane, mostly open desert with very little light.  As the sighting continued, I entered the outskirts of Lancaster – a more urban environment. If my direction of travel is thought of as “12 o’clock,” the object was at 11 o’clock, approximately 50 –60 degrees above the horizon.  I do not know how long the object may have been there, as I just noticed it out of the corner of my eye.  Its speed was approximately that of jetliner – perhaps 500 mph.  Its direction of travel was from the Southwest to the Southeast.  The size of the object was the length and thickness of my thumb, held at arm’s length – approximately two inches by ¾ of an inch.  The object was ½ to ¾ as bright as a full moon, if obscured by light cloud cover.  By this I mean it was bright -- white, but with something of a haze about it.  The edges were sharply defined and its overall shape was of a “picture-perfect” comet – with forked tail.  I will send a hand drawing by snail-mail if you would like. After 30 seconds (approx.) the forked end of the tail began to spread out until a leaf-shaped “cloud” had taken shape.  Note, the head and part of the tail remained sharply defined and attached to this “cloud.”  The “cloud” was thick (no stars shown through), white and somewhat luminous from either internal or reflected light.  Looking at the “leaf shaped” “contrail” with peripheral vision, I could make out a round mass within its center – seemingly of the same cloud-like material.  This center mass, though barely discernable, remained long after the object and “cloud” disappeared. The object continued on its southeasterly course for approximately four minutes before “disappearing.”  One minute it was there and the next – it was gone, leaving the cloud behind for another one to two minutes. 03/04/1999, 1906: The second sighting occurred as I continued to drive on Avenue J, now within the urban area of Lancaster, California.  This object appeared to be just like the first, but oriented due South, and without the leaf-shaped “cloud.”  The object was lower on the horizon –perhaps 45 degrees and with a pronounced nose-down angle.  This sighting lasted approximately two minutes, before I lost sight of the object. There were two aircraft in the area of the sightings:  one, heading South at a lower altitude to the first object during the last minute or two of the sighting.  The second aircraft was at a higher altitude heading North, and observed after the second object was no longer visible. If I can be of any further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me.

It was not moving but just hovering over the hills between Golden Valley and Laughlin. We stopped the car and  got out and started taking pictures. suddenly the ball of light dissappeared behind the fanned shaped beam of light. Then both the ball of light and  the fan shaped beam of light dissappeared leaving a misty light slowly faded away. We got back in the car and drove about a 100 yards when we spotted another ball of light with a trail of light behind it moving fast towards the ground behind the hills until it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 3/4/99 around 7:00 P.M. my girlfriend, her brother and girlfriend and myself were driving down a dirt road in Golden Valley Atrizona on our way to Lauglin. It was completely dark at this time. Clear sky. I was in the passenger seat and my girlfriend was driving. The hills between Golden Valley and Laughlin were on my right as I looked out the passenger window. My girlfriend noticed an object out the passenger side window over the hills. I looked and saw the object. My girlfriends brother who lives in Golden Valley immidiately screamed to stop the car. I jumped out of the car. Over the hill hovered a large  white ball of light with a large fan shaped beam of very white lite coming directly outwards of its right side. The white fan shaped beam of light looked as if it had some sort of mist spraying in it. The ball of light that the beam was coming out of was a lighter white. It seemed to be round shaped but it was hard to see its form. As I began to take pictures it looked as if the ball of light suddenly moved behind the fan shaped beam of light. Then both the ball and beam of light vanished leaving a misty looking afterglow. This all happened in about 1 to 2 minutes. The object made absolutely no sounds at anytime. Then we noticed what looked like a fast moving plane flying towards where the object had dissappeard. We got back into the car and drove about a 100 yards when we spotted another object. This one was farther east over the hills. This was a large ball of white light with a white tail of  misty white light coming out of it. It appeared to be moving fast downwards towards the ground until it dissappeared. I am a Quality Inspector from Tukwila Washington, my girlfriend is an employee at Boeing worker and my girlfriends brother and girlfriend live and work in the Golden Valley area. None of us have ever seen a UFO before and are completely certain of what we saw.<n>

Then saw a bright white ball with a triangular white glow behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neighbor alerted me to a strange glowing green ball in the south western sky; it had a long orange streak from center of ball extending to the west.  Ball appeared as a large full moon but,like vapor; the orange streak was four times the width of the ball.  I thought a test misile had been detonated.  The sky around this ball was hazy as if smoke were in the air from an explosion.  We watched it fade for several minutes. I walked behind the house and saw a BRIGHT white ball with a triangular glow heading due south toward Fresno County.  It appeared as a comet, but was not burning up.  The tail on this thing was fan shaped, but not rounded at the trailing edge; it was straight edged.  I called everyone out of the house and we watched it for a couple of minutes. Several fast moving aircraft with their marker lights came into the area from the Fresno area and turned as if following a trail.  Up in the area where the ball had been,  Periodic BRIGHT flashes occured as if something was popping of strobe units for photography.  There were no marker lights visible, so if there was a helicopter hovering there, they had no running lights on.  All this took place in a fifteen minute span. Note:  My father-in-law was ((name deleted)).  Worker on the first moon lander, and a top level employee at Wright Pat, (Yes he has been in Hanger 18 and we know what was really there). I do not get excited about UFO&#39;s, but this was quite wierd so I thought I would let you check into it.<n>

This became visable to us as we climbed in elevation so, by the time we noticed it it was very large, suggesting it was fairly close.  It was much larger than the moon would appear to be if in the same position. The very center of the &#34;ball&#34; had a green tint that was only noticable if viewed with peripheral vision.  Also, there was a red tail eminating from the green center that extended downward at about 45 degrees.  The object seemed to grow in diameter and lessen in intensity over the next five minutes until it disappeared. It was &#34;cloudlike&#34; and I would best describe it as an explosion of some sort.  As the light diminished we noticed two other objects, much smaller.  One looked to be heading south at a high rate of speed just over the horizon of the Seirra&#39;s, while the other appeared to be dropping from the &#34;explosion&#34;.  This object moved erratically as if it were debris.  Both of these objects also looked like small comets, looking like small flashlights in the sky.  They may have been aircraft or helicopters?  One was definetly flying, but the other seemed to be &#34;floating&#34; downward and not in control.  Both were approximately the same size and had the same level of intensity.  I&#39;ve read other posts at this sight from the Fresno area, and although I thought this was much closer to us in Nevada this may have been the same object(s).  I&#39;m not trying to jump on any bandwagon but since I saw this thing I&#39;ve been searching the web to see if anyone else saw anything.  I really believed at the time that an airliner exploded.  This object was so large I assumed that many people had to see it.<n>

Noticed one set of lights that at a distance might look one bright light and as it gets nearer it turns into a pair of lights. This bright light didn&#39;t move. Called for my 27 old son to come and look at this. We got our video camera to scan in on it and look to see what it was. It moved east like it was coming towards us as it was monving I could see the shape like a wide slice of bread or a fat car without wheels. It slowed or stopped and began glowing , but it looked liked was getting bigger like if blowing up a baloon into a sphere and inside this ball there were multiple rings of circles that were pulsing .Before it came to stop it looked red,then orange to real pale orange and then expandedto this big glowing grey light blue ball with a  sherbert green halo . Again inside like I said before it was pulsing within itself with rows of circles. My son and I watched it for fifteen minutes .At one point you could see it moving away until it got out of sight. But at a great rate of speed.Then it returned back  to the place  where it originally was , then again  it left our view after a few minutes . The sky is clear because we can see the stars.

We heard a sudden sound of a jet breaking the sound barrier.(this is not very common in this area) I looked up in the sky facing north and said to my wife &#34;they are probably going to spray us (con-trails) at that instant the jet sound went away and I saw a brilliant green fireball shoot coming from the south to north, and from very high in the sky towards the ground and over north mountain range.It was partly cloudy and I could see it come in and out of the cloud cover, it lasted in my view about 2 seconds. This is the second green fireball I have seen in this area. In September I saw one in approximately the same place in the sky, except it came out of the east heading west and went over the horizon this was at dusk and it lasted about 3 seconds and was more parallel with the ground. Very awsome sight!!! Hope we can be of some help, and I appreciate all the hard work you do. I listen to Art every night and hear all the reports, just didn&#39;t think I would ever see anthing like this, now I have seen two. There is sure something to this, and with you and Art I believe we will find out someday. THANKS<n>

Some were going up, others going down, some criss-crossed each other, others were simply horizontal. In front of the streams were golden, very bright, metallic cigar shaped objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 6 pm and my mother and I were driving on Route 422 in Niles, OH, to go to the Eastwood Mall.  I looked up and noticed these streams in the sky.  They resembled the streams that jets produce in the sky as they fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s what I thought it was at first.  However, there were so many of them...about 8-10, and planes would not fly that close together.  Some of the streams were going up..some down...others were cris-crossing...some were horizontal.  I also thought that maybe they were meteors, because they had tails that looked like comets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to the parking lot, we got out and were able to stand in the parking lot and get a good look.  That&#39;s when I noticed that in front of the streams were cigar shaped, golden metallic objects.  They were so bright.  There were no wings, so these were NOT airplanes.  They were all in the same area of the sky, except for one of them.  I noticed that one when I turned around to go into the store.  It was behind us, quite a distance from the other objects.  This was the lowest one in the sky, and I was able to see the cigar shaped object much more clearly on this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other people driving through the parking lot who were also staring over in that direction and pointing, so we were not the only ones that noticed these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I have a law degree, so I like to consider myself to be a very rational person.  But I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before in my life. I think I should point out to you that I live in Trumbull County, OH...the same place where police officers chased objects in the sky a few years back.  This story was chronicled on the NBC special &#34;Confirmation&#34; a couple of weeks ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do live near the Vienna Air Base, so that may be relevant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, back in November, my mother and I also saw some strange lights in the sky, and my uncle, who was about 10 miles away at the same time, reported seeing objects on the same night as well.  There were three of them.  They didn&#39;t move at all.  They were lights, but you could tell they weren&#39;t stars.  They were too big.  They never moved.  While looking at them, all of a sudden, they just disappeared out of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>
3/4/99 16:00|Miami Shores|FL|Disk|7:00min|Craft was Disk Shaped with a dome, self illuminating bright white, saw on a clear day through my telescope.|6/23/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07944.html|142|ndxe199903| Craft was Disk Shaped with a dome, self illuminating bright white, saw on a clear day through my telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was setting in the driveway of my winter home in Miami on a clear day about 4PM.  The sky was a deep blue with a very few scattered white clouds. I noticed in the eastern part of the sky what appeared to be a white dot that was stationary. The white dot would disappear than re-appear but always stayed in the same spot. It was very high in the sky as an occasional cloud would pass in front of it. I looked at it through a pair of binuculars and the white dot seem to display a hint of a disk shape. Luckily, I had my telescope already set up in the garage as I planned to do some star gazing later that evening. I have been an amateur astromoner since I was 12 years old and am now 55 years of age. The scope I used was a 8&#34; Celestron with a 20mm wide angle lens. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. This was a disk shaped craft with a definite dome. It was hovering perfictly still but then would occasionally tilt straight up revealing it&#39;s dome. While it was tilted this way, you could see it with your naked eye as it displayed it&#39;s total top surfice area. It would keep this angle for about 5 seconds than tilt back down to its vertical position. At this angle it displayed very little of it&#39;s surface hence it would become invisible to the naked eye but was still visible through my telescope. I called my wife and told her to grab the binoculars and look. As the disk was back to it&#39;s horizonal position it could not be seen with the naked eye. She grabbed the binoculars and started scanning the area of the sky where the scope was pointing. Suddenly, the disk took off to the south so fast that it just gave a hint of a slight streak in the field of view of my telescope. That was the last I saw of it. My wife never did see it as she didn&#39;t have enough time to scan that part of the sky before it streaked off. End of Story.<n>

There was no sound, it was stationary though hovering in place - as we saw other planes in the airfield in motion. There was a glare to it.<n>

The field are well lighted and there were 12 possibly more witnesses. We were talking when someone motioned to look up at the sky toward the southwest.  There we could see a small bright light just below the cloud covered sky.  It was sort of a cigar shape and had a larger light fanning out from it toward the north.  At the tail end of the fanned out light was a blue-ish round light with what appeared to be a tail or streak of red behind it. It made no sound and never approached any closer. I estimate it was about an eighth to a quarter mile away from us. We at first thought it was a helicopter hovering a distance away then the small cigar light disappeard into the clouds yet the fanned light and blue streak remained to fade out slowly over a 5 minute period.  Moments later a real helicopter came into view but it was of a different shape and we could hear the noise of the propellers.<n>

Direction should take it over San Francisco.  No flashing lights on craft or copter(s).  All lights were very dim.  V shape was difficult to make out but was very big.  The last light of the evening was visible on the northwest horizon.  Craft headed southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My age is 53.  I am sober (or thought I was after witnessing this thing).  One of my enjoyments is looking up at the sky day or night and watching aircraft going over.  This was NOT the usual.  I am still shaken by it.<n>

While driving North on Hwy 101 in California, 5 miles So of Gilroy (about 40 miles So of San Jose), a bright light attracted my attention. Was about 45 degrees above horizon and slightly on the left of the road, traveling from right to left but descending at about a 15 degree angle. It first appeared as a very bright trail which quickly formed a blob with raggedy edges about four time the width of the original trail. Looked like it was exploding. Then everything disappeared. There was no residual trace forward. Seen at arm length, the trail (tail?) was about 1/2 inch in length, the &#34;blob&#34; about the same in diameter. There was some light clouds but the object light was very bright and could have been seen through them. The duration was very short, one second at most and object was gone by the time I called it to my wife&#39;s attention. Could have been satellite/rocket reentry, but direction seems wrong. Could be a meteorite.<n>

Shape looked similar to flock of geese formation. Thought it was huge aircraft flying very low (it was huge) but there was little sound with it. Thought it was strange it headed East towards Lake Michigan turned completely around and headed straight West. Just before it went over there were 4 airplanes traveling east together and then this craft came from the east. I am a skeptic and always thought people were exagerating when they told of sightings, so when I saw this I was in awe and it actually took my breath away. I am still trying to find an explanation for it because as I said I am a skeptic. I have been looking at pictures  of B-2 stealth bombers and that is just the form it looked like, but I can&#39;t find any pictures of the stealth at night so I do not know if it has 6 red lights on it or not.<n>

I was delivering pizzas and just stepped outside the store to make a run.  I noticed two gentlemen looking up at the sky and i looked also.  I saw at about 1 o&#39;clock high a intermittingly flashing object.  I thought it was a bird at first because it seemed to be floating on an air current.  But it appeared to be reflecting light.  It was changing from white to invisable to red.  It was angular in shape. But i got the feeling that it may have been a sphere with angular panels on it and that it may have been spinning and reflecting light from the sun.  It reminded me of when I have held a rock in my hand and turned it over and the different facets catch the light and reflect it back at me.  It just seemed to hover for a few minutes then began to descend.  This is the tricky part.  It appeared to descend but it did not change size.  It just dropped from 11 o&#39; clock where it started to about 9 o&#39; clock on my left then went across from my left to my right across the sky and continued to descend to about 3 o&#39; clock where it went below the horizon line.  I wwas told the entire event lasted about 15 minutes.  The part i witnessed lasted about 5 minutes.<n>

It sounded like a short burst of claps or compress- ions.  As I looked up I noticed several aircraft before I viewed the source of the noise.Tha aircraft I observed first were a passenger jet heading West towards Love Field and a helicopter heading N/NW. As I looked  straight up I saw a military jet making a severe bank up into the sky following a sphere that was about 60 foot in diameter.The jet followed the object East to an altitude of at least 4000 feet(yes it was that low) Then the sphere was gone,into thin air. I watched as the jet leveled out and climbed gradually heading south as it slowed it&#39;s speed.Within sixty seconds two helicopters were in the vicinity,both hovering about and scanning the area it seemed.<n>

I pulled to the curb shut off the car engine and listened for the sound of a motor. this residential area is very quiet and no sound came from the object until it was almost dierectly overhead. that is when I heard a single pop or more like a crack, as you might here from an electrical arc .from high above, I checked the time it was 7:59.  my nine year ol d granddaughter would be out of the meeting so i continued to the school a few blocks away. A couple of streets west and turning south again on Glendora Ave. I looked back to wher it should have been but there was nothing. when I arrived back home I took out my binoculars and went outside to my driveway. At about 8:30 p.m. to the north of my house are high voltage transmition lines,about 1.1/2 mi away . I saw an orange glow for maby thirty seconds  coming from that visinity. this is just north of the 210 freeway in Glendora. my street N.

The last one hoovered for about a minute and swiftly followed the other two. This was very strange because of the location and the direction they went out of our sight. We were using our binoculars when they finally started moving and the speed of them was scarey. We stood there wondering if anyone else had witnessed what we had.  The sky was very clear.<n>

We were north of Butte in an area called Elk Park.  We were being very quiet so my co-worker could concentrate on his driving.  While we both watched the road a metallic disc approximately 18 inches across came at us head-on at about 25 m.p.h and about fifteen feet off of the ground and smoothly passed right over us.  This object was completely unaffected by the weather.  My co-worker started shouting and asked if I saw that.  I asked him to describe what he had seen and he descibed the same thing I had saw.  He had never had any interest in this subject and I had always held an objetive curiosity on the subject and had never seen an object such as this.  A friend of my wife&#39;s had descibed a similiar object in the same area on the previous Thanksgiving Eve while on a Bus trip from Boulder to Butte.  She was the only person on the bus.  When she pointed it out the Bus driver stopped the bus and they both observed it for several minutes. I have a good understanding of science and aircraft and nothing I know of created by man could have moved the way this object did.  It was absolutely unaffected by the weather and was moving much too slow to generate any kind of lift.  I was also told by a very credible older friend that several years ago he had seen a strange object in the same area and it followed him all the way to Butte.  Since I hunt this area frequently myself I will keep a sharper lookout in this area.  I do not find it a coincidence that all three situations took place in bad winter weather, there was no traffic around, there were two witnesses each time and all took place in the same park. Sorry I don&#39;t have anything more substantial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has received a number of reports of UFO&#39;s witnessed during inclement weather.

It originally appeared as a &#34;ball of fire&#34; in the sky. Then two more showed up. I went in to get my camera (unfortunately a cheap one), and when I got back outside, they started moving around and changing both color and it appeared that they changed shape. I am ex-military, Aviation, these were NOT planes, choppers, or balloons of any kind. They moved in ways and at speeds that our (as in made on this planet) aircraft are simply not capable of doing. The next night my husband to a picture of what looks like the moon, except it was BEHIND him! The pictures are being sent with this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared as (in the following order) a very large ball of fire, a bright light not unlike a very bright star, then as dark gray. They moved at incredible speeds in several different directions, then would come to a complete halt instantly. The one my husband got a picture of changed colors from white to yellow to blue to red and back to white ...... then it disappeared.<n>

It changed locations several times, moving at the speed that would be expected of a helicopter, hovering over several different ridges.  After between 5 and 10 minutes, it suddenly shot away at an incredible speed, impossible for an airplane.  The next day, unknown to the other witnesses, several people came into the local country store and asked if others had seen the object, describing it in exactly the same manner. This has been going on intermittenly in this area for years, but no one likes to talk about it.  There have also been numerous cattle mutilations, the most recent reported one occurring about a year or so ago.  It was reported on the radio news as a crime, describing the bowels and eyes of the cattle appearing to be cut out surgically with a knife!!!  Locals say it was just coyotes.  This is a very rural, conservative area, and most people out here would never admit to a stranger that they might have seen a UFO. Witnesses are farmers, factory workers, and laborers.  The common explanation is that it must be secret government testing of aircraft. Over the years, the lights have appeared many times, usually hovering over ridges, sometimes appearing to land and then take off.  I am not aware of anyone saying they have witnessed any aliens or having been abducted, but I will admit here that I have had marks appear on my inner elbow that look just like where I have had a blood test (i.e., needle mark).  I have never used IV drugs and I hate needles.  Also, shortly after I moved out here to the country, I began having excrutiating joint pain, for which I was tested for lyme disease. All tests were negative, and no explanation was found.  After a couple of months of this, I had a feeling (please don&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy) that something was in the skin between by left thumb and index finger.  I got a needle and dug out an object that looked something like a poppy seed, but not exactly.  I studied it but couldn&#39;t figure out what it was, so I threw it away.  I have never had those type of joint pains since that day.  I never thought much about it until the last couple of weeks when I have been reading when I have been reading about alien abductions.  I have no counscious memory of anything like that, but I do have a just-beneath-the-surface memory of &#34;something&#34; terrible and frightening happening, and I think I know when and where it happened (1975, Murfreesboro, TN).  The almost-memories are brought back by certain chemical smells (like poison) or some types of music.  I don&#39;t know what to make of any of it.<n>

I turned to look and I confirmed his sighting. I continued driving and visually tracking the object while my wife and other son tried to see from theri position in the vehicle until the residential buildings block the view. I stopped the car in the middle of the street and ran toward the buildings trying not to loose sight of the object, I lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> triangular, black , shiny black , from my position looked like flat of unidimensional tilted 6o degrees which allowed me to see the triangular shape.  Floating, no signs of engines, no noise, descending slow, tip of triangle foward.  I thought it was the stealth bomber B17, or maybe the blackbird sr71, but the way it was just suspended in the air and the way it came out of the clouds and desappeard have me thinking to this day.  Most shocking to me was that was flying contrary to the path taken by the planes coming to O&#39;hare Int.  I feared a chrash, there are planes here all the time. We never talked about it till this day.<n>
