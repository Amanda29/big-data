In response to that Energy Pull and the definite feeling that I was being watched, I looked up at the clear blue summer sky high over the ocean water beyond; there I saw an unknown object in the sky, a DARK LONG-OVAL SHAPE, motionless when I spotted it, which, the instant  I focused back at it, (as it seemed to be observing me), the object accelerated so fast straight upward so fast that I never was able to hold it in my vision to &#34;return its gaze,&#34;  and then it seemed to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt at the time, and still do now, that this was a &#34;flying saucer,&#34; a &#34;UFO;&#34; and have never forgotten the incident, though I had no official to whom to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End of Full Sighting Report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
