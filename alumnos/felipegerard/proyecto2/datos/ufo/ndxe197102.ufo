Some of the platoon was in a smoking circle as was normal every night. I noticed in the sky a large part of the sky began to look funny.  It began to morph while remaining transparent.  I noticed the stars in that segment of the sky began to glow funny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, one of the stars began to morph in shape.  It began to elongate as if it were a cell dividing. Then just as suddenly as it began the process.  The star split into two individual stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time many other stars about 10 began to go through the same process.  I ran inside and got the D.I. on duty at the time.  He came out and watched it also.  Previous to him coming out I called it to the attention of everyone in the circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly it stopped and all the stars that had morphed into two stars stayed and the whole event stopped.<n>

We were afraid and went inside and called the Hunter Army Air Force Base nearby, and they told us it was a weather balloon in Florida.  I don&#39;t remember reading about it in the paper later.<n>

It was about 30 to 50 feet in diameter andgoing extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one second behind it was an Air Force jet fighter.  The UFO was traveling much faster than the jet.  They were so low that had it been daylight I could have read any markings on the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO glowed very brightly and was the color of fluorescentl ight tubes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is all I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, I realize 26 years is a long time, but I thought itmight help verify someone else&#39;s sighting.<n>

We looked up into the clear night sky and saw lights approximately the size of the stars and the same color, zipping around.  They were going in all different directions, never pausing, but making these 280 degree to 340 degree turns all over the place.  There were between six and eight of these lights.  We watched the lights for approximately 10 minutes and then my husband went back to the house to get someone else to verify what we were seeing.  He came back with his grandpa who said &#34;Oh, I&#39;ve seen those before&#34;.  We watched for another 10 to 15 minutes with the lights never stopping and left to return to our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

2/5/71 18:45|Conshohocken|PA|Circle|15 minutes|Very large circular craft with engine problem, descends, stabilizes,restores engines and tests them.|3/16/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16875.html|5|ndxe197102| Very large circular craft with engine problem, descends, stabilizes,restores engines and tests them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Travelling West from Philadelphia by car on the Schuylkill Expressway on my way home after work, noticed multiple orange flames, seemingly falling from the sky like a wobbling leaf descends. This sight was moving slightly from North to South as it descended, and I thought I was witnessing a plane crashing. Then to my astonishment, it stopped falling,stabilized [from the wobbling motion], and the [13] spurting tongues of orange flame I had observed, stopped licking out of their round-cornered, rectangular apertures, beginning to pulsate as colours changed to a hot electric blue-white light [behind the rectangular apertures,now].From this condition, the flame colours licked out again as orange coloured and returned to blue-white several times.When in the blue-white mode, where they ultimately remained, they always appeared to be behind the apertures, glowing calmly. All of this took place as I drove directly toward the thing&#39;s stationary position, later determined to be slightly South of the Conshohocken exit of the expressway.As I proceded closer to its location, the object could be seen to have a top side something like the tapering crown of a Mexican Sombrero, discernible by vertical windows suggesting that shape. These gave the appearance of back-lighted milk glass,with a steady non-kinetic light source, unlike the other lights aforedescribed. Those flame-lights were arranged around the lower edge of the object, ringing an apparently circular form at its bottom edge. Suddenly, as I approached more closely, the object took off at high speed, directly away from me, seemingly going from a standstill to perhaps 500 MPH, giving me the odd impression that it did not go through any intermediate speeds.At this point, I began to wonder if I indeed was seeing some new kind of plane going away with over a dozen engines, the rear of which I was observing.Then, without turning it came straight back to its former position, like a yo-yo returning to one&#39;s finger, and I knew this was no airplane! Still driving, by now I was almost under what I estimated to be its position, about 300-400 feet off the ground, at the exit area previously mentioned. Deciding to investigate further, I pulled onto the road shoulder when I estimated it was directly above me. At first, looking up, I saw nothing and thought it had somehow moved without my noticing it. Then I realized otherwise. It was a clear starry night and above me the sky was pure black for an area which I believe was 300-400 feet in diameter at the height I estimated for it. From beneath there was no trace of the perimeter flame illuminations, from which I concluded that their observed apertures were atop the bottom surface of what apparently was a gigantic discus-shaped object. The foregoing represent all of my observations. I exited the expressway at Coshohocken with the intention of stopping at the gas stations there to alert them to what was emplaced above them, but for some strange reason, I felt powerless to do as I had planned and felt directed to go straight home. When arriving there, I called The Norristown newspaper, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Willow Grove Naval Air Station to report this situation ,but was treated in all cases in a patronizing way as if I was to be more pitied than believed. After this, I took my wife and son with me to see this object, but By the time we arrived, it was no longer there,and they kidded me mercilessly on the way home . Nonetheless, I saw what I described to you and have no doubts whatsoever about it, since I had the luxury of observing this &#34;UFO&#34; continuously for 15 minutes, or more. My overall impression was that I had seen a craft whose propulsion engines were malfunctioning as it fell,that these engines were brought back to normal function when it stabilized, and that they were revved up and down for testing as it stayed in place and were then tested further with the out and back flight which appeared to me to cover approximately 5 miles from Conshohocken to King of Prussia ,PA and return.<n>

Ist thought it was moon but crescent moon was just above horizon. Object paralleled us as we drove slowly, stopping when we stopped going when we started again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we drove about 5 miles slowly but took old Warm Springs Rd. instead of 4 lane into Columbus. As dusk was almost complete I got out and walked toward it and watched for some 10-15 minutes. Suddenly I had the feeling it was gone but the object simply faded slowly as if it left behind a mist. Within the haze red green and bluish lights could be seen moving but did not seem to be spot lights, more like flood lights. It was strange that it stayed with us for so long staying the same distance and height above the trees from us except when we turned off it crossed eaterly to the opposite side of the road. Although the timeframe was long neither my (now ex-)wife noticed any missing time. it was truly remarkable to us from when first seen it was so bright and moved rather rapidly but as it slowed and paralleled us through this little &#34;speed-trap&#34; town it got dimmer and changed from the bright full moon shape to the definite football shape. It seemed to us we were seeing it edge-on as it paralleled us. Numerous other cars behind us should have seen it also but noone stopped and watched but us. I had a camera with me but had used up the film. On a recent get together in Ga when my mother died, my ex-wife and I discussed this event and she seemed to remember it the same as I remember it. Later that month we moved to Texas.<n>
