We took the scenic route, Rt 92. I was 17 at the time.  I remember we went around the last bend on 92 just before you get to Rt 202 and all these cars were just &#34;stopped&#34; along the curve, in their tracks. We stopped too. We got out of the car and looked up to see this GIGANTIC glowing object, just about where the mall would be, hovering over that spot. It looked like a huge cylinder, with a cone shaped end.  It was glowing bright and incandescent. There seemed to be an electric humming sound, very faint.  That is all I remember.  We didn&#39;t remember going to the mall. I don&#39;t remember talking to the other people who were stopped. I only remember driving home with my friends in silence.There seems to be a huge chunk of missing time during and after the event. I don&#39;t remember ever talking about it after that, except years later I did call one of the friends to ask if she remembered it. She did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

She had seen this strange looking oval shape craft, as it was flying over her house. It made a strange eerie sound, as it landed out in the field of her backyard. She told me that small 3 creatures martains like beings, came out of their spacecraft looked around in the back yard. Mrs. ((name deleted)) had called the Police to report there were strange intruders in her back yard. I don&#39;t quite remembered the whole story, but somehow the story ends as the martains got into there spacecraft and flew away as they vanished through mid air without a trace!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The orange sphere then stopped and proceeded a short distance, but with no vapor trail.  The object then stopped again before proceeding on its way leaving behind a vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

5/8/72 16:00|Livingston|MT|Fireball|3-4 seconds|1972 fireball|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18131.html|5|ndxe197205| 1972 fireball<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were vacationing, driving across country after graduating from high school.  We had crossed the boarder of Wyoming, headed in a westerly direction through Montana.  We&#39;d approached some foothills, exited off the I, and had taken a scenic, two lane road, bordered by trees on both sides.  It was approaching dusk, still bright, but the sun beginning to recede.  I was in the passenger seat with the window down, staring at the scenery.  Suddenly, a fireball rose up from behind the tree line on the right side of the road, lolled over the hood of the car, and disappeared behind the tree line on the right, as if to crash. It made a nearly perfect arc over the road and our car hood, directly in front of us.  I believe I managed to count to four as the fireball appeared and disappeared, but my friend stated it was closer to three seconds in total sighting.  To all remaining details we agree.  The fireball was orange, regular flame color on top, but was a striking green on its underside and at the edges toward the front of the object.  It looked almost as though the fireball &#34;housed&#34; a hard object; as though something the size of a VW Bug had been enveloped in flame and catapulted across the road.  If one dipped a wadded piece of paper in gas, lit it, and swung it on a string in a slow circle, you&#39;d approach the effect.  It moved so slowly there was very little if any trail. The track it took would have made a perfect circle if one used the center line of the road as circle&#39;s center; the fireball entering our view seeming from directly behind the tree line, and descending directly behind the opposing tree line.  It sputtered as well.  The effect was similar to grinding a piece of pitted metal on a wheel.  Sudden bursts of flame and sparks jettisoned from it.  From its appearance and close proximity, we would have expected the fireball to make a noise like an approaching express train, yet the was none.  Part of the oddness of the event was the fact there was no sound whatever.  We could hear ourselves gasping at the sight. My friend immediately pulled the car to the ditch, and we tensed, waiting for the sound of a crash or explosion.  There was complete silence; not even a sound of birds or crickets.  It was as eerie a silence as you could imagine.  We debated on whether to leave the car parked on the highway and hike into the brush toward the fireball&#39;s point of decent, but decided not to.  Equally odd, we discussed it for a few minutes, shook our heads, and promptly forgot about the event until five or six years ago. I have since scoured the web and books for pictures of entering meteors that looked similar to what we saw.  Nothing even approaches it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke by telephone with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  We suspect the event is accurately portrayed, although the date may be approximate.  It was at about this time that a major and celebrated sighting of something occurred, and was photographed with a movie camera, over Montana, the witness reports, as well.   PD))<n>

5/5/72 22:00|Dannevirke (New Zealand)||Formation|30 minutes|Big blue light with many smaller varied coloured lights going to and away from it|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43060.html|7|ndxe197205| Big blue light with many smaller varied coloured lights going to and away from it<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi ((name deleted)) here in New Zealand, I&#39;m ((40&#39;s)) years now, this happened at the age of 12 going on 13. I was sent from my hometown of Christchurch to the North Island to the town/now city of Dannevirke to spend a year boarding at the High School. I was in the B dormitory with nine others, it was late and we were talking quietly as you do. My bed was at the far end of the room I got up and was sitting on the ground next to a friend. I was sitting on the inner sill talking when I looked out the window, it was quite interesting I saw a bright blue light that shifted colours over a long period with smaller light glowing at its side/bottom (it was just outstanding and quite beautiful in clarity) above what would have been to me the main road of Dannevirke I can say this as it was a beautiful clear crisp night. I sat and watched for about 5 minutes while up to 10 at a time in about 30 second intervals other coloured lights came and went to the big blue light. Please remember I was 12 and no impression of anything was in my mind about what I saw, it was just lights going to a bigger blue light. I whispered to everyone to come look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there for about half an hour watching the lights go back and forth, we saw by the way the light got smaller and bigger as they went to the big light that we could judge a distance and we agreed that it was about where I said, that would put it about 1 mile away and perhaps half a mile in the air. The teacher patrolling the dormitories came in and was quite angry we were all out of our beds. We showed him the lights but were to scared to say any more, he watched for about one minute then pulled the curtains and sent us to bed. I had never seen anything before this and never since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I run my own computer repair company here in Christchurch, happily married with a 22 year old daughter who has just become an accountant. I just typed in google &#34;ufo&#34; and found this site, I will not be posting again anywhere and I am not interested in any way about ufo&#39;s. We are a Christian family and I have no conflict of what I saw. I just say it as I saw it and form no conclusions at all about it. I see it in my minds eye as clear as that night still. It was interesting. If I can add : This happening would have been seen by a lot of people and I would think it would have been noted somewhere so if you find any information from the night please post or email me if you would be so kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> silver blue steaking object zips into center of starlight sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> As strange as it may be,sometimes i feel that their was a time lapse,or loss.A nucler power plant was being built on a artifical island in the delaware river,and was not nearly completed.we were in a parking lot at augustine beach in Port Penn,De.  Yes it was in the hippy era,but no one was high or taking acid.We were parked,backed up to the river,so we were looking twoards land,not at the power plant or river.My brother noticed a shinny blue silver light on the horizion.  Then the driver noticed.  I was the last to see it, cause it would light up,but be dim.  by the time it stopped.We watched for what seemed like 5 minutes,but much later i remembered the sun was just setting when we got their.We watched this shinny light brighten,then zip,it was dimm again,but visable.It did loops,and fast stange manuvers,like nothing we have to this day.The reality of lost time came to me years later.We flashed our high beams jokinglly at the object.The last time the object lite up,it seemed to grow in size,and zipped twoards us,kinda,but went upwards,yes,upwards all the way up,so fast that it left a trial of light,straight into the center of the night sky.It was a very clear night.I will never forget that trail of light into the stars,that quickly dimmed out.Yes i said stars,but remember,the sun was just going down,then its suddenly night time,with all the stars out?<n>
5/1/72 18:00|Moline|IL|Sphere|10to15 minutes|Craft was spherical with windows turning, going up and down not more than 25 feet of the ground.|4/25/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22567.html|10|ndxe197205| Craft was spherical with windows turning, going up and down not more than 25 feet of the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Iam 41 now. I was 12 when this happened. It started out like a bright star, getting closer,in abought a 5 minute period, as I remember. It came down and hovered about 15 ft above the tree line.It was about 400 yards away from us. myself my two friends who were 12 and 15, and one set of parents. we watched it for about 10 minutes, as it went up and down 2 or 3 times. it was in line to the runway of Moline Illinois airport.A dirt road went through a cornfield where it was . To this day I cannot understand why of all places it would be in such an insignificant area. We were watching it from the trailor court where we lived. I could see the lights from it shine off the trees when it got close to them. The one thing That I do espically remember about it was the lights that continually revolved around it. I dont remember any colors. I was so scared , I remember running home crying to tell my mom. To this day I cant remember what happened after that.  I never walked down that road again, and will never forget that experience, the rest of my life.<n>

I slowly became paralyzed and had an out of body experience -- but fully conscious. It was definitely a &#34;super&#34;conscious experience. Exactly how long it lasted, am not sure. But when I regained normal consciousness the road retuned to normal and I still had my hands on the steering wheel and foot on the gas pedal and still driving -- the road was definitely straight.  I did not notice any bright lights or flying objects, before or after the experience. It might have been something electromagnetic that had been set up on both sides of the road as I passed by...but being dark out, did not notice. Whether this type of experience is caused by a strong electromagnetic field am not sure. But what else could have caused it?????<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
