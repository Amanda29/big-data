I became aware of someone sitting on the bed near my left leg, a small form or being is there as i look but in the near-darkness i cannot see the details of who it may be. Then, to the right and above the end of my bed, another form is materializing in the room by the doorway. Again, it&#39;s too dark to really see but it&#39;s as if this &#39;being&#39; were coming out of thin air. This being seemed covered in a dark cloak-like piece of clothing, hooded perhaps.  I was shocked and surprised by all of this, thought to call out to my roommate in the next room but i was immobilized, could not move or speak. The beings themselves were neautral feeling, i wasn&#39;t scared by them, just alarmed that they were there. Also, anytime you see someone just fade in like that gets you questioning things a bit. I felt as if i were a young child at one point, until realizing i was here at this time in this room and this bed ( this gets me wondering if i had similar experiences as a child ---which i believe i have, there are many strange occurrances like this from back then---). What kept me from shouting out to my roommate, also, was a voice in my head which said something like,&#34; Don&#39;t be loud, it&#39;ll wake the neighbors&#34;; we lived in a duplex, so there were other folks living on the other side of the wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Then after 20-30 seconds, two orbs, one out of the top and one out of the bottom, the orb out of the top and the bottom circled clockwise, so now there is one smaller orb, large orb, small orb, in a row up and down, at this point we all are amazed at what we are seeing, then after another 20-30 seconds, the two smaller orbs each broke-exploded into 5- 6- 7- smaller orbs, then zigzagged as in the same direction as they got smaller then disappeared, which left the large orb.  After another 5-10 seconds, the large orb got smaller then gone.<n>

THERE WAS A THIN CLOUD COVER AND IT WAS DARK OUT SIDE SO I COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT.  THE LIGHTS WERE SO BRIGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF MY HAND.  THEY WERE NOT IN ANY PATTERN.  THEY WERE JUST SCATTERED ABOUT THE SKY.  THEY WERE NOT STARS I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THEY WERE FAR TOO LARGE AND BRIGHT.  AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES MY GRANPA PULLED BACK ON TO THE ROAD AND WE LEFT.<n>

It did not look like anything I have ever seen in the skies, when it appeared it looked like it was right on top of us but very high in the night sky, it stood there for about 40 to 50 seconds as if it was watching us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and the others were just speechless, none of us said a word all we did was look up in amazement without a sound then an amazing sight happened, as it came out of nowhere it left the same way only this time we witnessed how it all happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a fraction of a second there was what appea! red to be a rapture in space, it looked like a door way to a different place in space, and just like that, the bright green yellow object was sucked in that door way and vanished it happened very very fast but all of us could see that, once the object was sucked in, the rapture closed behind the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear this is true and I have no reason to make it up I just thought  I share this event with the rest of the world. I don&#39;t know why it took me twenty years to do so but it did, believe or not I don&#39;t really care, but I&#39;m sure of my event and this is not bull story, it really happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were south of steamboat x number of miles.  Way up in the Rocky mountains of Colorado. The highway was deserted, no other cars in sight, very clear night, all of the stars were visible. Suddenly a big male deer, a buck with a huge rack, was slowly walking onto the road directly in the path we were traveling. I was in the passenger seat. The driver of the car put the breaks on and started steering into the other lane so we wouldn’t hit the deer. That scared me a lot but we barley missed it. Just a few seconds, maybe 5 seconds, later the entire area all around us lit up with blue colored flashes of light.  The flashes were very bright, lighting up everything, I remember the shadows that were casting from trees and rocks and stuff as very noticeable.  There was not a pattern in the timing of the flashes of the lights. The flashes were a few quick ones, a 1 second delay then another flash, then another delay something like 2 more flashes then another delay and then an abundance intense flashes and so on. It seemed to be coming from above car and to the left and high enough to light up everything in the area very well and way out in front of us 1000’s of yards and all directions (front left and right from where I sat).  I was yelling at my roommate, the driver to stop because I knew there was something awesome outside and really wanted to see it.  My roommate was scared and sped up, running away from whatever it was. We argued for a few minutes, then started trying to figure out what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/16/90 02:15|Blocker|OK|Cigar|10 minutes|6 Deputys at roadblock see object in level flight with large exhaust trail,explosion near nose of craft sends multiple smaller objects|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03289.html|10|ndxe199012| 6 Deputys at roadblock see object in level flight with large exhaust trail,explosion near nose of craft sends multiple smaller objects streaking to ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the above date and time, myself and 5 other deputys were working a drivers&#39; license check at the main intersection of a small rural community in our county.I had just released a motorist to go on his way when I heard one of the deputys exclaim,&#34;What the hell is that!&#34; I turned to face him and looked in the direction he was looking, which was to our northwest. It was not hard to see what he was looking at. I observed an object whose shape was hard to determine at first, as it appeared to be coming almost straight at us. I did easily notice the long trail of exhaust and flame that trailed the object. The object progressed rather slowly, about normal aircraft speed, from our northwest(right), to eventuaslly end up to our southeast(left). As the objectbecame closer and crossed our field of vision, a shape could be better made out. At first, a couple of us thought it might be an airliner that was on fire, but we could not make out any wings or tail structure. The glow from the trail of fire was illuminating the rear of the object somewhat. It should be noted that this sighting occured on a cloudless night with a 3/4 moon in the western sky, many stars visible, and a very clear view as we were far away from any city lights. When the object crossed between our position and the moon in the west, we could discern a cigar-like shape, reminiscent to me of a large missile(icbm type). The others present were in agreement as to the shape of the craft. At a point where the object was moving away to the southeast, but still mostly in front of us, we observed a very bright and instantaneous explosion near the &#34;nose&#34; of the object, immediately followed by approx. ten small objects which streaked toward the ground in a fan pattern, disapperaing in the proverbial&#34;twinkling of an eye&#34;. In fact, if we had blinked, I&#39;m sure we would have missed them, they moved so fast. At that point, a couple of us were saying our prayers and waiting for the blinding flash and mushroom cloud. The closest thing I could think of to describe what I was seeing was an icbm that had just MIRV&#39;ed. There was fortunately no explosion, much to our surprise and relief. We continued to watch the main object progress in controlled flight, to the southeast fo our position, until it finally became nothing but an orange circle of light, as if we were now looking straight at the rear end of the thing. We continued to watch the object until we could no longer see any sign of it. It flew out of our sight. It did not explode, blink out, disappear, or streak off at an unbelievable rate of speed. Once we rgained our composure, I radioed the sheriffs&#39; office and asked the dispatcher to call the FAA Flight Control Center in McAlester. He asked me what was going on because he was already getting calls from citizens around the county who had also seen the object. He called the FAA and they had no report of any scheduled aircraft or any aircraft at all for our area. Within a few minutes, the dispatcher advised me he had received a teletype over the state law enforcement net of the report of an object that landed in a farmers field near Anadarko,Ok.(approx. 130 miles west of McAlester.), and that personnel from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City were enroute to see what it was. That was the last we heard about this until the next day. I channel surfed the news all day long, checking for any mention of this incident, to no avail. Of the seven separate news stations we had available, not one mentioned anything until 1730 that evening when KOCO channel 5 in OKC made a statement that if you saw a bright light in the sky the night before and wondered what it was, you were not alone. They claimed officials at Tinker had no idea what it was either. At a second newscast on this same channel 30 minutes later, in fact, during the weather portion of the broadcast, the weatherman stated that officials at Tinker had determined that what we saw was a Russian &#34;booster rocket&#34; re-entering the earthe&#39;s atmosphere and burning up due to friction. Well, I&#39;m no &#34;rocket scientist&#34;(pun intended), but what I saw was on a perfectly level trajectory(horizontal) with no angle. There was definitely a large streak of flame behind the object, but it was emanating from the rear of the craft, not the nose as you would expect if the flame was caused by friction. The craft was not on fire, it was under propulsion. No other mention of this incident was ever heard by me. Those of us who saw it don&#39;t talk about it anymore. I still have video of the few seconds KOCO devoted to it though.<n>

Approximately 12:30am, I checked my sliding glass door, looking out to the ocean.  I saw a peculiar object hovering over the water with lights shining down and what appeared to be some sort of &#34;probes&#34; reaching into the water below.  I was stunned and just stood there wondering if my eyes were deceiving me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw the hovering object pull in the &#34;probes&#34; and ascend back up to what appeared to be a larger hovering object up above, higher in the air.  I assumed it to be some sort of &#34;mother ship&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After ascending, it descended after a few (?) minutes.  This process repeated approximately 3 times.At this point, approximately 3 hours had passed. I had to get a closer look, although I was fearful.  I walked out on my balcony and saw the lights shine towards me on the coast.  I was horrified thinking this &#34;thing&#34; was going to chase me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back in to my condo and slammed the door.  I watched from inside once again.  At this point, it ascended midway to the &#34;mother ship&#34; and took off at a very high speed, South, down the coast and disappeared from sight.  I was so frightened, living alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to leave my condo, but I was too fearful after what I saw.  Although, it was frightening, somewhat, it was truly amazing and something I have never forgotten after 15 years.  As usual, most of the people I reported this to, just laughed it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt this was worthy of reporting to your fine organization after I learned about you after watching the Peter Jennings special on UFO&#39;s.

Despite my young age, my mind was very lucid and clear.  No belief in UFO&#39;s or sightings prior to that or after the event took place.  Went out for a job on a track on a very clear night.  I heard a humming noise above me, looked above, and I saw a saucer. It was at a 60 degree angle from my position, i did not have to tilt back to look at it.  It was flat at the bottom, had a base, and capped at the top, sort of looked like a half circle.  Metallic in nature.  The lights were red and very bright, flashing on and off.  I could not determine if the base was spinning on it&#39;s axis or if i got confused by the flashing lights.  I had no time to get a camera but I&#39;m certain it was visible to other people.  It flew away into the horizon, gone from site.  It was definitely, metallic, saucer shaped, big, noisy and very visible.  A thundering jet flew over an hour later in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I report it now because I listened to Art Bell&#39;s show last night and listened to a similiar descriptive sighting.

Then, for some reason, she went back to bed, could still see the light glowing. One of our cats got up, then, from in her room, and came to my doorway,looking around awhile. Only coming partially in though, as if uncertain as to just what was going on in there...  also relevant may be a dream i had that night, in which i was walking with someone else thru a forest, feeling aware ans semi-cautious, when i looked up above us and saw a man sliding slowly, at first, and then quickly, along a thick tree branch and dropping to the ground. He wore almost caveman-like clothing, chest bare, head huge and brain-shaped.

I arose from the sofa to slip back to bed when a bright reddish orange triangle shaped object caught my attention in the night sky.  The blinds were open on the patio door and the bright light was first visible in the top upper left corner of the door as the bright object became descending toward me.  At first I thought it was a falling airplane but realized it was a UFO.  My glasses were in the bedroom so I turned and started yelling, &#34;There&#39;s something in the sky!&#34;  My husband and I met in the bedroom door and I told him to look out the patio door as I groped around in the dark for my glasses.  When I got back to the den, my granddaughter was on her knees in the playpen looking out the door where my husband was also standing and looking.  The blinds over the double windows on the left wall were also open (we lived in a rural area with few trees and no outside lights).  Through those windows, this huge object, changing colors, making a droning noise, was rolling about 30 ft off the ground and apx 20 ft from the house.  It was spectacular!  I thought it was crashing.  The shape of the object had changed from triangular to cylindrical but was all ablur with the changing colored lights and the rolling motion.  It went directly behind our house and three small white planes enterred it from different directions, very fast like bees.  As it cleared the small hill behind our property, it shot a bright green star at us that got larger as it came closer then seemed to just fade out.  We marveled over the event for a few minutes, and surprisingly enough, went back to bed and to sleep (including the baby) and didn&#39;t mention it again for approximately forty hours. This was reported in the Dallas Morning News on December 10, 1990, as a Soviet booster rocket plunging to earth.  However, their archived story is somewhat different from the story that was actually printed in the newspaper. We witnessed the event in Canton, Texas which is fifty-five miles east of Dallas.  The object was first seen in the southwest coming east then turned and headed due west towards Dallas.  It appeared to be propelled and not out of control.  It was an unforgetable experience!<n>

I was in the first year of high school and had the choice of taking astronomy lessons after school hours. As curious I was and still am about space and extraterrestrial life I decided to take those lessons and every time I came back from school and it was dark outside I took my dad into the back yard and pointed out the stars I&#39;ve learned about that lesson, so also that night in December. My dad and I were standing in the back yard looking at the stars when we suddenly spotted a bright orange sphere (as big as Jupiter, but not as bright) high up in the sky moving slowly from West to East. Initially we thought it was a satellite reflecting the sun, because it didn&#39;t make any sound. I called my older brother to join us and show him what we spotted. Slowly it went straight over our heads and when it just passed us it suddenly stopped without slowing down first. We all made a sound of disbelieve. Than after a few seconds it started to move backwards at same speed and stopped again without slowing down. Now it was straight up above our heads. I guess it stayed there for about five, maybe ten seconds and than it moved so much faster than before in North West direction. We ran to the front of the house, hoping to still get a glimpse of the sphere, but it already disappeared. When we talked about our experience together we all found out that we had exact the same feeling when the sphere stopped exactly above our heads…the very strong feeling of being watched. Although I watch the dark sky almost every night I am not lucky enough yet to experience it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>
