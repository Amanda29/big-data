The wx was clear and sunny and the wind was northerly. I was in Gasworks Park when I saw the object coming from the north. Its altitude was probably around 2000 feet.It twisted about as it proceded.It had the appearance of being made of plastic sheet. I had the thought that someone had glued together some plastic garbage bags  and filled the thing with  helium.It headed  south, over Lake Union. I didn&#39;t watch it out of sight so I don&#39;t know what happened to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are quite familiar with Gasworks Park in Seattle.

He pointed to my right and I looked over.  About a 150 feet over to my right thier was a disk shape ufo flying about 50 feet off the ground at about 45 miles per hour.  It had larg squar sheets of aluminum mettle.  It was so close I could see it hade rivets in the squar sheets of metale.  It had gold tinted windows that rotated and when they rotated around I saw the non humanbeings and I could tell they where looking at me.  As my grandpa drove forward we started to go over a bridge with rail road tracks beneith it, as the bridge whent up the ufo stayed it&#39;s course.  I leaned up in my seat to look at it longer but as the bridge got higher my view of the ufo disapeared.  When we came over the other side of the bridge I never saw it again.  I think the clear view of the rail road tracks was used like a magnetic run way for the ufo?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I just canot explain it and nothing has come about in the last twenty years that can. There are no planes, Shuttle Craft, Or anything else that has been invented that i know of that looks any thing like what i saw. Myself and a friend were on a fishing trip in west cork,We were about ten miles from the coast heading down a rural road driveing at mabey fifty miles an hour.I am going down a slight hill and on both sides there are hedgerows with small spindely trees every so often and its hilly country side were driveing trough, Its dark and about one o&#39;clock in the morning, All of a sudden with no warning a green light passed across the car from left to right like a scan the light did not seem to enter the car, It made a noticeable movement that i can only describe as being like a fine line of light that did not spread out and light up the whole road only the area we were in. It had a difference about it that i have never come across again.As it crossed away from the right hand side of the car i caught a breef glims of something glowing green moveing away over a slight hill the glims only lasted a few seconds. By the time i stoped the car and got out it had vanished, Myself and my friend just stood there with no explaination as to what had just happened I asked if he&#39;ed seen it, He said he had,We were amased but only stayed a few minutes at the place and drove on, its odd but i dont realy remember us haveing much to say about it as we drove to the coast were we saw it again, It must have been fifteen or twenty minutes later when we got to the beach i had stoped and parked the car and was eager to get out of it and look at the sky it was a very clear night with very little cloud and as i looked out over the sea i saw it, it must have been a few miles out and hovering over the sea, It was a green ball of light, pure green light,It held there for a couple of seconds two at the most and then in a flash it raced acrossed the sea and it was gone.My friend said he only saw a flash of green light at the horizon as he got out of the car. I swear that this sighting is true, It has left me hopeing that in my lifetime it will be proved that were not alone in this universe that there is life on other planets, Hopefully not too much longer, I cant see how it can be hidden any more. P.S. IT MADE NO SOUND.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up and noticed something hovering above.  It was about 50 yards high.  I was young and thought it was a car, for a very brief moment I looked down for some reason, then when I thought wait a minute, cars dont fly, after maybe a couple of seconds had passed I quickly looked up, but it was gone.  The strange thing it didnt appear to move, it stood in the air solid, it didnt have anything that looked round, there were no windows.  But noticing the all the images of ufos until today, I have not seen anything that resembles anything near it.  It was dark mostly, but had etching in no particular pattern, the etchings were some what golden at the base of the craft.  If I can describe something that looks like, the first thing that comes to mind is ancient Chinese buildings design.  It made absolutely no noise.  I thought about it for years and haven&#39;t mentioned this to anyone,  I thought might as well.<n>

I had showered and immediately stepped into bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 3:15 AM I awoke to see an orb hovering above the deck and just outside of our bedroom door.  I had an ominous feeling about this sighting.  My children were in the bed room behind me.  The object was brassy in color with flat ends, although shaped somewhat like a football.  I reached behind me for the .357 magnum that was in the headboard.  The weapon was hot loaded and had a trigger safety.  Something was about to get used for target practice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke in an upright position at about 4:45 AM.  It was light out.  I went into the kitchen and made myself a cup of coffee and sat down on the base of the fireplace when I noticed oily spots on my feet.  I knew that I had been out side, but I could not remember anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience would also be the subject of a regression in 2009.  They walked me into the yard where I noticed a bright light and an absolutely gigantic craft sliding over me.  It was hundreds of feet in diameter.  I felt seriously outgunned.  They sucked me up and took me for a ride.  These entities were red/brown and there were about a dozen of them.  They were extremely angry at me. They felt that I had a very bad attitude. They gave me the cold shoulder and I can remember watching stars blow by in a blinding blur. The dog that I had picked up on the beach was a special gift to teach me how to love.  I did make a number of changes in my life after this abduction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Camping, and hunting, on Imuruk Basin (lake), the craft came across the lake about 50 feet above water silently,then rose to about 100 ft.Coming across the lake it looked to be about the size of a cessna 206, above us it appeared to be about 100x100 ft.in size. I paniced and grabbed my 30-06 rifle,aimed,and started to pull the trigger, when the craft went from stationary to disappearing in about 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was alone. I was facing North, when from the West, I heard a &#34;roaring&#34; sound...as the sound one would hear listening to a powerful furnace, roaring flame sound. Suddenly, passing over the building west of us, came a very slow-moving giant ball of flame. It seemed to be almost hovering, it was moving so slow. Estimation: 1-2 mph. My mouth dropped open as I watched this object move West to East in front of my eyes...I estimated it to be moving approximately 15-20 feet above the ground..it was almost perfectly round...I could see a dark round mass within the violent flames encircling it..It left a trail of flame,with a few sparks flickering on the tail of the flame. The diameter I guessed to have been about 15 feet (when I was looking at I quickly made a mental note that one could have easily placed a full-sized automobile within it). It passed in front of me approximately by about 20 feet. I watched it move easterly across the fence next to our property, and until it was out of my sight! Approximately 1/2 hour afterwards, I heard on a radio broadcast that it had been seen and reported to that radio station, by 100&#39;s of people! The broadcaster stated that this radio station had called our local air force base, Davis Monthan, and inquired if they&#39;d heard of this reported phenomena. Supposed response from the Air Force was: It was an experiment they were working..... Yeah, right!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We noticed that our home lit up in this lime green light (like fllod lights were on in the house), in our living room we had a fish tank, and the air stone surged in power and was throwing the water as high as 2 ft. out of the tank.  Then when the light stopped the air stone went back to normal.  We had thought the high lines might have been struck, but when we asked the electric company, they said no.  I asked different people, line men, supervisors, etc...and they all said it had nothing to do with the lines.  This happened outside Gary Indiana in a single dwelling, inside was my husband and I, my 30 year old daughter who was taking care of a 2 1/2 year old boy, and my 16 year old daughter.  My 30 year old daughter can confirm this.  Please keep this confidential, like we talked about (name).  Add to your records only!

6/15/86 19:00|Chard Town, Somerset||Formation|2 hours|Lights scanning our town|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22069.html|15|ndxe198606| Lights scanning our town<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry for not knowing the exact date of my report as it happened so long ago but thought that you could add it to your files to see if anything matches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Firstly I have no reason to lie and I have 8 witness&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this completely clear night, with all the stars on show my friends and I were playing in the local school fields. We were all about 15 to 16 years old. As the night started to draw in. We were looking at the stars now and then and when the light was fading rapidly we noticed a ball of light moving incredibly fast around the sky. It was clearly not a satellite as we all know what they look like nor was it standard aircraft. It was moving too fast and in all directions but for some reason not up or down just on the same plane. The object was basically 4 or 5 times brighter than the brightest star on view and would very roughly guess that it was anything from 5 to 7 miles up, based on the background of stars and the objects movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all gob smacked at the site of this object and it&#39;s slow to fast and curved movements it was making. One witness I hasten to add ran home crying not wanting to accept or appreciate this thing, but the rest of us stayed. My Father was not there at this point but on another day, which I will get to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So on this night while watching this light dance about the sky we had a rabbiting lamp and proceed to flash at it for all it was worth. About 1/2 an hour passed by then this light became static and just hung there like any normal but bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the point where we knew we were seeing intelligent life elsewhere as what happened was an incredible sight. From this one bright light a second light shot out of it to the end of our towns edge and back at magnificent speed. A second light went to the other edge of our town, then a third, forth, fifth, etc, etc. In a minute or two we were seeing between 30 to 50 lights shoot out from this one main light covering the entire span of our town(roughly 18,000 population). The smaller lights coming from the main static light were the same brightness as a normal star but did not flicker like stars do, proving that they were roughly 5 to 7 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speeds of the smaller lights varied in speed but all were moving the same when they turned back to merge with the bright static light. The only way I can describe it is this way. Imagine a dart board and the bullseye the Bright light. From the Bullseye smaller lights shot out from it to the edge of the dart board and back again, sometimes 10, sometimes as many as 50 lights. After a while we all began to get neck ache through looking up for so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while the 50 lights were going down to 40 then 30 and so on and I will never forget that one last light returning back to the bright light speeding up almost as if it didn&#39;t want to get left behind. This is silly I know, but that&#39;s how I felt about it. Once all the lights were back to the main bright light it just faded away. We all walked home feeling differnet things, but I for one felt privelleged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only way I could describe what we saw is that it was scanning our town, whatever it was. But it was truely not from this earth due the speeds involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the following night I had 2 witness&#39;s but will explain later what they saw. Directly outside my house I was looking up in the sky for more activity. This time I saw a large round sphere. It was like seeing an up turned hot air balloon but much too high up for one to be there, way too high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This round balloon had numerous coloured lights flashing different colours. I ran into my house to alert my Father and to grab my binoculars. Ballancing them on a fence post I got a much better view and could quite clearly see form and space between the lights which were square, hexagonal, octagonal, etc, but not round, all of which were attached to this sphere/balloon shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the lights were changing colours many different colours. This event lasted roughly 10mins and the object I would guess was about 2 miles up above my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here is the strangest part of this sighting. Like I said before I have no reason to lie and sit here writing all this for the fun of it that happened many years ago for me but this sighting my two friends with me could not see the object. I kept persistently pointing at it and it was clear as ever for me and to this day I have no explanation as to why they were unable to see what I could see..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Father a total non believer in anything like this would never discuss or talk about it even now he will not talk about it and would niether admit seeing it or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has totaly confused me. In a way I wish I never saw these things as I have many thoughts about them. What was it, why was it there and why do I feel that it was singling me out in particular. It has now been 17 years since then I have never seen anything else like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this article has been of use to your research<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We took a break and observed many birds flying above the trees and river. At that time I noticed a circle of four disc (possibly metallic or possibly reflecting back light). These discs were above the few clouds that were present that day. I called to her to look at what I was seeing and she saw it immediately. At that time another disc entered the formation from the West. We just watched in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued to circle in perfect formation and then one by one they shot off to the West and seeming to go upward until out of site. This lasted approximately 3 minutes. The circle appeared to be about the size of a basketball and the discs were about the size of a quarter. This was above the level of clouds as there was a thin cloud that the discs flew above as they left the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This little forest was about 100 yards by 35.  Also, the church I attended was only about 500 yards west from my house.  (the road i lived on ran east and west) I believe it was late morning when my friend and I went across the road to play in my grandmothers barn.  It got to be close to 1:00 and we decided we should go back to my house.  We walked through the trees and down the ditch to cross the road when we both heard a loud humming/buzzing sound from above.  We both looked up and saw a large boomerang shaped flying object.  I would have to say that it was shaped exactly like a boomerang, with small towers at the three ends or arms that stick out of a boomerang.  There was also one slightly larger tower in the center.  The color was a very light blue, and I remember alot of little flashing lights on the top of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also have to say that it was flying at under 1000 feet.  Probably 700-800.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost directly over the church when we saw it.  We then ran back under the cover of the trees and watched it move, very slowly, and also rotate as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It proceeded over the church and kind of circled over it and headed South.   We intently watched it, waiting for it to go away.  It got to be about a half mile away and circled back.  It made another run over the church and went back south.  We watched it until we could not see it anymore.  We then ran across the street back to my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not say a word to my parents, or to his, because we knew at our young age nobody would believe us.  I did not tell anyone until after I was 16.  I&#39;m not sure when the first time my friend told anyone.  Probably waited longer than I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

One afternoon I was stuck in traffic on High St. in Oxford, headed for a London computer show. While looking around, I noticed what appeared to be the Moon. It was off to my right looking out the windshield. I thought to myself the Moon should be behind me. I turned to look for it, and sure enough it was in the expected location. I looked back where I saw the White colored Sphere. It was still in the same position for about 20 seconds and then just started to accelerate out of sight in a matter of a few seconds.  It appeared to be the size of the Moon, but I had no reference to establish the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

NorthRidge Apartments) off of N. Nevada Ave. and I-25. (west of Pulpit Rock) Location of Sighting: Near and Around Pulpit Rock (about 4000 feet from apartments).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out one of the apt. windows, viewing the rock possibly after a rainstorm and watching the rainbow, I saw a mysterious ball shaped object floating south in a staight horizontal line toward the middle near the top of the rock. It was golden-white, sometimes with a bluish tone. I knew that it wasn&#39;t an airplane or any known flying object, especially since it never had any blinking lights, made any noise and lacked other shape than a sphere. I felt entranced everytime I saw it. The most peculiar thing about it, was that after reaching the rock, it appeared as if going behind it, yet never came out the other side! I have hiked the rock many times in my life and there is no trace of any aircraft landing, nor any place for a helicoptor or even a smally plane to land, since it is very treacherous terrain, behind the rock, ie., rocky hills and ravines with lots trees and uneven territory. In recent years, I came to conclude that this object may have not even entered behind the rock, but perhaps into the rock itself, judging by the rocks enormity. I not only had seen this phenomenon on this occasion, but aproximately three to four other times, in a span or two to three years, always in the same location...and horizonal direcion and height. The appearance of this happening occured usually in the mid summertime, and always durring the early part of the evening, where it was still lit outside. It was usually after it rained and the sky was almost all clear, yet I observed the same occurance on a clear evening, where it had not rained at all! I do not recall any other witnesses beside me, I was perhaps alone in the room everytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always felt that Pulpit Rock was a Strange and Mystical place, where I always felt drawn to. Up to this day, this place is like a magnet to me....It energizes my spirit, stimulates my Higher conciousness, and body and a peculiar something that isn&#39;t logical and radiates from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It was saucer form with edges that seemed to be (measuring thickness with  my fingers) was like 3 inches thick which maybe could be in reality, 6 to 10 feet thick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing hovered at same level for about 12 to 15 mins.  It had flashing lights all around which started off red and blue.  It seemed to be spinning or it was the effect of the lights flashing in sequence all around.  There was no sound ever heard from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back in the camp woke the other 4 which all witnessed this flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back out with powerful flashlight and flashed my beam of light in its direction.  As soon as I started flashing flashlight the object went from a horizontal position to a vertical one, and the lights changed color to green and yellow.  I was begged to stop because my friend&#39;s wife was absolutely terrified and was scared that this object would land and or do us harm..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of us remained outside observing this until, this is the most bizarre part of story.  We just remember looking up at the sky but nothing was there anymore, as if we lost a bit of time or something.  We remember looking at this thing and then nothing.  We looked at each other and don&#39;t remember this thing leaving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following week, the local newspaper (l&#39;Echo Abitibien) reported of this event stating that a object was reported seen by persons and if my memory is correct it had been reported to police by a few people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was sighted about 15 miles north of Val-d&#39;Or towards the town of Barraute, it was observed in the Southwesterly direction..  I know it&#39;s a long time ago, but this I will never forget..<n>

In the middle of our conversation my friend said loudly and kind of in surprise &#34;look&#34;!! I looked around and didnt get it and said &#34;what,what&#34;? He grabbed my head and pointed me to the southeast and up. We both just shut up and watched then. What we saw looked like a very large ,softly glowing boomerang. It approached fairly slowly and looked to be only about 100 or so feet up. one thing that seemed strange to me was that it flew absolutey perfectly level and straight. It had no lights or sound whatsoever. The whole body of it had a very soft glow like one of those lightsticks only a bit softer and white not green. It seemed to trail a vapor or mist off of its entire rear edge. It flew almost directly overhead and i noticed it blocked out the stars as it went by. Because of its low light and it being night i couldnt say for sure but it was large. Maybe 200 or so feet from one end to the other. We watched it go by overhead and kept watching until it eventually flew beyond our site. Afterward we both kept asking eachother what the hell was it and it became obvious to both of us we didnt have a clue. I remember being quite excited and we both mentioned it to several people together just so we wouldnt get laughed at as bad . A few people told us that about at the same time the tv reception in the nieghborhood had gone out briefly. My friend and i were only teenagers at the time. neither of us are kooks or attention seekers or whatever. im posting this only because someone else may have seen something similar and it might be of help. Also right after it passed we noticed a very large amount of air traffic . Some of it seemed to circle or crisscross the area. Some headed in the same direction this thing went. We left shortly after.<n>

But I swear on my familys life that what I say is true and even have a witness whom saw exactly what I did.. And it changed my life forevermore...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was 86.  I was 17.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were driving on a rural country road/hwy, just outside the town of Louisville KY on a fine clear summer day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was about 4:30pm. I was riding shotgun and enjoying the nice country drive when something caught my attention through the corner of my eye off to the left of the highway.  I noticed something large hovering over a wooded area about a quarter mile away.  At first I thought &#34;what in the world is that?&#34;  It was a silvery metallic cigar shaped craft that was probably at least a hundred feet long.  It was in a vertical position, just hanging there motionless maybe a hundred feet above the treetops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed this curiosity out to my friend who was just as puzzeled as I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured it must be a weather ballon or something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But...I have never seen anything even re similar in appearance in my 17 years of life. There were no appendages, wings, motors, rotors, windows, Nothing! It was a solid metallic shape that reflected the suns rays brilliantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were looking at the object trying to figure out what it was, when, in the blink of an eye it was gone!  I was quite excited and scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eagerly we scanned the skies around where it had been, looking for it, but it was nowhere to be found.  Maybe 30 seconds later, while looking on the OTHER side of the expressway from where it had been, I saw it hanging there motionless again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yelling &#34;there it is!&#34;  I pointed to my friend where it was, and we both watched it for several seconds.  Then, right before our very eyes, it disappeared slowly, as if it was cloaking, or dematerializing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just faded out to nothing.  It did not move away.  It just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were speechless.  I told family and friends but no one believed me, even with my friend as witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot describe how I felt, but know that this event convinced me to research what I saw, and over the years I have found much. Having seen this firsthand, I have opened my eyes to accept what others cannot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many people have seen exactly what I have, all over the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was that I saw, but it was broad daylight when we saw it, so there is no questionable night time issues here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion this was no government secret project/craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. The technology was far too advanced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  The speed used would have broken a humans neck, or the G forces involved would have been impossible for a human to withstand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  As far as I know , no government on earth has craft cloaking/dematerializing abilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has bothered the hell out of me for 20 years. It could be a government project, but I seriously doubt it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having seen what I have, I honestly believe we are being visted by beings from another world.  Before I die, my one wish in this world is to truly know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mom just yelled at me and grounded me.  My dad, feeling sorry for me, said let&#39;s go pull the new truck into our car port.  When we got inside the truck my dad couldn&#39;t turn the truck on and this was a brand new truck.  It seemed like all power of the truck was gone.  My dad was about to out and check until we saw a saucer like spaceship hovering very close on top of our house.  It had bright likes in the color of red, blue, and yellow.  Very slowly it started moving along the trees behind our house and as soon as it was away and couldn&#39;t be seen anymore the power of the truck came back on.  We never really spoke about again until last year when I asked if he remembered it and he said, &#34;yes, as if it were yesterday.&#34;<n>

We were standing at the edge of the beach when something in the air caught my friend&#39;s eye.  At that time, he was a policeman serving the Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, and he is to this day still employed as a policeman.  I had just started graduate school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He motioned to me to look up.  As we watched, we saw three delta-wing shaped objects flying in a V-formation at what appeared to be a very high altitude out over the water in the Gulf of Mexico.  The three objects flew south for a few seconds and then banked to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they did so, we both were amazed that we could see stars through the objects.  They were luminous, but not hugely bright.  They appeared to be transparent or had a certain hard-to-describe transparent quality about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they banked, they increased in speed and, still in a V-formation, they zoomed out of sight in a just a few seconds. The sighting lasted for 20 to 30 seconds max.  The objects made no noise that we were able to detect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I went back to the house where we were staying and took out pencils and paper.  We went in separate rooms and drew what we had seen just to make sure we had both seen exactly the same thing.  We compared our drawings and they were the same.  Neither of us were on drugs or alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have carried this experience with me for many years and would sign a sworn affidavit attesting to the truth of this sighting.<n>

While preparing the cabin for landing the Captain made an announcment to the passengers. If we looked out on the left side of the aircraft we would see space debris. I bent down to look out of the window and I saw a huge craft. One could not see the top or bottom of it. It appeared very close but yet was suppose to be 100 miles away from us. It had rows and rows of brightly lit windows...one row on top of another that went on forever. It slowly passed... going in the opposite direction at an even speed. It was very, very huge as huge as a flying skyscraper turned on it&#39;s side! Not one passenger mentioned this thing. My flying partner confirmed what I saw.

I looked up and seen what looked like a fluorescent tube in the sky, it was a clear sky, sun shining and I thought to myself at first a blimb reflecting the sun&#39;s rays. I said to my dad &#34;what the hell is that?&#34; he looked and couldn&#39;t figure it out.  It wasn&#39;t a blimb it was very high in the sky, looked like a few miles which would have made the object 100-200 feet in length just glowing like a white tube. It didn&#39;t seem to be moving, I begged for my father to pull over so we could watch it but he didn&#39;t want to pull over on the highways express lanes so, I could only watch for like 2 minutes. I&#39;ll never forget it and thought to myself if anyone else seen this. I was shocked to discover last year how many people on this  planet that have seen similar craft of this type. I thought I was alone, man was I wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It had gone well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the Monday morning we had a group session with local psychic, Isabelle Kingston. This went well too, I was getting encouraging messages and ideas from all manner of people and places. My confidence was good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After Issy&#39;s session, I thought on my way back to Somerset I would call in at Warminster, a place well-known for UFO sightings, and check out whether &#39;ET&#39; and UFOs really exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove through Warminster, up towards the start of the fenced-off, huge army training area of Salisbury Plain. I sat and just relaxed my mind. After a while I had the impression ET really did exist, so in my mind I said, &#34;Don&#39;t bother coming out of your way to appear for me, you probably have far more important things to do&#34;. Then I switched on my engine and started driving back west towards Somerset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes, I noticed a red light over to the north keeping pace with me, it was followed by a second red light, then a third red light. The next thing was they were veering towards me, then they went over my car at about 50 feet. I was excited. I swerved the car onto the grass verge, and got quickly out of the car. Three, disc craft, of approximately 23 feet in diameter were hovering close to me. They were at an elevation angle of approx 45 degrees, and were only about 60 feet away, i.e. they were VERY close! Around the mid section of each craft was a continuous line of windows. I did not see anyone at the windows, but I felt a communication coming from the ship; the communication did not come to my head and mind, but seemed to connect to the middle of my chest. This was undoubtedly a most wonderful experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three craft started to move off, back to the south-east. I quickly got back into my car and accelerated off in the direction they had gone. A minute or two later I had caught up with them; looking up through the windscreen, the 3 craft were moving gently side-to-side as they progressed on their way. The road started going uphill, to the entrance to Longleat House. Looking across and downhill a little, I saw the 3 craft going past the foot of Cley Hill, at this time a little, white light came up behind the group of three, and entered the trailing disc craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We parted company as I drove through Warminster. I felt I had to go to where I had been parked in my car half an hour before. True enough. The three disc craft were there; they were 100 yards from where I had been parked when I sent them my telepathic message. They were circling a stand of trees, flying beautiful, slow circles around these tall trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.michael-irving.com/meetings1.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

((Doctor&#39;s name deleted)) is her Dr. his office is located in Crestview Fl. I have much more to tell but not enough space. She is now cancer free, Why? we may never know the truth, but one thing is for sure she is still alive. and now 27 yrs. old. the moral to my story is not one of horror and probes but one of truth and goodness.if not for those beings visit i would be placing fresh flowers on a grave, instead of hugging and kissing my most wonderful gift, thank you who or what ever you were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((names deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is medical professional.

My uncle was a fisherman and I worked on his boat in the summer as a deckhand. While waiting to leave for the overnight shrimping trip I was looking at the stars when I observed two bright lights circling each other at a high altitude. they looked like stars but were moving at a very high rate of speed. I went to where my uncle was an advised him to look up and pointed to where the lights were and he also observed them of a few seconds circling each other and right after that the two lights shot away from each other in opposite directions at incredible speeds and then they faded away. I have no idea what they were. Stars? Ive never heard of two stars getting caught up togeher like that and then shooting away from each other.

When I was 16-17 years old I saw something unlike anything I have ever seen. It was very late at night and my parents where sleeping. I was in the living room watching television.  I decided to look out the window at the stars. The view from our window was unblocked and the sky was full of stars that night. I had only been looking for a few seconds when I suddenly saw what I believe was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three lights in a triangular pattern appeared in the sky. At the top of the triangle shape was a red light. At the bottom in each corner was a white/yellowish color light. The two lights in the bottom corner left there position at a rapid rate of speed. The light in the left corner moved to the left and the right light moved to the right in the same formation at the same time. Both lights went out away from the red light. The two lights suddenly returned to their exact positions as before and the whole thing disappeared as if someone just turned it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I saw was lights in the form of a triangle. If it was a ship of some kind it had no other lights on it except the three that I described. I have never seen anything like this before or after that night. Considering my age reporting what I saw at the time was of no importance to me. Now that I am older I feel it is important that someone knows of what I saw. If it was a UFO or not maybe the information I have to offer could be of some kind of help or assistance to our world or country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported my sighting as one or possibly  three sightings because the two lights separated from there position as if they where separate from it but had a connection to the red light at the top somehow. From what I saw I believe it to be one main ship with others that detach . Thank you for time reading this and I hope I wrote it where you can understand what I saw. I’m more then glad to offer more detail if needed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I don&#39;t remember the date, or even the year exactly. It was most likely 1986.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a date with my girlfriend, Victoria (Tristan) Poetzel. It was about 9 or 10 pm and we were returning to my house. I pulled into the driveway in front of my parents home. I got out of the driver&#39;s side, and looked up toward the night sky. I noticed a small dim white light that was no larger or brighter than the light from the dim stars that were visible that night. The light tracked very slowly, in a straight line, due south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was how it reminded me of the satellites we used to watch move slowly across the sky as we layed in our sleeping bags on the camping trips of my youth. They were dim, and moved slowly in a straight lines across the night sky. But this was in the city, on the street, surrounded by streetlights, at sea level. I&#39;d never noticed a satellite in those conditions before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to Tristan, &#34;Hey, do see that light? What is it a satellite or something?&#34; I pointed in the right direction, and told there it was in the sky next to the tv antenna on the neighbor&#39;s house. I saw her look in the right direction, but she said nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if she could even see it. She didn&#39;t like wearing her glasses all the time, and she was not wearing them now. Her eyesight was not that great.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wathched for a moment longer in silence and suddenly, to my surprise, the light appeared to oscillate wildly back and forth perpendicular to the direction of its travel, kind of like the needle of a sismograph, and then it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned. Nothing I was aware of could move like that. I quickly looked toward Tristan, and in perfect unison we both said, &#34;Did you see...&#34;  She had been able to see it after all, and we had both witnessed its odd departure. We went inside and explained what we&#39;d seen to my parents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As UFO stories go it&#39;s pretty boring. No huge craft. No big headed aliens. But, we saw what we saw, and I can&#39;t explain what it was. I&#39;m a skeptic myself, but this story is the God&#39;s Honest Truth and I&#39;d take a lie detector test in a minute to prove it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, Tristan and I broke up in 1988. I haven&#39;t seen her in years, and I don&#39;t know if she recalls what we saw. But I know I&#39;ll never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

We wanted to view the meteor shower from the darkest place within walking distance near our home.   It was a very clear sky that night and the starts were bright.   While we were standing there looking up, waiting for another meteor, I noticed something unusual.  There was a small white light moving.   As I watched it, I noticed that it stayed within the area of three other white lights that made a triangle shape.   I was finally able to get my family to see it among the thousands of stars.  We watched it for a long time.   The three lights in the shape of a triangle were absolutely still.  Whatever it was, it never moved from its position.  The white light that moved never moved out of the triangle shape.  It went moving around all over within the triange.  Sometimes it would move slow, sometimes fast, and sometimes it would stop.  We finally were tired of looking up.  We walked back home and could still see it.  I have no idea whether it was close or far.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The shape of the object was not discernable, however it had, as I recall, three white lights, situated what I assumed to be at its perimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most noticeable thing about this craft was that it made no noise and that it moved so slowly -- very slowly. The object was easily 300 feet long if all the lights observed belonged to the same craft.

I don&#39;t know...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember two seperate events. The first one happened in June or July of 1986. I was 8 years old. I witnessed what I thought was a Meteor shower. We had a thunderstorm that afternoon, complete with warnings. I believe it was on a Sunday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I liked storms for some reason.  Especially afterwards because I would look for rainbows. Well, as I watched out of the back door through the screen door...I saw a the sky start to turn a brilliant orange/red color.  I mean this was a deep orange-red (almost like dusk, but it was too early in the day for this).  The next thing I know I saw a few fireballs rain down.  I called for my family to come look.  I mean these objects were on fire.  I thought that it was judgement day or something but I wasn&#39;t scared. Which is why I thought it was because noone was concerned. We all had this euphoria going on. They were round and it looked like fire was around them. I mean they were showering, however, no one was concerned about them starting a fire.  I don&#39;t remember what happened after that.  Also, nobody in my family remembers it.  I have asked several people around town and they really don&#39;t remember.  A few people I asked that are around my age say they remember about as much as I do...and nothing after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of the day is just sort of blank.  I try to remember myself and it&#39;s hazy what happened afterward.  However, I do remember not hearing any fire engines or anything.  This has bugged me for years.  I guess it could be dismissed as a meteor shower but I can&#39;t find any reports and nobody remembers.  What happened?<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second incident was about four years or so after that(circa 1990).  I can&#39;t remember what year but it was the summer time and as I looked outsid in mid-afternoon I heard a awesomely loud clangy like sound.  My first thought was that it was an accident but where was the screeching tire sound? The clanging metal sound lasted too long for a MVA! It sounding more like a symbol as it pulsated outward. The musician in me noticed that it almost changed tone as it moved (like someone running their fingers across piano keys, but imagine keys sounding like metallic chimes with tones sounding almost identical but still different). A good example is the movie War of the Worlds (newer version) the sound the tripods made right before they fire the weapons. I looked down out of the window and saw people running outside. They were hollering what was that?! My dad was hollering too. It was on the news. They said that there were no military planes in the area and the airport didn&#39;t even have any planes in the air at that moment. Also, this spread out over the entire county. Wild. I have never heard anything else about it...not even the next day. Also, I haven&#39;t heard anything else like this since then. Someone should investigate these two incidents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the incidents are approximate.  PD))<n>

Don&#39;t know what month or date it was. It was my junior year in Hollywood High School. I was walking towards the cafeteria/auditorium suddenly I stopped as if someone told me to stop don&#39;t move or else, so I stopped, looked up at the Hollywood High School cafeteria/auditorium this huge black triangular shaped object just appeared hovering on top of the cafeteria/auditorium. It looked like the mothership itself, it made a buzzing sound. As if time stopped in seconds when I looked up. It made itself invisable when it moved away it disappeared. After seeing the huge black triangular shaped object move away slowly there were five helicopters behind it. They were not chasing it just following it slowly. Than in minutes they were gone. Then this part is going to sound crazy and strange after seeing all this happen there were two men in black coming towards me. I got scared and said who are you, what are you doing, where are you taking me, he didn&#39;t answer, took me to the side of the P.E area we were walking and walking then I went blank I didn&#39;t know what happened from there. After two days passed one of my classmates said what happened to you, you were gone for two days. I was confused to what happened to me. The strange thing is that the army or some soldiers were making the students take some kind of test that day in the library when alot of students saw this black huge triangular shaped object. I didn&#39;t report it sooner, because I was scared of this thing, the others students also. This is a true story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was making a Snow hole when a friend of mine shouted towards me to look over the Tree Line as we were digging in inside the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up I say this disc shape craft that gave off a brilliant white light from its under carrige- evryone stopped what they were doing and we just sat their in ore of this amazing craft, minutes later a second craft same as the first came in to view from the same direction as the 1st -over the tops of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their was 12 of us just standing quite in ore of these craft that gave off no noise and no fumes of any discription, I walked forward from my snow hole for about 80ft and the 1st craft gave off this brilliant white light that shot straight down from its under carrige to the ground were we all stood looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is being back in my snow Hole with my friend and it was 3 hrs later than when we had been looking outside-which only felt like 5 minutes a go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now out of the Marines,  myself and a few of the guys who witnessed this evenyt still talk about are visit from God only knows and are time loss///? now comes the Good bit...we were picked up 1hr later from Helicopters and taking back to camp -everyone  of us still in disbelieve at what had just taking place ? I mean here we are 12 normal guys just digging snow holes on a Exercise for the Military and the next thing we no we are all carted off in to a office with Generals and What I can only think of as Goverment agents-they stood at the back not saying much but every now and then nodding their heads in agreement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didnt feel write from the moment I stepped inside the office-? OK my head was in bits because one minute I am digging a snow hole and the next I am picked up by helicopter and whisked away to an office full of generals and God only knows who else was in the room, but I was feeling a little at ease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They asked all sorts of questions and at the end of it all made all of us sign a form saying it was a Satellite falling to earth -I mean why go to all that bother to prove something that even today I dont even no myself what the hell happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife as told me to go and get Hypnotized-and try to pierce together what did happen all those years ago when I was a 21 year old Marine on exercise in a cold and dark Norway...I am affraid to go and get Hypnotized just incase I dont like the outcome...But I did have a reacurring dream were 2 men in dark suits and glasses walk me along a corridor, and just before I wake up one of th emen touch the back of my right ear and I instantly fall asleep and wake up the next morning very tired and thirsty-? Thats all I have to say I could write on for ever but who believes ?? I didnt until ithis happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Simon   I am sorry I havent left you more details as in my true name ect -but I was also threatend...sorry<n>

I was playing basketball by myself when something cought me eye. It was reflecting of and on. Something like a diamond ring does when you put in the right light. I thought it was an airplane because that&#39;s about the distance I could see it. This object was just still, the occasionally it would move to the rght and then bacl left. It was doing this for some time. I the called my cousin who was nearby and pointed it to him. We were fasinated by this object. It did this for sometime and the it moved futher to the right and then it just kept on going right and just dissapeared. I think it just went full throttle. It never went up it just dissapeared into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really never told anybody other than my parents. I know there&#39;s something outhere it&#39;s alot of space out there, I just hope i&#39;m still alive when they find concrete evidence that there is life out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Suddenly, my son came running into my bedroom and shook me awake, yelling &#34;Mom, come look, there&#39;s something funny outside&#34;.  I got out of bed and went to the porch and looked outside above the house.  Above us I saw, about 50 to 80ft above us three rows of lights that seemed to outline a large craft.  As I watched for about 2 minutes, the lights slowly faded out. It was so weird, not even the crickets were chirping.  It was dead silent.  I never said much to anyone, but it seems that no-one but us saw it...at least I never heard anyone talk about it.  It wasn&#39;t until much later, when I read in a book (unfortunately I can&#39;t remember the name of it,) that a woman who chased these sightings down, mentioned that they could just fade away, but that it didn&#39;t mean they were gone.  When I read that, I felt more secure in my sighting.  I was afraid to say anything about it because people tend not to believe.  To this day, my son won&#39;t talk about it because when he woke up at 3:00am, he said he was standing up, and didn&#39;t remember getting to his feet.  It scared him to talk about it because he heard that these &#34;people&#34; kidnapp people.  His friend claims not to remember, but I know he does.  I have always wondered why they are so reluctant to talk about the incident. By the way they also told me that it was very bright until I got there, that&#39;s when it became dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was deep asleep in my bedroom when I was suddenly awakened by a orange glowing sphere hovering near my dresser. It was the size of a dinner plate, had a faint orange glow, and was somewhat transluscent. At first I thought it was a beam of light that someone was shining into my bedroom (I was in college at the time), but my curtains were shut.  I noticed that the light rays did not bend when it floated near the corners of my furniture and quickly realized that it was 3 dimensional sphere of light just floating around. I suddenly became very frightened and got a strange &#34;feeling&#34; that it was looking for something. Here is where it gets even stranger - I bolted out of bed in total panic and ran into the hall to turn on the light. My screaming had awakened my parents, and when I flipped on the light switch, the ENTIRE HOUSE interior lit up in a brilliant white flash (like an enormous camera bulb flashing) and then the electricity went out for several minutes. Although no one else saw the sphere, my mother witnessed the bright flash and became frightened herself. She had been awakened by a strange &#34;crackling low hum&#34; (as she describes it) about a half hour before my incident, and had actually gotten up to look out the window to try and see where the noise was coming from. She saw nothing and said the noise lasted for about 5 minutes. After reading so many UFO sighting reports that mention a correlation between a UFO sighting and an electrical disturbance, my interest in trying to resolve what I saw in my bedroom in 1986 has provoked me to research this event further. Whether it was just ball lightening or of extraterrestial origin, I need to know.<n>

The Lake (Erie) was calm almost like a sheet of glass; It was late at night, and there were no other craft (boats or planes) in the water or air. As we both watched the object move, it appeared to have stopped; almost like it knew we were watching it. It then appeared to have stopped moving in that direction (west to east) and it appeared stationary; however a few moments later, the craft which I will say had a hull of a hover craft and a canopy of a stealth fighter, was hovering about 5 to 10 feet above the water, at a distance of 100 feet. It had white lights around the perimeter of the hull and made a horrific constant sound that I cannot even describe. We watched the craft from what I can remember at this point, for only a few minutes. The last thing we both remember from there is we were at the top of the cliff, where our car was parked. My friend and I lost contact for several years until recently we ran into each other when we were working downtown. We met for lunch, and believe it or not, this event was the only thing we talked about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1986 is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought it was a helicopter hovering in the dark sky. suddenly the sphere shot like a bullet straight toward us and over my head. It was so fast that i thought it was a light turning off on an earth based aircraft, but i also believed that i saw a glimps of a trail straight over my head. then at that moment my brother said &#34;wow! Did you see that?&#34; I almost didnt believe my owne eyes until he said that. my response was &#34;Oh my God...you really saw that too?&#34; this confirmed to the both of us that what we both could have passed off as some wierd hallucination was if fact very real. Since then we have seen television stories about space shuttle personel wittnessing similer &#34;balls&#34; of light.We had never seen these repoorts until the early 90&#39;s and our experience occured during the middle 80&#39;s.

Me and a friend witnessed an ufo the same evening while we were fishing on Adak island. this occured somewhere around 1986 and we were both avionics technichnicians in the us navy. I have extensive knowlage in aircraft and airodynamics. This object defied all aero dynamics that we knew. we agreed not to ever say anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6 years old wedding outside in dark no body around ship over head for seconds and flies off<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok i am not to sure if this was the amagination of a small boy i.e me at the probable age of 6 but i remember it to this day like it happend. I was at my dads brothers weding reseption some place out in the country. I had not been drinking :) i was too young for that. any way i vidly remember being outside with sombody and seeing a shooting star. the person i was with says to me &#34; that means u are going to have good luck&#34; Not to long after i went out back of the wedding reseption to the large outside garden that lead onto the country side. i remember how fresh the air was and how clear the night sky was. i remember that the garden was softly lit by a flood light witch was no good as the garden was to large to be fully illuminated by it alone. i recall the calm fealing and stillness of that night. I remember walking over to the far fence away from where the wedding reception building was and behind the pond area that was surounded by furn trees. i looked at the sky abouv the towering fence then saw a second shooting star. seconds later i remember a silent &#34;ship&#34; flying down and hovering abouv my hed. the ship slowly tilts forward and i see a pain of wraparound sunglases for windows. well they looked like windows all tinted out and black. it felt  like i was beeing watched, looked at through them. the &#34;ship&#34; hovered silently abouve me for a fiew seconds then it tilted its front end back up while roling over to my left so tat it was facing the other way and it shot off as fast as it arrived. ship details. i include a rough 10 second sketch to show you what i belive to have seen. the metal or material that the ship was made off was a greeny grey colour more grey i think. it also looked to be made from panal sections. the windows where like a shiny black colour not tto diferent to a shiny plastik, well sort of inbetween plastick and shades or sunglasses. they was verry dark. also i recall lots of grood looking apendijes like areals on the object and some thing on the top of it... one thing i remember was the strange triangle shaped thing at the bottom of the ship. there was no light flashing no hazes no flames or anything. it looked like somthing that had been used, somthing that was weathered in.. not shiny and gleaming nothing like a saucer shape. i remember that. the shape was very long looking at the back i supose like a sauser but streatched out and it had overhanging rims to the lower part.. the most rememberable thing was the shades for windows... also i recal numbers or simbols on the fromt of the object... i dont know what but i remember syimbols... i think when it was hovering over me there was a strange low leval humm almost like wind sound. it might have been the wind. I also remember while looking at it that i was not upset or skered in any way. i felt pecfull. after this i ran in and told my mom i saw a plain. my mom confirms today that i was all exited and was pestering her and my dad to come out side and look at the plain. I think i thought it was a hovering plain or somthing... like i said i was 6 years old aprox at the time it might have been later on or erlier in the year..<n>
