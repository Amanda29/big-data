12/24/47 21:00|Whitmore Lake|MI|Cigar|20 Min.|Dec. 24, 1947 cigar shaped lighted object above the trees near Ann Arbor, Michigan|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63203.html|1|ndxe194712| Dec. 24, 1947 cigar shaped lighted object above the trees near Ann Arbor, Michigan<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a two lane road between Ann Arbor and Whitmore Lake, Michigan, we noticed something above the tree tops, a short distance away to the right.  It appeared cigar shaped with lighted windows along it&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, an Air Force aerial photographer, and I discussed it as though it was not unusual because we felt it must be a distorted railroad car, reflected in the moonlight by the deep snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were young and did not rationalize a lighted train car would not be alone but with other cars and would not be cigar shaped.  It seemed stationary in the sky and we watched it for @ 20 minutes until we reached our destination, then forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was years before I thought of it again.  Only after seeing several unusual things in the sky near Port Angeles and Olympia Washington, plus hearing other stories did I think of that night.<n>
