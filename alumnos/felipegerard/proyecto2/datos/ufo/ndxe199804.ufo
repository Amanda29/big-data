We looked up, saw this fireball appear about 30 degrees above the horizon, a greenish fireball with a hot white cen- ter. it had a tail of sparkling white stuff trailing behind it. It zoomed silently for about 10 seconds, more or less level with the hori- zon, then just winked out. I have seen these several times, as had my friend.<n>

My mother, who was driveing, thought it might be a kite or a balloon and ignored it. I got a good look at it and it was a very strange shape. It didn&#39;t look like any kite or balloon to me. It had a blue floresent auric discharge over the top which realy made it UFO like...It was about 7ft tall and 3ft wide, hovering 500ft above the road. We drove right under it and continued to our destination. When we returned a few minutes later it was gone.<n>

We were camped near Stampede Lake which is about 20 miles NE of Truckee, CA and 30 mi. due West of Reno, NV as the crow flies.  I got up to relieve myself at around {maybe one a.m. or so}and was looking up to enjoy the unfiltered view of the stars. Sometimes you can catch a satellite moving overhead. I then spotted what at first to be just that coming from the north, but noticed that it was just a little brighter than the average satellite. It looked kind of like a star in the sky would. Anyway, I observed the object for about 20 seconds and it continued to travel in a straight line to the SE. But the object stopped overhead and blended in like a star in the sky for several moments then began moving again. The object then picked up speed [it was quite phenomenal] and then made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the NE and continued to pick up speed. It then looked as if a flash occurred and the object just disappeared. I am still not quite sure what I saw, but it has kind of stayed with me.<n>

The object also had one flashing white light directly on top and one flashing light directly on the bottom of the craft. I was completely shocked to say the least, I even went so far as to call the police but they told me they didn&#39;t know what they could possibly do. I called the local airport but got through to nobody. Every night, whenever I pass the area from which I saw it, I stop and look hoping to see just another glimpse of it. Oh yes, the object was stationary.<n>

Called the attention to my wife,who also saw the formation. We are accustomed to the pass of light planes as there is a nearby domestic airport, and too to the characteristics of navegation lights of high flying commercial planes. To her the speed was fast. Also I estimated a change in the position of the lights at the end of the sighting, that was approx.to 45 degrees to northwest. To my observation that could be birds my wife replied that they don&#39;t have lights.<n>

It first entered my field of view from the left side, or from the east. The object appeared round in shape and was glowing brightly, it was whiteish in color. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and seemed to stay just barely below the high overcast until it left my field of view moving westerly. The object never changed direction nor did it change speed. I work in the tire industry as a mechcanical/electrical troubleshooter. I have done this for 12 years. Prior to that I was a machinist for 5 years.<n>

The &#34;star&#34; moved in a steady pace in a northerly direction until it was too far to see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 28 April 98 at 10:42 pm  I looked up at the night sky and noticed the Dipper directly above me.  (Do not know if it was the big or little dipper.)  At this time I noticed that the brightest &#34;star&#34; blink out.  I kept looking and saw that it reappeared in a slightly more northern attitude.  It faded out again and reappeared at a more northerly position.  I yelled for my husband to come out and he too quickly found the &#34;star.&#34;  While he tried to identify it with binoculars, I counted the seconds between fades and reappearances.  Counting in a measured One-One Thousand way, this &#34;star&#34; blinked on after 8 seconds ... in all cases in a more northern position. (This position, according to my compass, had the slightest northwesterly slant to it, but I cannot confirm the actual degree.] The only way to measure the distance between the sighting and the reappearance would be to say that with arm extended, the thumb extended, the space between would have been as wide as my thumb. Binoculars did not improve the detail of the object, which had no color other than the bright white of some closer stars. We watched it until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  Sighting possibly explained by tumbling object in polar orbit.))<n>

They seemed of good nature so we took them up on their offer for us to experience a true bedouin night in the desert.  We arrived to a spot in the middle of nowhere about twenty minutes from the town of Dahab.  We proceded to set up our minimal camp and our bedouin guides cooked up dinner.  After our meal we chatted for a while and then we all got into our slleping bags a proceeded to got to sleep.  I myself was untired and so sat up for a while ejoying the undisturbed view of the stars.  About 45-60 minutes after my friends went to sleep, while looking at the sky, from above and behind me floated over a craft with the shape of a cone or diamond.  I say it floated because the cone shape was rotating in a completely non aerodynamic form, the object also seemed to be only 500-800ft. est. above me and made No sound.  The craft had various color and shape lights aswell.  The sighting lasted about 15 seconds for the craft never noticed myself or my companions and proceeded on its way deeper into the Sanai desert.  Imediatly after the object was gone I looked around at my friends who were all asleep and unknowing to what just passed overhead, just at that moment i founnd that one of the bedouin men was awake and had seen everything i had.  With my eyes popping out of my head i looked at the man and curiously pointed to the sky, his response was simply &#34;Israeli, secret Israeli&#34;  I have no better explanation for what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Although it did move quickly, it was easy to see the craft in detail.  After about 15 min .  of following the craft it was gone.  The craft did not come close to land, it remained high in the sky.  The craft looked like a disk with three to four poles comming out of the top.  It did not look like it was made out of metal, but some other almost cloud like material. The craft was white. I was not able to see the material it was made of easily, as it was high in the sky on a very sunny day.  I know more people saw this.  The beach was crowded and many people were looking at the craft. I am a student at a nearby university<n>

I then observed it better and saw that it was a triangular shaped craft with 3 red light (one on each tip of the triangle). It moved quite slowly, approx. at 70 miles an hour (the speed of those small prvate planes) at the height of approx. 30-40 metres above some of the houses. The sky was pretty clear, a few clouds high up in the sky (it was night time). This hasn&#39;t been my first sighting, I think in the last 3-4 years I have had about 20 sightings varying from triangle ones to saucer shaped ones, tho this is the first one I&#39;m reporting.<n>

The object was seen with the naked eye and 7x35 binoculars.  It was a dull red, more of a glow than an actual color.  it had an apparent length of maybe .25-.5 inches.  The shape was like that of a disk seen almost edge on.  The object was symetrical, appearing fuzzy at the edges, and the center was more focused and somewhat brighter.  These details were seen only through the binoculars, not the naked eye.  It maintained the same color and shape and orientation in the sky (meaning the object&#39;s flat shape stayed flat relative to the earth&#39;s surface, horizontal, never vertical or whatever).  It moved towards the north slightly, maybe only a few degrees.  As seen through the binoculars, the object hovered at times and jiggled or moved only slightly.  Then around midnight the object abruptly moved to the southeast, almost 45 degrees, where it stayed for about a minute, then quickly moved back to where it was before in the south.  I had a difficult time following the object due to it moving so fast.  It stayed around 35-45 degrees above the horizon.  The stars in the background (in the binoculars) were very out of focus, meaning the object was close to us, how close, it&#39;s difficult to say, a few hundred feet or thousands of feet, I don&#39;t know.  The object moved out of focus twice, causing me to adjust the focus of the binoculars.  It appeared to move closer, slightly growing in size, then back, all within a minutes time.  Then around 0:20, it dissapeared. I was a physics major in college, and I do a little amateur astronomy as a hobby, so I know the difference b/w a star or an airplane or a meteor or whatever and what it was that I saw.  I really have no clue as to what it was, but by it&#39;s motion and shape, it was NOT man made or some natural phenomenon.  The weather conditions were good, a little haze around the horizon, but clear otherwise.  So we had no trouble seeing the thing.  I am nearsighted, that&#39;s why I could not see it without the binoculars, but my brother has better vision than I, and he could see it quite well w/o aid.  My brother is 15 and I am 21.  We live in a rural area, so there are no extranious lights or other sundry things around that could ever be mistaken for a ufo.  Airplanes do come over our area quite frequently, but at high altitudes.   Because we see planes as often as we do, we definately know the difference b/w one and what we saw.  Plus, the object didn&#39;t blink like the lights on a plane do.  Or move in a specific pattern, either.  Simply moved around and glowed the same shade of dull red the whole time, staying in the same general area, except when it moved over to the southeast.<n>

The lights appeared white in color and kept a constant level of brightness.  The two points of light were obviously traveling as one unit as they moved across the night sky. I just happened to look upward to admire the night sky when I left a restuaraunt and noticed the object moving on a southeast to northwest path. Within 5 seconds, the object vanished as quickly as it appeared.  The object never came near the horizon. I recently graduated from college with a degree in Sociology.  I took an Astronomy class in college and consider it somewhat of a hobby of mine.  I have seen countless shooting stars and this object was very different from anything I had seen in the night sky before. It traveled way too quickly to be a jet and there was no actual &#34;streak&#34; as is commonly observed with meteors. The intensity of the lights remained constant until it disappeared.<n>

I was admiring ophiuchus and othere southern oriented constalations when I noticed &#34;sw about halfway from zenith&#34; a extreamly bright star? pulsing red and blue. I have seen stars look this way when aurora or sunspots are active&#34; but not this bright!&#34; So as my sled warmed up I ran in and grabed my trusty spining sky chart and could not find where this mag -3.8+  - -6mag star was?  it would have been just lower right of Spica  and above crater.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought hmmm maby its a variable star not knowing it was too bright to be that at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought I saw it do a quick loop back to its origanal spot,first I though maby I shouldnt be snowmobiling I must be tired &#34;seeing things&#34; But then I saw it do a quick j type turn and bounce back to it&#39;s spot before NOW I KNEW I SAW THAT I THOUGHT! I ran in grabed roommate and tried to get him to focus on object lining it up w/ a pole as refference to see if it moved. It did and he reluctanly said&#34; I think I see what your seeing&#34; It moves quick and then stops and pulses right? Yep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped on my sled and moved to a darker location w/ less lightpolution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I set up a stick as reffernce point and layed on sled seat to stay still/steady and watched as this object did loops and figure 8,jturns always very fast and ending in same spot then it would get brighter red and blue pulses. I did have a cheap pair of spotting binoc. with,   all I could see was it was like a squashed circle very bright seeming to have 2 or 3 points of light at edges blending together red and blue some white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first guess after seeing it at 8x was &#34;damn smart it acts like a star moves fast,must be military test platform way up above NM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the more I watched it I kept thinking how do they deal with that g-force,this was amazing! I wish my camera was w/ me I didnt even think of grabing it! if I would have locked shutter open it would have shown up perfect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also cursed myself for not buying a video camera and even more importantly a good telescope as I would have loved to see this thing at 100x power or better. I  now spend many nights looking up and out. I saw a simalar object 3 years later same area @ zenith did 2 zigzags then backed up took off NW &#34;Gone&#34; same size bright blue light some red pulsing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As it was streaking, it left a white trail behind it that elongated as the green sphere advanced.  Then suddenly the sphere gained velocity and vanished.  Upon gaining speed, the white tail shrank and dissapeared along with it.  I have seen shooting stars before but never like this. I was curious as to what it was.  It appeared not to be in the immediate atmosphere but instead just outside of it.  This occured thursday morning at 12:25.  On friday as, I was walking with a freind, we were talking as I glanced straight ahead and saw the same sphere streak by ahead of us not above us.  Like the first instance, it also headed west and lasted only 3-5 seconds.  This second instance occured at 9:30 p.m. .  I could not believe that I was seeing the same thing I had witnnesed a day earlier.  My reaction was that of amazement and reduced my ability to react.  I only pointed the object out to my freind as it vanished.  Unfortunately he did not see it in time.  I am not suggesting anything grand or spectacular.  I am only reporting what I have witnessed.  I hope to somehow find the answer to this curiosity that has crossed my path twice.<n>

It hovered as it seemed to look like it was going to fall but it didn&#39;t.  Instead it shot across the sky again.  It looked like it was observing people on the highway. It hovered over the highway for about 30 seconds then left the sky. We looked again and again for it but it did not come back to show its face. During the time that it hovered our car had went crazy.  The windshield wipers went of and the radio went dead.  The lights started to flash and it was very eerie.  When it left the car went back to normal and we did not see the craft again.  There is a airport nearby about 3 miles away but there were no planes going that late at night.

I was alone as it was a Wednesday and my wife was with her quilting group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright greenish object streaked into view moving south and was visible for a few seconds until it disappeared over the horizon to the south.  The object had the appearance of re-entering space debris from my location.  The speed was constant and the direction of travel never changed from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed it was a rocket booster or satellite burning up in the atmosphere, as it resembled a re-entering Russian booster I had witnessed some years previous.  I mentioned the object to my wife and the next day heard reports that it was space junk and dismissed the sighting as such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later attended a talk by Peter Davenport and he asked me to file this report with the best possible recreation of directions and elevations for his records.  In doing so, I wish to state again that from my perspective, I observed no unusual behavior of the object and I remain somewhat skeptical of claims that these sightings are anything other than events easily explained by familiar events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time, if I can in any way clarify an event with hard data I am more than willing to contribute. What follows is the data to the best of my recollection.  Directions and elevations were measured with as Brunton pocket transit, a $200 compass that I used as a geologist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I was a HS physics/chemistry/astronomy teacher.  Because the location of viewing obstructions in the house is fixed I feel that the angles and directions are good to within plus or minus 10 degrees.  I wished that I had used the compass that night when all was fresh in my memory but I feel good about the numbers that follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparent direction: due south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bearing when first seen:  145 degrees true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Elevation when first seen:  30 degrees Bearing when last seen: 180 degrees true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Elevation when last seen: 0 degrees (at horizon) .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed seemed slower than a meteor and there was a width to the trail.  It was not just a narrow streak.  I stepped outside and listened for a few minutes afterwards and no sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this is of some help in piecing together this story.

One was red and flashed one was white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were directly west, immediatly infront of the mountain about 3/4 up the height of the mountain. They were stationary for about two hours the moved slighly north.  We looked with binoculars but could not see any thing more than the two lights.  The aerostat was up that night and was beside us to the south and plainly visable with its flashing white light.  We observed the lights from our porch until we went to bed about 2300.  I thought I could see at times a white beam of light emitting from the red light.  My son thinks the beams might have been only glare because we could not see them when viewing through the binoculars.  We both wear glasses.  There was no other airial activity at that time.  We have had other experiences before but never have  told anyone.  The  thing  that upset my family is that when we returned inside and  got busy doing other things I  suddenly had a severe nosebleed.  We are leaving here late Saturday night moving to another state so we cannot be contacted by e mail or phone after Sat.<n>

It went from the top of the sky, down past the horizon, right to left. I saw it for about 15 seconds. It was a circle that was a little bit bigger than a dinner plate from where I was and it had a tail that was greenish and had sparks in it, sort of like the sparks from when a knife is being sharpened. It reminded me of a comet, but much, much bigger. It didn&#39;t make any sound. It moved quickly,but not as quick as a shooting star &amp; it didn&#39;t disappear into the atmosphere like a shooting star -- it remained the same size &amp; I could see it clearly until it disappeared past the horizon line. I&#39;m a mother of 3 children and a childbirth educator.<n>

My friend was in the back seat looking out the back window and she shouted to us to look.  There were 3 tear dropped shaped objects in a triangle formation, the radio station went out and we just heard static for 2 minutes.  Then the objects just dissapeared. The radio came back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> there were 3 tear dropped shaped objects, they were silver but not glowing, they were metallic and shinning.

We were traveling Route #10 through west Texas just outside of Pecos.  At mile marker #205 I sighted lights off over a field approximately 2 miles away.  The object had three lights on top, two red lights on the perimeters and one white light centered.  I told my wife to look and we watched for about two minutes when the object flew straight at our car.  The object gave the feeling that it just suddenly was there next to us.  It had banked showing us the underside, hovering over the median, then swooped over the car, righted itself and speed off behind us.  At that time we lost sight of it.  The underside displayed three small, dull, lights in a triangular form with two dull concentric circles of light.  The shape of the craft was generally batwinged with a central payload area.  The coloring seemed to be a deep slate grey, almost black, leaving a dark on dark image in the sky.  On the &#34;forward&#34; area of the payload area there was a half moon cut out with two pointed &#34;antenna&#34;.  It made no sound and no exhaust.  I am retired from the military with 23 years of service.  I worked in communications with military aircraft.  My wife has been in retail most of her life.<n>

On second thought, no plane would produce this much light and this sustained intensity. I am an amateur astronomer and this *was not* a meteor breaking up mainly due to the sweeping up of light prior to the second and lesser burst of very bright light. Most interesting, last night Tue (21), Art Bell opened his show reporting a similiar light display from a San Antonio listener, precisely 24 hours after my sighting. Definitely plan to be outside and looking toward the south tonight at around midnight. Thank you.   -  Bob<n>

It was in a triangle shape and moved very slow seemed to be black or very dark in color it flew over us stopped hovered above us for some time as if to be watching us. It didnt really scare me I had a feeling it was ok, like perhaps checking observation equipment or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It however was unusally quiet, and was flying at an unbelievable height, I couldn&#39;t believe it was so close to us and moving so slowly, it arrived with no sound hardly at all and left with no sound above a slight humming. As it left the lights seemed to appear to come on as if on some type of dimmer switch but as it left I felt a very slight breeze thats just how low it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That year I went to the VP Fair to see the Harrier to see for myself if it moved in the same manner, the manuvers were the same but the sound and shape were not,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve often wondered if it was of our own and felt as tho it was now I believe just that after the 2005 sighting in Sidney Texas,it was good to hear he could read the words on it, thanks for the reporting!<n>

This aircraft was going faster than our truck and had a halo around it, plus a vapor trail very simular to the tail of a comet. I called it to my wife&#39;s attention and she replied that she had never seen such a craft. Suddenly it appeared to stop, but then it got very small with no vapor trail. As it disappeared we both realized it had gone into deep space. I know of no human aircraft that can perform such as this vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was very cloudy but was not raining. I was listening to the radio, and trying to get to sleep when all of a sudden the radio just shut off. I looked over at my alarm clock and it was out also. The filter on my fish tank which is in my bedroom shut off completly and the heater light in the fish tank turned off too. Then I had a strange urge to look out my window. And a few seconds later a saw a very bright light, shaped like an circle or oval flew by my window with incredible speed. It was so bright it lit up my entire bedroom and seemed almost as if something as bright as the sun just flew by my window. I made no sound what so ever. My house and my neighbor&#39;s house are only about 10 feet apart, and judging by how bright it was and how close it seemed, I&#39;m sure it flew in between my house and my neighbor&#39;s house. I never did ask my neighbor if he saw anything, so as far I know, I am the only witness. Once the craft left I was about ready to leap out my window to see if I could see it again. But it happened so quickly I didn&#39;t know what to do. Moments later, my alarm clock turned back on but had to be reset. And my radio also turned on again. I beleave it was just a coincidence that I was listening to Sightings on the radio at the time it had happened. I wish to hear your imput and comments concerning this incident. Please e-mail me at: ((deleted))@usa.net Hope to hear form you and thank you for your time.<n>

The craft was traveling approximately 100 miles an hour.  The satellites (or chase planes) seemed like stars, until they started to move toward the craft.  Being near an airport, I noticed there was no air traffic at the time.  I lost sight of the craft in the horizon but followed the chase planes for about 10 minutes (heading south).  There were four chase planes.<n>

They went up and down and covered a good distance in moments.  Then the larger of the two objects seperated into three and kept flying the same errratic flight in the same tight pattern that the two had made initially.  I stopped the car to see them better and did not see them again.  I am a school teacher in Ft Myers FL who has more than a passing interest in UFOs but cannot say for certain that I have ever spotted one before this.  My wife is a housemom.  What was odd about this was the length of time we were able to watch this. Because they were in constant motion and never kept one side facing us for any length of time it was hard to get a good look at the shape.  The closest description I could give would be spade shaped.  There were no lights or trails and the color appeared to be be between gray and black.  I heard about your site on Art Bell&#39;s show and hope to hear something about this there.  Hopefully someone was closer or able to see it standing still and was not going 80mph.<n>

Since they knew i liked science-fiction, they immediately thought i was pulling their leg. My younger friend (of the two) was very reluctant to believe, but i stressed very strongly at what i saw was real. At that time we all started looking toward the northern sky, about 5 minutes later my younger friend saw what he believed to a low flying helecopter. Since we lived about 4 blocks away from the nearest hospital, we just thought a lifecare helecopter was getting ready to land. We watched the lights for about 10 mins. but it never got close to here the turbine engines or the hum or rumble of a approaching aircraft. That`s when we all agreed that we were witnessing a ufo, because this object never got close to determine what it was. What we saw was a bright light moving slowly at first then getting faster as it went in a southernly direction. We were pretty excited at what saw that at that time i turned to my left facing west to see the same object i reported before. I quickly told the others to look in my direction to see what i was seeing. This shape(triangle with lights) was coming very fast from the western sky. Quickly, my younger friend darted inside the house.My other friend and i cotinued our observation of the two or more lights and the triangle one for about an hour. This happened near a major highway that we lived near. After about an hour we could`nt see anymore activty in the sky.<n>

The light appeared over the trees about a half of a kilometer away from us on the far side of the lake (I checked a map later for the distance), it was a very brilliant white light and it was travelling silently (at first we shut the boat off to listen and started it up again) but slowly to the east. We had a perfect view of the light as it moved and we noticed that it would speed up a little then slow right down. We sped up in the boat to get closer and the light continued to move away a little faster but with the same speed up and slow down movement. We noticed that it travelled in a straight more or less and watched it for a good few minutes as it travelled to the other side of the lake (about 5kms) where it moved over the trees and out of sight. This area of northern Ontario is very sparsely populated and is for the most part thick forest for hundreds of miles, there are no airports nearby aside from the odd private airfield. Two nights later it was approximately 3 am on another clear night with some clouds rolling in and again we saw the light over the lake. We were sitting on the deck of the cabin with all lights off looking at the stars in recliners when we noticed the light again but this time very high up over the lake. At first it seemed to just sit there for a few moments and then it began to move slowly. It would change directions instantly at sharp angles with no curving. And a couple of times it blinked off and then blinked on in another location in the sky. My best estimate is that it was at an altitude of about 1 km.  We watched it for about 3 min in all and lost sight of it when it moved into approaching clouds. We waited another hour for another look but by that time there was cloud cover and we saw nothing. I am an audio engineer and my fiance is a legal assisstant, we do not take drugs and are not heavy drinkers, we do not wear glasses or cantac! ts and w e have never been able to properly explain what we saw those two nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Simultaneously there is a very bright white object about 40 degrees to the West of this , I&#39;d say due West geographically. I thought this to be a planet (Jupiter?). This object was stationary the whole time. After observing for a few minutes I looked at my watch, it was 20:48 MST. My 15 yr old neighbor was visting my 14 yr old son, and came out of my house. I asked him to come take a look. We both watched for about 10 mins. Green and red object started moving at this time. I went in and got my 7x35 binoculars. We were then joined by the neighbor&#39;s Mom and 15 yr old sister. We all watched this red and green object move. A little zig-zag, some up and down motion. It shot off several times and winked out, only to reappear in the spot it winked out from. In the binoculars it looked like a red and green ring, like a wedding band with a yellow white spot like a diamond on a wedding ring. It was turning. I sent for my wife son and daughter to come out. Now there were 7 of us watching. The red and green object shot off beams of light several times. Keep in mind these are objects are miles away so everything looks pretty small, the beams were distinguisable, but not real intensely bright. About 21:15 we started looking in other areas in the sky and spotted 6-8 other moving objects. I looked at several through the binoculars. Looked like the edge of a ring. Dull yellow to tan color, not real bright. About 21:20 the bright white object I thought was Jupiter, suddenly shot to the North and winked out while in motion. It did not reappear. By 21:30 the sky was getting very cloudy, and observation was concluded. I have no fears about being contacted by you or answering further questions. I have not reported this to any Law Enforcement agencies, Military or Newspapers. Please advise proper course of action to follow. Sincerely ((Deleted))<n>

My family lives in a small house with 3 bedrooms. I was in the southwestern room (a large room where me and my three older brothers slept) watching Seinfeld on a colorless antennae T.V.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of my family(my Biological parents, two sisters and four brothers) was in the family watching T.V. and playing Monopoly amongst themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a buzzing noise which was easily discernable in the sky. I had no sense of direction of where it was coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise grew and grew in decibels until my ears hurt worse than they ever have(born with a better than average sense of hearing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I collected myself and lookEd out my bedroom window which faced West. What happened next I&#39;ll never forget!  A circular pattern of lights flew over the trees(about 8 total).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise and velocity violently shook the trees on our property to such a degree it was like a bomb went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A noise like that would&#39;ve been heard for miles!  Suprisingly, the story gets stranger yet remains the truth of what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out into our living room to talk to my family about what I just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They told me they didn&#39;t hear anything and that I just had a wild imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only confess how badly I would love to find out what I had seen that night, and that I have never seen an Aircraft like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to add that I have seen many kinds of military cargo planes fly directly over our property going South over the years since the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were also with a mutual friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon their agreement, we started to get freaked out.  We all agreed and felt strongly we had seen an unidentified flying object.

They did not move but remained motionless. Very bright but looked like large polished silver balls. The most forward of the balls suddenly inflated in size and then they all vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell the size of the object. They seemed to be within a mile or so. To me they looked @ 3 inches big from the distance I viewed them. I would guess they were ten feet in diameter or larger. The day was partly cloudy. The interstate runs downhill at the point where I noticed them. They remained for @ 5 minutes before the sphere closest to me became larger and then they all disappeared. I was wondering if any one else had seen it out of the many people on the interstate going home. The objects were a good 50-70 ft off the ground. I could not tell if they were lighted or if the sun was reflecting. That is really the only thing from the list below that I saw.<n>

He told me to look outside.   We were both about 10 miles from downtown Vancouver and could easily see above and beyond it.   What we both saw was seemed to appear like a classic &#39;disc&#39; shaped object.   The object appeared to be grey and just seemed to hover over the city.  Although it could have been farther over the water, we couldn&#39;t tell.  We watched it for about 5 minutes as it slowly made it&#39;s way from south to north.    Then without warning, just seemed to disapear.   To this day we tell people about it and have no doubt in our mind it wasn&#39;t a balloon or plane of any kind we&#39;ve seen before.   Unfortunetly, neither of us had the opportunity to capture the sighting on camera.   Which makes our sighting probably one of thousands you recieve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;disc&#39; as mentioned, was grey. It was stationary when we 1st saw it.  Then it slowly moved towards the north until it just disapeared.   The sky was clear that day.  (which is a rarity in Vancouver)  So we know it couldn&#39;t have been a plane fading into the clouds. I and the witnesses were just out of high school at that time. If credibility is the reason you ask for a description of backgrounds, sorry, we aren&#39;t doctors or scientists. :) I would also like to add that i decided not to release any information about my detailed location due to privacy.  If this was a more prominant sighting/experience combined with physical evidence, i would be more than happy to submit any information requested. :)<n>

It was perhaps mid April with very puffy white spring clouds set against a clear blue sky. While looking up at the sky I noticed an object silently passing through the clouds. (The clouds were at an altitude of approx. 1000 feet) The underside of the craft matched the color of the blue sky perfectly, but against the backdrop of the low white cloud it was perfectly visable. When it pass through the cloud into the clear sky, the shape of the pentagon shaped craft was barely visable. It was a large craft as it took up half of the cloud as it passed through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had just brushed my teeth, put on my jacket and stepped outside onto the porch. Once I got outside I saw the craft. It scared the hell out of me. There was only one of them but it was quite large. It was grey in color and triangular in shape.  It appeared to have several lights or engines on the very end, which was the rear end that I could see the easiest. It was that low. After a few seconds, the lights or engines became  very bright and the craft just disappeared. After I got on the bus, I told my best friend, who lives just a few houses down, what I saw. He told me that he saw the same thing!

We hung out late in hopes of catchin a big one . Around 3:30am we decided to take off , fishing was slow that night .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were heading back toward omaha on highway 6 .Just after we had crossed the bridge by the creek , my buddy riding shotgun notices something very strange and tells me to look up .  To my surprise , I notice 4 flare like objects slowly descending . One was well above the others , all of wich were no further than 1000 yards away . Its seems to me the bigger one may have been triangle shaped .  The other 3 that at first glance looked like flares descending slowly as if they were attatched to parachutes . Then all of  the sudden , the 3 smaller object starting movinging around in different directions . 2 of them seemed to travel off to the west , and one seem to come straight down .  Behind the trees ,the entire area in the field was lit up like a football stadium at night .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point , I could hardly keep the car on the road . We turned back and decided to further investigate . I found a country road , that was closest in the direction of  the crafs . we were driving up this dirt road , west toward farm area . Between us and the creek , around 3-500 yards away , we could see this glowing plasma ball like object , kinda bluish white , and green at times , howevering in the tops of a tree .Almost blinding to look at .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remeber there was also another witnes that was driving a 84 chevy s-10 pickup coming towards us . we were both coming at each other  maybe 5 miles per hour . And it was obvious , this guy was withouth a doubt looking at the same thing .<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this guy passed us , i figured what the hell , ya only live once , we pulled off road into the feild and got out of the car . Mind blown on what we were seeing we started walkin toward it .I do not remember any noise. Within a couple minutes of getting closer , it started getting super foggy . Visibility began to get poor . The illumination of the of object grew dimmer and dimmer . all the sudden it was gone , vanised . We waited for the fog to clear and could not find even a trace of evidence , i wished to god I would have had a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we still discuss it from time to time , and the last couple of years I&#39;ve been keeping my eyes on these reports to see if anything else was reported around that date , or in that same exact area . I guess im posting in hopes of finding more info on what we saw .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The funny thing is , after talking about it all these years , we realized that when it was over , we were driving home at sunrise . Not sure if we lost time or not , it is possible .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are going to conduct further investigation this year with camera (digital , and completely mechanical ) . I will post updates if we find anything . I will also try to get my bud to post as well , in case there is something he saw that i didnt .<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing is for damn sure , they were without a doubt aircraft of some sort , but definitely not of this world .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The streets were very quiet at this hour. I was on the west side of town driving east. Suddenly, dead ahead, I witnessed a red flat glowing disc, approximately 1 cm at arms length, race north across the visible sky towards Mission. Since Abbotsford is home to an international airport I was used to seeing and hearing many types of aircraft at many different alltitudes in under different conditions. I estimated it&#39;s altitude to be 250 feet, and it&#39;s speed at about 700 miles per hour. I instantly slammed on the breaks, stopped the engine, and got out of the car as quickly as l could, to catch the sound of crafts engines. There was no sound however. Abbotsford is situated in a valley surrounded by mountains. That is how I managed to gauge it&#39;s speed and alltitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then the object started to move south and passed directly over them slowly.My son ran in and told me ther was a ufo outside. I ran out side and saw it then .by then it was about 400-500 feet south of the house. we watched it continue south maybe 1/4 mile and it turned west. Note as strange as this might sound,this is the third encounter like this I have had. once about 1968, once in 1974, and this current one. Could you tell me if other people have had numerous close sightings? and if there were any other reportings on april 14 1998? It traveled maybe a mile or so and then we lost sight of it.I took my family inside and one at a time had each one draw a picture and give me a discription of the object. they were seperated when they gave me this imformation yet all discriptions were alike. the object was 75-100 feet above the ground approximately 30 feet wide, boomerang shaped,numerous lights on the bottom (blue,red,pinkish yellow), two brights lights on the front which you could&#39;nt see from the bottom. It was dark in color,no shine. it was silent. When they first saw it it was hovering,then when they stopped and got out it was moving at a walking pace,and faster as it left.<n>

Suddenly LIGHT bolted across the sky directly at the plane.Right before it would have hit plane, the light just sucked up in nothing and vanished. WOULD SURE LIKE TO FIND THIS PILOT!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were sitting on porch in quiet north Spokane neighborhood.Time was approx:3:20am.Apr.14 98(approx.) Clear night. Earlier had been out to some clubs. Alcohol was taken, however, this was not an incident caused by same. As i said, we were sitting on front porch talking, listening to music. I smoke, so was outside.Friend was inside changing music. I kept noticing a bright light in the south sky(my vantage was facing east with a 4 ft.porch overhang above me. Clear view to the EAST-SOUTH- AND NORTH. Out of the corner of my eye I kept noticing a bright light to the South, like it was moving.But when I would look directly at it,it seemed to be stationary. It also seemed to get brighter everytime I would notice it.(maybe that was just me?) After a few mins. a light drew my attention from directly overhead. This was obviously a plane as it had the flashing aviation lights. As I was looking up at the plane (probably within about 15 sec.) I was drawn back to the light in the South.Within  2 sec. the light got really bright and darted across the sky directly at the plane.(not sure of size of plane, but it was high up) I was looking directly at the event.My guess is this thing covered about 5 to 10 miles in an instant. (About the length of 1 1/2 Big Dippers). As it approached the plane, instead of hitting it,as it was on a collision course with the plane,it was like it just Sucked up and vanished right before contact.That is the best way I can describe it. My friend just happened to come back outside just as the light started to move across the sky and he saw it,too. I started jumping around saying to him, &#39;&#39;did you frickin see that&#39;&#39;? Probably woke some people up.He saw this too and was quite freaked by it. We talked about it again the next day. Kind of checking ourselves as to, if we really saw what we thought we saw. WE DID!! WOULD SURE LIKE TO FIND THE PILOT OF THIS PLANE. There is no way that the pilot didn&#39;t see this thing coming at him! Can you search some way to maybe find this plane and pilot?<n>

I look at the sky alot .. I looked up &amp; to my left &amp; noticed what appeared to be a crumpled piece of white paper moving along at a moderate( and steady) speed heading almost directly away from me. it held my intrest. as this thing moved away I noticed it was going at a steady speed and in a directly strait line, I then noticed there was NO wind at all so my flying garbage theory was shot. when I first saw it it was bright white&amp; about the size of a big crumpled newspaper @ 40FT. as it moved away I saw that it was becoming more of a metalic shiny color. this is when I noticed it seemed to be... (no, it WAS)  CHANGING SHAPE. it was a multi sided object the shape is nothing i can discribe.. it had corners &amp; flat spots &amp; appeared to be rolling forward.  the course it took was straight &amp; methodical. as it got farther away it looked very shiny &amp; metalic it continued to &#34;roll&#34; forward untill it was out of sight. there was no one else around to witness it, &amp; it was completley silent. sure wish I&#39;d had my camera.

The airport beacon would shine in through the bedroom window with it&#39;s rythmic flashes every night. I&#39;m a pilot and enjoied living so close to the airport with the sounds of the planes and goings on. I could identify almost every plane by the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awoken by my, then, wife with her saying &#34;their here!&#34; She was out of bed and heading toward the window on her side of the bed by the time I was awake. The room was filled with blue light coming from the small window in our up stairs bed room. By the time I was on my feet and walking around the bed toward the window she was trying to open the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The window was an inexpensive aluninium frame type that had moisture intrusion between the glass panes causing a white calsium deposit to obscure the view. So opening the window was in order to see what was going on out side. When she finally got the window open it made a bang on the aluminium frame. I scolded her for making too much noise. I could only see out of the bottom half of the window so I had to bend down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw four half sphere white lights that were so bright it was difficult to see anything else. The airport beacon was obscured completely. However, I could see what I think was the side of the craft. I say craft because there is no other explanation for the lights or anthing else being there. It was completely silent and stationary above a hanger 25 yards from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the most extrordenary thing happened. I have had an interest in UFO&#39;s and the possability of life on other planets and inter dimentional travel all my life. So it would stand to reason that when confronted wiuth such an event a photo or closer investigation would be appropriate. After looking at the lights for about 1 minute I closed the window and she and I climed back in bed and promply went to sleep. Right before I closed my eyes I thought &#34;what are you doing?&#34; A day or so later I remembered a dream that I had and was telling her about it I discribed everything that I could remember down to her banging the window open. Her face changed and she said that she had the same dream. She remembered the sound of the window banging open. That was her trigger. We had the same memmory accept she remebered a man standing on the other side of the street directly across from our house looking toward us. This I must confess I did not see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Emitted a beam of light in a horizontal sweep of the sky.  Darted horizontally, vertically, and diagonally across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out looking at the beautiful Montana sky one clear night, when my eyes caught an unusually bright star.  I thought nothing of it, but when I turned to look at the same spot again, the &#34;star&#34; had moved.  Then I looked at it from the corner of my eye.  It started to move again, but as soon as my eyes focused on it straight on, it stopped, like it had never moved. I stared directly at it, and less than five minutes later, it started to shake.  Then it darted across the sky, where it stayed for a few seconds more, then took of in another direction.  All together I watched this &#34;star&#34; for over an hour and half.  It had no regular flight path, and stopped, accelerated, and turned much too quickly and precise for any conventional aircraft. The longer I watched this, the more I began to notice.  It would change from a bright yellowish-white light to red, white, and blue lights.  It would also dart across the sky, change direction, and emit a faint white beam horizontally, in a 360 degree sweep of the night sky. Sometimes the light would get brighter, then slowly fade out and disappear, only to reappear in the same spot a few minutes later, like it had never moved.  Just last week, on May 12, I was standing on the top of Big Mountain, a ski resort here in Whitefish, and witnessed the same thing again.<n>

The first triangle emmited a beam or a streak of light from the side of the craft and aimed it toward the other craft.  This light was a blueish in color and seemed to change with the movement of the other craft.  All of a sudden the second craft emitted a beam of its own, at that moment there appeared to be another object in the sky coming in close to them.  I could identify that it was indeed an airplane of some sort because of the red,blue, and white lights in a cross configuration.  When the two triangle objects noticed the third, the two triangles shot strait up in the sky then zig-zagged until they met up with a bigger triangle object that seemed to be sitting in the ladle of the big dipper.  The bigger object shot straight up and just disappeared.  The airplane left to the south, toward the Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs.  The whole time this was going on I was heading north on I-25 just past the city limits of Castle Rock.<n>

What made it different was its abiliy to change direction. It was moving quickly and had it been a satelite or something, it would go across the horizon in a straight manner.  This moved from due East to a South East direction.  It was very noticable and lasted +/- 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 43 year old real estate developer w/2 children in private school.<n>

None of the 5 persons present during the actual photographing remember seeing the object.  It was not known untill the film was developed a few days later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and a group of friends were shooting off model rockets in the parking lot of West Lake High School here in Waldorf Maryland around 17:00 Easter Sunday 1998.  I snapped this photo of my nextdoor neighbor prepairing another rocket for launch, and when the photo came back from CVS, the object in the upper right hand courner was present.  It appears to be roughly oval in shape with what might be a triangular construction on top.  The triangular region seems to be highly reflective, while the lower oval portion of the overall object is dark and featureless. I have ruled out the possibility of lens contamination, it only appears on the one frame, and there were no rockets in the air at the time, and no other persons in the area.  Noone from the group remembers seeing anything, and we were all suprised by the photo.<n>

I saw a red orb not that far up in the sky. And another one comming sideways across to it. They stayed there for at least 15 min. Then along came another one. I think it was having engine trouble, because it was so slow! They hovered there for a few min.

Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Woodland Hills, Los Angeles Shinning craft at midday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sun bathing at the pool in L.A fittness.  I decided to look up at the sky and block the sun out of my view to see if the theory of being able to see things in the sky was true, as i had just seen a story on doing that on a T.V show called &#34;Sightings&#34;.  To my absoute surprise i did.  It was a very bright shining and pulsating object that appeared to shimmer.  I was much more silver than the sun itself, which seemed to be yellow in comparison.  This was a strange thing to see since i had a very memorable dream about meeting with aliens only a few days earlier.  In the dream they took me around the USA and showed me where they had bases, the strange thing was though, they all looked the same, and to me in my dream they looked like businessmen in suits.  I was wondering if i could communicate with the people flying it, this just came to me, so i asked them in my mind to fly in such a way that i could prove to myself that they were not an earthly aircraft.  In about 10 seconds it begen to fly in tight circles at an incredible speed, this clearly could not be a plane, helicopter, balloon or satilite.  When it finished, i heard in my head... &#34;there you go&#34;. I was impressed beyond belief! I was in the presence of other people at the tiime and could not understand why they didn&#39;t look up to see what it was i was looking at so intently, it seemed that they didn&#39;t even notice me.  I felt the need to tell someone so i could get a second witness, however when i had that thought...I heard, or felt a thought that i should not do this and that this experience was a GIFT TO ME, so i din&#39;t tell anyone there at the time.  As i indicated this went on for 20 minutes.  The vehicle flew all over the sky at incredible rates of speed, covering an entire two thirds of the horizon in a few seconds, it was uplifting and joyful to watch, i had such a feeling of overwhelming wellbeing within me. At the end, after the spinning circles, they indicated that they needed to leave as they were being tracked, even though i never saw! any pla nes up there, and it took off to the west, out over the Pacific so fast that i don&#39;t know if it disappeared or left my view.  I have seen many lights in the sky and have had numerous strange experiences throughout my childhood in Australia, along with psychic events all my life, but this was the clearest i have ever seen in daylight.<n>

Moved slowly toward us.  Through binoculars, could see marquise-shaped lights, largest in center, and tapering to smaller in size towards edges. As approached, went up in altitude.  Directly overhead, shot up quickly to a pin-prick size, then disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5:45 A.M. Pacific time, I looked out my kitchen window and saw a bright, intensely red light. The sky was clear, no clouds. We had just switched to Daylight Savings Time last Saturday.  The red light pulsed bright-dim approximately every second.  I looked at it for approximately thirty seconds, noting that it was not moving.  I went upstairs to get our binoculars.  I raised the blinds in the bedroom, waking up my wife.  I told her, &#34;Come here, there&#39;s something in the sky.&#34;  She observed the same red light.  We both determined it was not an airplane.  In fact, we are near the approach flight path for Lindbergh Field in San Diego, and during the event, we saw the lights of a jet on final approcah, and the plane&#39;s lights were below the height of the red object.  We also determined it could not be a helicopter.  I would also like to note that it was extremely early in the morning and there was no traffic noise, and we heard absolutely nothing from this object.  If it had been a helicopter, we would have heard the blades. My wife went downstairs to get our 35 millimeter camera (autofocus-type) to take a picture of the object.  I retreived the binoculars and went downstairs also.  My wife took two pictures of the object, hopefully one at its bright pulse and one at its dim pulse. To my observation, it moved slowly from the southwest toward the northeast, but not in a straight line.  It moved in what I would call a Lazy S configuration.  During all of this time, the pulsing of the lights did not change.  When it got directly over my head, it stopped and it seemed like it disappeared.  I looked for it through the binoculars again, and I found it, but it seemed much smaller and dimmer than when we first observed it, and then it completely disappeared.  It seemed to me as if it went straight up very quickly.  My wife did not see this movement because she had gone inside to try and find someone to call. My wife observed the object through the binoculars, and she reported that it appeared to her that the object had seven marquise-shaped lights that were glowing brighter than the surrounding part of the &#34;structure&#34;.  The largest one in the middle seemed to her to be the one that was pulsing.  Each of the marquise-shaped sections were yellowish at the centers, graduating out to orange, and then red, with the spaces in between red also. I am 44 years old, retired USN Chief.  I work as a Draftsman/Design Engineer for a metals manufacturer.  I have never seen an object like this before. My wife is 43 years old, works as a freelance court reporter.  She&#39;s never seen anything like this before.  We have been married ten years this September and have two cats.  I have three children from a previous marriage and two grandchildren.  We&#39;ve lived in this home since 1989. One other thing we would like to report is that we are close to a mountain in Spring Valley, CA called San Miguel.  Atop this mountain are a multitude of communications installations for probably every radio and TV station in our county, as well as Tijuana, Mexico.  We don&#39;t know if that has any bearing, but we did want to mention this. When we get the film developed, we will send the two pictures via regular mail.<n>

Cassiopea was still very clearly visible on a pre-dawn blue as it is a bright constellation. Between the North Star and constellation Cassiopea, 2 round objects of apparent size of about a penny at 20 feet &#39;faded-in&#39; view as if coming from a higher altitude and coming down low enough not to be masked by the blue of the sky. The fade-in effect lasted about a second. It looked like something coming out af a fog. There seemed to be no self illumination. The color of the two UFOs could have been the reflection of the dawn Sun on a dull metallic surface. Hard to tell, apparent size was small. The color did not look even, sort of brighter in the center and brownish orange outside. Again this is more of an impression, as the size was too small for objective description of surface features. The formation appeared unmoving at first, one object was higher in altitude angle by about 2 moon diameters, azimuth North East, moved as a formation about 40 moon diameters east (towards the approaching rising Sun, which at that altitude was probably already up) and faded-out in exactly the same fashion they had come in, although they faded-out while moving rapidly east and were unmoving at fade-in. About 5-7 seconds. I am an experienced observer as an amateur astronomer for 30 years, a pilot for a few years in my teens and a general observer of nature. I don&#39;t have perfect vision anymore, I have a slight astigmatism and I was wearing my glasses. I used to be a software engineer (without a finished degree) and I now study Physics at the University of Montreal (back to school, got to get that degree). I am a skeptic. Still am, but I used to feel comfortable. My field now is astronomical optics, and I know what a sun-dog looks like, a comet, Venus, flocks of birds, nebulae, a meteorite, a galaxy, an aurora, a weather baloon, Jupiter, an airplane at high, low and medium altitude in foggy or clear conditions from up there looking down or from down here looking up. In winter and in summer. I&#39;ve watched satellites go by hundreds of times, once even Soyouz in full sunlight, not penumbra as we are used to see orbiting satellites in, but if full sunlight; it glared many times brighter than Venus, quite a sight for all of 2 or 3 seconds. My point is that I am an observer, a good one, and a skeptic. This week is the beginning of spring and I saw flocks of Canada Geese, big birds, flying high enough for the birds to be the same size as the two UFO&#39;s of this report, and they flap, you see more flapping than bird actually, and even at that altitude you can hear them yak like a chikcken coop. The UFOs I saw this morning didn&#39;t yak or flap. This I am sure of: it was not two birds or weather ballons, planes or speeding bullets, helicopters, gyrocopters or Venuses. It was not any known human machine or animal. Which leaves unknown natural phenomena, ETs and SDI style research. ETs being the most unlikely of course. This is important: the movements suggested very low mass. An eerie &#39;easyness&#39; about the movements which does not match the apparent size at all is what is most bizarre. Like inertia is for others. They seemed to go about the sky as droplets of water on a very hot surface. At least that&#39;s the best comparaison I can make.

I looked at the sky to the southwest and saw a row of about 8 large/amber color lights. I pointed it out to my friend and she saw them for about a second and asked where they went. About a second or two later the lights came on one at a time from right to left over the same spot we had originally saw the first set.  When the last light was lit it was gone again.  We continued to look and listen but nothing else happened. I would estimate the object was about 5 miles away and about 1000&#39; to 1500 feet above the ground. I am a former helicopter pilot and a mother.  My friend has a professional career.<n>

Couldn&#39;t clearly make out the shape, but it had approx 10-12 lights, most white, a couple yellow and red. Hovered, disappeared, and reappeared for under less mminute intervals 4-5 times over approx 15 minutes. It reappeared a couple of times in same position, appeared couple times in different positions but close to original.  Lots of small aircraft in the area which is normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our house sits on a bluff and overlooks the front range of Colorado Springs. I was in bed watching TV.  Our bedroom has a big window looking out at the front range.  On this night, there was a lot of aircraft flying across the front range, probably from the USAF Academy and/or Co Springs Airport.  It was fairly clear with a few clouds.  I saw the object several times without paying too much attention to it, before it finally sunk in that there was something different about it--it didn&#39;t seem to be moving, just staying in the same spot.  At first I was trying to figure out what kind of airplane it was, but it had more lights than I&#39;ve ever seen.  It wasn&#39;t familiar. I thought it was strange---but again didn&#39;t think too much about it--doens&#39;t necessarily mean anything.  Afterall, I&#39;m not intimately familiar with all aircraft.  Then I also realized that it didn&#39;t seem to be moving.  Maybe it was a dirigible.  Don&#39;t know why one of them would be in the area, but who knows. Or maybe it&#39;s an aircraft with all lights on coming straight at me---but it didn&#39;t seem to get closer---but couldn&#39;t honestly really tell.  But then it completely disappeared (all the lights were gone). That&#39;s when it got my full attention, and I began searching for it.  A few seconds later(maybe 15?), it reappeared in the same spot.  I looked closer and it&#39;s not moving.  It disappeared again after a short time (again less than an minute).  It appeared and disappeared (I think) 2 more times within a short distance of the original spot, and then didn&#39;t reappear.  Each time it appeared, it didn&#39;t seem to move, just hovered.  It was the lack of movement that gave me the idea it might be a UFO.  It was hovering somewhere over the Academy Blvd business district.  Pikes Peak was to the right, the mountains in the background, and the object was a little more than half way between Pikes Peak and the end of the mountain range to the left.  It&#39;s impossible to say how far away from my house it was. I&#39;d guess the base of the mnts are approx. 5 miles a! way. Using that as a reference, I&#39;d say it was a mile from me and was about 6-8&#34; wide. Perhaps that can help give you some perspective of size. It was much larger than anything that normally flies in the area.  The Academy flies small Cessna type aircraft, and I&#39;ve never seen the larger aircraft from the airport fly this close--they have always much farther out next to the mountains. I just wish I&#39;d had a camera handy. I had hoped to see it on the news with an explanation or confirming that I wasn&#39;t crazy--but there wasn&#39;t anything. I have been associated with the AF for 29 years.  I was in the AF for 6 as an aircraft mechanic, my husband is AF, I&#39;ve lived on AF bases, and I currently work for the AF as a civilian.  In other words, I&#39;ve been around airplanes most of my adult life.  Also, I&#39;m not &#34;into&#34; the UFO craze.  I&#39;ve always been very skeptical--I have always thought their existance was possible, but since I hadn&#39;t had any personal experience, I reserved judgment.  My theory has always been that most sightings could be explained (including this one), the witness saw what they wanted to see or they were telling tales, or the sightings were just military test aircraft.  However, what I saw the other night, has gotten my attention.  There&#39;s probably a good explanation of what it was.  I&#39;m hoping your organization may have an explanation or reports from others.  I&#39;m reporting it to you in hopes that you may know of someone else who observed it.  Right now, I dont&#39;t feel like telling anyone (other than my husband) as they&#39;ll think I&#39;m nuts.  I wish I&#39;d had a camera that would have captured it. Have you received any other reports about it?<n>

I sped off, and they moved parallel with me.  As I turned a corner, they rotated diagnally and I took off, losing sight of them<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was April 5, 1998, approx 23:35.  It was sunday night.  I am a student and we had no school the next day.  I left my friends house to take another friend home.  After I dropped him off I headed towards my house, when I noticed three lights in the sky to the east by northeast of my direction of travel (east) I was observing this over a farm field.  As the road curved right, I lost sight of the object over a small wood.  when I cleared the trees the object was much, much closer.  over the initial hydrenaline rush I was able to tell the three lights were a perfect equalateral triangle.  The lights continued to expand outward, as the object appeared to come closer.  I slowed to see the object as it stopped and hovered beyond a neighborhood, nearby an old rock quary.  The lights rotated clockwise, then the lead light turned towards me as the object banked, as an aircraft would turn, I thouht it to resemble the B-2 stealth bomber.  The shape of the triangle was incorrect though.  The object was equal on all sides, as the stealth has a longer base at the tail than the shorther two wings (an isosolece triangle).  As the object moved towards me, sped down the winding road, only looking back as I could, to horrifyingly see that this object was moving parallel to my direction of travel. the road curved, and i lost sight of the object over more trees.  A few seconds later I stopped to turn left on US route 6 and saw that these lights were still there.  I sped around the cornder as the object tilted, while still rotating-so that the bottom of the object was facing me.  I drove really fast without looking back for about 15 seconds, bu that time I had lost sight of it.  I returned home, took out the binocculars and searched for the object, but I could not find it.  All I saw was the stars and moon that had been absent before.<n>

Four UFOs were hovering overhead.  Three of them landed and one of them stayed hovering overhead.  When they landed one alien came out of each of the crafts.  They were smaller but still looked human-ish.  They looked the same as a white person but they were only about 3 feet tall and their eyes were creepy and huge.  They all stood in a ring of light that the fourth UFO hovering overhead had created with a beam.  Then they started dancing and doing the jig or something.  It was really wierd and reminded me of the Telletubbies.  They didn&#39;t even seem to notice us.  But we all watched astonished not knowing what to say or do.  No one ran in fear though.  When they did notice us they just blinked away into non existence and disappeared.  Right when they disappeared we all heard a creepy lingering little laugh, and in their place all that was left was a ring of burnt grass where the light beam was about three feet in diamater.  As far as I know it is still there.  As far as I know, none of us has has ever actually told anyone else about this, for obvious reasons.  Sorry, can&#39;t give out any more specifics for fear of looking crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Lived outskirts approx. 6mi. Turned onto road which was uphill. At top of road, saw bright orange/white light that appeared to be sitting low in the sky. began to panic (have seen this many times),knowing that home was not far, I began to speed up. The light became very bright and seemed to be traveling very low (treetop high) and alongside my car. Speeds of 55-60mph were reached and it stayed along the side and just over trees. The light was very big.A short distance from my home, I began to blow my horn, hoping that my husband would hear and look out the window to see what was going on. When I got to the end of our drive,I turned off my lights and pulled into the driveway(a steep downhill,under pine trees).The light slowly &#39;floated over the trees and sat at the edge of the field nearby.I ran to the door and began pounding. My husband reached the door  in time to see it slowly move away easterly.<n>

I got up to get a drink and looked out the kitchen window and saw an amazingly bright yellow circle hovering about 1,00 feet above the treetops. I thought it was aa star so i went back into the living room and started watching t.v. again.  My brother went to the kitchen and got a drink also and he also saw it and told us to all go there quick. So went over and looked out the window and the yellow object was going striaght up and down.  it did this for 6-10 minutes and then dissapeared. We talked about it for a while and then my Mom&#39;s boyfriend and his son had to go so we went to bed.  About half an hour later I got up and looked out the hall window and there it was doing the same thing.  i went into my Mom&#39;s room and she was satill awake. i told her and we watched to gether for 3-5 minutes, this time though about halfway through it stoped about 10,000 feet off the ground and hovered and we couldn&#39;t tell if it was blinking or rotating. Then it shot down below the trees and then came back up in an arc about 15,00 feet and went horizontaly over to the left of our house and dissapeared.<n>

If I&#39;d known about it then I&#39;d know better the date and maybe the location. My husband and I were driving on I-5 in Northern CA on our way to Southern Oregon for vacation.  The sky was dark.  Hills to our left, fields to our right.  A bright light (like from a police helocoptor) flew very, very low over the highway just in front of us. It made no noise at all.  No real shape we could see.  Just a huge ball of light.  It crossed the highway and I watched it go into a field near a house which had on a yard light high on a pole.  It was too dark to see what was in the field around the house but when the light passed the house and went over the field it split into two lights which seemed to dance over the field.  I asked my husband to pull over so I could continue to watch but he said there was no place to pull over and to stop would not be safe (because of possible other cars coming up behind us).  You&#39;d think the splitting of the light would be the oddest part but the quiet was the strangest part to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

First, He noticed the &#34;black&#34; Huey w/ no markings on it very low to the ground a little ways off the highway. Then, on the Highway Just behind it, was a convoy of two(2) Humvees w/soldiers(?) in all black uniforms w/m-16&#39;s traveling just ahead of a tractor trailer flatbed. On this flatbed was an object covered by a tarp, which was flapping in the wind. Enough so that from his vantage point, He could see a round object with &#34;winglets&#34; sticking out off of the side of it. These He estimated to be about four (4)ft.long. Length or dia. was estimated at 8-9 ft. Metallic in color. Truck was followed by two(2) more Humvees of same Description as front two. A ways back (mile?)there were several County Sheriffs in Chevy Suburbans traveling in same direction. This all took place near Cheyenne Mountain on a desolate Highway on a cold,clear morning. Direction of convoy was either Northerly or Eastern.*NOTE* This event  took place the same weekend as Mass UFO sightings were reported over northern Colorado according to MUFON CO.

This was south of Wickiup, Az., about one mile north of the bridge that crosses the Upper Burro Campgrounds. The shape was a paralagram, with green lights on the corners. It flew from the east-southeast toward the west-northwest, at a high rate of speed. It made no sound as it passed, and it looked to be less that 1000 feet off the ground. The road is hilly and twisty with no place to stop, so I&#39;m not sure where it went after we saw it. From the time we first saw it until it disappeared couldn&#39;t have been more than a few seconds. It was being followed by a military jet. It was also less that 1000 feet up, and clearly following the objest. The plane was close enough so we could hear the jets roar, and this was with the car windows rolled up and the radio on. The jet made a turn toward the south, I know this because I could see two cones from the exhause of the jet.<n>

It changed from an oval shape to a disc shape before our eyes. There was a bright flash of light and i found myself in the spacecraft. I noticed a few oval shaped heads surrounding me. I was momentarily stunned and could&#39;nt move. When I woke up I was on a cold bench. The &#39;beings&#39; were operating on me and i have the scars to prove it. There was another flash of light and me and my mates retourned to the exact same spot that had left only we were left back 3 hours earlier!? I still have flash backs to this day.<n>

These objects were crescent shaped with the horns toward the back. Both had a soft whitish glow to them, and both wavered or wrippled like reflections off of a pond .They crossed over me so that my head was at a 10 - 15 degree angle. The objects where silent and left no trails behind them, the top object was slightly ahead of the other. They would drift toward each other with the two inner crescent horns over lapping .They did this 3 to 4 times. The objects disappeared heading west. They faded from view at the same 45 degree angle as when they came into view. There was a jet ( I believe passenger) flying close by. To me the jet and objects appeared no more than 1 to 2 inches apart. The objects gave me the impression of being lower than the jet..though they did not pass between me and the jet. It was at this time that they faded from view. I am a 27 year old honor roll graduate of Greenville High School.  My hobbies include art, astronomy, biology, geology and many of the other sciences as well.<n>

I checked back a few days ago and was excited to see another person reported the same object, at the same time, in the same area!  What a relief!  I&#39;m not paranoid after all!  This is actually the second time I have seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been checking out your website and the reports within.  I don&#39;t know if it is of any use to you, but I saw a UFO when I was a senior in high school..way back when; and would have reported it then, if I knew of this forum.  I had a hard time getting people to believe what I had seen when it happened.  No one had ever heard of triangular UFO&#39;s and glowing fireballs at the time.  However, I see they are common now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me start off by giving a little disclaimer.  I have always been fascinated by the idea of UFO&#39;s and aliens, or actually anything paranormal.  I loved that show the X-Files and wrote a research paper on alien abduction when I was in eighth grade, but that is pretty much the extent of my involvement in anything like this.  I&#39;m not fanatical, I just think it is interesting and entertaining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think this report may be of help to you, because there are not many reports like mine from this time period, and as you will see; I witnessed a glowing ball and a craft.  Also, I have not been able to find a report where the shape of the object reported matches mine.  There probably is one, but I don&#39;t have time to research UFO&#39;s all day,  I&#39;m a busy mom!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in the early spring of 1998.  I just remember it was starting to warm up outside, but the fields hadn&#39;t been planted yet.  I was driving home from Toledo with two of my girlfriends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were headed west on Airport hwy. between Springfield township and Swanton, we were approximately one mile past Toledo Express Airport when I saw a bright light, similar to that of a helicopter out of the corner of my left eye (south).  The light shone bright and then faded into the size of a radio tower light.  I asked my friends if they, too, had seen it, and indeed, they had.  Apparently, I was the only one impressed enough to mention it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then it lit up brightly and faded again.  At this point we all knew it was something strange, and decided to check it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we began to follow this light, it began to get stranger and stranger.  It was now changing shape continuously, and also began to change color.  It was changing from large to small and white to red and orange.  The object did not appear to be moving at all, but it was hard to tell because we were in a moving vehicle.  We turned left onto a country road, not sure witch one, because many of them intersect Airport Hwy, and also because I can&#39;t remember.  I believe it was somewhere between Swanton and Delta.  This would be around ten miles from where we originally saw the light.  I think this because the town we ended up outside of when we eventually stopped and pulled over would be located between these two towns further south on a map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept following this light after we turned.  It would almost disappear at times and then suddenly reappear even brighter than before.  The light got brighter as we got closer to it, until finally we were right beside it, about thirty miles from where we first saw it.  We were now out in the country and farm land of Henry county, about five miles north of Liberty Center, OH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we came within a mile of the light, it was no longer a light but a solid form aircraft.  We could only see it from the bottom and it was an equilateral triangle(as I remember, but it could have been isosceles), with a bright, round, white light in each corner.  I pulled off the to the side of the road on the left side.  We were out in the middle of the country and no other cars were out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my car and could now see the entire craft.  It was hovering motionless and silent over the field.  Is was hard to tell how far away or up in the sky it was because it was so large, and it was nighttime. I could no longer see the bottom of it just the side.  The side was an acute triangle.  Again, the bottom and top were not visible at the same time.  The craft was covered in thousands of tiny white lights, all in lines, with one single red light right at the top point of the triangle.  In my mind I thought this must be where whoever is flying this thing is at.  If I had to guesstimate I would say it was the size of five or six football fields, just based on the number of lights on it, and maybe a mile up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends were totally freaked out and would not get out of the car, so they never got to see the craft like I did.  I had a camera in my backpack, and asked my friend to hand it to me, but she couldn&#39;t find it.   My friends were begging me to get in the car.  They were completely terrified, and thought they were going to get abducted by aliens (we were teenagers).I thought this has to be some sort of experimental aircraft.  There is an Airforce Reserve base in Toledo.  I had never heard of anything like this craft before, and the closest thing I had ever seen to compare it to was a Stealth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back in the car at my friends urging, and we drove off.  The craft now began to appear as a light again.  We turned around to head home, down another country road.  The light was now shining more orange and more larger than ever.  We saw a truck with some young guys pulled over on the side of the road and thought they must have seen it too.  We stopped to ask them, but they were just sitting there, drinking beer.  We pointed the light out to them and they didn&#39;t seem too impressed, but mentioned that they lived out here and had seen some strange looking lights on different occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car and headed home again.  We were headed west again, and now it appeared as if the light was following us.  My friends got really scared and started to scare me.  My adrenaline was pumping and I was driving about ninety miles an hour because my friends were screaming and claiming the light was trying to get us.  I don&#39;t know how much of that is true, I didn&#39;t look back at this point because I was driving really fast and had to pay attention to the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived in our town, Archbold about twenty miles from where the craft was we could still see the light, but it was only showing white, and I could tell it hadn&#39;t moved position at all.  We went to the gas station, to fuel up, and I could see the light from there.  At this point I was able to find my camera, and took a few pictures.  Unfortunately when they were developed they were all black and blank.  We saw some kids out playing basketball, it was now about 11:00 at night.  We asked them if they had seen anything , but they just thought we were pranking them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived at my friend&#39;s house, I decided to contact the authorities. This was before everyone had cell phones.  I called the Henry county sheriff&#39;s office,(Archbold is in Fulton County), and told the dispatcher what we had seen, that it was still out there, that this isn&#39;t a prank, and that everyone is really scared.  She told me that she was going to send a deputy to check it out, that nobody had reported anything that night, but not to be embarrassed because they do get a calls like this every so often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got home around midnight and woke my mom up to tell her what had happened.  She thought I was just being crazy and told me to go to bed.  I also remember getting in a lot of trouble from my dad for driving the car so fast.  This was on a Friday or Saturday, and I remember drawing a picture of what I had seen and showing it to the Biology and Chemistry teachers at my school on Monday. I don&#39;t remember what they said, I just remember they didn&#39;t really seem to care at all.  My friends and I never really talked too much about the events of that night afterwards.  Why, I don&#39;t know, but they always made me feel isolated about it, because I wasn&#39;t afraid to talk about it, and I think they were.  We had a falling out a few years after high school (over a guy, of course), and I haven&#39;t seen them since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the years passed, I began to think none of this had really even happened, and I had just let my imagination get the best of me.  Then,in 2005 or 2006, one night when I was watching random TV, there was a rerun on one of the cable channels about UFOs seen in  the Midwest in 2000 that were triangular shaped.  I&#39;m sure you know what I am talking about.  It was totally legit and hosted by Peter Jennings,  or one of those &#34;real&#34; news anchor guys.  I felt so validated! I don&#39;t know what this object was, but it made such an impact on my mind I still remember all these details 15 years later!  I suppose it could be of this earth, the only thing that makes no sense is how it can emit such a bright, glowing, ball of light around it.  How can it be a light from far away, but a  dark craft up close?  I have read reports of either/or but not both together. I would be grateful if NUFORC could direct me to some.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My personal theory, and trust me I&#39;m no scientist, although I did have to take some Chemistry and Biology for nursing school, is that the glowing ball of light is actually some sort of exhaust from the craft that contains highly reflective particles, and it is reflecting it&#39;s own light from all those tiny lights on the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either this, or the craft is made of material that is reflective from far away but not up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just like airplane exhaust can reflect the sun and make streaks in the sky, only different.  Or when a fog is rolling in, and you can see it from far away, but when you are standing in it, it doesn&#39;t seem foggy at all.  This would explain why we visually saw it as a ball of light from far away, but a craft up close.  I was actually standing in the exhaust so I couldn&#39;t see the light reflecting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is all I can come up with, because if the craft was emitting so much heat or light that it could be seen from 20 miles away, being that close to it would have blinded my eyes or burned my skin.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else has theorized this, but would be very interested to know if they have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time, I know this is a long and detailed report, It&#39;s just been so long ago I don&#39;t know what to leave in and out.  I hope this is helpful to your cause.<n>

Many times they are seen in a triangular &#34;formation&#34; and sometimes as one object. I have seen these lights on two occasions, and from the vantage point of Niagara-on-the-Lake.  From the rocks at the end of the main street they are evident after sunset, and usually appear in the direction of Missisauga.  One, two or three orbs may be seen, often taking the form of a triangle (one object higher than two others).  They hang in the atmosphere, going nowhere but occasionally growing dim or blinking out.  They have been videotaped and computer-analyzed by members of a Buffalo MUFON group, and are solid objects.  There is a website (&#34;Orbwatch&#34;) devoted to them.  They are well worth investigation.  They are NOT airplanes, unless airplanes hover over lakes and emit non-blinking, yellowish light! The objects may be seen at any time of year but are more obvious in spring, summer and fall.  The date of my observation is approximate.  I am certain that many who have posted here are seeing the same objects, and that they have been around for some time. The date of observation posted is approximate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

That night I couldn&#39;t make it so I took to looking at the night skies from my house which is in vega alta two towns away from the laungh site. that&#39;s when I began to see some activity in the sky, soon after the first NASA laungh an object started moving about in the sky.  I saw it from a distance for a very long time, but for a minute or two it came extremely close. seconds after it took of never to be seen that night but as NASA&#39;S project continiud more sightings apeared. I believe that what NASA was doing was distracting the public so that some other government agency would have the chance to perform their testing of a program in fact something was happening on the opposit side of the Island in lajas this is a town on the southwest side. After watching NASA have a rocket failier on almost every one of this, I began wondering NASA CAN&#39;T be so disorganize. That&#39;s when I personally saw a lot of activity on the sorounding area of the laguna cartagena, many different government and military vehicles sighted there all thru the same time NASA was launghing rockets. Look I spent some time in the military with top secret clearence and I know something enough to understand that something is going on. Soon after roswell was hit by the media that&#39;s when plenty of night activity in the skies began hapening more government personel were being seen and on US military bases housing construction for more military personel is taking place at this very moment. Since I&#39;m retired I often have time to look around and their are more unidentified agency working on sites that are of limits to civilians the same ones that used to be tourist sites, like the small Island near PR called vieques this is next to the bigest naval base of the USA. Somehow the government has take! n almost the entire Island {vieques}they say is for target practice. This is one of the most beautiful places in the word. From what i&#39;ve gatherd is no shooting range something very important is going on I just hope someone has the ability to investigate and tells us whats going on.  PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.<n>
