The light was travelling at about 200 kilometers per hour and about 25 - 30 feet above the ground.  The size of the light was round and approximately 30 feet in diameter and bright blue white pulsing light. After comparing what I saw with two other people I realized what I saw was something other than any ordinary vehicle.<n>

Object crossed 90 degrees of arc in 8 seconds, continued in straight line another 4 seconds until sight obstructed by building. First sighted about 45 degrees to the right of north, out over the water too far away to be light reflected off seagull breast ( my first thought)Estimated speed due to various guesses  of altitude, distance, etc. between 3,000 and 6,000 mph. Possibly heading, in my opinion, toward Del Rio, El Paso, or Southern California passing over sparsly populated part of Texas. I think it was military. Do not believe in aliens.<n>

The plane &amp; pitch black ballappeared to be at simmilar altitude, however the plane had noticable wings &amp; blinking lights - the ball had neither. For the previous 2 days I had seen a black helo each day. On day two I added a pair of binoculars to my workbag &amp; saw another black helo w/ black blades, funny I couldnt see the markings with 8 power at 1/2 mile. The plane passed quickly yet the ball slowly crossed the sky( as i watched it I &#34;heard&#34; in my mind-&#34;you are not seeing this - it is not happening&#34;. I said to myself &#34;Like hell it isn&#39;t&#34; &amp; ran in the house for the binoculars, 10 seconds later I was back outside but it had vanished from sight. Now I know why not so many reports are made, at a deeper level of mind I was being told to ignore what I was seeing, I shook that quickly( I think), but from now on I have a camera at all times.I am still baffeled at the thought of &#34;thought transference&#34; &amp; I suggest we at very least, somehow try to prepare our minds better, but how? Funny,I dont remember that I heard a sound from the jet, now that I think about it.<n>

There was a very thick, low cloud cover. My husband and I were in the house watching television. We became aware of a loud humming overhead. It was unlike anything we have ever heard. We jumped up and went outside and looked up. We couldn&#39;t see because of the thick clouds. But we could tell the craft was just above the clouds. It was moving over our house, very slowly. It was very, very large...the size of half a football field. No turbines, no props just a humming that was vibrating. It slowly passed over the house in the direction of McChord Air Force base which is approximately 10 miles away.<n>

I, the driver, looked and saw the object as well.  It was traveling away from us and to the right, due southwest.  There were no stars in the sky.  The object was oval and it had four lights on its outside that would become bright in a consecutive order, clockwise.  There were also a clump of lights that remained bright in the center of the oval.  We did not see or hear any strange noise.  The object was fairly low to the ground, so that we could see it in plain view, almost as though it were getting ready to land, however it stayed at that same height.  It was not as low as any building, but it was noticably lower than a plane would fly.  The object might have seemed lower than it was due to its immense size.  It was huge!  After approx. forty-five seconds, the object had moved so far away that it was no longer in sight. the object wad traveled such<n>

After about 35-40 minutes, lights moved toward west and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night (June 29, 1999) I was returning home with my daughter to our house in New Carlisle, IN. After turning onto our street, I saw what looked to be the finish of a white-colored fireworks in the northwestern part of the sky. However, the lights (and there first appeared to be two or three) did not move from that location for quite some time. These light flashed in a vertical fashion, much like the lights on an airplane. After pulling into our driveway, my daughter and I watched those lights for several minutes....as we watched them, there appeared to be another light of a green color which appeared to the left of the flashing set of lights. This green light (which did not flash or pulsate) shone for maybe 10-15 seconds, then seem to disappear. My wife came outside and she saw the flashing lights as well and maybe thought it was a cell telephone tower, since these lights were not moving and they seemed to be at the same height in the sky. Just after both my daughter and wife went into the house, I noticed a red light which appeared on the right isde of the flashing lights. As with the green light, it lasted but a few seconds before fading off. After about 20 minutes or so, the lights (which had been staionary) appeared to very slowly move toward the west. In the last five minutes or so, the lights seemd to pick up speed and very soon had disappeared in almost a straight line westward. The entire sighting lasted about 50 minutes or so. It was difficult to determine a shape. However, like I stated earlier, the white flashing lights were vertical and just on occasion would either the red or green light to the side show. Twice to my recollection the red and green light appeared at the same time and then faded. There were at least two planes in the sky that night, one directly over our house and another moving from west to east at what looked to be a lower point in the sky. All the while I wathed the lights, there also did not appear to be any sound, but maybe its distance away could account for that.<n>

Well the reason I was watching it was because of these huge contrail&#39;s behind it. When i noticed a airplane. that resembled a space shuttle. And coming right toward&#39;s the spaceshuttle loking airplane was a cigar shaped object. The colors were actually not color but like a dark moving metal with some reflection to it. I wanted to pull over but there was to much trafic. When I turned the corner and looked back up it was gone but the shuttle was still flying. this all happend around 12:50, it was very ecxiting.<n>

I am a student pilot, and this area is my usual practice area. I do believe my estimations are close, as I seem to watch the sky whenever I see any aircraft flying in my neighborhood, and am familiar with the area altitudes. I realize this isn&#39;t much, but this is what I saw that night. I only listen to Art Bell part of time, and only on my way to work. I believe you were on that night, and this is where I heard, with any interest about your reporting center. I had, with my wife and two friend, seen another incedent that I repoeted to the USAF in 1966, but was as most, I assume, shuugged off.<n>

We was looking at the full moon at about 9:30pm cst with my binoculars when an object flew in the light of the moon from left to right. The event lasted a few seconds. It looked dark, no lights, elongated, steady speed, it appeared to be close to he moon. The moon was full and clear(you can easily see craters etc.) My wife was with me at the time though we only have one pair of binoculars. I was so surprised that I continued to watch the moon and about five minutes later I saw a similiar object move from left to right across the bottom quarter of the moon. It looked longer or closer then the first sighting. It was similiar to the first, no lights, black against the moon, Steady speed. I thought I saw a sparkle the second time as it left the light of the moon and into the darkness. We were in our backyard at the time of the sighting.<n>

I was driving north on Powers Blvd about to turn left or east on Platte Ave.  I saw a very large craft that was either moving very slow or hovering.  I new I was by the airport and at first thought it was an aircraft.  Howerver, it was to large, moving to slow or not at all and like nothing I have ever seen. It looked like an ace of spades flying horizontaly with the pointy end forward.  Depth perseption of the craft was dificult to determine.  It appeared that you could see through some parts of the forward section and into parts of the middle section and the back seemed solid.  It was dark and I would say the craft was black. There were lights on the three points of the spade and interior lights that seemed to give the craft 3 decks at its thickest point.  Again, depth perception was unusual as the interior lights were not on what would normally be considered the hull, but rather within the craft. When I realized what I was looking at I was frightened, completed my turn on to Platte Ave. and sped off.  A co-worker was following me and when we arrived at the terminal he was going to say nothing.  I asked him &#34;did you see that?&#34;  He said &#34;Oh the triangle?&#34;  We walked to the west side of the terminal where we could see the corner where we had seen the triangle.  There was a small plane in a tight circular bank around the area we had seen the triangle.  We assumed the piolt had seen the craft also and was checking out the area further. I am 45 years old, have a bachalor&#39;s degree and have never seen anything like this before.  One other thing we were only about 100 yards away from it at most!  We also both saw the same thing.<n>

The weather was hazy with only a few clouds at several altitudes. We were at 22,000 feet when our radar facility called and informed us that they had a primary target south bound at 350 knots approximaely 150 miles west of Tampa Bay. We were vectored to the target as we decended out of altitude. The radar center informed us that they had checked with all the military bases along the coast in Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana and noone could identify the unknown target. My aircraft is equiped with an F-16 fighter radar and FLIR (Forward Looking Infared) sensors. Shortly after being given vectors we locked up a south bound target at 390 knots, 300 feet off the water. We were established on a head on intercept with the target at 55 miles. As we closed and off set the target, it made a 90 degree left turn east bound and exited our scope in a matter of seconds. I turned right to reaquire the target and again locked it up at 25 miles heading east at now 670 knots. I initally thouhgt it was a radar glitch but every turn, speed change, and heading change was verified by 3 different radars. My aircraft radar, and 2 other radar systems. The target slowed and we closed to within 15 miles of it, it then stopped, reversed course 180 degrees and then made an imediate 90 degree right turn north bound again and accelerated to 1100 knots. It stopped made a 120 degree heading change and accelerated again to close to 900 knots coming at us. I tried to manuver our aircraft to keep it on radar as much as possible and to get a flir image on tape but due to a haze layer it was impossible. The radar image taping system was non operational on this aircraft at the time of the incident. This chasing around the gulf went on for 25 minutes or so and the last call I got from radar was that the target was heading east bound accelerating. I turned and locked up the target east bound accelerating through 1100 knots and climbing! at a ve ry high rate of speed till it just blew off the aircraft scope. That was the last time I saw it on radar. We never got close enough to get a visual on the object. There was never a mode squak from the target and the manuvers were something like I had never seen. I have been flying since 1976 and have extensive military and civilian experience. I waited this long becasue of the reasons we were out in the gulf and why we were where we were.<n>

It was very far away, headed in a NE direction.  It was moving very slowly.  At first I thought it was a plane, but when it got closer I wasn&#39;t sure.  I got my binoculars and looked, but it didn&#39;t look like a plane.  After about a minute of watching it with the binoculars, it suddenly disappeared.  I quickly put down the binoculars and saw that it had quickly picked up speed and was now almost out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was a flying triangle.  It had seven lights on it that I could see.  It was flying at about normal altitude for a plane.  The lights were a light blue color.  When the craft made its rapid speed increase, the lights became red.  There was only the one object and all it did was fly in a straight line.  When I first saw it, it was moving very slowly.  About half a minute after it had passed over my house, its speed increased so much that it was beyond the horizon in a few seconds.<n>

Magnifaction was 40 power, using two filters and a 26mm lenses (focal length is 1442mm for the scope).  Object was approximalty covered 5 to 10 percent the image of the moon relative to the moon&#39;s size in the telescope lens.  It was a full moon.  When looking into the sky without the telescope immediatly after seeing the object there were no contrails, sounds, lights of any type resembling an airplane.  The object was black, shaped like a top-hat, and what looked to be a curved doom.  Sighting was only a few seconds.  Not sure what it was.  Submitting incase someone else was looking at the moon at the same time, and saw something.<n>

I was looking up at the stars when I notist somthing that was stationary and then started to move for no reason. It WAS NOT A PLANE. Or a sattlight.

I was looking out the window at the planet Venus, when a yellow glow caught my attention.  I watched it for sometime.  Then it sped diagonally down.  Suddenly the radio became extremely fuzzy and switched off for a moment, then switch back on.  I kept watching it intensly while asking myself what it could be.  I decided to get help in identifying it, so I beckoned my younger brother to see it.  At first he didn&#39;t know what I was talking about, then he asked me if I was talking about the &#34;line&#34; that he saw.  I turned around, confused, and saw that the circle had created a tail behind it that had started to fade away.  After the tail diminished, the circle dissapeared.<n>

There was a long check-out line, so my husband took our daughter with him on a short errand. As he left, he told me that he would pick me up outside the store after I checked out. When I got through the line, I went outside to wait for my husband. I didn&#39;t see him immediately, so I just stood, looking around as I waited. I looked up at the sky and noticed two bright star-like lights travelling upward high up over the parking lot. Each of them had a single white contrail that trailed behind them as they soared upward. I thought they were a jet at first,but I couldn&#39;t see a body around them. Then I noticed they were flying sort of &#34;neck-and-neck&#34; as though they were racing each other. After I had been staring up at the sky for a few moments, I could see the security guard looking up as well. I don&#39;t really know what he thought, but he appeared to be looking in the same direction as I. When my husband drove up, I told him what I saw. I told him to park in a parking space and look. Unfortunately, by then all that was visible was a jet, which was flying in a different direction. Unlike the lights, I could see the white body of the jet airplane as it flew by. By that time,the lights were gone. My husband insisted that what I saw was the jet. He said, &#34;Anything that leaves a contrail is a jet.&#34; I just thought I&#39;d bring this to your attention, in case someone saw something similiar.<n>

The disk seemed to be round but would at times appear flat as well, no larger than a nickel held at arms length, but still under the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were eating our customary lunch on the road after purchasing the food from Maruta, a Japanese grocery in the George town district.  We sat on a curb between Maruta and a Seafirst Bank, next to an on Ramp for I-5 a routine we&#39;ve gone through several times in the past. One of the attractions ofcourse is the planes landing at King County Airport. After most of the meal I was looking up at the sky watching another plane come in when I noticed a dust spot on a cloud.  I kept watching it to figure out what it was.  Not being able to determine it, I asked my wife what she thought. She insisted it was a bird, but after careful scrutiny, realized it was round and had no movement as a bird might make, such as wings.  Also, at this point we had been watching it a couple of minutes and it was moving in a straight line, no doubts.  No bird can move that straight. We discussed wether or not it was a plane, of which there was one in the sky to compare with and decided no. Aside from the shape, there was absolutely no sound emanating from the object.  A balloon, maybe, but at times it seemed flat and not round, as if it were a CD slowly spinning.  LET ME POINT OUT THAT THIS ANALAGY IS NOT ACCURATE&lt; IT IN NO WAY SEEMED LIKE A SPINNING OBJECT. That merely describes the transition between the round appearance and the flat. While watching, it appeared once my eyes adjusted to the sky&#39;s light, that the disk was not black as first appeared but rather a charcoal grey, my wife however maintains that it was black. As it slowly moved towards a cloud, one with shape, not the usual cloudy Seattle sky, I started telling my wife it was a UFO.  She kept saying no, there is some explanation and was remaining very calm. I however was trying to get her to follow the UFO as it was moving by us. She threw away our trash, and started the car, we headed West on Bailey from Maruta&#39;s parking lot, the North on Corson Ave, but saw nothing, it was gone. I spent the next fifteen minutes trying to determine the time and direction of the sighting since we had neither a watch or map with us.  I think the information given here is accurate and correct.  Please call me for any other info you may need.  I will be checking the web sight regularly for further occurances by others. Thank you, ((name deleted))r<n>
6/26/99 12:30|San Fransisco Bay Area|CA|Other|5 - 10 min|Lenticular object hovering over bay|7/5/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08189.html|29|ndxe199906| Lenticular object hovering over bay<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an object last Saturday 1999 June 26, out over the bay, between the San Mateo bridge and San Francisco. The object was flattened football (lenticular) shaped and white with a slight amount of shadowing underneath it. It was hovering at an angle of  about 15 degrees from the horizontal (ie: horizon) but there were no lights visible. I don&#39;t know the height exactly, except that it was low enough so that the object from my vantage point looked to be lower than the tops of the buildings in the San Francisco skyline. The sighting took place in the early afternoon, approx. 12:30pm to 1:00pm. The day was mainly sunny but with some smog &#34;fuzzing-out&#34; San Francisco city from my vantage point, but with the buildings / skyline still visible. At first I though it was a dirigible / blimp but it was symmetrical and had no lights / signage on it. Moreover, as I continued to watch it all the way across the bridge, it did not move from its position. At about the half-way point across the bridge, as I observed the object, it did a rather amazing fade-out and became completely invisible. This was not due to cloud shade or the object changing its orientation since the geometry of the object remained exactly as before while doing the fade-out. Immediately after it disappeared, I looked in the sky around the area it had been and at that moment I noticed a commercial airliner flying overhead into the area that the object had just been. As soon as the airliner had traveled a bit out of the area where the object had been, the object did the exact opposite from before and did a fade-in and was exactly as it had been before. The fade-out / fade-in took about the same amount of time, of about 2 to 3 seconds I&#39;d estimate.<n>

Almost at same time (sec or two later) there is a flash in front of lead object which appears to turn &#34;up&#34; and fades out. The second one mirrors the turn and also fades away.  Both pilots saw the event. It lasted between 20-30 sec.  No report was filed and no query made to ATC.  Observation.  No military areas nearby were active (0322 in the morning); slant angle and arc rate change indicate objects were fairly far away (possibly in sunlight from coming dawn). Flash in front of the lead was like a pin-prick of light  `* to the left of the object.  the distance between the two objects very closely matched the diameter of the moon.

The object was approximately 2 miles in the air. As I turned the curb driving in my car, I said to myself that I would try to get a closer look at this object. When I got a closer look at the object. The object begin to transform colors, it went from a white ball into an oval shaped object which was red on the outside and orange in the middle. The object then started to move, at first it begin to hoover, and then it raced off so fast that you could only catch it with the naked eye. The object then dissapeard into the sky. The object I know for sure was not an airpland or jet plane, because a jet or airplane could not hoover and one spot and take off so fast.<n>

I looked up as I was running and saw 3 lights moving in a consistent formation.  They seemed too low to be an airplane and too high to be a toy.  As they moved along they began to weave and zoom among each other.  There was no pattern to how they were moving.  They were moving short distances really fast.  After a few seconds of this movement they shot off out of sight.  This is the only sighting I have had.  I am not a sci-fi freak.  I am a reliable college grad.

My brother saw it first, he was out having a cigarette on the deck. He called me and his wife, I came to see. The house where we were is about 2 miles East of the former Rockliffe Air Base. The object was moving South to North, and then began moving upwards very fast. It started off near the moon (from our point of view), then passed a bright star (maybe Venus), then continued North, until it started moving more upwards, when the light got smaller and smaller and then it disappeared. It was at about a 75 degree angle when I looked into the sky, from the horizon, then it became closer to 90 degrees (almost overhead) when it disappeared. It lasted only a couple of minutes. From my point of view, it was very high up; the ball of bright white light was about the size of the large star/planet we saw it pass). There were no sounds coming from the object, and the light was steady the whole time; not flashing. After a few minutes a plane flew over us; we saw the difference between what we had seen and the airplane. It wasn&#39;t an airplane, and it was flying much higher, too, even before it began its ascent.<n>

In the sky to the north, moving due east to west was an object which glinted in the sun. It was a clear night, just some high clouds. With  7 x 50 binoculars the object clearly  consisted of 3 parts. A leading &#34;round&#34; part with, on either side, as if being dragged by &#34;wires&#34; (which were visible), two similar round objects (almost as if it were an obeject with two parachutes, or a gondola with two balloons). Movement was very steady with no vapor trail. In the binocular the size, compared to just eye vision, was multiplied about 4x. At 19:05 another obeject appered which seemed to be a metallic object glinting in the setting sun. In the binoculars it appeared to be an object such as debris (asteroid or dead satellite) which was burning up on entry. The glinting might have been as it rotated, and was on fire, or had a shiny side which was catching the sun. Closer inspection made it seem that rather than rotating, it was moving from &#34;left to right&#34; and that it had a &#34;headlight&#34;. This object seemed rectangular. No other markings or light could be made out. Moving east to west, no vapor trail. Finally, coincidence or not, I tried calling numbers in the local yellow pages for air traffic control (O&#39;Hare), IL national air guard, and FAA, to find out what I might have seen, and all numbers were wrong, or disconnected.<n>

It was moving very, vary, fast north to south (faster than any man made object i&#39;ve ever seen)and all of a sudden it appeared to stop.

The sky was perfectly clear, and the sun had recently set, so I believe it was around 9 pm. Earlier in the day, we&#39;d travelled northward on US93 from the Valley of Fire, to the east of the test site, and on three occasions, we&#39;d seen odd silver disks (one disk on each occasion) which appeared and disappeared (in fact, the sun was shining brightly and it was hard to follow them because they kept disappearing). We&#39;d assumed that they were something out of the test site and in the campsite, we were joking about them when my friend looked up and called my attention to an oval-shaped orange light which  moved silently across the sky from east to west at a steady speed, about twice as fast as a 747 would have appeared to move if it were flying at 35,000 feet; it also appeared to be at least four times larger than a 747 would have appeared at that altitude. The orange light was steady and not brilliant - much duller than a shooting star or a plane. After we watched it for about five seconds, it utterly vanished. It may be significant to note that we were about 17 miles southwest of the tiny town of Baker, but to the west, there were no towns at all before Ely, about 56 miles away.<n>

It passed in front of (underneath) a high white cloud and was clearly bright and visible even with the white cloud as background.  It passed into the cloud and was not visible for less than a minute, then came out of the cloud and continued.  About 7 minutes after I first started watching the light, it stopped in the sky, and stayed in the same spot for about 2 minutes.  While I was looking at it, it suddenly vanished - suddenly it just wasn&#39;t there any more.  I looked all over the area of the sky but couldn&#39;t see a trace of it.  Then I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it, but no one else was at the bus stop with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, 6/24/99 I was waiting for my bus at what is known as &#34;7 Corners&#34; on Washington Ave. in Minneapolis.  I was sitting on the bus stop bench on the south side of the street, facing north.  My bus wasn&#39;t due for about 15 minutes and I didn&#39;t have anything to read so I was just relaxing and looking around.  It was early rush hour and traffic was pretty heavy.  The sky was bright and blue with a few scattered high fluffy white clouds.  I was sitting in the shade and wearing sunglasses, so I was looking around very comfortably.  I was looking north (towards the Holiday Inn at 1500 Washington Ave.), and at 4:35 p.m. I was enjoying the lovely sky and watching a couple of high clouds when I noticed a light moving very slowly from west to east across the north sky.  It was very high up and I immediately thought &#34;oh, a satellite&#34; like I&#39;ve seen on clear nights away from the city.  It looked very much like a satellite, but a little bigger, like a small star - as bright, white, and clear as a star on a clear night.  Then I realized it was broad daylight, and I wondered if it&#39;s possible to see a satellite (so bright and clear!) in the daylight.  I watched it carefully, curious to make out what it was - but it was too far away - just a light like a moving star.  As I watched it I looked at with and without my sunglasses, and it was clearly visible both ways.  I&#39;d been watching it cross the sky slowly from west to east for about 2 or 3 minutes when it came to a cloud.  I expected to lose sight of it, but was surprised to be able to clearly see it with the cloud in the background.  Even though it was a white light on a white cloud, it was bright enough to see clearly.  Then it passed into the middle of the cloud and I lost sight of it for about 45 seconds.  It came out of the cloud again and I continued to watch it move slowly east.  Two or 3 minutes later it stopped.  I wondered if it was changing direction and kept watching closely, but it just stayed still for at least 2 minutes.  While it was ! just sitting there in the sky, a bus passed in front of me, blocking it from view.  I expected to lose sight of it, but after the bus passed by I could see the light clearly, still sitting in the same spot.  About 1 minute later it vanished.  I was looking at it, and then it was just not there anymore.  I looked all over to see where it had gone, but I couldn&#39;t see a trace of it. I looked around to see if anybody else had seen it, but there was no one else at the bus stop. My bus came and as I rode, I kept watching the north sky for a couple more minutes but couldn&#39;t see it anywhere.  I would really like to know if anyone else saw it and if anyone knows what it was!<n>

It moved around slowly in the same area descending and ascending for about an hour. I left at around 5p.m. I went to buy a disposable camera at the 7-11 a block away. At 5:12 p.m. the sphere over the banana tree was gone. I sat for a couple minutes looking the sky over, and I found to the east two more. (Both looked the same as the first sphere over the tree.)  I watched these two spheres as they slowly headed west, stopping directly over an obvious incoming and outgoing flight lane. During that time a plane heading southwest for LAX pasted directly under the two spheres. I took two photos of this, but they did not come out.  I watched these two sphere’s for about 15-20 minutes, as two more planes (separate times) leaving LAX heading east had also passed under the objects. I snapped another 4 photo’s but these also didn’t come out.  A low cloud cover came through the area at 5:35p.m. I lost sight of the two spheres, as they passed through the clouds. When the cover burned off 10 minutes later I spotted directly over the moon another sphere heading west.  The moon was in the southeast portion of the sky. I took a picture of that sphere with the moon.  It came out but it only looks like a light spot with a dark bottom.  A few minutes later another sphere heading east passed over the moon. So now I was watching two spheres.  One is moving to the east, and one moving to the west. The second moving to the east was a lot closer. With the naked eye you could see structure to it.  It was obviously nothing conventional.  I had also taken pictures of these two spheres together. I had earlier in the afternoon seen a couple Mylar balloons drift by and when they became the size of the sphere’s you could still see the strings on the balloons, so I knew that what I was watching was not any balloon. All the spheres at some time went against the wind.  The balloons did not!  The sphere moving to the west eventually went out of sight.  The sphere moving to the east eventually positioned itself in one spot in the sky, and during that time other’s joined it. At one point there may have been as many as five spheres in the sky. It was hard to tell because they seemed to fade in and out. Thes! e spheres were very hard to see with the naked eye.  But once you spotted them you couldn’t miss them.  This went on for about twenty minutes or so and then they one by one disappeared.<n>

They were in a straight line, 6 to 8 white lights on either side of a red central light.  The object seemed to be hovering horizontally some 250 ft above the rooftops and appeared to be about 100 ft long.  We stopped the car and got out to listen.  We couldnt hear anything.  The only aircraft flying in the area was a Hercules from RAF Lyneham.  We often have Hercules flying over the town and they have a distinctive drone sound, are easily identifiable.  We called Air Traffic Control who couldnt say what we had seen, although they said it had too many lights for a Hercules.  The object seemed to move sideways through the air, without &#39;banking&#39; to turn and began to hover.  At this point we lost sight of it.  We could not see any other features apart from the row of lights.<n>

It was moving up into the night sky at around a 40 deg. angle up into the night sky. No sound but it light up my car and my legs. The appearence was like a giant comet leaving Earth&#39;s atsmophere going up into space not across the sky or horizontal but up at an angle from the sea. The light was blinding but the tail had a lower hew or was not as bright, silver like. The ball at the end which was exactly round, was so britht white it  hurt my eyes. {every 7 yrs my Dad and I get a visitor, same looking guy each time.

Then there was another bright flash and it shot to the other side of the yard, it hoovered there for a few second then another bright flash and it shot to where it was when I first saw it.  Then there was another bright flash and it shot straight up into the sky.<n>

We were star gazing around 11:30 at night when a very bright light from the west caught our attention at the same time.  The brightness was comparable to that of burning magnesium which seemed to create a glow our halo around it.  It was very high up.  The &#34;glow&#34; lasted for about 10 seconds as it moved slowly to the north.  The light dimmed and started to accelerate, moving in a straight line for another 10 seconds or so.  All of the sudden it seemed to &#34;turn on a dime&#34; (about a 45&#39; angle) and started moving faster and getting dimmer (barley visable). This lasted about another 80 seconds when it grew very bright like it had previously and then it was gone. What this was we really had no idea.  Our first thought was that it was a satelite reflecting light from the sun. However that doesn&#39;t explain the sudden change in course.  It was much to far away to get any more details.  Very interesting.  If you&#39;ve ever heard anything like this could you please let me know.<n>

It sped much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen, appearing from the southwest and racing in ascending path toward the north (it appeared at approximately 30-35 degrees off the horizon, and climbed to approximately 50-55 degrees).  Then, about two seconds later, it simply vanished.  It didn&#39;t diminish in size, or fade, or slow down.  It was just gone, leaving no trace behind.  In terms of how close it was to me, I can only estimate.  I am five miles from Dulles Airport, in a flight path for that airport, and this object was between me and Dulles.  I&#39;d say it was no more than a mile from where I stood, probably closer than that, and no more than 5000 feet in altitude, and probably less than that.  Its actual size I estimate to be about that of a passenger jet (a Boeing 727 or thereabouts). The sky was crystal clear that night.  In fact, it was probably the clearest sky we&#39;ve had here all year.  Many stars were visible that are not, usually.  I was on my balcony at the time of the sighting, and I spend a lot of time there, sky-watching.  I&#39;m very familiar  with the kinds of aircraft that usually swarm about this area, and watch them all, in order to become familiar enough with them that I won&#39;t be fooled by one into thinking I&#39;ve seen a genuine UFO when it is, in fact, an airplane.  The object I saw on this night went incomprehensibly fast, and was absolutely without sound, and I know it was not any kind of conventional aircraft.  The fact that it was ascending indicates it was not a meteorite, and I learned later that an Iridium flare traveled the same route as my object, but three minutes AFTER I saw the object.  Having gotten the URL to a website which gives times of Iridium flare flyovers, I went out to see one the next night, and I did see one, and can say with certainty that what I saw on June 22nd was NOT an Iridium flare.  I just do not know what it was. One other detail about the object: it was the brightest white light I have ever seen, and it had a pale blue rim that blended into the white light.  The overall effect was of a &#34;bluish-white&#34; light.<n>

We had commented on it, and noted how we had neither seen anything like it before. After listening to Peter on the Art Bell&#39;s show tonight, I had to take the time to contact you, and report that what had to be the same object described on the show, was visable from here on the head waters of the missouri river, between Butte and Bozeman, in south central Montana sunday night, by two more witnesses. It was truely an amazing bright white light, with a bluest-green aura or haze around the center. We both talked about how it looked like an arc welder.

I was driving on a two-lane road at about 45 miles an hour, when I saw an object that looked like like a disk with a string of red, green and white lights shining around the rim of the object.  I noticed that it was not moving, but rather it hovered over a thicket of vegetation on the side of a small hill.  I pointed out the object to my friend who was surprised to observe that the object suspended in the air.  We pulled to the side of the road and got out of our rented car, and continued to look at it.  We then realized there were some other people who had gotten out of their cars and were observing the object.  The object seemed to be emitting a blue beam of light from its underside.  We noticed that there was a small object in the beam of light and it looked to us like it was an animal, perhaps a small dog or cat. The animal appeared dead or asleep and slowly disappeared into the object.  After five minutes we noticed some helicopters were moving slowly towards the disk.  The disk then began tto descend and disappeared into the side of the hill.  We could hear a weird sound from the area into which the object seemed to have penetrated. The helicopters disaapeared beyond the hill but could still be heard for a few minutes after we lost sight of them.  Some people began to walk towards us, and my friend was a little fearful and told me to get back into the car, which I did not hesitate to do.  We pulled away, but we had the eerie sensation that we had seen something unusual.  We checked in our small hotel and had an uneventful trip back to San Juan.<n>

They appeared to be somewhat oval, but transformed to a long golden V shaped object. We are currently investigating the incident, and will be going over the video frame by frame. In zooming in there was some blurring, and distortion, but still a very valuable and interesting piece of video. You can see a definite white light in the middle, with some red and green light coming through, looking at each frame, there does appear to be a contrail of some sort. He contacted Nellis and Vandenberg AFB, and neither knew what these were, not theirs. The investigation continues, and will keep you posted if anything develops. Also, driving towards Las Vegas, at 8:30pm. on I-15, ((name deleted)) spotted an aerial object in about the same location that seemed to be stationary, and move towards similar area, we both watched it, and it finally moved, became intenesely bright, and then move around the sunrise mountain area, but do not know at this time if the two sightings are connected Thank You, ((name deleted))(Investigator/MUFON) and friend ((name deleted))<n>

Object was a firey white globe the size of a Union 76 gas station advertising ball and diminished in size and brightness as it fell a vertical distance some 1000 feet, and disappeared behind the hills south of the 205 FWY, 2 miles east of the Tracy city limits. The evening was perfectly clear and still, no moon visible, many bright stars visible; very little traffic on the FWY at the time except a large McDonald&#39;s Restaurant supply 18 wheeler vehicle who must have also witnessed the event. There were no colours visible either inside or outside of the (single) object, and no impact was noted (assumed to have burned up before hitting ground); no noise noted, although my driver window was all the way down at the time of the sighting. Did not resemble the normal traverse of a bollide meteor, but seemed rather to be some sort of wreckage free falling from space and distintegrating due to contact with earth atmosphere. Did not seem to be intelligently operated, but in a kind of free fall as it disintegrated. No parts of the object seem to fly off, nor were there any sparks of any kind noticed at any time during the event which lasted a total of 5 (five) seconds in duration. Eyes of both driver and passenger were on the general area of the event prior to the event occurring, nor did either of us turn away during any part of its fall but our attention remained fixed on the object. Only one alcoholic beverage was imbibed by driver and passenger that night, approximately 4 hours prior to the event, and both driver and passenger were of &#34;clear minds&#34; and were fully awake and alert both prior and after the event. No other objec! ts were noted accompanying the object which seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, probably gradually gaining brightness as it fell to earth before disintegrating. Only a slight trail was noticed which quickly evaporated. The trail was a pure white with no colours noted. No camera was available for imprinting the image on light sensitive film as it fell. Duration of event: 5 seconds.<n>

The object was white in color and looked like it was at a high altitude. At first we thought it was an airplane but then we noticed there was no blinking to the light. It remained constant and there was no audible noise coming from the object. We observed it for about 3 minutes moving slowly across the sky in a straight line, above us at about a 75 degree angle. The object then seemed to disappear in the matter of a second and was not visable again. The sky was clear and there were no clouds.<n>

The size was as big as my thumb held in front of me and the spot on a wall at 12 feet away. I estimate that the height was 2,000 feet in altitude. I contacted the airport and was told there were no aircraft in the area. NOTE: The city street lights illuminated the bottom of the craft.<n>

I could only see one but there could have been more.  It was late at night just before midnight, and I was getting ready to go to sleep.  I saw different color lights and no sound of any kind.  The entire event did not last more than 10-15 seconds.  The only thing that I thought was strange is that during the sighting of this object, I heard strange voices in my head which sounded like a different language, but a language that is totaly different and not from this world.  Then, as the object disappeared, the voices also stopped.<n>

I noticed a black spec. I then blinked to make sure it was not something in my eye. Upon further inspection I noticed this spec was circular and very black. I also noticed a shadow underneath it on the surface of the moon. The moon was approximately half full and the object was moving in the middle of the illuminated area and traveled in a straight line toward the dark half. I watched it until it disappeared in the darkness and kept watch for the next hour in hopes of seeing it again but to no avail. This object would have to be hundreds of feet in diameter for me to be able to see it. So I researched Lunar orbiters and found that the biggest one was about 2 meters in diameter, which would be impossible to see. So what was it?? Has anyone else seen something similar??<n>

Second. Greenish glowing ball with thick red-orange tail shoot out of clouds then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about June 19, 1999 I was camping in southeast Oregon in the Alvord Dry Lake area which is near the Nevada Idaho border, just north of a little town call Fields. The dry lake is a huge area that is bordered on either side by mountain ranges  We were camped on Pike Creek, about 35 minutes up the dirt and gravel road, which is on the western side of the Lake.  The sun had gone down, the night was relatively clear. Sighting 1:We were sitting facing east toward the opposite end of the lake looking at the mountain range.  We suddenly saw a line of red lights about the length of an index finger held horizontally against the horizon rise from behind the mountain range.  The color of the lights were the same as taillights to a car except that there were many of these lights in a row, seemingly connected.  The lights rose, hovered about an inch or so, relative to us, above the mountain range for several seconds and then sank back below the mountains.  Because it was so far away and all we saw were lights we could not determine the shape of the object.  What we saw was a horizontal line.  The lights had a moving glowing quality.  Perhaps the object could have been round like a saucer ringed with red lights.  Because the distance from us to the other side of the lake was several miles I can only assume that this object must have been huge.  Both my friend and I said at the same time &#34;Did you see that?&#34; So I know I was not imagining it.  A few days later we happened to take a drive to the other side of the mountains, about a two hour drive, and there is absolutely nothing over there.  Just more desert, more wilderness. Sighting 2: Then two nights later, on or about July 21, we were sitting again looking out across the expanse.  The night was cloudy and seemed to threaten rain.  Out of the clouds at our eye level we saw a green/pale green glowing orb about the size of a golf ball held at arm&#39;s length streak from out of the clouds.  The orb had a short thick reddish/orange tail and just as quickly as we had seen it disappeared behind a cloud.  We saw this more to the north of the previous sighting and it seemed to be inside the dry lake area as opposed to the previous sighting which appeared to be on the other side of the mountain range.  This could be a natural phenomenon, some kind of huge static ball maybe although I have never heard of anything like this before.  There was no sound and it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.  But it lasted long enough to leave a lasting impression on my mind.  The object was very clear.  I think what&#39;s important is that the object was not up in the sky like an asteroid but right at eye level just a little bit above the mountain range.  We both saw it and both said simultaneously,&#34;What was that?&#34; Again, because of the distance from where we were to the other side of the dry lake area this object must have been huge.  I can&#39;t even begin to calculate the size of it.<n>

I thought at first it was just heatwave distortion but I could see another aircraft in the distance moving normally.The light appeared to be in the front of whatever it was because as it went away from me I could only see the halo rather than direct light.There didn&#39;t seem to be any sound comming from it,but I do have some hearing loss. I have been woking on and around military aircraft since 1966 in the U.S.Navy and as a civilian contractor<n>

As it turned, the sun&#39;s rays reflected from a row of at least 20 windows along the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were stopped at a gas station near the Vestal library when we spotted this long cylindrical object silently flying in the southern sky.  It had no features such as wings or tail structures and had a shiny metallic appearance.   It was traveling much slower than the similar object that we observed on May 30, 1999.  It was traveling to the east when we first noticed it, but it then started to make a slow right hand turn.  As it turned, it passed through the angle at which it reflected the suns rays towards us.  For a short time a row of at least 20 individual bright lights appeared on the side.  These lights may have been the reflection of the sun from a row of windows on the side of the craft.  As it turned southward along route 26, it climbed in altitude and then suddenly disappeared at an extreme rate of speed.  No sound or vapor trail was apparent.  The sky was perfectly clear.  This sighting occurred at almost the same time as the previous one, right before sunset.<n>

The sky was clear and sunny with the exception of a few clouds. As I was looking at one of the clouds a craft moved slowly from behind it. My first thought was &#39;What the heck is that?&#39; It was a large white/silvery color and rather radiated very bright white reflextion/light. I did not see wings, a tail, anything hanging from the bottom of the craft, no blinking lights. The craft left no contrail and made no sound. It was cigar shaped and about the size of three Goodyear Blimps end to end. I watched it move across the sky at a steady rate of speed until I could no longer see it because of trees in the next door neighbor&#39;s yard. I am a graghic artist and know how to &#39;look&#39; at an object. I have never seen anything like this before. Two weeks later my roommate and I were out in the back yard working in the folwer bed and I sat down to rest...looked up and saw another craft just like the one I reported above only smaller in size. I called to my roommate and pointed to the craft. We both watched it travel across the sky. Both craft came from the same direction.<n>

So I watched it coming slowly towards me, it wasn&#39;t very high but there wasn&#39;t any noise coming from it ....So I watched ...it was so bright though. I was intrrupted by across the street a couple came running out to look at it. It was right over me when it came to a stop...for like 3 secs, with a faint humming sound....There was still no other light except the surrounding glow from the white light (Does this sound like heaven *L*). It&#39;s a totally clear night so I could see it was long, from my distance it looked like the size of a huge passanger plane, but no wings, cigar shaped as you explain it!  Then it just took off, faster then when it came, but not remotely fast enough ....still as bright as when it first came. Then I watched it go, but gor freaked out so I ran in the house, as well as all the neighbours did...<n>

It was too bright to be a star and that is one reason I continued to watch it. It was still and then began to move to the ground.  It stayed on the ground approximately 5-10 minutes and then moved back up in the sky at the same location it was before.  It slowly starting moving horizontal toward the west until it dissapeared.  I have three other witnesses besides myself.  We live in a very secluded area on a large farm hundreds of acres between all neighbor&#39;s property.  Our dog, along with many others were barking for a very long time while it was in the area.  I did not notice any sound the object might have made.  It is also noteworthy to state that I live very close in proximaty to government property- Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The object three times the size of the largest planet, had a rainbow of colors around it in a jagged shaped around it.<n>

When I looked up in the sky exactly above my head I had my eye on bright star and a couple of others in the area one of them moved. I am not sure now that it was a star. The object was not very bright but when it started to move it grew in length and width it was the shape of a capsule like a pill, it got VERY bright and it moved a short distance and then it started to dim and just blinked out. It was moving north from south and it was straight up from where I was standing facing north. When I first saw this I said, &#34;wow&#34; and my co-worker looked up and saw the object disappear. I thought it may have been a shooting star but it didn&#39;t streak and it didn&#39;t look like other shooting stars I have seen before. This object moved and brightened up like it was building energy to move very fast. The object was very high in the sky and appeared to be close to the stars.<n>

It remained visible in the same part of the sky for approximately half an hour, at which time the original observer left.  Two other witnesses - family members - saw the unusual motion of the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes on an unusual occurrence in the night sky 16-17 Jun 1999. I stepped onto the patio at the back of the house for a smoke and was admiring the display of stars.  The sky was very clear ; it is often cloud covered to some degree here in Courtenay on Vancouver Island. I located Ursa Major to find Polaris, as I normally do, and found it with no problem.  I used the memory trick;d been taught in Navigator;s school; and followed the arc of the Big Dipper;s ;handle&amp;#8221; to Arcturus then tried to &amp;#8220;speed on to Spica&amp;#8221; but wasn&amp;#8217;t so sure it was visible.  A bright reddish planet was in the western sky &amp;#8211; I took it to be Mars, but it may have been Venus. Turning counterclockwise towards the south and then continuing to approximately south east, I spotted a fast moving object apparently at great altitude.  I immediately thought &amp;#8220;satellite&amp;#8221; and watched as it proceeded from southeast to northwest.  The object was marginally brighter than the stars around it and about the same diameter.  As I watched the &amp;#8220;satellite&amp;#8221; it stopped and began a counterclockwise rotation describing a circle perhaps the size of the tip of my finger held at arm&amp;#8217;s length.  It turned for about 3/4s of a circle, stopped and reversed direction &amp;#8211; moving clockwise for about half a circle. Thoroughly  fascinated,  I wanted to get some parametric data on the object&amp;#8217;s location.  I extended my right arm fully with my thumb and little finger spread as close to a straight line as I could get them.   To the left of the curious object was a star noticeably brighter than most of the others around it.  With my left eye closed and my thumb just touching the bright star the object was almost exactly a splayed hand spread away from, and in line with, the bright star.  To fix the azimuth I dropped my arm to about 45 degrees and noticed that with my thumb on the vertical middle member of the house&amp;#8217;s upstairs window my hand filled most of the gap between the house and a small tree in the neighbor&amp;#8217;s yard.  I noted where I was on the patio using the BBQ and a separation line in the concrete as references. I was approximately one pace away from the leg (on my left) on the back of the BBQ about a foot west from the line on the concrete.  I planned to come back later and attempt to get fairly accurate azimuth.  For the time being I estimated it to be about 130 degrees true with reference to Polaris.  Raising my arm back to the object I estimated its elevation at about 70 degrees (from the horizontal) . Trying to get more detail on the object I looked a few degrees to the right of it to use my peripheral vision.  Another quite faint object, reddish in color was moving somewhat erratically side to side below and slightly to the left of my first object.  It was proceeding towards the first object.  The first object appeared to be moving away from me, that is almost straight up, and it was getting dimmer.  I checked my watch and noted the time was 23:40 (Pacific Daylight Time).  When I looked back up I thought I saw faint reddish beams of light flash between the two objects.  They occurred rapidly &amp;#8211; there were perhaps 3 flashes.  Both objects continued to move away from me during the &amp;#8220;exchange&amp;#8221; for lack of a better word.  I stuck my head in the door and asked for somebody with good eyes to come have a look at something interesting. The family was watching a video at the time.  My wife joined me on patio and I used the bright star as a reference point to steer her line of sight toward the objects.  She saw the first one that again stopped and dipsy-doodled around some more.  It did not move far, but at that distance it must have had incredible acceleration. She watched for a while and commented on its unusual motion. The second object was all but invisible at this point.  I thought I perceived a vary faint golden ring, or halo,  flash around the first object a few times.  I again tried to use peripheral vision the get a better look, but it was so faint I thought I may have imagined it.  I saw this perhaps half a dozen times.  I mentioned it to her, but she did not seem to see it.  The diameter of the flash would be about the size of a looney (Canadian one dollar coin) held at arms length.  I thought maybe something was causing a reflection from my eyeglasses &amp;#8211; so I moved my head around slightly &amp;#8211; looking at stars near the object- but the only place the halo occurred was around the object, centered on it. My wife went back in the house and a few moments later I saw a meteorite sparkle from east to west overhead then wink out.  I was getting a little cold, so I went to get a jacket.  Shortly afterwards I saw an aircraft&amp;#8217;s red strobe and saw the red and green nav lights as it winged from south to northwest and I heard the jet engines,  faintly but clearly, as it passed to the west of me.  I noticed it was about 3 minutes after midnight.  Our eldest daughter came out and I located the object for her &amp;#8211; she was not sure she was looking at the right thing.  The object was now a little fainter than the surrounding stars and seemed to be continuing to move vertically away from us.  It jinked a little but not as much as before.  My neck was sore by now so I went in and scribbled a few notes to later record the event in detail.  This is the account of what we saw.  I have never seen such an amazing thing in the skies before. I am a 45 year old man still actively serving in the Canadian airforce as an Avionics technician with 29 years military service, holding the rank of Sergeant.  I got interested in astronomy &amp;#8211; primarily identifying constellations - while undergoing Air Navigator training in 1977.  I did not complete the Nav course, but using the stars as navigation aids is an interest I&amp;#8217;ve kept ever since.  I have the equivalent of a college diploma as an Electronics Engineering Technician.  I have been married to my original lovely wife for 23 years.  We have 2 daughters, 20 and 17, and share our home with Ollie the bone-head dog.  I have spent most of my career working on the flight line on fighter aircraft (CF-104s, CF-5s and CF-18s).  I was a Quality Assurance Rep at a defence contractor&amp;#8217;s plant for 5 years and have worked at 19 Wing Comox as the Avionics Shop supervisor for 4 and a half years.  I am a computer software power-user (my 4 Gig hard drive is full) and an avid flight simulator pilot.  I have about 20 hours back-seat time in CF-18 Hornets.  I have instructed courses in the military on Theory of Flight, Inertial navigation and Automatic Flight Controls .  I received two Suggestion Awards for designing/building technical improvements to the CF-18 and its ground Test Equipment. 1 I later measured the distance from my eye to my spread hand to be about 2 ft 3 inches (or about 70.3 cm).   My spread hand from thumb to tip of little finger is 9 inches.  Using this data it should be possible to compute the apparent distance of the object from the bright star. 2 I later approximated this angle and used a protractor to arrive at the 70 degrees elevation.<n>

We were halfway there,and saw a very large triangular shaped craft,with 3 bright white lights at each end, the lights did not blink or flash. The craft was just above the car and was moving at about the same speed as I was about 35mph. It was going the same direction also. We arrived to my home, and hurried up and was going to look at the craft from the back porch,we ran from the car inside one door and my friend ran out the back door to look at the craft closer. I did not make it to the back porch,because I heard a strange noise coming from my bathroom. My hairdryer was running on high speed. I had not been home since 3pm that day,it was now around 11:30pm. And I have never left my hairdryer of all things on and running. No one else had been to my home and the door was still locked as I left it. I remember turning my hairdryer off and then meeting my friend back in the kitchen area where my back porch door was located. I do not remember what happend after that. Recently, in May of 03, i discussed this with my friend and she did not remember the whole occurence. I had to keep talking about it with her over and over..and she still isnt sure if it even happend or not. Im not sure if time was lost or not,if it was,then it wasnt that long.Prior to this incident, I would see from time to time red lights coming from outside of my windows at night time,and my neighbors told me it was probably hunters. But once there was a very bright light prior also to this sighting coming in all windows of my downstairs. My friend told me she did not turn any lights on that the lights were coming in the windows from the outside,and she was so scared she covered her head up and would never stay there again. I have since moved away from that area and the house had been torn down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1999 is approximate.  PD))<n>

He is the director of Safety at a major oil and gas company and has the highest amount of personal integrity a person can have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 Brothers (I&#39;ll call them Tom and Allen), were driving a truck in Wyoming late at night. It was late (around 10pm) and Tom saw something in the distance down the road or at a low altitude. The lights were dim because the object was very far away. Allen told Tom to flash his lights at the other driver/object. Tom flashed his lights 3 times. The object flashed the lights back at him 3 times, but when this happened all of the lights inside the truck (radio lights, console lights, floor board lights) started to flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Less than 10 seconds later&#34; according to Tom the object starting to move towards them very rapidly (much faster than a regular vehicle can move). The object stopped in front of them and seemed to follow them (from the front). The object was a cube shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom flashed his lights 3 times again and the object flashed it&#39;s lights 3 times back and again all the lights/electronics began to flicker uncontrollably. this object followed them down the road for a few miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom said that he was scared to death and his brother, Allen was hiding in the back of the truck crying saying &#34;I don&#39;t want to die&#34;. Tom began to slow down and the object slowed down at exactly the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom sped up and the object sped up at the same speed.

It was to dark to use them though.  I looked up and saw the &#39;craft&#39;.  It was oval shaped, and had silvery, metallic look to it.  It had flashing lights too.  Green, blue, red, purple.  After these colors flashed, a bright withish light would flash.  It wasn&#39;t moving very quickly.  Suddenly, one of the stars moved!  It wasn&#39;t a star at all.  It was another &#39;craft&#39;.  It did loops and moved quickly.  Then it began chasing the first craft.  The oval craft sped up and ran away.  The &#39;star&#39; followed it.  The oval craft suddenly disppeared.  The &#39;star&#39; stopped and did some more loops, then seemed to fade away.  That is all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous, date is unspecified.

We were out in the country away from lights, except from the power plant, and the sky was clear. I spotted the object first and noticed that it was slowly rising in the sky. I pointed it out to my cousin because we both had telescopes growing up and I knew he would help confirm that this small, glowing dot was actually moving. We watched the object slowly rise about 2 inches from the point I first spotted it, and it also started to grow larger in diameter, and shone more brightly. The object then seemed to blink out and reappear a second later 3 hills over above the horizon. It was brighter and larger than it was when it was visible a second ago. The whole disappear and reappear took place in a blink of an eye. When it reappeared, it moved quickly up in the sky and vanished again. I have done hours of sky watching and seen many different types of &#39;shooting stars&#39; so I know what the look like. It was the disappearing of the object that really freaked us out. I have never seen a shooting star disappear, reappear, and move the opposite direction and disappear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

I then saw a fainter, less red light, about 3 or for fist lengths from the other two, forming a triangular shape with the other two. I thought i could almost make out the outline, but there was no moon, and the sky was incredibly dark. I watched it for about 2 minutes, until my vision got blurry from eyestrain, so i closed them for a few seconds, trying to rest them, and when i looked up again, the thing was gone.

It was far away because when i asked my friends, &#34;What ((deleted)) is that?&#34;, they automatically dismissed it as the north star. (however it was MUCH brighter then the north star) But when i show them that the north star was left of the object they started to get interested.  then they said that it was an inbound plane, but the object hasent moved in 10 minutes.  Now here is where it gets wierd...as we were start to focus all of our attention on the light, it casually started to moved to the right at a very slow speed.  The light didnt move to far until it started to shrink...while it was moving...and the light kept shrinking until it literally vanished...and thats it...nothing ever since, or anything more that night<n>

We were returning home to Oglala, South Dakota from Rapid City, South Dakota.  My female cousin was in the front with me and my male cousin was in the back seat. We were driving in a newer model Geo Metro, only about two years old or newer.  About a two or three miles before we got to the junction to start making our south on the tribal road that we were traveling on.  We were traveling through the Badlands on the north-west side of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota coming from the town of Red Shirt Table.  This road is part of the Ellsworth Airforce Bomber Training Run(B1-Bombers and Stealths?). We hear them but when you look they are already gone. They are fast and loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, about a few miles before we got to the junction, the radio on the car started to fade in and out, it was weird because the car was new and had was inn great mechanical condition. The needldes on the dash started going all over, like the gas gage looking when the tank was three-quarters full. The motor started to act weird to, like stuttering or startling. The car seemed like it was in the wrong gear and was lugging. I tried to put it in a lower gear and give it gas. But nothing happened. I looked at the radio and the clock read a few minutes before 17:00. Then, that went off too. It was scary, and I tried not to panick as my cousins&#39; were a year or two younger than we, I felt responsible for them as we were out in the middle of nowhere. I tried to stay as calm as I could. It got really bright inside the car. I could see the fibers of the carpet in the car. I could see the dust in the car moving in the air of the car. Things started to go in slow-motion then. Things started to move really slow in the car. I could hear myself breathing, and feel my pulse. We seemed to sort of float or leave the ground. I looked over at my female cousin in the passenger seat and she was screaming to me to go and she was hitting the dash. I looked back at my male cousin and he had his head between his knees&#39; and was screaming too. He was grabbing my shoulder and trying to shake me. It seems like we were playing on slow-motion, time was slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, finally, it seemed like a few seconds later the car slammed down on the road and started back up. It went back into gear, a lower gear and the motor revved up really high. The headlights came back on and so did the radio. I could hear my cousins&#39; now screaming and crying irradically for me to go. The were scared and so was I. It felt like we went over a big bump in the road, because we bounced really hard. I got control on the car and put it into third gear. We picked up speed really quick like we were going that fast already. I just happened to glance at the clock and the one on the radio said 20:30. The radio came on really loud, the light was still above us. I tried to slow down to see what was going on. My cousins&#39; were screaming for me not to stop. The were screaming at me to go fast. I looked up on my side of the window to see what was up there and it hovered above us and kept our speed. The light was so bright, I could see the weeds in the ditch plain as day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, just as quickly as it all begin the light went ahead of us about twenty feet and took off, really fast. It was gone. That was a whole hour and a half that was missing, as I kept telling my cousins&#39; to remember the time. They just kept crying and were not talking to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was scared and I have never spoken to anyone about this except to my cousins&#39; who get scared when I even mention what happened. I have been having dreams&#39; and weird nightmares&#39;. My female cousin refuses to tell me if she has the same thing going, and my male cousin will not listen to any talk at all about this. They get this look in their eyes&#39; and they actually stand differently body language-wise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have had people on the reservation talk about these lights&#39; and things that race those bombers&#39; and those other planes&#39; that fly out there. These jets&#39;, bombers, and etc. make their runs at all hours of the day and night. People have experienced things&#39; and seen things&#39; out there in the middle of nowhere. Alot of them refuse to talk about what they have experienced or seen, for fear or rejection or ridicule. I need to talk to this as it is a part of my PTSD(post-tramatic stress disorder) I need to tell somebody and get this out of my head. It feels like somebody is always&#39; watching me, I asked my cousins&#39; and they say the same thing too. That is one of the reasons&#39; that they are afraid to say anything. I&#39;m not afraid, whatever happened changed me and changed my physical body and how I handle diseases, sicknesses, and etc. My cousins&#39; are the same about this too. We feel watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks before this about ten miles out of Rapid City I had car trouble, and I saw a big triangle. It was shiny,like gun metal. I thought it was one thing, but another one split off of it and they were floating or hovering or something. They were headed north towards&#39; Rapid City. They came out of the Black Hills&#39; from the west heading towards&#39; were I was in a easterly direction before the turned north. The were quiet, really quiet. I never talked about this either until what had happened to me and my cousins&#39; in the Badlands&#39;. Again, I have never spoken to anyone except my cousins&#39; about all of this. Out of fear that I&#39;m being watched or listened to. I don&#39;t know maybe I&#39;m just paranoid about all this. But thanks for your time. With respect. Thank you reading this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It&#39;s hard to get my friends to beleive me but i know what saw, i beleived in u.f.o&#39;s but after seeing that, I beleive even more.  And behind me were some fields, this happened in the country.

We at first thought it to be a love flying jet but we followed it&#39;s movement and it was soon joined by approximately four other objects.  They were in formation with the first object we had spotted being in the lead. Actually, I believe that the first object dropped (descended) and then the other four obects fell in behind.  As I watched the objects disappear, the whole mountain over which they had flown or floated was completely bathed in a light that was glowing a reddish-orange color.  I ran to get a witness other than my now terrifed child and an elderly lady also witnessed the whole mountain lighting up.  I tried to rationalize by convincing myself that these were jets and one of then at least had crashed into the mountains.  No plane crash as far as I can find out was reported and also five jets would not have been flying over Lavendar Mountain as low as this.  I did find an article in the Rome News Tribune about a spacecraft, or flying saucer looking object that the Berry College students had designed and actually gotten to fly..There was a picture of the &#34;flying saucer&#34; in the paper.  Just one.  Not Five.  And Berry College is anAgricultural College.  This is the first time I have ever heard of themAlso I hav dealing with aerospace.  It just did not make much sense and the more I think about it the more I wonder if the story in the newspaper about the &#34;flight worthy&#34; aircraft erected by some college boys at an Agricultural College is not some sort of cover-up for something.Also my daughter and I have not come across anyone else except the two of us and the elderly lady whom I knew who experienced this sighting.  How can that be possible.  The whole mountain lit up in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was a solid object, no lights or portholes, was silent.  It staying in the area for 20 minutes and did every kind of maneuver----something I have never seen before.   It was able to go up and down, sideways and then stand still.  I got out of my car and watched it until it slowely went off into the distance and it was as if it was putting on a show for me---and I got the feeling that it was part of something else---maybe a probe or something that could see everything but that there was most probably noone inside as it was too small.  I always thought if I saw a flying saucer it would be LARGE but this was dissapointing in size.  I do not recall if it was shiney or it was dull but it was a grey metalic colour.   This is the only UFO I have ever seen and what I am reporting is the trueth.  What is so bad, is I had my video camera in my hand just before I left on the trip and set it back down thinking I would not need it!

To give an idea of its size, in order to block it out, you would need to hold a dime in front of your eye at arm&#39;s length. It was too difficult to judge the object&#39;s speed as there were few other reference points at that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a pair of binoculars in the car, and when I focused in on the object I could only faintly make out two silver-ish objects that appeared to be the profiles of fighter jets flying a short distance ahead of the object at its upper and lower left corners. However, because of the height and angle at which they appeared it was difficult to make them out clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reaching the store, we all stood on the parking lot for awhile looking up at it; several other people had also taken notice, before moving on. I remember hearing one mother explain to her son that the object was a stealth bomber. My dad was in the Air Force, I have my MS in Space Studies, and I am very familiar with most aircrafts including the stealth bomber. This most definitely was nothing of the sort, and I have never come across any other craft similar to what I saw that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of sighting is approximate.

I was looking at it when my sister asked me if I could see it. I said yes I could and it just hovered in the air, then it shot to the left, and back to the right. Then It shot to the east so fast we could not follow it with our eyes, but we could tell that it had gone off to the east. We were quite some distance away. the best discription was of a silver egg shaped object. We heard nothing of any reports in the news paper or on the radio etc. There was an haze that surrounded the object from the distance it sort of looked the way the road does when there is heat commming off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Driving  about 100 yards further I realized there was no ranger station in this area.Three very bright lights in form of a triangle started to rise slowly to altitude 150-200ft and started to move tworads my position-at this time both my vehicle and portabe radio died.The lights came directly over me slightly to my right hooverd 3-4 min then took off slowly at first seeming to move sideways then took  off at a rate of speed faster than any jet straight for the stars.<n>

It than made a curved 90 degree turn to the west, without losing any speed or gaining any speed. It then turned another curved 90 degrees to the north. Once again it did not lose or gain any speed. I have no approximation on the speed but it carried itself unlike a shooting star in the sense that it went much smoother than a shooting star, if you can understand (like there was 0 resistance to it).

We could not tell how close it was to us but the light was smaller from what I remember and not very far away.

I lived on the lake Allatoona,  I was on my pontoon boat with my sister talking, a normal conversation,  when she stop and said you would not belive what I saw.  She said she saw a blue looking object fall out of the sky,  fairlly close to where we were.  I thought nothing of it,  passing it off as a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night me and five of my other buddies went out on the boat,  it was a very windy night on the water which is very rare most of the time it is dead calm.  We were just talking when,  we noticed something fall out of the sky, in the decribed area my sister clamed the night before.  Again I was passing it off as nothing,  but I had a spot light on the boat,  and for fun sake I got it out and shined it in the area where the object fell.  I was ha ha UFO yeah right, continuing to shine the spot light into the sky.  Then I noticed a very bright light comming closer to our location.  This skared the people I was with so I stated the boat and went down the lake alittle ways,  This object stayed above us.  Then another object appeared and went ahead of the other object.  Through out a duration of two hours we saw four or five unknown craft morfing colors from bright yellows to red colors.  I was loving it I was thinking to myself you will never see anything like this ever again conteinuing to shine the spotlight.  Then there was a thought to be a boat heading straight at us.  I turned on my lights and this object headed back into a cove, across from us.  I wanted to get the attention of it to see if they had a phone so we could call someone to get a vedieo camera or just talk to someone because we were electicfied.   So we went closes to this boat and call out to them but no answer.  So we went closer and called out but still no answer.  I thought this is odd.  So we went ever close and called out are you seeing what we are seeing, long pause Then the most earrie voice said &#34;What did you say you saw&#34; then silence.  So we go closer and as we get to the point where we can start to see the boat our boat is engoulfed in this extermly bright light.  While this light was shining on us I was looking for a back wave from the boat, because it was windy and wavy and when a boat bounce up and down in the water it will give a back wave,  but this boat have no back wave,  This did it for me it really scared! me.  I stated out the boat and got out of there.   On the other side of the lake I tied up our boat and went to the dock where this object was it was move back forth right to left, and looking like it was comming towards us.  so we ran throught the wood back towards the house,  as we start to get to the house the front porch light went out,  I thought this is it we are about to be obducted.  I bangged so loud on the front door my nabor called and thought I was knoking on her door.  I told my dad the whole story, and he wanted to go back down to the lake one of the guyes we were with refused to go back down her was teriffied.  We went back down and it was as calm as glass.  Whatever it was was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Aprox 15 minutes later, 3 objects of the same intensity shot across the sky from E to W in a &#34;V&#34; formation right through the big dipper.  The 3 objects were initially traveling in an consistant pattern, then the objects &#34;arched&#34; around each other - almost making circles around each other, but still going straight W.  They were traveling much too fast to be commercial aircraft at a speed seemingly half that of a shooting star, but with movements much more sophistocated than a shooting star.  Both the events were witnessed by  two of us for several seconds before they disappeared - quickly fading out. Both observers were sober, and both observe the stars on  a regular basis.   We stayed outside for another hour hoping to see a recurrance, or another event.  We did see numerous shooting stars and satellites also that night.  One observer is a flight attendant for a private airline.<n>

I did e.mail Art Bell on our return to the US, he did not respond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I remember the events VIVIDELY and thou time has passed I feel I need to informe you.  I love the Art Bell shows when you are a guest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first wrote this to an &#34;expert&#34; on EARTHLIGHTS and included the &#34;moon size&#34; ball story also.  I feel that it is well described and hope that you don&#39;t feel slighted because I am sending it on to your organization. FEEL FREE TO PASS IT ON TO ANY OTHER experts.  The BIG SILVER BALL insident was at approximately 7 to 8 pm on June 14, 1998 or 1999 ( I remember that it was about 2 days after my birthday- but I can&#39;t remember the exact year ).  I wish this could help maybe you received another report of this nature about June 14 or 15.  Maybe you could forward this to Art Bell and Coast to Coast as well.  Thank You and keep looking up ( I THINK IF MORE PEOPLE KEPT THEIR EYES TO THE SKIES&lt; UFO SIGHTINGS WOULD BE EVEN MORE COMMON ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;Subject: earthlight sighting and seperate massive silver ball sighting (high altitude)  &gt;sighting #1 - Two beautiful silent orange lights &gt;Hi, I live in Kennewick, Wa ( where the Columbia and Snake River Join &gt;together).  This is also 30 miles from the Hanford Atomic Energy site that &gt;produced the Plutonium used in Japan.  The coolant water from the reactors &gt;passes directly below my home, one mile away (I mention the reactors only because I wonder if they are sometimes associated with sightings). As I was just getting &gt;home close to eleven pm on a dark evening, I stood by my parked car looking to &gt;the North in the direction of the Columbia River(one mile away).  Silently rising at &gt;approx. 30-40 mph and at an angle of 30 degree&#39;s (approx) headed up river &gt;East ( at right angles to me ) was a beautiful spot of ORANGE light.  It was &gt;a silent night and I COULD HEAR NOTHING - I was of course absolutely &gt;intrigued.  I continued to watch the light head east until it reached say a &gt;height of 4 or 5 telephone posts.  ( It&#39;s size ping-pong ball-softball or &gt;slightly bigger ).  I first saw it rise from directly in front of me to &gt;that height approximately 1/8 mile to my right or less.  At that point the &gt;light made a seemed like,sharp, 90 degree turn to the right and continued in a &gt;straight line in a Southern direction.  AT THIS TIME I WAS REALLY AMAZED AND THRILLED TO SEE ANOTHER silent ORANGE BALL OF LIGHT FOLLOW THE SAME IDENTICAL PATH AS IT&#39;S PREDICESSOR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I NEVER MOVED AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE PATH WAS IDENTICAL &gt;WITH THE 90 DEGREE TURN INCLUDED.    AFTER THE SECOND LIGHT HAD MADE IT&#39;S &gt;TURN IT FOLLOWED THE LEADING LIGHT BY 200-300 YARDS.  I continued to watch &gt;the lights go to my right ( as if following highway 395 to Umatilla,Oregon) the event took at least 5 minutes and the second light blinked out but &gt;the front light grew fainter as it continued South.  IN AFTERTHOUGHT I FELT &gt;SO BAD THAT I HADN&#39;T ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW IT .  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU &gt;FEEL THIS IS AN EARTHLIGHT SIGHTING OR UFO SIGHTING.  THIS EVENT WAS FROM &gt;TWO YEARS AGO AND I REMEMBER IT LIKE YESTERDAY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> sighting #2                                                From my yard I also saw, while watering my roses in the afternoon light, a perfectly round silver BALL it looked like a basketball up in the air high enough to be just the size of the moon in the sky.  I thought this thing may be close to me but as it moved to the east it passed in BACK of the WAVY little Cirrus Clouds that are close to 30,000 feet in altitude ( yes, I am bright enough that I thought of testing its hight with CLOUDS). Again no sound.  I DID NOT THINK IT WAS A WEATHER BALLOON/ EVEN IF ONE COULD SURVIVE BEING INFLATED TO THAT PERFECT ROUNDNESS. TO HAVE APPEARED &gt;THAT LARGE AT 35,000 feet it would have had to be huge. Bigger than a Boeing 747 because when watched from the ground a boeing 747 does not appear to be the size of the moon until it is much lower, say 5000 feet or less.  To approach that much pressure the high altitude weather balloons would be much closer to 25 miles above the earth anyway and would not even be visible). Again I could have followed the object but did not. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dates are approximate.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently stumbled upon your website and decided it time to report one of dozens of sightings in my life. I have witnessed dozens of flying objects as a keen sky observer and budding amateur astrologist.. but can&#39;t verify any of them as i always seem to be isolated and alone when it happens and many are most likely space junk causing &#34;shooting star&#34; like objects to fly across the night sky. I&#39;ve seen dozens of those now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I once reported to the Australian police a sighting of a perfectly round object hovering above my top floor apartment which appeared to be at least 5 miles wide.. this was ignored.. and I myself quickly wrote it off as just light refractions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My report here however is not of a UFO but of a being. I had walked out of my home late at night as i was studying.. it was approximately 1999.. so i cannot recall the exact date. The night was still and silent with no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside my back yard.. and spotted a white figure.. i estimate it to have been 4 feet tall.. and was all white with a subtle glow. I stood in frozen shock as we faced each other off for approximately 3 minutes. We stood only 5 meters apart so I could make out the shape but could not discern a face nor shoes.. it was completely white. In that time the object sat on top of my fence at the rear of my backyard which fell into parkland behind it, and made no effort to run away.. It did not move for the whole time, even as i approached- i got spooked when i was 5 meters away though and stopped purely because this figure did not seem worried by me approaching it.. we faced off for the next 3 long minutes.. and then eventually it slipped over the fence and disappeared. As it slipped away.. it did not make a single sound.. and nor did it make a sound as it left..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not move and as i stood frozen i simply stared at it, thinking it was a burgular. strangely though.. the figure simply disappeared after a few minutes. it did not make a single sound as it did. A burgular hopping off a fence would have made some noise.. and in the dead of night i would have at least heard leaves crunching underfoot.. but in this case there was not a single sound. it simply vanished. the fact it was all white left me to this day with the eery feeling that what i experienced that day was not a burgular but a potential visitor from another world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see any discernable features other than it was a human type shape.. i did not see arms or legs though.. roughly 4 feet tall.. it seemed to be shaped like a round blob sitting on my fence.. and then like a jelly blob.. it flopped over the fence and disappeared.. it did not make a single noise in doing so and i did not hear a single noise thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This story is not provable and more for your information than for public publishing.. the area where this happened could even be tested as the fence upon which the figure appeared has not been changed since..<n> <n><n> <n><n> it could have been a potential burgular that night.. but if it was, then it was one highly skilled dude.. because not only was it terribly out of shape and unatheltic looking (it was shaped like Jabba the hut from Star Wars fame) but it managed to completely disappear without making a single sound in the dead of night.. and it seemed to just roll off the back fence..which is 8 feet tall..  also.. if it was a burgular why would it be wearing only white clothing.. they usually wear black..<n> <n><n> <n><n> to this day.. the thought of that night sends a chill up my spine.. so i thought i would report it for documentation on your database.. this happened in a suburb called Ashbury in Sydney&#39;s inner city area ( the park is called Wagner Oval) .. a highly populated area but my home backs onto a large park which is where the figure disappeared into. it was also approximately 3am and no one else was on the streets at the time and the park was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my study is at the rear of my house overlooking my yard.. and my lights were always left on throughout the night as i studied for many years.. perhaps that attracted this figure.. a burgular again would have been deterred given that i was active till late all night.. this figure seemed to be sitting there just watching me.. until i noticed it, stared it off from a distance of only 5 meters.. it did not flinch nor seem worried either. it sat there the entire time before disappearing.<n>

I saw a white/grey sort of metalic color (but did not shine)large triangle object quickly floating across the sky from south to north.  It had no lights, but was clearly visible.  I don&#39;t believe it was more than half a mile from the ground. It made no sound and I don&#39;t think I was more than a quarter of mile from it.  I observed it for about 4-5 seconds until it was obscured by my neighbor&#39;s house.  I worked at and lived near Castle AFB,CA, (home of the B52&#39;s and KC135s) before it closed in 1995 so am familiar with large aircraft.  I don&#39;t know why and can&#39;t explain it but I got the feeling this object was observing this area.  We are just an agricultural area with mostly daries and orchards and do not have a large population.<n>

In the southern sky I saw what appeared to be a shooting star. I said &#34;look&#34; to my son. He looked and saw what I did. The star-like object then completely reversed course and went back the same way it came at an amazing speed. It then began to make manuevers that could not have been accomplished by any known craft which was man-made. It did circles and sudden starts and stops at sharp but regular angles. This was all done at a speed which was unbelievable. It then sped away a long distance until no longer visible. My son was frightened and went inside. I am now a believer. I tried to explain it to myself but I know what I saw. It was not a spotlight,plane,lightning bug,falling star etc. If the object was man-made then we have learned to defy all laws of physics and have secret aircraft. This object was real,was under control, but performed manuevers normally thought impossible.<n>

I thought I was seeing a satelite. It streaked across the sky like it was a satelite, then it &#34;turned off&#34;. The &#34;image&#34; was gone. Then it re-appeared just slightly south of its original position, made an arching 180 degree turn and vanished again. The object was in the west-south-west sky between two stars on a vertical plain. I can point out the stars if you&#39;d like, I don&#39;t know the names of the stars. There wasn&#39;t a tail. It didn&#39;t change colors, (by the way, it looked white from here.)it didn&#39;t hover and do all those things that TV shows. It came and left, that&#39;s it. (When I say it came, I should say that something was visible, it was fairly close as far as celestial things go.) The reason I was outside was to smoke a cigarette, bad habit. I just hope you take this seriously. I was going to call McChord but I think they would have had me locked-up. This is the second one I have seen, the first one being about 15 years ago, the other guy I was with thought it was weird and we left it at that. This was weird and I just wanted to let you know what I saw. Thank you for your time and considerartion.

I noticed an orange looking light that I assumed was also an incoming jet, but it did not move. As I watched this light I could see the jets were actually flying under this light. Then I noticed another orange light drop straight down from this statioary light. The second light to fall from this light had a trail behind it. I called my girlfriend to come outside and see this light show, before see was able to get outside a third light fell from the light. When my girlfriend did arrive we watched the light flicker off then on, then fade out and on, and finally it went completely out.<n>

Very fast moving lights. Changes in direction and velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 20:00 hours, Observer1 notices a bright object from his back porch that is almost directly overhead.  Observer1 is sure of the time because he could hear a popular television program starting inside.  He was facing towards the south and the object was aproximately 80 degrees above the horizon, almost directly above his position.  The object catches his attention because of its brightness and that it seems to be moving around.  The object is not confused with normal air traffic, which was present at that time, planets or a satellite because of its intensity.  Observer1 calls his friend out to witness the object.  Observer2, who was a sniper in the Army, easily sees the object and three other objects in near proximity to it.  Observer1 goes inside to get his binoculars: West German, Steiner, Commander Pilot S, 7X50mm with a built in compass. With binoculars, Observer1 is able to see the other 3 objects noticed by observer2.  Observer1 is not able to make out some substance and colors to main object.  Main object begins to move rapidly to the south after loitering around with 3 smaller lights.  Observer1 tracks main object to the south while observer2 follows 3 smaller or less intense lights.  Observer1 watches the main, brightest object disappear beyond the horizon at a heading of 136 degrees in a time span estimated to be 5-8 seconds.  Observer2 sees other 3 objects depart straight up or &#34;radially&#34; from the Earth.  Observer1 not able to reaquire the 3 smaller lights and observer2 is able to see the 3 smaller lights longer than observer1.  Note: terms &#34;smaller&#34; and &#34;larger&#34; deal with the intesity of the lights and not necessarily to their true size.  The terms were used by the observer1 to report the event to this investigator.  The altitude of the objects seemed much higher than surrounding aircraft traffic.<n>

It moved in a bounce, up and down to the left, then right, very quickly, very fast because it seemed to jump without movement.

At first I thought it was a plane or helicopter but noticed no same signature like blinking red lights that planes and helicopters use. So we watched it for a bit(not taking my eyes off the road for any long periods of time) and then it disappeared through a cloud bank. Then after we went over the Sepulvida Pass we saw it in the San Fernando Valley. Then again after a few minutes of observation the craft took off straight in the air (the weather was clear over the pass).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were returning home from dinner near Los Angeles International Airport and were driving on the San Diego Freeway ( the 405) when I noticed this strange light in the sky moving north my guess is near the Pacific Ocean.  It struck me as strange because planes and helicopters have a blinking red light and this object did not. So as we were driving north on the 405 we were watching the object disappear in a cloud bank(low clouds moved in as is usual June weather here) and then we just didn&#39;t think of it. We continued to drive and after we got over the Sepulvida Pass(a hill that seperates the San Fernando Valley from West Los Angeles) we saw the object again. (still continuing north in the San Fernando Valley) the as we went from the San Diego Freeway north to the Ventura Freeway east the object just took straight off in the sky. Needless to say my friend and I were pretty freaked seeing this and I wanted to report it to you as soon as I had a chance. My backround is I work as a data entry clerk.<n>

Two Weeks previous to my sighting I was listening to a local Talk show (The Allen Prell Show [WBAL AM 1090]) A Caller discribed a simular craft sighted around twilight, said to be standing still. The host listened, then quickly moved on with no comment (seeming to Poo Poo the caller). To go on with my discription the craft that I saw was huge. Very low, only one to two hundred feet (a normal plane going this slow would fall from the sky). The craft was SILENT, it made a U-turn in a jerky or phasing manner in little more then its own length. A normal craft would have to make a wide banking turn. The sighting did not last much longer due to the low hight it soon flew out sight. I looked around the parking lot to see if anyone had shared my sighting and found that I  was alone (very suprising due to the time of day and the normally busy area where this ocurred). I then entered a shop and told the clerk what happened, he quickly changed the subject (case closed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A revision was sent by witness:  &#34; I am sorry but an error was made in my report. The altitude should have been two to three hundred yards not, one to two hundred feet.&#34;))<n>

I looked up in sky, only to see a silver object sitting in a clear blue sky (it glinted in the sun).  My friend(the driver,who tends to be a skeptic) confirmed that she saw it too.  We lost sight of it as trees obscured our view, and we had to make a left hand turn.  This is a very busy highway, and there was no chance to pull over to try to take a picture. My friend recalls it as being crescent-shaped; my impression was of a slim rectangle.  I am retired; she is a high school science teacher; we are are both college graduates.  On returning from the movie, I scanned the same area of the sky (only travelling west now) to see if I could see it again (thinking it could have been an advertising balloon, but too far up for that really), but did not.<n>

It traveled an approximate distance of 150 miles in the sky at an elevation of around 20,000 feet. It crossed this expanse of sky in less than 1 second. From this point of A to B, it then did an 90 degree turn and traveled from east to west where it traveled in this dash pattern for approximately 50 miles in the sky in a split second where it simply vanished.<n>

It was a silent night with only the occasional sound of traffic coming from downtown roughly 2 miles away from our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching the stars we both noticed that theones to our left seemed to be dissapearing.  About a minute after we first noticed the object, it was almost directly overhead moving slowly in a North Eastern, to South Western direction.  It did not appear to emit any light, and no audible noise could be heard, although we did both feel almost like we were near speakers playing emiting a low, but constant frequency.  We could also feel that the springs surrounding the trampoline were vibrating.  It was impossible to measure the size of the object, because it was impossible to tell how far away it was, however by the way it blocked out the stars it was obviously a triangular shaped object.  It appeared to be extremely large maybe over a mile from point to point, bu! t could have been much smaller depending on how close it was. It passed at a steady pace from the moment we saw it until it was no longer in site.  I didn&#39;t think much of it until a few days later other people around the area were talking about something similar, but they had seen it during broad daylight.  According to one person who told me about it, things in his house were shaking as if there was a.  Small earthquake happening.  The other rumors were fairly consistent with what my friend and I had observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was facing north when a star-like object caught my attention to the west just above the treeline moving extremely fast west to east.  I said &#34;That plane is moving pretty fast!&#34;  I decided that it wasn&#39;t a plane because there weren&#39;t any other lights on it. I realized that it must be far away because there wasn&#39;t any sound of a plane. After about four seconds the object started turning sharply to the north-northeast.  It continued in that direction and the light dimmed before being blocked by trees. Entire sighting lasted seven to ten seconds.<n>

NM at 10:30 p.m.Thursday night, June 10th.  I was in passenger seat looking at millions of stars.  Noticed two intensely bright stars in the northern sky, about 20-25 degrees above the horizon, and asked my fiancee to pull over so I could look at them.  They were, at that time, parallel to the car.  Watched them for about a minute then got out the binoculars to see if we could see what they were.  All we saw were just intensely blue light with what seemed to be an aura around them, which could have been atmospheric interference.  They were still and looked just like really bright stars but they were just too bright and too big.  Very suddenly, the light on the left took off at an amazingly fast speed to the west, dipped down a bit, then up and just STOPPED in the sky again.  The object on the right just started to &#34;mosey&#34; through the sky toward the east.  We continued to drive west on I-40 trying to get to where it was, to put it parallel to the car again and see what the heck it was.  The road was straight, we were driving like crazy to catch up to &#34;it&#34; when another light just &#34;blinked&#34; on in the sky right in front of us.  (That was a real shocker!)  It started moving slowly in the direction of the light which had moved so quickly to the west, then just went away, perhaps behind a mountain.  We never could catch up to the westbound light.  We watched it for about 30 minutes or so, got to a little town and lost it. The light on the &#34;right&#34; had what seemed to be a blinking light of somekind...no noise but it must have been pretty high.  We had turned the car off and were in the middle of nowhere. The light which &#34;blinked&#34; on in front of us appeared to have a light, as well but I really don&#39;t think either of them was a plane or hellicopter.  I could be wrong.  But the light which darted off to the left was amazing!  We were driving at 75/80 mph for at least half an hour and never did get it parallel to the car again...not even close.  The sudden movement to the west was instantaneous...maybe two seconds to go, which must have been, better than 50 miles. My fiancee is 54, director of an arts organization.  I am 46 and a festival promoter, former restaurant owner.  My daughter is a 19 year old college student.  We were headed to a family reunion in Tahatchipi, CA.

It was the track and intensity of the streak that gave me the impression of an incoming ballistic missile. I actually looked for a place to take cover should there be an explosion.  However, to my relief, there was no follow-up sound or explosion.  Shortly thereafter I arrived home to tune-in to the start of the Art Bell show. Mr Davenport was being interviewed about strange lights over Las Vegas within the &#34;last hour&#34; or less.  I&#39;d say that my sighting was approximately coincident with the time frame expressed by Mr. Davenport in his report. The time coincidence motivated my original e-mail report. I have checked my maps while writing this report.  Las Vegas appears north east, and Phoenix slightly south of east of Redondo Beach.

I went back to again read my report on<n> <n><n> www.ufocenter.com and it describes &#34;An intensely white-phosporous colored streak heading down vertically from the overhead sky..&#34;  The event appeared SE from my observation point while Las Vegas is generally NE.  Thus the streak did not show vertical where the reported event occurred. OK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, for what it is worth, that white streak trailing that white ball in subject Dec. 19 photo reminds me of what I saw and reported upon that evening.  It might be that what I saw was thicker and traveling vertically.  However, the white trail is of Dec. 19 is what I meant by an &#34;intensely white-phosphorus colored streak&#34; seen against a background of a dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondly, another point now captures my detection. I consider it of second order but worthy of consideration.  In the Dec. 19 photo, the white streak and ball is approaching a &#34;target&#34; horizontally after a vertical decline.  In other words it does not descend vertically into its apparent target-the<n> <n><n> volcano. But this too is consistent with the observation and proximate time report out of Las Vegas. I saw the vertical streak SE from Redondo Beach while the action you were reporting upon was over Las Vegas which is NE from Redondo Beach (see my account in the report of 6/9).  So to me this suggests that vertical streak sightings and somewhat distant horizontally observed arial phenomena may still be causally connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other unrelated point.  In the past from time to time observers in your reports on the air refer to flying objects as being &#34;motionless&#34;. Remember now, that an earth bound observer &#34;observes&#34; from a rotating reference frame (the earth).  So if an object is witnessed as being motionless, it is to say<n> <n><n> that v=dR/dt = 0 relative to an observer on a rotating reference frame.  It is also to say, that the object has the same motion as the earth-bound observer, which is probably not zero in an absolute sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) (Redondo Beach, CA)  ((e-mail address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the witness for the excellent report, and for the useful follow-up data about this incident.

They moved very quickly in and out of formations such as a V like geese.  Shortly went out of view perhaps moving towards the Nevada Test site?  I observed them from Buffalo and Lone Mtn intersection.  About a minute later after arriving at home, they had disappeared, but a group of 4 Nellis fighters were flying in the direction the lights were seen.  Shortly after that, another group of 4 fighters headed in the same direction.  The flashing lights of the fighters were seen to eventually head first west from the AFB, but ended up more N above the Sheep Mtn Rng. These objects appear to be the same ones I heard Peter D on Art Bell&#39;s show tonight (6/9) describe by another person(s).<n>

I was in the house when my husband who had been sitting out in the yard stuck his head in the door and said to come outside to see some UFOs. I ran out to look  and over the city traveling northwest were several ( 3 to 4 that I could see ) red orange swirling lights in a vee formation moving slowly above the city. As I was panicking and trying to call 911 for other witnesses. My husband said that the lights were being followed by jets.<n>
6/9/99 20:50|Phoenix (north Scottsdale)|AZ|Light|1 hour +|Two bright amber lights seen over Phoenix|6/23/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07995.html|188|ndxe199906| Two bright amber lights seen over Phoenix<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:50 PM, I was looking south-south west from my front yard in North Scottsdale and saw what appeared at first to be distant commercial aircraft landing lights climbing out of Phoenix Sky Harbor. As I continued to watch I noticed that the lights did not move and they also were a distinctly different color than landing lights. I got my binoculars and the lights can only be described as a two separate very bright but deep amber in color with one light slightly lower than the other.  There appeared to be no connecting structure between the lights and no other lights associated with the object(s). I initially estimated the distance at about 10 miles (incorrectly). The sky was clear with many stars visible.  Visibility in the Phoenix area is nearly unlimited and lighted objects could easily be seen at night 100 miles on the low horizon. My wife, and daughter also watched the lights as they remained perfectly motionless. Suddenly, one light dimmed and turned off, then perhaps two seconds later the other turned off. Then a moment later both lights came on again in exactly the same location.  My daughter and I decided to get in the car and investigate at this point. We drove in the direction of the lights all the way into Phoenix, approximately 25 miles south while observing the objects on and off.  The separation between the lights widened as we got closer.  During the drive the lights turned on and off at least two times.  Finally, upon rounding the big bend going southbound at the top of the Squaw Peak highway the lights were clearly visible and obviously much closer. My best estimate of their physical location was approximately 3/4-1 mile west of the South mountain antenna farm, and at an altitude of perhaps 3-4000 feet above ground level. At this point the lights were approximately two and a half fingar widths apart at arms length and still at the same inclination angle but higher above the horizon. They appeared to be literally glued in place...no movement whatsoever. All of this was occuring in Phoenix Sky Harbor&#39;s very busy Class B controlled airspace!! Certainly the tower operators could have had a clear view of these objects to the southwest as they were only about 3 miles away.  At this time the objects were at an approximate 35 degree angle above the horizon. I am an aerospace engineer and private pilot. I roughly estimate the distance between the lights to be 500 feet gauging from the rate of change of spacing and elevation above ground over the distance. Upon reaching the turnoff to Sky Harbor airport the lights turned off and did not return. At home the lights were perhaps 5-10 degrees above the horizon. Our home north of Phoenix is actually 1000 feet higher in field elevation than central Phoenix, plus we had a clear an unobstructed view initially. The following morning I listened on the radio for any reports of the objects, but unbelievably there were no reports!  People see so much in the air that even if something is unusual it is simply shrugged off.  I would like to know if anyone else has seen these objects. They were visible for over an hour. I know these were not an aircraft lighting system, and they were too stationary to be an aircraft or airship.<n>

I looked up at the western sky while talking to my daughter and noticed three, bright white lights in a horizontal row flying slowly to the west which I assumed was an airplane.  Something seemed strange about the lights - they were too big and too bright for a plane - so I watched it while talking with my daughter about her turtle.  Suddenly three bright red lights in a row came from the left side of the object with the three white lights and flew quickly off to the south. The object or three bright red lights flew off at a speed faster than any airplane would fly.  When I first saw the one object &#34;split&#34; into two objects, I froze in disbelief. My 13 year old daughter asked me what was wrong and I told her what happened.  She saw the two objects as they flew away.  There were no flashing lights on either object.  The objects were a little larger than the diameter of a dime held at arm&#39;s length. Both objects flew low and along the flight paths as planes that are landing at DFW Airport and that&#39;s why I thought the first object WAS a plane...until it split into two objects (I estimate the objects would have been over Lake Lewisville at the time they seemed to &#34;split&#34; into two objects - about 6 miles away).  These were not two planes crossing paths as I was looking straight at the first object and there were no other planes or lights in the area when the red lights suddenly emerged from the left side of the first object.  I heard no sound but probably wouldn&#39;t hear any sound from that distance anyway.  Right after I lost sight of both objects due to the trees I saw a bright flash of light like a beam of light coming from the ground to the north west of the objects but I only saw it once.  I stood outside watching the area for another ten minutes but did not see any more flashes of light or anything unusual. Exactly two years ago on June 7, 1997 I saw a large, crescent moon-shaped UFO only a little to the north of what I saw tonight.  I have seen flashes of light come from the ground in that area before (mostly lake and open fields there) as well as a circle of light that appeared on the ground with no originating source above.  About two weeks after I saw the UFO on June 7th, my daughter and I saw something flash/explode about 1/2 mile due north of our back yard - it lit up the whole northern sky.  Within 5 minutes of the flash/explosion, a helicopter arrived from the west and circled the area with two bright beams of light alternately circling and landing for over an hour seeming to search the ground for something (video taped it). I have a master&#39;s degree in counseling/psychology, past president-director of two UFO organizations.  I am now an independent investigator/researcher of UFO and related phenomena.<n>

I sleep in the daytime and leave at night.  I was driving through Newburg, Shippensburg in PA on backroads surrounded by corn fields.  As I was driving I noticed something bright in the middle of the road and so I immediately slowed down. It was two big bright yellow eyes and at first I thought it was an animal. But then it was right in front of my car about a foot away.  The creature creature stood about 5 feet tall .  It was black and very skinny with extremely long arms and a very big head with bright yellow slanted eyes.  It stared right at me through the front winshield for about 5 seconds then turned to the the driver side window and stared at me for about 5 more seconds.It then turned and waved its arm as if it was signaling for me to leave.  I then started driving away and as I was leaving I heard a loud rush of air.  I wanted to go back and see more but I was terrified and didn&#39;t know what it was capable of.<n>

Soon it seemed to become narrower but very elongated.  A bright pulse of light seemed to travel its length occasionally.  It was observed for 1.5 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident I&#39;m about to tell you about took place last night (June 8, 1999) at approx. 10:45 PM until past 1:00 AM (June 9th).  I live in Manchester, NH and was in my backyard. 	Last night about 10:45 I was taking a dip in the pool before going to bed &amp; a bright light caught my eye.  When I looked up (towards the west, about 60 degrees) I saw a bright green rectangle of light behind the clouds.  I watched it for a few minutes then saw other bright green streaks light run parallel to it.  After about 4 minutes the rectangle lost its &#34;width&#34; but it was getting longer.  I ran in the house to get my wife, who came out shortly after..  BUT, my son  figured he&#39;d come outside and amuse Dad.  I really figured I&#39;d either imagined it or that there would be nothing there when they came out and they&#39;d chalk it up to senility in the old man.  As soon as we got outside all I heard was my son say &#34;Oh my God&#34;.  It was still there!!!  We watched it together for over an hour!  It&#39;s green light definitely &#34;pulsed&#34; &amp; seemed to do a few &#34;chase&#34; patterns.  We saw some white flashes of light come out from the side of it.  Yes, we did call channel nine, the local TV station.  They said they&#39;d love to have a look but probably couldn&#39;t get anybody to where we were.  I told them to just step out of the station and look up!  Her reply was that &#34;we&#39;re pretty busy here tonight&#34;. 	This was like every sci-fi alien invasion movie ever made.  Two guys see it, no one believes it or checks it out.  I got out the video camera but I couldn&#39;t find it or focus on it thru the view finder. 	At times the light would seem long and narrow, sometimes whole, sometimes with a &#34;dark&#34; or unlit section in the middle.  Other times it seemed wider and the light more concentrated in a rectangular shape.  But it never regained the severe rectangular shape I first saw.  Another very strange thing was that it would suddenly &#34;turn off&#34;, then on again.  It was partly to mostly cloudy during this time, but it&#39;s light was definitely visible through the clouds. Just before I finally went to bed I checked out the window &amp; it was still there, but had gone from green to blue. 	  Anyway, I was just really grateful that my son &amp; wife were there to see it too.  I&#39;m trying to checkout NASA and the Nat. Weather Serv. to see if they reported anything.  There&#39;s no way we were the only ones to see this thing.  If it was a hoax of some kind, it was a good one.  I&#39;ve seen the Borealis before &amp; this definitely was not it.  It was west-south-west, about 60 to 70 degrees off the horizon.  I did check for comets and found that the Comet Lee may have been visible (if I read this info correctly).  Anyway, I know it may sound like I&#39;m losing it...but I know we saw something, I just don&#39;t know what.  Any help you could give me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for taking the time .<n>

OFF IN THE DISTANCE, I SAW BLUE AND YELLOW FLASHING LIGHTS IN THE NORTH BOUND LANE. I FIGURED THIS TO BE AN ACCIDENT AT FIRST WITH THE FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL ON SCENE AND A WRECKER. (THE FHP HAS ONLY BLUE ON THIER LIGHT BARS, WHERE THE LOCAL POLICE HAS RED WHITE AND BLUE. THE WRECKERS USE A YELLOW LIGHT.) I THEN NOTICED THAT THEY WERE TRAVELING NORTHBOUND, WITH A HIGHWAY PATROL CAR IN FRONT AND BEHIND A SEMI TRACTOR PULLING AN EXTENDED FLATBED. THE SEMI TRACTOR HAD A YELLOW FLASHER ON TOP of it. THE VEHICLES WERE TRAVELING AT A RATE OF SPEED, THAT I GUESSED AT 75 TO 80 MPH. I THEN PASSED THE VEHICLES IN THE AREA OF BLANDING BLVD, WHICH IS AN AREA THAT IS WELL LIGHTED. THE SEMI WAS PULLING AN EXTENDED LOW BOY TYPE FLAT BED TRAILER WITH AN UNKNOWN CRAFT ON THE BACK OF IT. THE FRONT HALF OF IT WAS COVERED WITH A TARP THAT WAS LOOSLEY TIED AND WAS FLAPING LOUDLY AT THE TRAILING ENDS. FROM THE SHAPE OF THE TARP, THE FRONT APPEARED ARCHED LIKE A BOW ON BOTH ITS HOROZONTAL AND VERTICAL AXIS. IT THEN NARROWED ON ALL SIDES TO A FLATTEND ROUND MIDDLE AND THEN FLARED TO TWIN CIRCULAR RINGS(SIDE BY SIDE) THAT WERE APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET TALL BY 3 FEET LONG. THE OVERALL LENGTH IS PROBLY 65 FEET, AND IT WAS TAN IN COLOR. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO BE RESTING AT A 10 DEGREE ANGLE TO ONE SIDE. THE NEXT DAY AT WORK I DESCRIBED WHAT I SAW TO A CO-WORKER THAT HAD RECENTLY GOTTEN OUT OF THE ARMY AS A LIEUTENNANT. HE STATED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN SEEN ANYTHING SUCH AS I HAD DESCRIBED, MILITARY OR OTHER. I AM A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER FOR A METROPOLITAN CITY HERE IN NORTH FLORIDA. I HAVE WORKED DIFFERENT SHIFTS FOR YEARS AND HAVE SEEN ALOT OF THINGS, BUT I HAVE NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS. BUT I HAVE COME UP WITH A FEW QUESTIONS 1. WHY AT NIGHT, WAS THIS OVERSIZE OBJECT BEING TRANSPORTED? 2. WHY USE THE F.H.P.? WHO ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO PROVIDE COMMERCIAL ESCORT. 3. WHY USE A LOOSLY COVERED TARP? STATUES PROVIDE THAT OBJECTS THAT NEED TO BE COVERED MUST BE SECURE. NORMALLY IF YOU SEE SOMTHING BEING HAULED WITH A TARP ON IT. THE TARP IS FASTENED DOWN SO AS NOT FLAP IN THE BREEZE. AND THIS TARP LOOKED OLD AND STAINED. 4. WHY COVER JUST THE FRONT OF IT? MY THOUGHTS I FELT THAT THIS WAS A CRAFT OF SORTS TO PROVIDE TRANSPORT. I FELT THAT THIS CRAFT WAS BEING HAULED AT NIGHT TO CONCEAL WHAT IT WAS. AND THAT THE TARP THROWN OVER THE FRONT OF IT WAS AN AFTER THOUGHT. THE TWIN RINGS APPEARED TO BE SOME TYPE OF PORT, AND APPEARED TO BE ON THE REAR END OF THE CRAFT. I DID NOT SEE ANY BLACKENING AROUND THESE REAR PORTS. AT THIS POINT IM CONSIDERING THIS OBJECT UNIDENTIFIED AND THIS IS WHY IM SENDING YOU THIS INFORMATION. I WISH TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS.<n>

She noticed a bright, star-like object moving from the south of us, below the Big Dipper.  It appeared the size of a large planet, and was bright white. It was about at a 60 degree elevation, and moving very quickly across the sky above us, moving at toward the NE from the SW direction.  It maintained a straight path to about midhorizon, when it appeared to zip and zag, to our utter amazement. By this time, a couple of minutes, it had moved across nearly 60% of the visible sky (which was crystal clear).  We then saw it slow down, and begin a 90 degree turn, taking it toward the NE (toward Durango direction).  As it went into that direction, it appeared to brighten and dim slowly, at one point flashing beams from it.  Then as it neared about 30 degrees from our point of view, it disappeared.  In size it would be taken as a planet or star.  It appeared to be very high.  It left no tail or trace of its path.<n>

It was the most intense thing that has happened to me because I have never seen a UFO in person ya know so now that I have seen them I&#39;ll make sure to report them!!<n>

It then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving along Highway 64/412 about 5 miles east of Spranger, CO.  It was pitch black, and I suddenly noticed a white streak of light off to the right at about 60 degrees above the horizon.  I looked like a very bright meteor tail, and I expected it to burn up in the sky as others I have seen do.  What was unusual about it was that it was a very bright white streak, and somewhat broader than others I have seen.  I watched it as it did not burn up, but instead suddently displayed a bright, almost luminous green ball at the exteme end of it.  This was quite amazing.  It then suddenly disappeared.  It lasted only several seconds, I&#39;d say about 20 seconds or so, going slower than you&#39;d expect from a meteor.<n>

It was a straight dowm drop from the larger object. The second object we saw was Northwest from where we were standing in our back yard in Pleasanton CA. This 2nd object was red-yellow and also very bright in appearance, It appeared to fire sometype of projectile to the South, the projectile was quick and as it shot-out from the object it was fast then slowed and disappeared. Were there any rockets or NASA type crafts in our area last night?? also both objects stayed in the same area for a good 45 mins---till we gave up and went to bed.. Would appreciate a response...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are a married couple in Pleasanton CA. My husband has worked at a local Car Manufacture Co, for 27 years. We had not been drinking and were completely sober. We were the only 2 witnesses, as far as we know.I&#39;m sure there is a good explianation for these weird &#34;objects&#34;!<n>

As I was moseying northward on I-95, I looked to my left and saw a cigar-shaped object of what seemed to be a whitish tint.  The object was bright, but not too bright to look at directly (perhaps a bit brighter than a full moon).  The object seemed to be hovering, although it may have been moving slightly from north to south (since I was moving south to north, I can&#39;t be sure if this was simply motion relative to my own).  Soon, the object was obscured by the trees and I did not see it again; I may have witnessed it for close to two minutes but am not sure.<n>

It was at night, in a little patch of woods known as Brown Woods Trail. My boyfriend and myself were in the woods, no flashlights, just darkness, when we came to a clearing. Coming over the treetops and moving towards us was a bright light. We thought it must be a helicopter as we are less than a mile from the airport. The light just hovered there, making no noise what so ever. As soon as I pointed at it and mentioned it being there, the light seemed to close into itself until it was just a pinpoint of light and then took off straight up at an incredible speed. I don&#39;t believe we have the kind of technology it would require to travel at such speeds.  Two months previously, in the same general area I experienced the exact same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up and saw a black triangle hovering about 40 ft off the gound. At fist I didn&#39;t see any lights, but then about three seconds later, I saw three white lights go on. Then two seconds later I saw three red lights go on, and then it started looking blurry, and took off faster then anything I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

(There was a fellow there witnessing it with me at the time).  It was far away, so the best description is that it did have what seemed to be saucer shaped lighting around the bottom of the craft. As one light to my left would come on, one on the right would go off.  They were white light.  I&#39;ve no idea how something stationary could instantly propel away with such a great speed.  From where we were, there was no contrail.  I was too far away to hear or not hear any noise.  There is high probability this craft was near Beale Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best part of this story is what happened three days later. I saw another set of lights in the sky, moving slow over the city.  This was however very very different then what I had seen before, so I decided to try to get under it.  I entered the freeway and headed in the direction of the plane until I was able to get underneath it while exiting on 34th street.  I slowed and stuck my head out to look up.  It was a crop duster with white lights in rows along the entire surface area of the bottom of the wings.  I feel this was to cover up the sighting three days earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in Sacramento, Ca, in summer of 1999.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

6/6/99 19:00|Hollywood|CA|Circle|20 minutes|I witnessed what I believed to be three stars at first.  Then they began to glide across the sky.|6/23/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08000.html|210|ndxe199906| I witnessed what I believed to be three stars at first.  Then they began to glide across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was attending a church concert and service on Sunday, June 6, 1999 with a couple of my girlfriends.  Around approximately 7pm, I just happened to look up in the sky for no apparent reason.  I saw what I believed to be a star in the eastern sky.  I then saw another and, then, one more.  I thought maybe I was seeing part of the Big Dipper or some other constellation.  I, then, remember thinking it was awful light out for me to be able to see stars. The weather was calm, very little wind.  It had been very warm that day and as the sun set, it got cooler.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  I was sitting facing the east.  I felt the sun setting on my back.  I was at the John Ansen Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood, CA.  It sits off the 101 freeway up in the hills.  A large cross marks a hill nearby.  A large hill or small mountain scales up behind the stage. I looked up and saw the objects above the mountain.  The first one began to move towards us (WNW) and, then the second and third followed close behind.  I turned to my girlfriend and told her to look at them.  She thought they were balloons.  But then, the first one began to hover.  The second and third kept moving.  I could no longer see the third as I believe one of the lighting structures for the stage was blocking my view.  I told her there was no way they could be balloons because how could one just stay still and the other keep moving.  Then, the first one, which was stationary, started back in the opposite direction.  It was moving a little more swiflty than before but never very fast.  It was moving ESE. Then, the second kept moving WNW and the third came back into my line of vision.  It was following close behind.  The second one kept going until I couldn&#39;t see it for the structure of the building and the hills that surrounded.  The third one, then hovered in the same place that the first one had.  I, then, proceeded to show my other girlfriend who thought they were birds or stars.  I told her that birds don&#39;t go that high plus they don&#39;t hover in one place and that stars don&#39;t move.  She no longer paid attention to them as she was more interested in the concert.  She told me to stop looking at them but I didn&#39;t. Then, all of a sudden, the first one came back moving as swiftly as it did when it left.  It came back from the same direction it had disappeared to.  Once again, it was travelling WNW.  It passed by the third one (which was still hovering) very closely.  Then, the second one came back into view and they all started back in the ESE direction.  I, then, began to return more of my attention to the concert and every so often I would look up to see if they were still there.  Eventually, I looked up and I could no longer see them.  I don&#39;t know where they went after that point. The whole event lasted for approximately 20 minutes.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.  I probably wouldn&#39;t have believed it if my friends would not have seen them also.  They looked just like moving stars.  They were graceful and smooth, almost entrancing.  I am just a 24 year old secretary.  I have never been interested in UFO&#39;s as a study.  Yet, I have always believed.  Now, I know.  I saw them with my own two eyes.  I know.<n>

I was to frightened to speak. They didn&#39;t speak. I didn&#39;t talk about it at all until now. The spacecraft changed to any shape it wanted to. It was about 30 feet long by 30 feet. and about 10 feet tall. First it was a saucer. Then it was a spacecraft like a ship from startrek.<n>

WHILE SETTING UP LIGHTS NEAR THE FEMALES RESTROOMS I AND OTHERS NOTICED A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT OVER US.  I HAD ALREADY SEEN THE SAME LIGHT BEFORE ON THE 5TH AND MANNAGED TO GET BOTH EVENTS ON MY HI-8MM CAMCORDER. MYSELF TWO VOLUNTEERS AND ABOUT 5 FEMALE CHILDREN WITNESSED THE EVENT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HELLO MY NAME IS JOE ROGERIO.  I USED TO WORK FOR THE SOUTH TEXAS COUNCIL ON ALCHOL AND DRUG ABUSE (STCADA) AND DURING A LEADERSHIP CAMP WITH ABOUT 85 STUDENTS IN CAMP CORPUS CHRISTI NEAR MEDINA TEXAS I AND OTHERS WITNESSED STRANGE OBJECTS IN THE SKY AND OTHER REPORTS BY CHILDREN THAT NIGHT. IT ALL STARTED ON THE 4TH OF JUN 99 WHEN MYSELF AND OTHER CO-WORKERS WERE GOING TO CAMP CORPUS CHISTI TO SET UP THINGS FOR THE CAMP. I HAD GOTTON THERE EARLIER THAN THE OTHERS AT AROUND 1:30PM FROM KERVILLE,TX. THE CAMP WAS BEAUTIFUL AND WAS AWAY FROM ANY BIG CITIES. LATER THAT EVENTING AT AROUND 11:20 WHILE WALKING TO THE MALE RESTROOMS OUTSIDE I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT OVER ME. I THOUGHT IT WAS VENUS BUT IT WAS TOO LATE FOR THAT. THE LIGHT BEGAN TO MOVE VERY SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST. I THEN RAN TO MY TRUCK TO GET MY VIDEO CAMERA AND THEN MANAGED TO FILM IT FOR ABOUT 25MIN. UNTIL MY CO-WORKERS SHOWED UP FROM LAREDO WITH ALL THE SUPPLIES. I THEN HAD TO MEET THEM BECAUSE I WAS THEN ON WORK TIME. THE NEXT NIGHT WAS CLOUDY AND NO LIGHTS WERE SEEN. THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WAS THE BEST. AFTER MY BOSS TOLD ME SO SET UP SOME SPOT LIGHTS BEHIND THE GIRLS CABINS I NOTICED THE SAME LIGHT IN THE AIR. I THEN SAW TWO KITCHEN COOK VOLUNTEERS AND CALLED THEM OVER. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A STAR BUT A INSISTED IT WAS NOT AND THAT IT WAS A UFO. THE OBJECT THEN STARTED TO MOVE VERY SLOWLY TO THE WEST AND THATS WHEN THE COOKS UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS SEEING. THEN SOME YOUNG GIRLS WERE COURIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE WERE SEEING. THEY MANANGED TO SEE THE OBJECT LIGHT INTENSIFY AND DIM. WE THEN TOLD THE OBJECT IN OUR MINDS TO DO SOME MANOUVERS. IT MOVED TO THE RIGHT AND THEN LEFT. DURING ALL THIS TIME I CAPTURED ALL THE EVENT ON TAPE. LATER THAT NIGHT MY BOSS AND I SAW A BLINKING LIGHT STEAK ACROSS THE SKY AT AN UNBELIEVABLE SPEED. IT CROSSED THE WHOLE SKY IN LESS THAN 3 SEC WHILE WE SAW THE STROBE LIGHT UP. THE ORIGINAL LIGHT THAT WE SAW WAS STILL IN THE SKY IN A DISTANCE AND WAS NOT MOVING. MY BOSS SAID IT WAS JUST A STAR. BUT MINUTES LATER IT HAD MOVED DIRECTION AND MY BOSS WAS FREAKING OUT. IN THE MORNING I NOTICED THAT SOME OF MY FEMALE CO-WORKERS SAID THAT THEY HEARD THIS LOUD CRASH AT NIGHT AND A LITTLE BOY SAID HE SAW SOMEONE CARRYING A DEER. I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THERE ARE UFO&#39;S OUT THERE. AND ALSO THINK THEY ARE AROUND THAT AREA. IF YOU WOULD LIKE A COPY OF THE VIDEO PLS GET IN TOUCH WITH ME. THANKS ((name deleted))<n>

Between the trees to the northwest of me I saw what appeared to be a shiny silver, egg shaped craft. It appeared to be hovering directly over Branmar shopping center, probably 200 or 300 feet in the air. Each time there was a clearing the trees I could see the object. The trees only covered the object for a few seconds at a time. After about 5 minutes my view was again blocked by the trees. Once I reached a clearing, again after only several seconds of obscured vision, the object was gone with no trace of which direction it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two weeks later, again while driving, on southbound I-95 just before the exit for route 273 into Newark, Delaware I saw an object that appeared identical. It, again, appeared to simply be hovering over the area near Bear, Delaware. I had an unobscured view this time. I watched very intently as I drove (dangerous? maybe a little). After watching it for a minute or two it the object seemed to disappear into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw A point of light ( Bigger than the star&#39;s and much brighter.)going at a high rate of speed, from the South to the North. ( Out the driver&#39;s side window, which was down.) It looked like a shooting star Except there was no tail to it at all, then about 15-20 min&#39;s later, I saw the exact same thing, also going from South to North.  The reason that I am letting you know about this is because this same thing happend about 4 month&#39;s ago, Except it was colder outside and I had the window&#39;s up, and I thought that maybe it was a reflection off the glass from some other source (passing car, ect.) But this time with the window down, that was not the case. I should mention that the first event also had two object&#39;s about 15-20 min&#39;s apart. I do&#39;nt know if this is anything at all, but I thought I would tell you about it.             Thank you for your time.<n>

The evening went great and I had a wonderful time, and yes during the show I was one of the &amp; subjects who was hypnotized. Trouble is just before my wedding date, I believe it was the Thursday, I started having dreams of a very different nature.  I dreamt that I was awakened (as if I were right there in my body at that very moment  not like myself standing by my bed watching me wake up, rather I was in my body within my dream.) and there were two short people with huge eyes and what I found funny about that was that they did not have any eye lids or eyebrows.  It was hard to tell what they really looked like because it was dark in the room.  I cannot say that they forced me as much as I volunteered to follow them.  They spoke oddly without opening their mouths and before I could talk they would answer me.  I don&#39;t remember much after that until the time that I was sitting on a very low chair, the kind you would find in a kindergarten classroom.  Then I remember talking to them for a while and them telling me stuff about where they come from and then I don&#39;t know how the conversation started, but the next thing I know is that whatever the hell it was I was seated in became transparent on the upper half and I could see earth below me.  Then we swerved extremely fast, just like you do when you go around the corner on a roller coaster, except that I did not feel much of the turn.  Just then (I know it sound stupid) I felt like I was turning into water except without the water.  It or I was like what you feel when you get a mild electrical shock, except that it did not hurt and it felt warm.  The thing was it wasn&#39;t just me turning watery or melting which I think is more of an accurate description.  Everything melted too  the sun, stars, earth, and the next thing I remember is that I was hovering over some planet with domes on it.  I remember asking if we were going to go down there, but they said no, and then I remember nothing. I was not forcibly confined unlike the stories you hear, and at all times I remember the feeling of free will.  Yes I know what I am saying sounds crazy, but I cannot forgo the sounds, smells, touch, of every part of my senses.  Since last year I have read that you can remember more under hypnosis, and I am willing to go a truth test and be hypnotized again.  If I did experience this, I am sure my dreams of this are somewhat fantasized of what actually happened to me, if anything at all.  But then I have been drawing stuff like triangles within triangles.  I asked my friends if at any point the hypnotist even suggested to myself or anyone that we were on a UFO, but all of them said that that never happened, also I remember everything from the comedy club.  My guess is that the best scanerio is that we can actually find out where they live, and the worst case is that I am pronounced as a stupid fellow with nothing better to do with his time but to dream the fantastic and scream wolf!  If you wish to call me I can provide you with references upon references to who I am, and if you actually believe me (I don&#39;t believe it myself) call me.  My home number is ((number deleted)) and you have my email address above.  Either way I thank you for taking the time in reading this.<n>

Seveal minutes later as we began disguessing what we saw, an enormous helicopter flew over my house with its search lights on, it flashed my house with it and continues on towards the direction in which we saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> **see summary for description** the only other thing i can add is that the light was the size of a star, it was white/orange colored and moved in the straight fashion of a controlled craft would do.<n>

I did not see a contrail of streaking away, or any other thing that looked like it could be a plane!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling south on I-10, aprox. 35 miles south of Phoenix, on 6/4/99, i saw a very intense, bright object in the eastern sky. The light was very bright, and seemed to be somewhat oval in shape. It seemed to have a metalic finish, almost a chrome!! it seemed to have a roundness about it. i watched it as i was driving, out my driverside window. the sky was clear. no clouds, on this sunny morning.In relationship to the ground...the sun was higher in the sky. Size...(see image I sent via e-mail)As I watched it for about 15-20 seconds, turned away to see where i was on the road, turned back to view the bright light, and it had vanished! i did not see any other airplanes, contrails,landing gear, wings, or anything that looked like an airplane. Upon returning to Phoenix after my business in Tucson, I called the FAA and they refered me to Peter Davenport....hence...this report! FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME IF YOU NEED MORE INFO!!!!

Suddenly, a small bright object appeared near the upper left corner of the screen, moving to the right towards the &#34;3 o&#39;clock&#34; position of the screen.  Just as the first object exited the view another object appeared from the lower left corner of the screen.  It shot up towards the upper right (7 o&#39;clock to 1 o&#39;clock).  Both objects were between the shuttle and the clooud tops but much closer to the earth than the shuttle.<n>

I was also lucky enough to have taped the STS80 shoot out live. I went to a brief by Richard C. Hoagland re STS80. What I saw looked exactly the same as the STS80 film! This event took place on orbit 124, MET 07,21,00,14  GMT of 155,07,50. (time hacks via nasa disp) This is the closest time hack poss. The event takes place during the 10 min or so b-4. Shuttle STS96 passes Fl starts going out to sea. About 100 to 200 miles out to sea two objects appear on the low light cameras. they move then goto hover, then a third moves in and hovers with them.I believe these to be large. The camera zoom/ dist to target seems to be the same as STS80 they appeared to be the same size and brightness. a min or two later hand fulls of smaller less bright objects move in from all directions. There is a lightning storm going on and several of the small ones seem to dart in and out of the lightning! Some of the smaller objects appear to move really close to the larger  craft. the small ones are moving very fast . In and out of the picture in no more that 2 pause frames on vcr. I have this event on tape and will be willing to send you a copy if you wish. too many things going on at the same time to type here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  Tape was received.  It was viewed by approximately 45 people at the monthly meeting for June, and everyone seemed to find the objects to be quite interesting.  NUFORC will apply some analysis and attempt to establish what the objects might be, or cannot be.))<n>

We could see that it was following the river because of the direction that it was moving in. It was black and had white lights, with a red outline around the whole ship. It was very quite and graceful. We watched it has it moved up stream from us, I would say it got with in 100 yards of us. At it&#39;s closest point! We then observed the ship come to a complete stop and then suddenly take off straight out in to space.  I mean straight up! We never saw it again. It was just gone that fast. We have seen a lot of things in Idaho, I think this state is very high in it&#39;s sightings.<n>

We observed three commercial jetliners in the same field of vision while we were observing these lights. There is no possible way for them to have missed them. Concurrently we observed almost from the start of our paying attention several lights on the MTN itself that were in places were no vehicles can travel. From the distance we were observing there was in our opinion no way for the lights to be hikers (brightness, weather conditions in the area-high winds, cold temps) As stated three of the moving stars dissapeared on the MTN. two of the moving lights crossed in parallel fashion while a commercial jetliner was headed north. Of the three commercial jets two went N&gt;S, one went E&gt;W OF the five fast moving lights three went ESE&gt;E and disappeared on the MTN The other two went north and south respectively. We were in near complete darkness (very little ambeint light.)((name deleted)), my brother was the one who called in, I am visiting on vacation. I live in Seattle, I listen to Art Bell, I am very skeptical, but the facts remain: we saw exactly this. It is entirely true.

What I discerned shape-wise was extremely wide and triangular and flying northeast to southwest. Squinting my eyes, however, I could not make out a fuselage. This craft was definitely all wing. (Note: I was wearing my prescription glasses, and with them on my vision is corrected to 20/15 &amp;#8212;  better than perfect.) The color was either white or gray. For just a few seconds the craft banked (corrected course?) to its left (easterly) and the brightness of the setting sun brightly illuminated its belly during that time. I ran in the house and managed to find my binoculars. I went to the front porch to observe the craft more; however, the it was so high and far away by this time that the magnification provided by the binoculars was inconsequential. I then went to my upstairs window, which looks south, and watched until I lost sight of the craft as it headed generally toward Pike&#39;s Peak/Colorado Springs (approximately 100 miles away). * At no time were anti-collision lights observed * Craft was perhaps 30,000 - 40,000 feet high * Two contrails tailed behind * Estimate the craft to be as wide or wider than the wingspan of a Boeing 747 * Though unusual, I feel the craft was definitely earthly in origin owing to the conventional way in which it flew * Craft was probably military, but type and purpose clearly unknown by me * Environmental (neighborhood) noise prevented me from hearing the craft I hereby affirm that the above commentary accurately portrays my observations of unidentified craft sighted June 3, 1999 in Thornton, Colorado.

Opaque or pale white in color. Size 10ft by 5ft. Gliding through the air above the Olive View Medical Center, upward and to the south. I observed this initially from my bathroom and then my bedroom. There was no exhaust trail or flashing lights. My thought was that it looked like a hang glider,but the nearest hang glider port in Sylmar is in the hills off of Hubbard St, which is  3 or 4 miles away and I have never observed anyone hang gliding in the night or early morning. There was no noise either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in early June 1999 is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was eye-level but the funny thing was it looked like it was just floating there or suspended .  I looked again and it was gone.  It was metallic in color-silvery and was not real high up which surprised me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been to town which  is 7 miles from my house.  The time was approximately !:30 in the afternoon.  I have a habit of watching the clouds and sky ( even when driving) I look up and am a very observant person.  Something caught my eye on my left and when I shifted my eyes to the left to see what it was i saw a metallic object-shiny - it looked like a sphere with a circular  something around the outside. The top was definitely a dome shape.  I pulled over and tried to find it again but it was gone.  The thing about it that was strange was the fact that when I first looked at it from the window of my car- it was at eye level and it seemed to be effortlessly kind of floating  along it was going in the direction of  almost direct East.  I was on Highway 50 West going West.  I also thought it strange that it was so low in altitude. There was no exhaust or anything but it was just kind of gliding along effortlessly. The size of the object was about the size of my fist at arms length. I do not know how to measure altitude but I am 4 11 and sitting in a small make car (1991 Subaru Justy) and it was eye level.<n>

During the STS96 mission, this routine was followed, and I accumulated 8 6hr. vhs tapes of mission events. These 8 tapes covered the time period of about 23:00 to about 05:00 on the nights from May 30 to June 5, 1999.  On the night of June 2/3, 1999, the usual procedure was followed for my part.  At bed time, I inserted a blank tape into my vcr, and let it run over night.  On June 8, 1999 I happened to be reviewing this particular tape.  At about 4Hrs. 40 mins into this tape, one of Endeavor&#39;s payload bay cams was trained on one of Zarya&#39;s solar panels, when suddenly a bright pulsating object buzzed the space complex.  I am in possesion of this tape and would be happy to show it to someone who could make use of it.  Owing to the fact that this sort of evidence often disappears when it falls into the hands of government people, I will not part with it, however.<n>

The object was west of me.  It caught my eye as it passed very quickly from cloud to sky.  It didn&#39;t make any sound as far as I could tell, given that I can hear every other aircraft that passes anywhere near, since we&#39;re pretty much under the Sea-Tac and Olympia airport approach flight paths.  No lights were visible from my angle, anyway.  It&#39;s a wonder I noticed it at all given its speed and the dimness of the light.  The speed is what really stood out, and probably what made me notice it.  It was either very small and flying very, very low, or much larger and flying very, very fast.  I think the latter is more probable since I saw it over housetops and trees and it appeared to be some distance away.<n>
6/2/99 21:10|Daytona Beach|FL|Triangle|Several Mintutes|Four black triangles see close up.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43036.html|234|ndxe199906| Four black triangles see close up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around June that I began going to DBCC (Daytona Beach Community College). I didn&#39;t have a car yet, so my mother would pick me up from night school around 9:00 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night, we were chatting as we took the back route home from my school. We were driving down Williamson Blvd, which is a long and twisting road that is rather undeveloped for the area, but the occasional apartment complex or convenience store can be found. Thick trees are on both sides of the road. I live in Ormond Beach, so Williamson was a straight shot to Hand Ave without having to stop at so many lights. It is a very well known street, and there were quite a few other cars on the road in both directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving home, I looked out the passenger window to see these giant triangular air crafts flying low. I squinted and said, &#34;Mom, look at these planes. They are shaped funny.&#34; She couldn&#39;t look up until she came around the bend. When she glanced up at them, she slowed a little. &#34;Oh my god, they&#39;re black triangles. Is the government testing something new?&#34; She asked me. I shook my head, but didn&#39;t take my eyes off them. I counted four. I remarked, &#34;Look at how low they are flying. You&#39;d think that if they were testing something new they wouldn&#39;t do it here.&#34; My mom commented on the time of night, and the thick forestation on both sides. As I watched them, I noticed that they had a weird way of moving. Focusing on just one of them, it flew straight...then stopped....went backwards....then stopped...then to the side and stopped, all without changing the direction of the &#34;nose&#34;. At the blink of an eye they could go from being completely motionless to down the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Going 45 mph. with only my window half down, there was no audible sound coming from the four planes. I thought that was extremely odd, considering how close we were to them. I saw one do a slow nose dive into the woods until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I was prepared to hear a blast, as I thought it was surely doomed. As far as I&#39;ve ever known, those woods are completely blanketed with trees, but I&#39;ve also heard there are also small retention ponds somewhere in there too. Apparently, there must have been a clearing back there for the plane to go down like that, only to emerge a few seconds later unscathed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the best of my recollection, there were no lights on the planes whatsoever. Being at night, and the planes painted pitch black with no lights, they were obviously meant to go unseen. If it weren&#39;t for the moon, light pollution, and the scattered lights of homes and businesses, we would not have seen them at all, and we certainly would not have heard them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother weaved slightly as she tried to drive and gaze up at the same time. We watched them play in the sky. They came so close to us at one point, that I had to crane my neck up to see the whole craft. There was no particular formation, and they didn&#39;t seem to have any real destination, until they all turned and sort of drifted in the opposite direction than we were heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother returned to her normal driving as I twisted in my seat to try to get one last peek at them. The last thing I remember was that even though they were shaped like triangles, the sides were flat and the edges looked like they were sanded down a little more round. The &#34;nose&#34; looked rounded too. Since then, I&#39;ve looked at photos of the Stealth and other interesting air crafts and none of them have had the shape or contour of the four we saw that night.<n>

We were laying on blankets just outside of the vehicle and the kids had just fallen off to sleep shortly after the first film ended. During the second film I was looking up into the night sky and noticed just how beautiful the stars were in the moonless, cloudless sky. After a couple of minutes I noticed a brilliant white light moving horizontically through the night sky at what seemed to be at a super fast speed (Note: it was not a falling star - I&#39;ve seen a million of those and they move at a much slower pace and tend to be falling down in the sky this object moved sideways). The light traveled in a perfectly straight line over 90% of the entire body of the night sky. I had my wife observe it as well. We watched it move to the corner of the sky at which time it made a perfect 45 degree angled turn upward (not like a falling star) into the sky (I&#39;ve never seen anything cut an angle like that). Then in just two seconds, the moving object proceeded to go into some kind of hyper-speed and it looked like a stepping stone in the sky and then it gradually faded out forming a blurry intermittent line and then vanished. I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. My wife refuses to talk about it to this very day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I had a friend over that night and we were throwing darts and visiting with each other.  There was a knock on the door and it was my ex girl friend. She was excited and asked me to come outside and follow her.  She lead me west to the parking lot and instructed me to stand there pointed to the Northwest and said look over there and talk to me a while.  We talked for a couple of minutes and while looking to the West I felt heat on the back of my neck and a yellow flash. I started turning to see what it was and between West and North there it was.  I froze.  To the NOrthwest about 400 yds away and about 150-200ft off the ground was a huge hat shaped object. The brim was fat and the crown was short.  The outside wasn&#39;t glossy it was like flat paint. It was clear as a bell.  It wasn&#39;t moving and it seemed to have no power no sound.  In a few seconds I h! eard like a loud mechanical engaging and segments like those from a digital clock appeared in random order underneath.  Then another mechanical engaging sound(like a electrical motor starter?) and the other half of the segements came on and created a wagon wheel shape, colored in darker than lime green light.  In a few seconds more it looked like it moved towards the west for just a split second and disappeared.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it flew off or went into another dimesion,but it was gone.  She was looking at me when I looked at her and she said what was that.  I said I don&#39;t know but don&#39;t tell anyone.  My other friend over heard us and started saying Yall didn&#39;t she see anything what did yall see.  We didn&#39;t respone and went back into the apartment and just acted normal until they both left. It didn&#39;t dawn on me, I guess because of the gravity of the sighting, until a couple of days later how did she know when to come get me, where for me to look, to show me what she knew was go! ing to be there.  I sent word through her brother that I needed! to see her.  In about a week she showed up after work and after visiting for a while I asked her how she knew?  She looked at me like she didn&#39;t know what I was talking about.  Years have passd and after remebering some vague statements in the 2 yrs. before the sighting she made to me, there is a bigger picture formed not in this report that make this even more interesting and important.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are interested in these statements and my opinion feel free to contact me anytime.  I am available and have a answering machine with no caller ID.  Leave a message or I have no way of knowing who called.<n>

I heard a strange beeping noise and started looking around.  Then I saw right between my house and my neighbors house was a silver craft just hovering between both houses.  It was approximately 40 feet off the ground.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing and just stood there frozen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it slowly, very very slowly, moved over the street where I was standing.  It stopped about 20 feet in front of me and was about 30 feet up (it was slightly below the height of a street light).  I stood there for about 15 seconds just looking at it in awe.  It had a very smooth exterior and had 3 circular white lights underneath it shining down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the placement of the lights underneath the craft, imagine a triangle with one light in each corner of the triangle and the triangle being underneath an aircraft.  I hope that makes sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I freaked out and ran inside my house and grabbed my brother.  He came out and as we ran into the street,  it sped off into the distance, slowed down for a few seconds and then sped off again.  I could tell that it still was fairly low to the ground - probably 100 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it go until it disappeared.  A<n> <n><n> <n><n> s for the beeping noise that it was making, there was a beep, then a 1 second pause, then another beep, then a 1 second pause and so on.  It never stopped beeping.  It was so loud that I was surprised none of my other neighbors ran out into the street to see what was making the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the craft came from the South East and moved to the North West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Repeated sightings in a week&#39;s time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister, her two boys and my one child were sitting out by our home by a campfire.  My sister pointed to the skys and from the Northwesterly area were three fast moving objects, they would have looked like stars, except they were moving. They moved up and down and and back and forth, but eventually went in a South Easterly direction and disappeared. The next night we watched and saw the objects again acting in the same manner and going the same way. The next night and the next my kid went out and he saw the same objects doing about the same thing. We have not gone out to watch for them this year. They can not be anything we know about as far as planes, or any other ship that we have seen because they move in such a way fast, up and down and zig zagged .. their speed is incredible, because of the distance away and as fast as they move, they are hundreds of times faster than any jet I have ever seen, and no craft I know of moves like these do.<n>

It got closer to where I could see it very well, and well enough to know it was not a plane, and it was not a helicopter, and it was not a balloon of any kind. I was alone, and on the phone with my mother when I saw it. I  looked at it for several minutes explaining to my mother what it looked like, and how it was just hovering in mid air not moving, when I saw my boyfriend driving down our driveway.  I hung up on my mother, while I sprinted down the second floor steps to the parking lot of our apartment building.  By the time I got to the parking lot to scream out to him to look up, it dove off to the north/east behind the trees very quickly, and it was gone, ALMOST AS IF IT KNEW I WAS TRYING TO GET SOMEONE ELSE TO LOOK AT IT.  The lights were all the way around the craft, and seemed to move around or light up at different intervals. It was very close to the ground, closer than any commercial airliner would be. I am guessing it was around 10 pm and it wasn&#39;t cold out, so possibly summer or spring time, but I didnt log it down, so the details arent as clear as they were. I didnt want to tell anyone for fear they&#39;d think I was crazy, but I am more curious now than anything to see if anyone else saw what I saw. I never heard anything on the news about it, but I am positive about what I saw, and the thought of it makes me feel very unsecure! The exact location was on Revere St. in Dayton, Ohio 45420 between Patterson and Watervliet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Two of us took a quick hike to the nearby ridge to get a better look.  I thought at first that it was a campfire (it looked like a flame), but when we got a better look it was clear that the object was floating in the sky just above the trees; and it was lighting up the ground below it.  It seemed to change shape (sort of like how a flame moves and changes); and its colors were a bright redish-orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved very slow, but it did hover around methodically; yet not really precise either.  There was absolutely no sounds from the object.  The phenomenon lasted for about 10 minutes; and then the object literally shot into the sky at speeds that I didn&#39;t think were possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was blacker than the night sky but it was completly surrounded by tiny, white lites that were VERY dim.  If the object was not moving, it would have blended right in with the surrounding stars and wouldn&#39;t have been seen.  It made no noise and was moving fast.  It was also giving off waves as though the actual object was very hot.  I would have put it at about 2,000 ft.  Being a fighter jet freak, I began to rule out all possible known aircraft.  I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR OF ANY OTHER SIGHTINGS OF THIS UFO. I called the local paper and they didn&#39;t report any other sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

6/1/99 21:30|Portsmouth|NH|Oval|30 seconds|Hazy "white light" oval shaped craft emitted blue beam of light downward in proximity of Piscataqua River and US Naval Yard and Nuclear|4/15/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12602.html|247|ndxe199906| Hazy &#34;white light&#34; oval shaped craft emitted blue beam of light downward in proximity of Piscataqua River and US Naval Yard and Nuclear Submarine Facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have hesitated up until this day to report this event.  Although I understand it has been almost 1 year since the event, I now believe it&#39;s important to report the event even though I want to believe it was nothing more than a trick of my eyes.  As the months go by I am still drawn to what I saw and hope that reporting it will at the least get this off my mind. I was driving to my last home (apartment) on a warm summer night approximately in Mid June of 1999.  It was just after dark and perhaps a bit of &#34;dusk light&#34; left in the sky.  I can&#39;t exactly recall, but it was mostly dark at the least.  Beyond the treeline of where I live is the Piscataqua River, which is home to the US Navy Yard at Portsmouth, NH.  Among other things that are developed at the Navy Yard, the base supports the building of Nuclear Submarines.  Perhaps there is no connection, but I would think that if there was a motive for a UFO to be in the area, that would be it.  The treeline is approximately 500 ft away from the area that I spotted the craft.  Furthermore, if you extended your arm as far as you could away from your body and measured 2.5 inches with your index finger and thumb, that would be the vertical distance between the treetops and the craft.  Based on that, I believe the craft was no more than 80-100 ft in the air.  The trees are approx. 50-60ft in height.  It is not an exact science, but I&#39;d said it&#39;s a fair estimation.  If the trees were 500ft away from where I was, then the craft was 550-600ft away (since from where I was it appeared that the craft would have been hovering directly over the river or just beyond the tree line where the trees meet the river). The craft itself would appear to be 40ft in length (width) and 20ft in height.  The blue beam was about 1/2 the width of the craft or 20ft wide and appeared from the bottom and center of the craft. The craft was moving slowly east or towards the mouth of the river, rather than further inland. As it moved a blue beam extended from the craft below the tree tops and out of my view.  I believe the craft hovered just along the bank of the river at times since the blue beam did appear to light up some of the trees.  The craft moved at an approximate speed of 10MPH.  I did not hear any sounds.  The craft was a glowing white light, but the light was isolated to the craft and didn&#39;t seem to extend beyond the craft.  It&#39;s as if the craft itself was the color of milky white light. As I continued on the road I lost the craft below the trees.  I do not know what happened after that.  I also, to this day, don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t stop to get a better look.  Again, I just simply didn&#39;t want to believe what I saw. I only hope this serves to rustle up some other witnesses to this event.  Mr. Davenport et al, I hope you can make a call for NH Seacoast residents to recall their memories to last summer to see if anyone else saw this event.<n>

My car window was down, I noticed on the far side of the lake bed, aprox: 1/4 to 1/2 mile away.  There was a set of very bright lights with smaller green lights behind moving back and forth on what I first thought was the road across the lake bed. I stopped to observe the erratic behavior.  After 20 seconds or so, I realized the object was below the road, and switching directions too quickly for it to be a car.  I wondered maybe a helicopter?, but there was no sound and I know that sound carries well across that marshy land.  I then realized that the object had turned 90 degrees and was then headed straight at my car, still no sound.  I know there is no path in that area for any vehicle to traverse without getting bogged down.  I also realized it was flying too high to be a car on the ground.  I put my car in gear and! decided to move down the road out of the way.  The object arrived on the road on my side of the road and again did a sharp 90 degree turn in my direction, I then became very alarmed so I accelerated my car to the point of unsafe speed.  Keeping my eyes on road and rear view mirror I saw the object was now following me at speeds 55 mph on winding  roads.  All I could see in the rear mirror was now two lights brighter than any halogen lights I&#39;ve ever seen, blinding me in the mirror.  I was now terrified and kept thinking please god let me get home so I can tell my husband.  I hit the crest of the steep hill still doing 50 mph. At that point I was 90 seconds from my drive way.  But I do not remember pulling into the drive or entering the house, let alone telling my husband what had just occurred.  The next I recalled was getting up the next morning. I had been terrified but did not even recollect the event till over a week later.  No matter what has ever happened, I have always talked to my spouse.  All I wanted was to survive to tell my spouse, yet I did not remember.  Nor am I given to hysteria.  My mind is completely blank as to the end of that event, yet I recall every last detail leading up to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was standing outside of my parent&#39;s house. Looking Northeast over the backyard and the neighbor&#39;s house, I saw something in the sky. It looked like a silver &#34;x-mas tree ornament&#34; - that&#39;s how I remember describing it. It just hung in the air for a while, moved around a little bit, made a motion left, then &#34;floated&#34; over to the right, behind some trees. I followed it but it seemed to have just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was small but I could tell that it was not a plane or helicopter - nor was it a balloon. This was shining, like metal.

It only lasted seconds.  It scared me so badly that I called a friend to comfort me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I realized the world hadn&#39;t ended, I was okay, but very puzzled as to what had happened.  The next day around 2:30 I went outside to mow the lawn. (and prove to myself I wasn,t scared to go out side.)  I started at the left front of house, going towards the woods.  When I came close to the woods ,I noticed a burnt place in the yard. I turned off the mower to investigate more closely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 12 to 15 inches in diameter, perfectly round, not out of line anywhere and about 10 to 15 feet wide and all the grass in the middle was squished down flat, like a heavy wieght had been on it.  My dog went crazy when he came over to see what I was looking at.  Jumping back and forth at it and yipping high, shrill ,barks over and over.  So I tied him on the other side of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The burnt grass was still in form.  I thot someone was playing a joke on me.  So I questioned my nieghbor on the hill across the road, to see if she had heard or seen anything.  She said no. But, you could see the burnt circle perfectly from her porch.  And it was perfect.  I showed the circle to my brother, my cousin and acouple of friends, and my husband at the time.  My husband and brother both knew of the incident the day before because I told them all about it at supper the night before, so we were all trying to put two and two together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As summer progressed  the burnt area turned brown. Then these mushrooms, and only mushrooms started growing in the circle. They grew fast,and extremly large, until they just burst open.  Then they disentigrated and toward the end of summer the grass started growing back.  It grew darker, thicker, faster, and taller than the rest of the grass in the yard.  That winter it snowed, and that circle of grass still grew tall through the snow.  You could see that circle for a few years after a! lso, but has finally faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Same as above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have revised this report.

It was so bright that I had to look the other way and then when I looked back at it it started to stop and stay still in the sky.  Then all of a sudden it took off so fast that I didn&#39;t know what direction it went in.  That night I went to shut my blinds when I saw the bright light again and this time the light seemed to point at me and it seemed like it was getting closer and then I heard the loud noise again and it left and I never saw it again.<n>

The object was not a spacecraft. I have absolutely no idea what it was. It was about the size of a pepsi can and was moving by slowly rotating through the air. It seemed to defy gravity and the air surrounding the cylindrical object seemed to have no effect on its movement. It was like watching the object fly through the air in slow motion while everything around it was at normal speed. It also was not very far away from me. It was only about 5 feet above me in the air. I didn&#39;t see where it came from, but it continued to travel horizontally through the air on a straight path until it disappeared from view. It was completely silent as well and made no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Last summer,  I observed a similar phenomena in full daylight. I was cycling with a friend and we had stopped to  rest in a local park area. The sky was generally clear - with the exception of a small hazy patch of cloud that  had somehow developed in one quarter. From where we stood we had an excellent view of the horizon - or as good as it gets on the outskirts of a big city. Eventually, my friend spied an unusual craft moving very slowly across the sky. It was light coloured (silvery white - very difficult to read in the mid afternoon sunlight) and somewhat angular appearing. At first I thought it was perhaps an ultralight of some variety - except it made no sound and moved too slowly - ie. should not have been airborne at that rate of speed.  Both of us were moved to &#34;high alert&#34; as we observed it very carefully for some minutes as it approached the cloudy area - which seemed to thicken. I began to suspect at this point that this anomalous cloud might have something to do with what we were seeing and I didn&#39;t so much as blink an eye as I watched the craft slowly merge with its outer edges. As the craft was just about to disappear behind the haze,  a bolt of light, like a lens flare or flashbulb discharge, erupted from its exact location. From my point of view, the object disappeared instantaneously and in a matter of moments thereafter, the  &#34;cloud&#34; dissolved completely. Although I scanned the skies for this object and traced its logical trajectory, after the flare, it was nowhere to be found. I stood there quite devastated, wondering what it was I had seen - even as the skies to the north and south of us were strewn with a checkerboard of contrails. A look at one of the planes that laid a large trail almost directly over our heads reveled that it was not a commercial plane - but a very large military craft - a two engine job resembling  a high altitude bomber of some description.  The sudden appearance of planes laying out contrails seemed deliberate. Were they mapping a location? Interestingly, my friend did not view the situation exactly as I did. Whether for fear of being implicated in a sighting or not, he insisted that he had seen the craft emerge from the other side of the cloud  and made repeated attempts to point it out to me. I have excellent eyesight and although I stood trying to get a focus on whatever it was he was attempting to call my attention towards, I saw nothing. It was both a puzzling and highly emotional experience and we actually got into an argument over the whole deal. I stand by my story - he by his. What he does conceede is that the event was &#34;suspicious&#34;. I would go much further than that. It does not take a genius to understand that this could be one of two things: a) ariel military test manouvres of  a new generation of air ship - the possible application of Bohm&#39;s non-locality and post quantum physics in faster than light transportation b) an incursion into North American airspace by some unknown entity One thing that<n>

Thinking it was a weather ballon I thought nothing of it. Suddenly there started appearing many more of the same obects going in the same direction. I then started thinking it could be someone turned loose a bunch of large ballons for some reason. I called for my wife to bring the binoculars out and she did. I could see no distinquishing marks on them but they were going in the same direction at the same speed, about 150 -200 miles per hour. This went on about 10 to 15 min.

I pointed my video camera at the trail and noticed a silver cylindrical object flying across the sky slowly. I kept my camera on it as it passed through and under the clouds. My wife is heard on the video tape joking that it might be a ufo. I thought it could be a balloon but at the height of the clouds could it be visible?  When I got home I viewed the footage on my big screen TV and was amazed to see that this object was cylindrical shaped and spinning and wobbling. It seemed to change shape from cylindrical to square and back a few times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clearest shot of this object is when it passed underneath the clouds and the object was black and very detailed at appeared like a top hat at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have this footage on tape and I&#39;m planning to transfer it to my PC when I get the software so that I can upload it for the world to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness has offered to forward a copy of the tape to our Center.

It wasn&#39;t really sunny so that is why I think it might have been around or past noon.  I was at the age when my head could just only appear above a window pane that faces out of the front of my parent&#39;s two story house to the neighborhood street.  Because of this, I think I was around my pre-teen age. Anyway, I liked to look at the sky a lot, and these were just one of those days.  Something shiny caught my right eye. I focused my attention on it- it was a smooth silverish metallic object shaped like a dome- not exactly a saucer or disk- but a dome.  It was very far, but it was close enough for me to make out the shape.  I remembered seeing window-like texture on the side of the dome, but now I&#39;m not sure I remember right.  It moved smoothly in a down to up-right curve, and continued to move farther to the right and away until I couldn&#39;t see past the window anymore.  I know this is not a false memory because at this time I told myself what I saw and tried to make excuses for what I saw such as perhaps the people were trying out new aircrafts.  Alas, I now know it&#39;s not possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I should note when I was little and around this age, I often heard a strange futuristic sound at night that reminds me of spaceship landing in the movies. This might be irrelevant, but I don&#39;t know what can explain that sound. I haven&#39;t heard the sound for a long time now- probably because I don&#39;t live at my parent&#39;s often anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1999 is approximate.

Both clouds were in the east and one was the apparent size of a thumb, the other half this size.  I also noticed that the vapour trail of a jet was stretching from roughly the SE to NW and its leading end was obscured by the smaller cloud.  It is always my natural reaction to watch, for a few seconds, the passing of a jet as it goes overhead but as yet this jet had not moved from behind the small cloud.  It should have taken a second or less for a jet to travel the apparent width of this tiny cloud.  After maybe ten seconds I was expecting to see burning pieces of jet fall from the sky as this was the only reason I could come up with as to why this jet had apparently stopped.  Time went by, maybe 20-30 secs, I can&#39;t remember the time scale that well because I was just astounded that the jet seemed to have stopped.  Then I saw what looked like a triangular object, an isoceles possibly moving in a smoothly curving path from a point which was many degrees above and to the right of this small cloud.  It&#39;s apparent size was 2 or 3 times that of a jet, its surface was not smooth but appeared to have details which were beyond my vision.  It had no vapour trail and it moved faster than a jet possibly twice the speed, it is hard to compare since it moved in a long arc.  At this point I was aware that something extremely mad was happening and that something weird was going to happen.  This object, which seemed to appear from nowhere was swooping its way towards this little cloud where a jet was apparently stuck.  Incidentally the jet was still &#39;stuck&#39; while this thing was making its way.  Obviously my heart was beating fast and my jaw was hanging and various expletives were repeating themselves in my head.  Anyway, as soon as the object disappeared behind this cloud, the plane popped out!  The object was gone and the jet continued on the same course indicated by it&#39;s pre! vious va pour trail i.e. SE to NW.  I am an amateur astronomer and I where glasses with weak lenses.  I have also seen other anomalous things when doing astronomy such as fast moving orange lights, which have also been reported by two others in the letters section of a UK astronomy magazine.  You just can&#39;t make this story up.  I am not seeking attention.  Just read this and know that it actually happened.  I will leave explanations to others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

Anyway, I was pregnant with my son he is now 13 years old so the sighting had to be in 1999.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son’s father, his uncle and I were all out at the jetties  “a place in Venice” fishing.  It was very late and I was tired and wanted to go home. My son’s father wanted to stay so I walked up onto the bench they had by the snack shop to lie down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out towards my son’s father and uncle as they were fishing and out of nowhere I saw this HUGE and I mean HUGE saucer it had if I remember correctly red and white lights going around the bottom of it. It made no sound at all. It was very close to the top of the trees.  I got up and walked down onto the dock where my son’s father and Uncle were and we all 3 stood there staring at this thing and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son’s father said the light were red and like fireballs.  I remember red and white. It was strange and honestly I don’t remember too much after that. I did call my mom right away she said I called around 2am from a payphone and she said I told her all about it.  I know that was a UFO. I have NEVER seen anything like that before.  I was not scared when I saw it, none of us were, and we just stared at it until it vanished.   After I called my mom and told her about it, I’m not sure how to explain it but I don’t really remember much after that.  I do know I saw a huge space ship with red and white lights and it was amazing to me that it made no sound what so ever.<n>

I saw a large stationary craft and in a moment or so smaller craft emerged single file almost, first to the west then from the opposite side of the craft to the east but this was going on simultaneously. About a dozen in each direction emerged, (without counting)  I was then urged to look to my left and up to the tree under which I saw a ball of white light smaller, but not much, than a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to have an intelligent presence and was observing me from a distance of only about 15 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later, as though driven away by my attitude it took off in a westerly direction climbing at an angle of about 60 degrees. As it did so it elongated into a tail of light then disappeared, not in the distance but simply a short distance away - it just vanished. Time travelling came to mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weidest thing was that throughout as is often the case it appeared as a normal circumstance and nothing to worry about and this feeling lasted for three weeks after which time it literally wore off and I freeked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also want to record several other sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several times around 2000 I witnessed the searchlight which seemed to go on forever but unlike some other sightings I believe I was given an explanation on one of these occasions and far more detailed and absolutely fascinating observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The searchlight emanated from a stationary craft, quite close, in the sky and went to and fro ad nauseum , not on the ground but on thin air! in the sky around an axis point roughly level with the originating craft on the horizontal plane, in an arc of around 130 to 150 degrees of a circle.to and fro, to and fro ad nauseum. the &#39;spotlight&#39; a kind of end circle with the conical beam just like you see normally but only a short distance from the originating craft . Hard to tell air distances but around 100 feet at a guess. But on one occasion it got very interesting and I was told to watch this... a narrow beam of light shot out from the originating craft independent of the searchlight bisecting the searchlight arc and stopping at its extreme perimeter. this then disappeared and a blue rectangle of light appeared vertically over the area of the arc search in a flash and remained for a moment or two then that too disappeared. It seemed to my mind and I don&#39;t know how , except to say intuitively that the narrow beam was like a fishing line and that the rectangle of light was the hook which retreived the INFORMATION, the whole point of the exercise, that the searchlight had been gathering about the people below it asleep in their homes and or the physical environment and that when these two lights disappeared the information was retreived safely on board the space craft. I found the whole thing fascinating and still do. Now why did they want to show me these things unless they were friendly craft - right? If you appreciated hearing about this please let me know I may or may not be allowed to detail a myriad of other things including scoop marks missing time seeing my abductors, responding to implanted thoughts, always benign as if they were my own,a cigar shaped vehicle having trouble leaving this time dimension - I can prove this using Einsteins exact same descriptions for the same.

Remember it was realy dark .No light post or any source of light but the headlights of our van.All of a sudden i see light on our dashboard.At the moment it took me a while to figure out why is there light on our dashboard when there is no light post outside.So I took a glance through the windshield and seen a round craft with lights pointing straight down right above our van realy close hovering over us.Right there and then I scream at my dad while he&#39;s driving and told him,&#34;look up!&#34;.He looked up and stopped the van right away with a look of shock in his face.I got out of the van not fealing any danger ,so my dad got out too.We looked up at this round saucer that resembled a pepperoni pizza but upside! down,but think of it like this.The pepperonies were the lights pointing straight down and this hovering object was realy quiet without making any noise what-so-ever.I could here my sister scream realy,realy loud,I turned to look at her but she was alright.She was only sticking her head out my window looking up and screaming and crying .This object was over us for about 2 minutes and then started to move realy slowly twards a field where we could follow it,there was no road.Only a fenced up field.Another thing ,this thing had a front and back to it .Even though it was round because what was the front had a spotlight going crazy lighting up,down,side-to-side.So this round saucer like I always seen on tv and read in fiction books was moving away from me until it disapeared.Me and my sister still try to remind each other if what we seen was real,but she shuts me up and doesn&#39;t want to talk about it.......life,is not the same for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The moon was crescent that night and setting in the southwestern part of the sky. We were talking all night to one another about our future and summer plans as we decided to call it a night and return to our respective homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the seven of us were outside ready to leave six of us, including myself, caught a glimpse of an object in the northern sky that made all the girls in our group scream. The object seemed to appear out of nowhere and moved at an incredible speed. It appeared in the northeastern part of the sky and moved in the shape of an arc or bow toward the northwestern part of the sky and disappeared &#39;into thin air&#39; very quickly. It was circular in shape and was only slightly brighter than a full moon and had the same type of brilliance, size, shape, and likeness. It did not make any sound. The object appeared to be relatively far away from us however our judgment deciding the approximate distance of the object from us could not be determined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Exactly two weeks later at approximately the same time of night, my friend and her boyfriend reported to us that they saw the same object in the same part of the sky complete the same maneuver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was unsure, but I had a strong feeling of something watching me, or similar.  I sit up, and in the window (which is on the second story of my house), there were two glowing greenish eyes.  The unidentified creature had a distinct humanoid head, with no ears, and almost no nose, but it was hidden almost.  I did not have any interactions with this figure, but I did make a distinct eye contact that I will never forget. I approached the window, then turned and walked out of my room and to the bathroom to make sure I wasn&#39;t asleep, and I was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Since I worked the graveyard shift, on my nights off I would lay in my hammock out side as not to disturb my sleeping children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 1st night I focused on two very bright stars for at least an hour when off to my right I saw what I thought was a bright satellite approaching those stars. Without changing speed as soon as it had made a perfect triangle with the two stars they began moving with the third object and continued on it&#39;s path. Same speed, perfect triangle across the sky until I lost sight of them. I was and still am baffled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following week I saw what I believe to be airplanes (since there was a small airport not far off) with their landing lights on coming over the tree tops on a hill about 5 miles away it came straight toward me from the west a couple more miles then made a sharp right turn toward the north. Something an airplane could not have done, also the so called landing lights were still facing me. I watch until it left my sight behind trees. Only seconds later another object on the same path,same size, same lights did the exact same thing followed by a third, fourth and so on. This went on for at least 45 minutes. I lost count of how many there were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At my parents house 5 miles south of those sightings back when I was a teenager about 1969-70 in the summer time, on a bright clear day my mom called my dad and myself to the front porch and pointed to the north to a very large star (brightest I have ever seen) We watched it as it stayed in the same spot for about 15 minutes and we discussing NEVER seeing a star during the day let alone that bright. All of a sudden it shot straight up at an incredible rate and was gone. It was then we realized it was too close to be a star<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had just turned onto Hwy 20 from Washington Rd.,Still speeding up to hwy limit, 35mph,My husband sitting in the passenger seat declared &#34;WHATS THAT!&#34;, While pointing to my left across the road and up,I followed his finger and looked out the upper left of the wind shield and saw a gigantic(almost as big as the full moon)slowly falling,bright glowing, greenish-white fire ball/ ball lightning looking object seemingly falling towards the town of Nevada City,CA. I veiwed it through the trees pieces seemed to be coming off the back like a falling 747, but it did not have the color of fire but something entering the atmosphere. When we finally got to Nevada city ,we stopped at a convenience store. The were 3 Co. Sheriffs standing outside, I approached one and asked him if anyone reported it. He said he hadnt heard a thing. Settling in for the trip to town, I was doing a planet/star sky search, in a clear cloudless view , instantly manifesting in the Western sky appears this bright odd moving greenish falling flash. Being a nearly full moon night, my perception was, size; alittle smaller than the moon, brighter than the moon, ten o&#39;clock in the SO. W. sky falling NO. Not a glow odd like moving on/within itself ,not unlike Ballightning. Duration; two-three secs.<n>

6/1/99 00:00|Fremont|MI|Light|45 minutes +|Bounding, glowing neon orbs of light over Fremont, MI. Neon green orb hovering over neighbor's home for several minutes.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90310.html|282|ndxe199906| Bounding, glowing neon orbs of light over Fremont, MI.  Neon green orb hovering over neighbor&#39;s home for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a late night, approximately 11:00pm-12:00am.  The details have become a bit fuzzy over the years as it was maybe around 1999.  Since then I haven’t really thought too much on it, except for when I see a show about UFOS or my mother and I reminiscence from time to time.  I want to say I was around 14.  I am now 26 years old with a master’s degree as a Physician Assistant Certified in a family practice center and I care for underserved and uninsured patients.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just gotten back from a family event and it was a cool night, probably late summer but maybe early Fall.  There were four passengers in our truck, myself,  my mother, stepfather and my brother. When we got out of the car I had remarked what a starry night it was.  While looking up, we noticed at least five bright neon colored glowing “orbs”, literally bounding across the sky like a pinball machine would.  There were no trails of light.  These orbs of light had no specific shape but the central region was a more rich color and the outer ring a slight aura.  At first the lights were the size of stars.  I specifically remember a pink orb of light and a green orb of light, but there were other neon colors as well. My mother and I decided to stay outside.  My brother and stepfather entered the house as my little brother was scared and my stepfather didn’t seem very interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were over our horse pasture.  As we stayed outside to observe, the lights came down closer to the ground and were still bounding about in erratic patterns.  Soon the lights were over the horse pasture, probably about the height a small engine plane would fly. There was no noise.  There were no specific shapes other than the glowing orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed for what seemed like a long time.  The lights started to move across the street.  We went into the woods across the street to observe further.  At the time, none of us had cell phones or a video camera to take any photos with.  We stood in the woods for a long while, maybe 20 minutes.  The woods were on the back side of our neighbor’s house, which also had a horse pasture.  We were on one side of the horse pasture, and their house on the other, no longer than half a football field’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The horses were not scared and were calm during all of these events.  After observing for a while, something miraculous happened.  One of the glowing orbs came down quite quickly and hovered above our neighbor’s house for several minutes.  It was a bright green orb with a slightly lighter aura with no discernible shape and no noise.  It was large, and seemed just a bit smaller than their roof, but hard to estimate exactly.  After simply hovering directly above the house, it took off straight into the sky as fast as it came down and all activity in the sky ceased thereafter.  We never had the sense of fear during the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this incident, we never seen the lights again.  We did not report the incident at the time and kept the story within the family. We did not hear any reports from locals.   We did not tell the neighbors about what happened due to fear of them &#34;thinking we were crazy.&#34;  Everyone was accounted for and safe. I still wonder if we should have told them.  We did not live in a military region or an area frequented by aircraft.  Fremont has only a small private airport.  I would absolutely take a lie detector test and I know my mother would as well.  My brother still doesn’t like to talk about it, as it still scares him, even though he only seen the first half of the event (he is now 23) .  My mother and stepfather divorced, and we have since lost contact with him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, this event must have lasted at least 45 minutes-1 hour though I didn&#39;t time it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

In Dublin this happen a couple of years ago I am sorry I cant give more details but if your looking for that kind of information you can contact 98FM and FM104 two of Dublin&#39;s biggest radio stations who followed all this for the hole night. It was around 10 I was going to bed when my Mam called me down and I looked out the window which is south facing and I saw a couple of balls which where changing colour from blue red green. It was just hovering there not doing  anything. It was in the sky for most of the night. There is a small airport near where I life and from reports nothing was been done by any one there. Ireland is a small country so our air force is even smaller. I don&#39;t know if this is any use to you I just thought that some body might be interested in the history of these bright balls. I don&#39;t think that there was ever any official report in to it but it was over here and this is very unusual because Ireland is not know for it ufo sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/1/99|Andover|MA|Unknown|30 seconds|1 Enormous Sized Craft at Cruising Speed, Northbound Direction, Highway 495, Andover, Ma. Area, In The Early Morning.|2/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107198.html|284|ndxe199906| 1 Enormous Sized Craft at Cruising Speed, Northbound Direction, Highway 495, Andover, Ma. Area, In The Early Morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Great People @ National U.F.O. Reporting Center and Others,  At the moment of my sighting of the Craft, I was approx. 36 years of age.  My education consisted of an 8th Grade education.  I was self taught and learned from highly intelligent, artistic and Spiritual People when it came to Science, Art, and Spiritual matters, and was/am very proficient in all these areas.  I was/am completely drug free, (prescription and otherwise), that could have an impact on my psychological state, as well as my physical and spiritual states and the whole of me.  I hadn’t consumed any alcohol for at least 6 months prior to my sighting of it and not in any great amounts.  I have never been diagnosed with any mental illness which would blur/alter my perception.  I was on disability for anxiety at the time, and managing it very well, and in great mental/spiritual/physical health.  I’m wasn’t/am not prone to lying or exaggerating.  I’ve never tried to make or have I made money as a result of my Craft sighting, and/or have I sought any attention from others about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of the date of this posting I’ve related my account of my encounter with the Craft to a very select few, special People whom I’ve had the great pleasure of knowing.  I did not document the exact time/date after my encounter with the Craft because I was content with having the information stay with me and with the select few, special People mentioned before.  I’m being moved to share my encounter of the Craft to include The National U.F.O. Reporting Center People and you who are reading this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving my 1987 Rose Mist colored Mercury Cougar XR7 8 cylinder while listening to the stereo on highway 495, heading in a Southbound direction in the vicinity of Andover, Ma., sometime around the year 1999.  I cannot yet recall the weather conditions in detail but visibility was clear as far as my eyes could see.  My vision at that period was accurate enough to the point of not needing any corrective wear such as eyeglasses, contacts, other. It was in the early morning hours and nobody else was present on the highway except for a few truckers, and I noticed a few breakdowns in the breakdown lane, (passenger cars).  There seemed to me to be more breakdowns than usual by the way of the passenger cars.  A Raytheon Plant was somewhere nearby, but not in my physical sight.  I was driving toward my then favorite meditation/recreation spot.  An immense Craft (1), charcoal to jet black was approaching in the opposite direction of my direction and I saw it coming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Craft was cruising directly overhead of my vehicle heading Northbound along Highway 495 at a straight forward angle, at a distance of around 50 to 100 feet.  I lowered the stereo to see if I could hear any sound and I perceived/felt a very steady energy and a feeling of a decrease of gravity and a decrease in the torque of my motion as well.  I asked myself if it belonged to the U.S. Government and answered myself that it probably did not.  I then sighted the Craft for size/shape and it was wider than a football field for sure, but I can’t say exactly how long because it carefully blended in with the night sky.  I can honestly say it was very long.  The speed at which it was moving was not extremely fast at all but very steady.   The only way that I can estimate the speed is to compare the speed of this craft with a car, if a car was moving in the same direction as the Craft (opposite of my direction), and I can say that it was moving less than the speed limit of the high! way at the time, (65-75 m.p.h.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the Craft had a thick density sort of like an aircraft carriers and looked to be made of some very solid material.  I don’t remember there being many lights, but there may have been a few.  As it passed over my vehicle the radio went to static.  I craned my neck upward, forward (windshield area) and said something in sheer awe and excitement as it passed overhead.  I wasn’t afraid at all and I’m still not fearful, I was just amazed and highly energized in a calm manner.  That’s the closest words that I can come up with to describe my emotion/energy for it.  My encounter cannot be expressed to you in words but they are all I have for this report.  I craned my neck back to my right backward, (bucket seats) to see if I could see it behind me, (the rear window on the 1987 Mercury Cougar XR7 is narrow and long), and the Craft blended out following its same course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a polarity shift and a definite charge of energy and looked around to see if anybody else was showing signs of it.  All I remember seeing was people on the side of the road, (breakdown lane) on the highway. I wasn’t close enough to the people to see what their states were.  I got the impression they were experiencing something different from usual whether they were aware of it or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped at a nearby Dunkin’ Donuts just off Highway 495 South.  The waitress appeared casually normal in a business as usual manner. I did not come across any other people there. I proceeded driving to my meditation spot close by, noticing very few cars on the highway.  When I arrived at my spot there were a few people around and they appeared sleepy/tired and nobody was talking or moving as usual. They all appeared to be sleepy/tired and stayed in their cars to themselves. I drank my coffee and reviewed my encounter with the Craft. I felt very calm yet very energized and different with a much higher awareness and enlightenment than I had prior to my sighting of the Craft.  I was then faced with who do I tell about it?  I didn’t let it bother me and I went home with a feeling beyond words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within approx. a one month period after the encounter, I parked my same Mercury Cougar at a friends house, went in for coffee, heard sirens outside, saw swirling red lights, and my local Fire Dept. were in the Apt. Building parking lot putting a fire out that had broken out in my car.  It was the electrical system for sure because in hindsight I smelled something not quite right in the car, but did not have it checked. I took the odor as possibly being from my cigarettes that I smoked and I didn’t want to a). incur expensive diagnostic expenses, b). I was wary about being forthright with information and my experience of the Craft to a car mechanic, or anyone else for that matter.  I said nothing about the encounter or the correlation to the fire of the car and honestly thanked the Law. Fire Dept. for extinguishing the fire. There were a few witnesses present and there was no damage to other people’s property and/or personal injury.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to report this encounter a few times in the past but something/someone told me to wait.  I’ve waited long enough and this is my encounter in total truth and honesty.  I could probably remember more details if I was in the proper hands of a skilled Hypnotist.  It would have to be handled honestly, truthfully, and scientifically for me to do it.  The documentation would have to also be handled honestly, truthfully and proper for it’s kind.  I’m skeptical yet open in pursuing it with the proper People as long as the stated criteria are met.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The facts being what they are in that; the Craft was in a position where there were not alot of People, the vicinity of Raytheon in relationship to the Craft, its’ size, speed in relation to its’ size, altitude, energy, and the number of increased car breakdowns, as well as the effects of the energy on Myself, along with the car radio going to static, the frying of the electrical system on my Mercury Cougar XR7, the very positive after effects it had on me, all make me know for sure that it was not a U.S. Government or any other earthly Government aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would not be safe to assume that any anxiety I had prior to my sighting of the Craft was increased.  As a matter of fact the anxiety I had decreased as a result of my sighting of it.  The other  positive effects on me are too numerous to mention in this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sincerely thank the great People at The Nation U.F.O. Reporting Center for allowing me to report my encounter. I thank Peter Davenport, whom I heard speaking on Coast to Coast Radio and I perceive he is a truthful, dedicated, and great man. I’ll continue with my discretion regarding my encounter and any other encounters and thanks to all the great People who benefit from this report.  We’ll be better for it for sure.<n>
