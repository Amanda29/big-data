The jet was going east to west and this sphere was low going west to east.  It didn&#39;t look like any weather balloon, no odd shapes dangling, or geometry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t at all high up.  Hard to tell size, but I would say about 20 feet in diameter. It wasn&#39;t translucent, didn&#39;t change shape, or seem to bounce at all, but had a definite direction heading towards Lakewood, CO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it reached the front range, it looked like it turned back to the west, and I watched it slowly getting larger again until it was blocked by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have seen something like this in the same approximate location and duration. - The previous event was in 2004.<n>

I normally spend a few minutes looking at the stars and observing; looking at constellations, spotting satellites, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I glanced over the sky to my north, I noticed a &#34;star&#34; that I didn&#39;t recognize.  I shrugged it off as being an airplane and figured I&#39;d look again in a minute to see if it was still there.  As I looked a little to the east, and north of the light (towards the big dipper), I saw the light get very bright out of the corner of my eye.  I looked towards the direction of the light, and over the course of maybe 2 seconds the light grew very bright, brighter than Venus on comparison, and then quickly faded away to nothing.  I could not tell if this was an object that appeared bright as it come closer to me and dim as it went away, or if the object was in fact getting brighter and then faded to nothing.   If the object was in motion, it would have been vastly quicker in speed than any conventional aircraft.  There were no sounds associated with this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/30/87 13:00|East Meadow|NY|Changing|15 - 17 min|ON 03/18107 photos of a black ufo, that changed shape as it went from west to east, were taken by my webcam.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55828.html|3|ndxe198701| ON 03/18/07 photos of a black ufo, that changed shape as it went from west to east, were taken by my webcam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking through photos that were taken by my webcam, during the day of 03/18/07 I came across 46 clear frames containing an unknown black object (1 object)  in the sky. There were actually about another 16 or so frames that I didn’t use because the webcam I use is wireless and subject to interference and these frames weren’t centered correctly or had many interference lines in them. The total amount of frames was about 64.  Each frame is 30 second between shots. The ufo would have had to be in view for 32 minutes. The camera is aimed at the eastern sky and the photos are sent to my website at http://aboutfacts.net .  The black object slowly moved from west to east at an upward angle until it was too far east for the camera to see since a wall blocked the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know the exact time the photos were taken,  since they are not time stamped, but by their placement I can assume it was somewhere between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked almost like a completely black cloud, but it was the deepest black you would ever see, an unnatural black. As it moved across the field of vision it changed its shape. I am including photos of it from my webcam and a gif animation I made from the 46 clear frames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Background: I am retired and the webmaster of http://aboutfacts.net. I have a degree in Behavioral Science from the New York Institute of Technology and I am a former Court Clerk for the New York State Supreme Court.<n>

Then a bright green light flashed over my head i ducked thinking it was a glider, it was then followed by another light this time white. I looked up and saw two oval shaped crafts. I quickly took out my camera and photographed them. But when i took out my film later i discovered it had melted! I only feel safe reporting this now as i think they have stopped watching me, or at least i hope they have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are skeptical as to some elements of this report, but we cannot be certain as to whether it is a truthful report, or a composition of fancy.

It wasn&#39;t anything from man, and it&#39;s not new to me. It was a cume winter night with a heavey over cast, as we where heading home my wife said to me, Hay look at the lighten, and I said there isn&#39;t any lighting in the winter. this was the best site I&#39;ve ever seen. this great light was flashing on and off, on the ground. I known this was something special to me. It was in the field close to a farm house, on the east side of HWY- 13 about 7 miles north of Elkader Ia. At that time there was many sittings, in Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota. I know what I&#39;ve seen was seen for 1000&#39;s of years. I realize what thise so called aleins are and know where they come from. So whats the big deal? The deal is we have no power to stop whats been going on, and the CIA, don&#39;t have any more understanding then the man on the moon. So just live your life,and don&#39;t worry about some other world coming to take us over. Go is in contorl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was shocked to see a glowing object pass a few feet above our car. I was so socked I woke my wife and childeren but they never got a chance to get a look at it. Although it was just a few seconds, the object appeared to be emitting a faint red light and I could see it rotating (reminded me of the rotating craft in Close Encounters of the Third Kind movie) as it went over the hills. Strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life, I&#39;ll never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We will attempt to determine it.  If anyone knows the date of the sighting, please contact our Center, and we will include the date.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Star Trek Actor Sees UFO In Alabama.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the biography of DeForrest Kelley, who played Dr. Leonard McCoy on the original Star Trek series called &#34;From Sawdust To Stardust&#34; by Terry Lee Rioux from Pocket Books on page #87, is a report of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the report as quoted from the book:<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Many years later, Kelly confessed that they saw an unidentified flying object while driving across country.  He said he was riding in the back of the car;  they were entering Alabama when they saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#39;This object came by at a tremendous rate of speed at a very low altitude...around 700 or 800 feet...it looked to be about 65 feet in length.  It was a long, cigar-shaped object with green and blue flames coming out of its side.&#39;  There was a soft sound like a missile, it had a red taillight flashing, and it had no wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once in Montgomery, the trio (DeForrest Kelley, his wife Carolyn, and Superman actor George Reeves) found a newspaper that carried stories of the sightings.  Even when Kelley told the story decades later, he did not mention Reeves by name.  He quietly guarded the old friendship, and, besides, some things were just too fantastic to believe.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> For further information on this story, refer to the Carolyn Kelley interviews:  &#34;My Real-Life Encounter With A UFO,&#34; National Enquirer, January 13, 1987.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Carolyn Kelley and friends corroborate the story, and the Enquirer was accurate.<n>

There were two large, apparently spherical objects, moving in absolute lockstep as though tied together structually, although I couldn&#39;t see any such connection, glowing so brightly that they lit up the desert with an erie deep red, possibly monochromatic light, displaying no other detail than two perfect circles of red light, which, at closest approach, each occupied about as much space in the sky as does a full moon.  They passed almost directly overhead, at a stately pace, and then seemed to very gradually accelerate and bank off to the left, moving rather quickly by the time they disappeared from sight. I stopped and took a motel room in El Centro, and heard on the news that either one or two helicopters (two I think, but I&#39;m not sure on this point) from a nearby military base had crashed or somehow been destroyed that same evening.  I, of course, immediately assumed a connection, but made no attempt to report what I&#39;d seen. There were other cars on the highway, so there must have been other witnesses, but I have no idea who or how many.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have estimated the time of dusk at 1700 hrs.))<n>

We left the theater in Hayward, Ca. somewhere around 11:10pm and drove 20 minutes or so to the Jack In The Box on Castro Valley Blvd. in Castro Valley, Ca..<n> <n><n> <n><n> After leaving the drive-thru, we headed east on Castro Valley Blvd. and eventually came to Paloverde Rd., where we made a right turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, It&#39;s dark out there and there was always a rumor or two, floating around our high schools, that the Palomares Rd. area was haunted or something, as was Niles Canyon Rd. To tell the truth, we did go there to eat what we just bought, but also, we went to look for anything unusual, which we soon found. After making my right turn on Paloverde Rd., I spotted, just up ahead, the entrance to Palomares Rd., so pulled over to the right hand shoulder of the small road and parked, right where Palomares Rd. met Paloverde Rd; it was a lonely spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just across from where we were parked, stood an old abandoned barn, with some old advertisements still painted across the back end of it, facing Paloverde Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started eating and within a few minutes, sometime around 12:00 am, a red ball, about the size of a large beach ball, came up Palomares Rd., heading north, entered on to Paloverde Rd. and stopped directly infront of my car and spun around in circles, in mid air.  It made no noise at all and it was a solid red color.  It didnt&#39;t flicker or shoot sparks or anything like that and again, it was about the size of a beach ball.  The whole thing happened only a few seconds from start to finish; approximately 7 or 8 seconds at most, at which time it sped away, heading east up Paloverde Rd. towards Hwy 580 and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw it and have always talked about it whenever we run into each other. I should mention though, this was NOT the first time that I and others that I was around, had witnessed this same &amp;quot;red ball&amp;quot;.  One &#34;red ball&#34; flew through some trees one warm evening, back in the 80&#39;s, and zipped right through our Dodge Ball game, about eight of us kids witnessed it, this was in Hayward, Ca.  The other time, I was sitting on top of my dads 1964 Chevy, thinking about some girl in class or something, when I saw a large &#34;red ball,&#34; high up in the sky.  It was following a DC-10 or somekind of large, jet passenger plane.  It circled around it and flew from one side of the plane to the other; as if it were playing with it. I ran inside the house, to tell my parents about what I was seeing outside, when I spotted the nightly news on tv.  The news person was mentioning that a large, &#34;red ball&#34; had been reported that evening, following and zipping around a large passenger plane and it was being called a &#34;UFO,&#34; by whoever judges those situations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was also in Hayward, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no reason to lie.  These events were real, all three happened at night, and all three events were witnessed by other people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
