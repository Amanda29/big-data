3/15/90 22:30|Janesville|WI|Light|45 min Hour|close encounters several events 20 yrs apart|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75290.html|2|ndxe199003| close encounters several events 20 yrs apart<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wish to remain anonymous.:  Please note this is strange enough for me to bring up.  Was ridiculed for it by my family for what I am about to write.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am of the age of 35 yrs and almost 20 yrs ago, a friend and I were honestly getting ready to head to the lakes about a mile from my home at the time to have a few beers.  Mind you we hadn&#39;t had any to drink at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled up to about the end of the lake, “they were man made lakes for reservoirs,” and parked the car got out and cracked our first beer.  This was around 9:30 pm..  The year was I believe 1990 and it was around march , “what day I could not be sure,”.  Anyhow we just cracked our first beer and looked over to the north east toward cape Canaveral fl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a luminescent orange light emerging from the ground. Our first reaction was what is that?  I said it&#39;s the shuttle. My friend says , “no couldn&#39;t be I didn&#39;t hear anything on the news about a launch”. I said, “ Me either but there it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing is that it looked to be traveling straight up and  at a very slow accent. My friend also noticed this and said that&#39;s weird. I agree. And sure as he said that it looked to have shot straight up what looked to be at least  2 miles up within the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed it coming in our direction. After seeing it move toward us we guessed it to be at least 3to4 miles away. It was over the lake not more than 50 yards in front of us within less than three seconds. Our initial reaction was holy sh** what the f**k is that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I got in the care shaking trying to put the keys in the ignition. I told him how many time in your life will you see this again? So we stayed. I remember it being shaped like a slender oval. It reflected the moonlight and the moon as would a mirror and had two lights on top swaying back and forth touching each other. No noticeable windows or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think they knew we were there. I believe it was purely accidental we saw them that close because when I opened the car door to get a better look, “ this thing at an angle straightened up shot side to side across the lakes at what appeared to now be a white light. It shot back and forth within 2 seconds stopped  at the end of the lakes and just shot off towards west palm bch fl you didn&#39;t have time to even close your eye and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both agreed that we had just seen what we had seen. I told him we should tell someone. He said sh** I&#39;m not telling anyone there going to think your f***ing crazy. I went home told my mom and brother who both till this day call me a liar and just don&#39;t believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Look I wasn&#39;t a believer in this. Never told stories like this in my whole life about seeing things. Yet how can you help what you see. I am now and always will be a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story gets better. For about a week after I noticed what appeared to be a white light resembling a star would always be on the right of the cars I would be in and would also change direction with the car as we would turn there it would be on the right side of the car. Weird I thought at first until I thought that no other stars do that so what the f am I going crazy?  I kept telling my girlfriend at the time and she about thought I was going crazy too. Until about 6 days after the initial sighting I noticed from my house back by the lakes a light. Looked like a spot light from a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my girl do you see that? She said it&#39;s just a plane or something like that. So out of all last hope I grabbed my lighter , “I know sounds stupid,” and began flickering in click click click pause click pattern. My girl looked at me like I was crazy. Can you blame her. Everyone else thought I was crazy. Until I noticed the light got real bright and flickered the same pattern. My girl said that was co-incidence so I did it again in a different pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And once again it did also. At this point my girl even said that&#39;s weird. I noticed the light starting to come our direction and as it got closer we heard the sound of a prop plane. My girlfriend then said see I told you it was a plane and I said no crap your right. At this moment the prop plane sound changed to what sounded like a helicopter . I started to trip at this point and I asked my girl if she just heard that thing change sound. She said yes. And at that moment it sounded like it changed to the sound of a single jet propulsion engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light began to get closer and as it came by the street in front of the house the light dimmed out to almost nothing and the sound just stopped. And there it was again and my girl saw it with her own eyes and starting crying and saying I want to go inside. I told her to look and tell me I am not crazy and she said I see it I see it I want to go in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her to go inside and get my mom and her husband , “at the time,” and tell them to come out the back door and look up over the house in the back yard . This thing was 30 ft high and probably 30 ft in front of us. By the time my mom and her husband came out I watched this thing start flickering and moving up down left right and random patterns as fast as the eye could see and disappeared . My mother said that I talked about it so much to my girl that I convinced her to see this in living color and she saw it only because I convinced her to see this, my girl I mean. She even told my mother and they did not believe us. If I was that convincing to make someone see that then put me on ripleys or I am in the wrong line of work. Oh well I know what I saw and have not seen it in almost 20yrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moved to wis. And recently strange things have occurred over the last two weeks that I can not explain. White star like object sitting in the sky around dusk very similar to the one I thought was around for a week prior to the second sighting when I was sixteen. Noticed every night for last two weeks at least ten times this has occurred. Will watch the star slowly descend and turn to amber orb no visual shape other than amber or every once in a while it changes colors but mostly amber. Sits there and moves slow almost as if to get my attention. Will watch it fade out to nothing and light will reappear bright white and turn amber and move slightly . Call this strange but it is really weir-ding me out .   After 19 yrs what the hell is it and why does it keep coming back . Have looked around environment and questioning it you know , “ maybe it&#39;s a street light , but come up with the same answer. It&#39;s not! Reason: It has not been here every night.  I&#39;ve seen this thing at least! 10 times and on a couple of clear nights its not there and 30min later there it is . So if anyone can help me solve this riddle pls do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I have never been abducted nor have I ever seen an alien being, just what I saw when I  was sixteen and now again almost 20 yrs later. Have never been inside of this thing or anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a color changing orb appears at close range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is it possible after one has a close encounter for these things to show up and let you know at a distance that they are back or am I just fortunate enough to see this again ? And if so why ? Haven&#39;t seen or looked up in almost 20 yrs . Tried to forget what I saw. This all started 4/14/2010 right before the meteor event. Saw these lights before the meteor and have 9 other occasions over the last 2 weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I am not nuts considering I haven&#39;t seen this in 19 yrs and not the same. This has been appearing around9:30 10: almost every night for the last two weeks. Any explanation would be valued.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

3/15/90 22:00|Los Altos|CA|Unknown|@ 5 minutes|a grouping of white lights surrounded by haze, floodlight shining down, no sound|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70706.html|3|ndxe199003| a grouping of white lights surrounded by haze, floodlight shining down, no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a beautiful, clear spring evening, I went for a walk from my residence in Los Altos, Ca., over to Sunnyvale. At that time, when I lived in California, I was hiking between 25 and 35 miles each week, both after work and in the evenings. I was returning home from my walk, and was within one mile from my house, and cut across a supermarket parking lot. The supermarket had closed for the evening, the lights were being turned out, and there were only a few cars left in the lot. As I crossed the lot, I looked up at approximately a 30 degree angle, and noticed a tight grouping of 5 or 6 white lights with a &#34;floodlight&#34; shining down. There was a mist or haze surrounding the grouping of lights, which were in a non-descript pattern on this object.My first observation of this object would indicate that it was a helicopter with a searchlight shining down. I quickly realized, however, that the object was at a close proximity; approximately one third to one half a mile away, and there was no sound audible from the object. The object was completely motionless. I realized that a helicopter hovering at that close proximity would be distinctly audible.As I watched the object, a person was walking to their car across the parking lot. I was just about to call out to that person to call their attention to the object, when<n>

Traveled left to right in the night sky in an up and down zig zag type movement.|8/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08872.html|5|ndxe199003| Bright white light with some blue and possibly red. Traveled left to right in the night sky in an up and down zig zag type movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was resting in my room. The night was very clear, the stars were out. I saw a bright light through the left side of my window. It was in space, not in earths atmosphere. It was larger than the stars and any sattelite for that matter. The object was mostly white, with some blue and possibly red. It moved up and down in a zig zag pattern, changing colors. I wondered to myself,&#34;What the heck is that?&#34; I opended my window and watched it glide in its zig zag pattern. It had a tail which would delay and &#34;chase&#34; the object as it moved. I heard an echo or pulsating sound, but I have no idea if the object and the sound were linked. The next day I read about it in the local paper. Apparently others had seen it as well.<n>
3/15/90 19:00|Valley Mills (near)|TX|Oval|2-3 minutes|Enormous, oval shaped object, hovering over a field-it had lights that were like no other type of lights I've seen.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29494.html|6|ndxe199003| Enormous, oval shaped object, hovering over a field-it had lights that were like no other type of lights I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night in the early spring of 1990,  my younger brother and I were out basically just being  teenagers-preparing for a weekend night of underage drinking and cruising around.  We had to drive about 12 miles down State Highway 6 to Clifton, Tx. to get ice for our cooler since no stores were open in our hometown of Valley Mills.  On the way back, as our beer was cooling down, something happened that made us totally forget our plans.  Between the two towns, as we were driving along, my brother suddenly yelled &#34;What the hell is that???!!!&#34;  I looked over towards a very large, open field and saw a sight that was probably the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  To this day, over 10 years later, the details are as sharp and clear in my mind as if it had happened yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object in the field was of enormous size.  It was hovering, probably not even 50 feet above the ground and VERY close to the highway.  I could see the outline of it-oval in shape and dark- colored.  It appeared to be larger than a football field and had a single row of lights along its middle.  The lights were different colors-amber,red, blue, and green; and almond-shaped.  But it wasn&#39;t the colors or shape of them that made an impression on me-it  was the light they produced.  It seemed that they were made of liquid or possibly a gaseous substance.  It is very hard to describe, because they were like no lights I have ever seen.  The closest I can compare them to would be neon; but still very different from neon. They were much brighter than standard neon but they didn&#39;t produce a glare-it was more like they were glowing.  Something in them seemed to be swirling or moving.  As I said, they were like nothing on this earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting only lasted a couple of minutes-I slowed and pulled onto the shoulder of the road, transfixed.  We both stared in disbelief and fascination until suddenly fear took over and I stepped on the gas and got out of there as fast as I could!  We were both so freaked out we forgot about our beer and went straight home.  We told my mom and my grandma about what we had seen; and they wanted to see if it was still there.  We drove out to the area, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve told many people about my ufo sighting in the years since; but never reported it officially.  I truly believe that it was not of this planet, and I&#39;ve often wondered what we might have seen had we stayed a little longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1990 is approximate.

This object made no sound, and it was bright enough to light up the ground and cast leaf-shaped shadows on each of our faces as its light passed through the tree branches over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be hard to estimate size, not knowing the exact altitude of the object, but a guess, based on estimated distance, would be between 10 to 20 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note:  Other strange craft in the area had been seen by several of us prior to this experience, though this was the first time any of us had seen something together.) We were setting up a campsite on a friend&#39;s property when this happened, and, to be honest, it scared us, and we elected to move indoors for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

3/1/90 20:30|San Pedro (Belize)||Oval|2 seconds|glowing noiseless oval fluttered out of clouds and shot backwards into said clouds.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42241.html|9|ndxe199003| glowing noiseless oval fluttered out of clouds and shot backwards into said clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and another person were on a second floor balcony of a motel overlooking the ocean. The moon was in the SW as a sliver. We were facing SE. The wind was about 20 mph from the north. About 70% of the night sky was covered by low black puffy clouds at about 400-600 feet. I noticed black stringy clouds forming in a area that appeared suddenly, they looked fake, almost like a hollywood special effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after I noticed A flash of bright light out of the corner of my eye reflecting on the water. I quickly looked at the source and seen a glowing oval. It had swooped below the clouds, fluttered once like a leaf ( rocked foward and back )then shot backwards back into the cloud as if using them for camoflage. Then it was totally obscured by the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared as a glowing oval-no disernable struture or outline. It made no sound. Glow was the same color and brightness as the moon.About four times as big or the size of a silver dollar held at arms length. Distance was about 800-1000 feet away. The elevation was about 25 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other person had a longer look at it and thought the top was more triangular shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that he was a state employee in the U. S., at the time of his sighting in Belize.  PD))<n>
