Actual date unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning with a date from Shreveport, La., (north bound on La. 1), where we had attended a movie theater.  She did not drink, and I hadn’t for several weeks. (I was 22 at the time.)(She wished not to be named at all.)   From our drivers side, I noticed lights moving slowly over the tree line from our left to our right in the distance.  I of course first assumed it to be an aircraft, although it was not moving fast enough in my opinion to maintain flight. ‘Curious,’ I thought. ‘Were we about to witness a crash?’  As we approached it, and it maneuvered in front of us, (almost directly over us) I pulled the car over to the side of the road to get a better look. I stepped from my vehicle to witness it continue to move slowly to our right, (completely silent), and then over the adjacent tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise whatsoever. Lights of all colors and “girding,” or a series of railings could be seen, (in an unmistakable “diamond” configuration) on its entire underbelly, at the edge of each of its peripherals. I saw no outer “windows” or “occupants” as are seen by some observers of such crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When “almost” directly under it, it could clearly be seen to be a solid object, as it blotted out all points of starlight beyond, that would have been apparent otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was two to three times the width of any man made aircraft of the times, and three to four times the length. I (of course) had never seen anything like it before, nor have I witnessed anything even similar since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, (as a former police officer), I have estimated the incident to have lasted no more than 90 to 120 seconds. A short time indeed, unfortunately. But more than enough time for it to have been recorded in my trained mind, just as I have described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

4/28/81 23:30|Petaluma|CA|Rectangle|Approx two minutes or les|Around the outside edge of the dark red grid, there was a shimmering orange aura|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34141.html|2|ndxe198104| Around the outside edge of the dark red grid, there was a shimmering orange aura<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the ham radio room of my house in Petaluma, California on the evening of April 28, 1981. That evening I was listening to activity on a local northern California ham repeater. One of the guys came up and announced that there was a station on the air from a rare african country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was interested in working that station, so I needed to go out to the back yard to crank up my tower all the way to the 50 foot level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When not being used, I normally left my tower cranked all the way down to the 20 foot level. That is because if strong winds came, I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about the possibility of the tower and antennas coming down on my roof- or the neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got outside, I cranked the tower all the way up. It took a couple of minutes to do it. As I had finished the cranking, I stood there with my hand on the crank, catching my breath and looking up at the antenna and sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I noticed was that for an April night, it was unusually warm outside; it seemed like it wasn&#39;t that early in the year, it was so warm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I noticed how clear the sky was, it was a completely clear and starry night and it was calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking up at the antenna and sky, suddenly I saw from the corner of my left eye a very bright light up in the sky approach from a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I was standing there facing in an easterly direction.) It came so fast, in a fraction of a second, that I didn&#39;t know what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way that I can describe it, from the brief instant that it was there, was that it was an extremely bright flash of white light, coming from the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I knew, I was looking straight up again, now shocked and in awe with what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above my antenna at an unknown height, there was a hovering object! It was difficult to judge the altitude of the object. It could have been at least several hundred feet above the ground or much more, because I could see the whole object including the aura around it between the space of two of the aluminum elements which my antenna was made of, without being blocked by the antenna elements- the view of it was completely unobstructed by the antenna elements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a crisscross grid of 8 or 10 bars that were glowing an intense, extremely dark red color. I tried to look between the red bars of the grid to see more, the area looked opaque and was a less dark red. The light that emanated from this object was not blinding- I could look up and see it very clearly. Around the outside edge of the dark red grid there was a shimmering orange aura, of which I also took note. The orange aura around the grid was fairly narrow, maybe one fifth or so the size of the grid itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hazy aura shimmered in waves, akin to the way you see heat waves on the highway ahead when driving on a very hot day. The waves of the aura were shimmering at a slow, uniform rate. After I looked up at this thing for about 10 seconds, I closed my eyes tightly, faced down to the ground and shook my head in disbelief. Then I opened my eyes and looked up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still there! Around this time, the thought crossed my mind- &#34;I wonder what the expression on my face looked like to them if something up there was in fact watching, if they saw the look of dread that must have been on my face&#34;.I studied it some more, and after 15 seconds or so, it suddenly vanished. I looked all around the sky above, but it was in vain. It left no trace of what had become of it, where it had gone, that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time that this all happened, I detected no sounds at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my assumption that this all came about because of the fact that I was quickly cranking up my tower with antenna from the 20 foot nested level to the 50 foot fully extended level and the activity and movement called its attention to this location. However, I get the impression that it was possibly not of any consequence to it whether or not I was standing by the base of the tower to see its approach. I only happened to be standing there, still catching my breath. It seems to me that the focus of attention was most likely directed at the antenna and tower and their movement upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possibly the deep red-colored grid was the mode that they were in to take readings or observations. I had this feeling, anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very shocked by what had happened, and most any time that I think of what I saw, chills usually come up my back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some months later on a visit to my parents, I told them about what had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom asked if I had been able to look at it standing clear of the antenna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish that it had been possible to do that, but there was not enough time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can hardly believe that it happened myself, it was so strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an added afterthought- When going back inside, I went into the radio room. I tried to operate the equipment, but I felt disoriented and stupefied. When I figured out I couldn&#39;t clearly tell what I was doing, I gave it up for the night.<n>

My husband and I rarely talked about it to each other after the incident, which was short in duration but very baffling just the same.  We were walking casually on a street parallel to the center of town and something caught my attention up above the houses.  It was darker than the night sky and shaped like a tri-cornered hat.  It was massive in size, about the size of a soccer field  There was a bright white light on each corner.  It was traveling very slowly, almost like it was &#39;coasting.&#39;  My husband and I stood and watched it drift over the rooftops, but oddly, it was silent.  The craft drifted out of our line of vision, and the trees inhibited further viewing, so we didn&#39;t see which direction it went, but it had to have traveled over the center of town as it was too large to avoid it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was holding groceries and watched it falling, (the fall/arch was like unto the left top part of a circle to the middle part) but then it suddenly stopped and I saw lights of red, blue, green flickering. You could see it was at treeline. I estimate the distance I was away from what I saw to be three miles. I watched the lights flickering and it lowered slowly (stright down) and then lights out and I saw nothing more. I assumed that the next day there would be something in the paper or radio, but there was nothing and I have seen nothing like that since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I was a stringer for NBC news and shot the landing from the dry lake bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left Edwards Air Force Base and headed back to the San Joaquin Valley on Highway 99.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late in the afternoon, I saw something that looked to be a dark spot on the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over and got out my binoculars. The sun was too bright, so I waited till the sun started to set. Soon, the dust from the earth allowed my binoculars to see what cannot be anything but UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First there was the large round ship that I could see with my naked eye and gave me the reason to pull over, (thinking it was a sunspot). When I looked below the large ship, I saw six smaller ships lined up three in a row, like on a dice, all at 45 degree angles. Next to these “dots” was a long dark bar (like a pencil) that was twice the length of the large sun spot ship. All these items were stationary is space between earth and the sun. I did an experiment to see if I was just seeing things. I positioned myself in front of distant telephone poles and placed the UFO’s directly behind them.  I watched as the group slowly dropped at the same rate as the sun. They started above the telephone wires and as the sun set they ended up below the telephone wires till they all sunk into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things had to be huge since they were not even close to being on earth and dropped into the horizon at the same rate of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am amazed to this day, that no one has reported this and if they have, I would sure like to know about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,  ((name deleted))<n>

I saw it from a distance, like a tiny pinpoint of light that suddenly was coming towards us and 1/4 of a second later it instantly stopped just ahead of us and to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered there in silence as my wife slowed the car to a stop. There wasn&#39;t another car in sight, we both just sat there and stared at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 8-9 stories high and almost that wide. Probably 6-7 stories high if it turned sideways. It was disc shaped, totally smooth all over. It looked like the entire disc was a dull blueish green color like a dull led light. I noticed it was perfectly round but the top portion was a little larger than the bottom section.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stared at it for about 15 seconds and both of us had goosebumps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly we both at the exact same time turned around and looked at the back seat.  Nothing was there but I had the strangest feeling there was someone there.  I immediately asked my wife why she turned around and looked at the back seat and she said the she had the same feeling that I did, that someone was there.  Then we started laughing and we looked back up at the craft and stared at it a few more seconds when it suddenly took off in a flash towards the south.  It was out of sight within another 1/4 second.  I&#39;ve never seen anything move even close to that speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I think about all the stories I&#39;ve heard about ufo&#39;s I think the one we saw was one of the coolest and for years I&#39;d never heard or read another story that described a similar craft until the one from the airport in chicago a couple years ago. That one sounded similar even though it was in the daylight and was silver in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought it was a 18 wheeler taking a short cut to avoid the the weigh station so I started to pump the brakes to let him know I was in front of him.The light came right up on rear as I continued to pump the brakes.I noticed that the light was to high to be a big truck, about that time it passed over the car at about telephone pole height.By this time I had slowed to about 10 mile per hour and had rolled down the window.The brightness hoovered above the car for about 5 seconds then moved forward.There was no sound from the brightness in front of me.Then the brightness moved to the left of the highway and traveled along side of me at about 10 miles per hour for about 15 second then dissapeared.The whole incident lasted maybe a minute an a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date may be approximate.

It seemed to be travelling up, no other lights were seen on the object, it was only orange.  I pointed it out to my father and mother and they told me not to worry and to go inside the house.  Again, it was not close to the ground, but it was a very distinct shape, very bright, not a star or Mars as it was definitely moving in an upward motion.  I&#39;ve never forgotten this, even thought I was only about 11 at the time of this sighting.  When I bring it up to my parents, they tell me they remember seeing the object, but it must have been a satellite or something like that.  Any ideas?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
