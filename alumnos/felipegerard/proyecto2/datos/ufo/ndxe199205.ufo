I just went inside to get changed and go out to the car that was waiting for me. I came back out and I was just getting into the car when I noticed a lot of wind blowing around a very big tree that we had in the front yard.  I happened to glance upward when I saw something about the size of a football field moving very very slowly about 100 ft above the tree line.  It had lights that blinked and some that didnt change or blink.  I remember that I was frozen in my place I couldnt even speak.  I finally got my bearings and ran into the house to tell my mom about my sighting and franticly yell for a camera.  I was in the house for a matter of like 10 seconds and ran back out to look up and it moved clear across the sky but I could still see it moving about like I would have to guess 1 mile away and up the same distance from the treeline that I had seen it in the first place.  All I could think was INCREDIBLE, it moved that amount of distance in a matter of seconds.  I spent the night telling my friends about what I had seen and them not believing me.  It was when we were listening to the radio that night that when the announcer mentioned the object in the sky and asking anyone that had seen it to call the station.  I kept telling my friends that THAT was what I saw!  It is so very vivid in my head...I close my eyes and still see the craft and how it didnt make any noice when it moved over my house.  It made a ton of wind to make my huge tree just rock and sway all over the place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In a very remote area. We were in our garden on a bright clear day. It wasn&#39;t very windy but a steady breeze was blowing fron west to east (5-10 miles per hour) We were both facing north and looking at the ground when we heard a noise like wind swishing over something and turned around to see a large oval shaped sphere less than 100 yards away floating above the tree tops going against the wind. We stared at it . It looked like a giant ball of mercury going from east to west against the wind causing a sound as the wind blew around it. it slowly moved across the tree top behind some trees at the lower portion of our property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get a better look at it and walked down the field to see were it went. Then ran to the workshop and called a neighbor down the road where the craft was heading. He ran out side but could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing had no lights , windows, motor or anything it almost looked like a blimp but was so shiny it looked like a polished mirror surface IT WAS NOT A BLIMP OR MAN MADE BALLON it just dissappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing was we (my wife and I I) never talked about it until a few days or weeks later. I said to her &#34;what do you think that was&#34; and she said &#34;who knows&#34; Till this day we can&#39;t remember where our kids where or why we didn&#39;t react more freaked out by this experience. We remained very calm and went back to gardening At the time our kids were young some preschool and don&#39;t know why they were not with us in the garden or near by. I&#39;m glad my wife saw it too or I would think I might have been hallucinating. It seemed the craft made no sound and we wouldn&#39;t have known it was behind us except for the noise the wind made blowing over it. Also it seems strange that we were&#39;nt afraid of it. I have search the web for similar disciptions but can&#39;t find any. I have never seen anything so shiny in my life, just like mercury.<n> <n><n> <n><n> no lights, windows gondala, propsetc just a silver sphere going agaisnt the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses were husband and wife.

We were talking for a while and we noticed an object that looked like a star.  We could tell it was in the atmosphere, and it came from the southeastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving at an unbelievable speed, and it stopped on a dime, instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching it, and it stayed there for 10 to 15 seconds.  Then, it instantly, and with great speed, shot to the right, and stopped instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, from the distance we were viewing it, it must have been traveling miles, but did it within a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed in that spot for another 10 to 15 seconds.  Then, it shot to the left with the same incredible speed, and stopped again, effortlessly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object repeated this back and forth, zig zag, about eight times, while staying in one spot, each time it stopped, for 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where we were viewing it, it made the shape of a triangle, and when it got to the top, it shot up, out of the atmosphere, again, with great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was our first sighting, and we were spooked, to say the least.  It was incredible, all of our skepticism was over, now we new ufo&#39;s were real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until you see a ufo for yourself, it is hard to believe; we are far from crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same, seemingly credible, source.

The star seemed to be right at the top of a heavily wooded hill, just over the tops of the trees. I looked at it for a short time and took our dogs back into the house. I don&#39;t know why, but I went back outside to see it again. I realized it was&#39;nt a star because it was moving very slowly down the hill ,without makeing any sound. It was a white circle of light, that glided just over the tops of the trees and did not illuminate anything. All I can think of to describe the light, is that it was &#34;self contained&#34;?The light seemed to have hard edges. The woods should have been lit up with light but it was&#39;nt. Then I noticed a soft blue light on the left side of the light. It did&#39;nt flare out, but was &#34;contained&#34; too. It seemed to be coming from the back of the light. It(the blue light) seemed to have kind of a marbleing effect to it.After a few seconds the &#34;blue&#34; was&#39;nt there anymore.. It continued on down the hill towards me and I started to get a little &#34;rattled&#34;. It came to a complete stop about 250 feet away from me and was absolutely motionless. There was a large tree just to the front of the light, but the light did&#39;nt shine through the branches. Then I became confused because the light just was&#39;nt there anymore.At that point the light was roughly 30 feet in diameter. I thought it was gone. Then I noticed some kind of movement and I ran to the opposite side of the back porch. I heard a low pitched ,deep humming sound like a generator. It was sporadic like an engine thats idleing. I could make out what looked like several amber colored squares of very soft light, butcould&#39;nt see the shape of the object they were coming from. At that point it was about 150 feet away from me. I could have easily run along side of whatever it was,it was moveing so slowly. I did&#39;nt have the courage....I watched it for a short time and then it was gone. It ! did&#39;nt f ly off..it was just gone. I did report it to the Pennsylvania Mufon Director.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was in 6th grade at the time, and i was also living in the residential unit at the school.  I was in bed, along with my room mates ((deleted)) .  I saw a brilliant flash of white light and i got up and opened the window to see what it was. Then the white light faded out and I saw the traffic light outside was changing colors erradically...it would go from yellow to green then to red, and so on.  Then i looked up and to the left of it, and saw there was another light in the sky, changing colors exactly the same way.  The traffic light was about 50 feet away, and from my vantage point it looked like the UFO was about twice it&#39;s distance, hovering at maybe 150 feet. After i observed this for about 45 seconds, an even brighter white light shined onto me, and i had for some reason an intense feeling of joy, followed by an intense feeling of dread or fear.  The next thing i knew, the person who was on duty that night came into the bathroom and said &#34;Are you okay, ((deleted))?  You&#39;ve been in here for almost an hour.&#34;  That was the last time i&#39;d ever mentioned it to anyone.  If you can, please leave my contact info in this explanation. I am an amatuer UFO investigator, and i still to this day haven&#39;t seen anything close to what i saw that day.  In fact, the event at that school was what inspired me to investigate UFO sightings.  If anyone wishes to contact me to tell me about anything they may have seen, they can email me at ((deleted))@aol.com.  Thank you for your time.<n>
5/15/92 15:00|Willow Grove|PA|Cone|5 seconds|A fairly large, gray, metallic object, cone-shaped with a flat, circular bottom spotted in the sky over Willow Grove.|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21973.html|9|ndxe199205| A fairly large, gray, metallic object, cone-shaped with a flat, circular bottom spotted in the sky over Willow Grove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember the exact date, but it was a weekend sometime back in the spring of 1992 or 1993.  It was early afternoon, and I was driving with my girl-friend (now wife) northeast on Fitzwatertown Road in Willow Grove.  A fairly large, gray, metallic object, cone-shaped with a flat, circular bottom was moving at a slow pace (approx 30 mph) in a north-westerly direction, towards Willow Grove Naval Air Station.  I can only assume the object was solid, as the flat, circular bottom was dark, possibly cast in shadow.  There were no discernable markings at all. The sky was somewhat overcast and cloudy gray.  I saw it out of the driver&#39;s side front windshield for approximately 5 seconds, as it passed from right to left across my path.  It was flying rather low over the trees (possibly 200 ft high). Its altitude never varied, nor did its speed. It made no sudden movement, did not display any lights, nor did it make any discernable sound.  It seemed to be moving with purpose and direction.  My wife did not see it as she was reading something in the car at the time.  I didn&#39;t point it out to her either, as I wasn&#39;t sure what I was seeing, and had to keep an eye on the road as well, since I was still driving.  I can recognize most military aircraft in the US armed forces, from an A-10 Warthog to a P-3 Orion (both of which fly out of the Willow Grove Air Station).  I can say with certainty, that this was not a fixed-wing, nor rotor aircraft.  It did not look like a balloon or blimp of any sort I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime.  I can only give you an idea of its size, by saying at arm&#39;s length it was about the size of a quarter.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before or since.<n>

It was a clear, dry, comfortable night...I think about 60 to 65 degrees (but I don&#39;t recall exactly).  I was looking up at the stars in the night sky around 3 am during a routine hourly weather observation in a rural area of very little street lighting, when a very faint, pulsating, pure white light directly overhead caught my eye.  It was about as large as, and otherwise resembled, a small star, and could easily have been missed in a well-lit area.  It appeared to be moving very slowly in a north to south direction amongst the stars, and it gave me the impression that it was many thousands of miles away.  It moved straight and steadily, and I would estimate the pulsations to be about one per second, with the brightness peaks about twice the magnitude of the lulls.  After about a minute, it got down to an elevation of about 80 degrees south (still nearly overhead) and then gradually faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

AND WE LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER AS WE WENT PASS WE STOPED AND BACKUP  AND GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK. AND  IT SAT THERE FOR A FEW SECOUNDS AND IT HAD NO SOUND SO AS WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS THING IT TOOK OFF, AND IT WENT STREIGHT UP  WITH NO SOUND. I NEVER SEEN SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE.<n>
5/10/92 10:30|Allston|MA|Triangle|1.5 hours|Large Triangular object just outside Boston|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19271.html|12|ndxe199205| Large Triangular object just outside Boston<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way to visit a friend in Brighton (I lived in Allston at the time) when I noticed a fairly bright white light hovering near the tree line. At the time I was looking in the diection of Logan Airport so I didn&#39;t give it much thought.  For some reason though this light kept catching my eye. I reached the intersection of the street I lived on and rounded the corner all the while keeping my eye on it. it would slowly drift one direction, stop and drift back the other way. Something in the back of my mind told me to stop in my tracks and observe it (which I did) and it seemem to almost be taunting me with the way it moved. It&#39;s movements were subtle but most unusual in that it seemed to have no clear direction. Also of note was the fact that the light remained at a farly consatnt magnitude unlike the lights of say a circling helicopter would if one is standing still observing it. It almost seemed to be taunting me as if it knew I was observing it. I must have watched this thing for a solid ten minutes just playing &#34;peak a boo&#34; descending just below and ascending just above the tree line drifting left to right. As I watched A black sedan pulled up near me and one of the occupants asked what I was looking at. They were three middle aged men three in the front one riding shotgun. The man in the front passenger side asked what I was looking at. Before I could answer he flashed a badge and said he was a Boston undercover police officer and that people had been reporting UFO&#39;s in the Roxbury Blue Hills avenue area. My jaw dropped and I told them I was indeed watching something in the sky I couldn&#39;t explain. They asked me a couple more questions that I can vaguely recall and drove off. At that point I felt very unsettled and tried to relocate this object I had been viewing but it was gone. I continued walking down the street keeping my eyes glued to the Eastern horizon and saw nothing until I got to the next intersection. I saw an object flying very silently and very low directly twoards me and i rememb! er feeli ng how surreal it looked because it was somewhat hazy that night and I couldn&#39;t make out any detail only that it seemed awfully low and traveling awfully slow. My ears kept straining to hear engine sounds but I heard none. There were two people approaching me and it appeared to be directly over their heads. I asked them to stop and tell me what it was but one didn&#39;t even look up, and the other gave me the sarcastic reply &#34;UFO&#34; dude. I felt like I was in the twilight Zone. After they past me the craft approached my position and hovered directly over head. I was so surreal triangular in shape silent with a solid red light at the nose and yellow green and blue lights that blinked rhymithicaly counter clockwise. It was huge. The size of maybe the infield of a a baseball field. The thing seemed to have some type of light absorbing field around it like a halo. It hovered above me for what seemed like a minute. Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone else across the street and I shouted for him to look at it and tell me what it was. He was by a gas station and I realized from his vantage point he was looking almost directly into a street light. In the moment I asked him and released my gaze from the object it had completely vanished from sight. I could not fathom how something that big could move that fast but it was completly gone from view. It was almost as if it knew I was watching it.It seemed to leaze the air with an ozoney kind of electric charge like just after a thunderstorm.It was the most unusuall/unsettling thing I have ever experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

I had stopped briefly to check for traffic before I crossed a street that was a few blocks from the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was starting to cross the road, I became aware of a large triangular craft hovering silently just above the trees on the river bank.  The craft was a dull dark gray or black, about 50’ long and maybe 25-30’ wide.  I could not judge its width as well because of the flat angle at which I was viewing it, but I could clearly see that it had a triangular shape and a fairly thin profile.  After a few seconds, it faded out, as if it had dissolved into the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting, I was working in Carlsbad as a mental health professional.  I previously had been chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S., and had training in fire investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.

I cant confirm this is the exact date of my sighting. I had an inclination to see if anyone else saw what I saw in approximately the same time period. I surfed through the listings on this sight and was surprised to find a listing during the approximate time i was looking for. The description of the event was exactly the same as what i saw. I was coming home from a sports practice. I was about ten years old. There were three other people in the car including my mom. The practice was in acton and we saw the craft about ten minutes into the trip home to chelmsford. All of us joked about it being a ufo cause the trip took a by a small airport along the high way. It wasnt until we saw the craft moving in untraditional ways to a normal aircraft that we were a little taken back. The craft moved extremely fast and agile. It would pick up speeds that i had never seen in a normal aircraft and then instantly turn around the other direction... as if it didnt have to slow down to turn around. I realize helicopters have this capability basically, but there was no noise, and the speed and liquidness that the turn around was, could not have been a helicopter. This craft remained in view for at least a half hour all the way back to chelmsford center where we lost view of it. One specific thing about the craft is we could vaguely make out a trianular shape about it. Chelmsford is about 30 minutes north of boston.<n>
5/9/92 22:00|Cedar Rapids|IA|Triangle|10 minutes|Dark triangular object with light on "nose" and 3 underneath at the points.|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114865.html|16|ndxe199205| Dark triangular object with light on &amp;quot;nose&amp;quot; and 3 underneath at the points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not exactly sure of the date, but this is a reasonable guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I worked every other Saturday night and I was going downtown into work traveling east on 16th avenue.  As I drove down the road, in the distance I saw what I thought were spotlights from a sale of some kind, yet they were facing toward my direction.  As I got closer I noticed it was one bright light and there was an object.  There is a stoplight at the intersection of 16th Ave and 18th Street.  The object was on the west side of 18th street (41.962633,-91.696363).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess approximately 40 feet in the air was a dark triangular object with the light on the end facing west (I was traveling toward it).  As I was stopped at the stoplight there were others around, but I can’t say if anyone saw it, but it could not be missed.  I rolled down my window and it was not making any sound and was not moving.  There were three less bright lights underneath at each “point” of the triangle.  The edges were slightly rounded. I could not see any detail beyond the dark shape and the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove on as the light turned green watching it in my rearview mirror. It did not move.  I wish now I would have stopped and waited to see what it would do, but I had only been at my job for a few years.  It was also an odd excuse to be late in a production environment.  I arrived to work approximately 15 minutes later and told a few people, who responded with joking, and then called my girlfriend at the time.  I asked her to go down the road as it was not far from my apartment and see if it was still there.  I called her back after a little while and she said she did not see anything, so it was have been gone approximately 30-45 minutes after I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I thought it was an odd shape, but later I saw the reports from the Belgian Air Force and the Illinois Police sighting and it was very similar. My friends know that I am open minded and have an interest in this.  I would never fake information as it does nothing to help people be objective on this subject. I also never thought something like this would happen to me. As I tell people now - it was truly an unidentified flying object. I won’t say it was definitely extraterrestrial, though I’m not saying it wasn’t.  It could be of earthly but unknown origin, but it was something that I have never seen or heard reports of other than in the context of other UFO reports; even to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s funny that when something like this happens, you are just incredulous. I can see how more people don’t make better notes or document better as the reality of it does not hit you until later and then it’s too late, and I’m someone who should have known better or accepted the consequences of being late for work.<n>

It was going at an incredible speed and it was less than a mile away. It looked like it hit the ocean but it was night so I can&#39;t really confirm if it did or not. Once the object made its way to the ocean&#39;s surface, it disapeared, so my guess is that it went underwater.The date I gave above was approximate. I could have been a couple years before or after.<n>

One morning, I had to call in sick but because I was ill and was barely awake at 4:30 AM, I mis-dialed the number (which I have forgotten since then). What I heard on the phone shocked and confused me. It was a pre-recorded female voice sayin something like &#34;Please enter your star classification code and your password and a UFO destruction team will be out to your site immediately.&#34; I cannot remember exactly now but I&#39;m sure it was very close to that. To be sure I wasn&#39;t hearing wrong I re-dialed the number and got the same message. Later that morning, I dialed the number so my brother could hear it and again so my mom could hear it. Sure enuff they heard the same thing. How odd. One might think it was someone&#39;s answering machine but it sounded too clear and there was no mention of leaving a message at the beep. A prank maybe? Who could have known I&#39;d call in sick to work at 4:30 AM? I&#39;m almost sure that message was legit. I&#39;ve been wondering since if anyone else has had this or a similar experience. Please e-mail me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

No sound. I thought they could be some kind of vessel&#39;s navigation lights but there would be no vessels out there due to the known hazard of navigating where we were at night.  They appeared to be moving slowly back and forth past each other and alternating from green to white every few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This made me think they were not navigation lights since they would be green and red if they were (not green and white).  Also, navigation lights do not alternate color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to take quite extensive video of this event which went on for 1/2 hour or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They eventually moved off and dissappeared behind an island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am searching for this video in my storage and would like for someone to look at it and give me their opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My daughter looked at it and asked me what it was.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  Just then a second craft flew in at such a great speed and stopped instantly next to the one we were looking at.  There was a brief pause and then they both shot off and were gone just as quickly as they came.  I never reported the incident to anyone other than family members because I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe what we saw that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

These windows had a view of an inlet (Penn Cove) which is in coupeville. As I was looking out of the windows an orange/red globe shaped object appeared over the trees on the other side of the inlet. It was approaching at a fairly rapid speed. I can&#39;t estimate the elevation but it didn&#39;t appear to me to that high. It appeared as large as the moon in the sky. It was quite bright but not painful to look at. The light appeared to look like some kind of plasma or liquid light. Trailing behind were three rings which decreased in size the farther they where from the ufo. The rings were barely perceptible and shimmered. The rings always maintained their their absolute distance from the ball and from one another. I want to stress that these rings were very faint. I barely noticed them. The object itself had a very sharp outline despite being extremely bright. It cat a glow on the water as it passed over the cove. I called to the woman I was staying with (she was in the bathroom) The object was on a trajectory directly over the house and I ran out the front door in time to see it go directly overhead and disappear from view due to the pine trees. There was no sound. My host didn&#39;t see it and was quite skeptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
