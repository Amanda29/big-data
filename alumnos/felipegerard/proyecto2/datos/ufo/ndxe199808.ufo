8/31/98 22:00|Tucson|AZ|Unknown|60 seconds|Pair of objects flying side by side.|11/1/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04117.html|1|ndxe199808| Pair of objects flying side by side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son (10 years old) and I were driving to our hotel in Tucson after dinner out with some friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw two objects flying toward us from the SW (moving NE).  Objects were side by side with a single light on either end (?) front &amp; back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moving slowly toward us, they came to a stop and one of the objects just sort of pivoted it&#39;s front end out to the side, heading E and started moving again.  The second object did the same and they continued one behind the other to the E.  We stopped the car when we first saw them because they looked so strange and we were on a secluded dirt road.  There was no noticeable engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I live very near an active MCAS in So Cal and we are very accustomed to seeing military craft.  We have also been to Tucson several dozen times in the last few years and we have become very familiar with the military aircraft at the Davis-Monthan Air Station in Tucson.  My son can identify most any military jet with only a slight glance - he loves them!  But these had him stumped and spooked.  We watched them for about a minute as they disappeared off into the eastern sky.  The way they turned was not at all like any aircraft we have observed.  There was no banking involved.  They just stopped and one of them slid out to the side, started moving E and the other followed with exactly the same kind of pivoting turn.<n>

It was very much like a disk or saucer shape, only thinner, and at each end it appeared to fork outwards into two distinct lines. I will try and send a drawing - I&#39;m not sure how well that description will be understood. They were both of a light red colour and I&#39;ve never seen anything move as smoothly as they seemed to. As I said they were orbiting around each other - first one would spin in a small circle while the other orbited around it and then they would switch places. They traded places every minute or so. The larger orbit was being made more slowly and the smaller being made more quickly, as is true of all orbits I think. After about ten minutes they stopped fairly rapidly, pausing for a moment and then flew away in one direction at a rather surprisingly slow speed. I don&#39;t know what else to write about it except that it was the first time I had personally ever seen a ufo.<n>

It was right above the palm trees.  We saw no shape of the craft, it was really dark that night,  with no moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely silent and still. I looked around, and the lights had lit up the street like a baseball field in the area around us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then went vertical, and went back into the blackness of the sky.

Rd. 810, I observed a very large flash of yellow lights in a diamond shape sequence, immediately following this flash was a blast of what appeared to be fire from the rear.  I saw no &#34;shape&#34;, just these flashes, and the flame.  The night was rather clear, with no clouds.  The object appeared to be flying in a downward motion.  I recall thinking that if it continued to fly in this manner, it appeared as if it would land in Hidden Acres Campgrounds.  I observed this phenomenon 5 times before turning onto Twp. Rd. 810, and immediately onto the private drive.  I was still watching this through the trees, and saw it flash and fire 3 more times.  I parked my car, and got out to see if I could see it better.  When I did so, it was gone. If comparing these yellow lights, if a star would appear as a . (period), then these lights appeared to be o (a lower case o).  There appeared to be 4 seperate lights, but all flashed together. The &#34;fire&#34; from the end of it was even larger. I would compare the width of it from a small &#34;o&#34; to a capital &#34;O&#34;. And the length of it was 4 times more. The lights were yellow, reminding me of caution lights, the flame, was first in line was blue, and then orange, and then red, but all together. Very similar to what a jet engine looks like when it takes off and the flame shoots out the back of the engine.

It appeared to be a star, but there was too much light for any stars to be seen. We grabbed a telescope, and focused it on the object in the sky. It was a diamond shape, with 4 bright lights. The object seemd stationary, but would twist around. The profile was very slim, almost cigar shaped. As it spun around, the light seemed to  change from four to three. We then noticed another one to the left of it, and then 15 minutes later, we noticed a third. They were visible to the naked eye, but were very difficult to keep focussed on.<n>

UFO encounter. But I was not able to get the all the information they needed. I will give you the just of it, I was 12 years of age and I had a older cousin in the Canadian military and at the time (1982) he was stationed at the Cold lake military complex in Cold lake, Alberta, Canada. I was 11 years old we (me and my family) drove from Edmonton to Cold lake to visit my cousin (he has been there for a good amount of time like 2-3 years) we went to the base and he then gave us a tour and some time into the tour he took me (only me) we went throw some hangers and hall ways and then into a space between 2 hangers and he lifted me up to have a look into a window into a hanger and what I saw was an image that will never fade away form my mind ever! What I saw was 3 objects one was a disk silver grey and seamless the size was as long as a city bus round the 2nd was a cigar shape and silver grey and seamless the size was as long as a city bus the 3rd I did not see very well. The thing that Chris and Stanton ask me was to get my cousin to come forward with this information. I did talk with him on this subject and he says &#34;he does not remember.&#34;  And that&#39;s were it ended. As for my second encounter I was traveling north from Calgary to Edmonton in the summer of 1998 the time was 10:42pm or 10:45pm. And in the sky I saw what I thought was a very bright falling star, well I never seen a star do this   It was traveling (slow) southeast leaving a long white trial and if I was holding a ruler in my hand at arms length it measures 7&#34; to 7.5&#34;; long the trail remand in the sky for 20 to 25 seconds  It stopped for about 15 to 20 seconds and then shot (very very fast) off in a 90º angle north east leaving a bright red trail the red trail did not stay long only for 3 to 5 seconds. Thank-you for reading this if you have any ideas who can maybe help me with this? Give me a email.<n>

It was after dark and we were getting ready to sleep. I saw what I thought was a plane and paid little notice to it as it flew above us. When it was a more or less directly over us it had changed direction by about a full 90 degrees. That was what surprised us. The object had three lights in the dark sky it looked triangular, and the lights were not flashing, just white lights. It was very high up. As far as the sound it made, a very low humm. There were no other planes in the sky. Both my friend and I were convinced that is was not a sea plane. It moved from directly above us to the horizon, a distance of about 25 km in less than a minute if that is a significant detail. I have no reason to lie, and in fact, since the sighting have been avidly seeking information to confirm my skeptisism as to weather this is a ligit sighting or a common aircraft. thank you.<n>

Seen from my position: looking to the SE horizon, at 130 degrees heading. Appears to hit the ground behind the hills, as three explosions light up sky. Drawing a line on the map from Frances,WA at 130 deg. comes close to Longview,WA. I just wonder if anybody else saw it, and if it hit the ground near any populated areas. ?<n>

8/28/98 19:00|West Islip|NY|Other|5 minutes|Large black boomerang low to ground near my house|1/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86783.html|10|ndxe199808| large black boomerang low to ground near my house<n> <n><n> <n><n> My closest enounter was at my old house in West Islip on long Island by rte 231. We lived along a backwater area full of trees that separated us from rte 231.  My wife, two kids, and I saw a black boomerang shaped craft move northward, silently in a very controlled straight line just along the tree tops at about as fast as a person would walk, actually caressing the tree tops on the eastern side of 231. It was still light out though heading into twilight. It then stopped about 40 feet from our house (just on the other side of the adjacent street) and hovered motionless for maybe 2 minutes, like it was parked. We watched it from our back porch.  I have 20 20 vision, and could see that there were fairly sharp angled surfaces that appeared to have a rough surface similar to velcro. This much reminded me of some known stealth technology, however there was no sign of any means of propulsion. It was about 40 or 50 feet across (wingspan) and about only 4 feet in heig! ht, not high enough for someone to stand, or hardly even sit - if it were manned a person would probably have to be lying down. I was trying to image how it was being flown.  Maybe it was unmanned?  There were no motors and no jets, no sound or light coming from it. It was all black. I told my wife to run in and get the video camera, and as she went in, it moved straight upward several thousand feet within a minute or two, by the time she returned. We turned on the video camera and captured about 30 seconds of video before the battery died, but by then it was thousands of feet up and it looks like some little black boomerang in the sky (and as a jet liner files past it, probably a few thousand feet above it, it flexed one of its wings while the other remained more or less stationary). Then it kept rising until it was out of sight. Having seen it up close I know it was not a balloon or some inflated thing, though it was apparently flexible to some extent. It was quite solid ap! pearing when close up. My 7 year old son actually exclaimed &#34;m! aybe the re are aliens inside!&#34;. I laughed a little nervously said, &#34;maybe, who knows?&#34;. At first I thought it might be one of ours, but I didn&#39;t think it would be very typical for a top secret ultra high tech craft to be flying around close to the ground in a residential neighborhood? Unfortunately I don&#39;t still have my video - I gave it to a friend where I used to work who was a &#39;ufo enthusiast&#39; and who told me he had seen many ufos while living in Arizona as a kid. He had told me he had seen many spherical colored objects flying over their neighborhood at several thousand feet in broad daylight, often being chased by jets (in the 60s?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Then he said &#34;man, that bird is really high!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that I looked up to see a triangular craft moving S.E. at a very high rate of speed.  The object was between layers of Cirrus and Altostratus clouds, or between 8,000 and 15,000 feet.  It moved in a straight line from directly overhead to beyond the horizon in approximately 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A commercial airliner passed by at about the same altitude (using the couds as reference) a few minutes later, which helped to verify our altitude estimates and moved like a slug relative to the speedy object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain that we are visited, but more certain that most sightings (like this one) are military craft.

8/28/98 05:45|Mobile|AL|Light|approx. 1 minute|A string of what appeared to be about a dozen streetlights, but obviously were NOT. (Mobile, AL)|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54348.html|12|ndxe199808| A string of what appeared to be about a dozen streetlights, but obviously were NOT. (Mobile, AL)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south down Rangeline Rd. about 20 minutes before sunrise, while the sky was still dark. As I was approaching the intersection at Hamilton Blvd., I had the window rolled down, enjoying the wind and casually gazing out at the landscape (due south, in the direction of Dauphin Island Parkway) as I was still about three blocks before the traffic light. It was as if they were purposely camouflaged as street lights, because I didn&#39;t even notice them at first. But then the last one at the end of the line, down closest to the intersection, appeared to be glowing about three times brighter than the others. As I focused directly on them at that point, I realized there weren&#39;t even any light poles along the road (it&#39;s a rural area), and these lights were actually a quarter to a half mile away. There was traffic both in front of and behind me, so I had to watch the road as I approached the intersection, and unfortunately, the traffic signal was green when I came to it, so I couldn&#39;t stop and stare. But I took one last lengthy gaze at that brightest one as I was rounding the street corner. There was a small clearing through the trees, and I got an excellent, last-second look at it as it had grown so intensely bright that it actually looked like a little sun in the distance. It had short rays of light shining from it it was so bright, with two prominent rays at each side, in the three o&#39;clock and nine o&#39;clock positions (edges of a disc?) Just as the trees were about to block my view, with amazingly synchronized timing, it suddenly faded to black, like a bright yard light going out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unlike most people who get excited when they only THINK they&#39;ve seen a UFO, my initial reaction to this was denial, and I&#39;m an open-minded person. Yet, it bothered me all day long at work that day, and then when I got off work at 2:30 PM, I looked out there in broad daylight, searching the skyline for any evidence of any kind of structure these lights would have been attached to, and there was nothing but trees. So I decided that, if they were anything that was supposed to be there, then they would be there again on the following morning. They were never there again. Except for that intensely glowing one at the end of the string, they all appeared about the size and color (yellowish) of streetlights, and they were the appropriate height and spaced apart like streetlights would be, so that nobody would have ever noticed unless they were paying as much attention as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another weird anomaly: when I got home that evening, I decided to do a web search and see if there were any UFO reports of craft similar to what I saw. Not even really expecting to find anything, I learned for the first time about Bob Lazar and his alleged back-engineering work at the secret base called S4, near Area 51. The site I found that evening is boblazar.com, and in the tape-transcripts section, I saw where Lazar says they &#34;glow&#34; at night, with the &#34;sodium yellow color&#34; of &#34;streetlights.&#34; He explains that they can actually warp space and disappear, so as you can imagine, I was even more stunned as I read this than I was when I first saw it in the sky for real that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were over minneapolis.  The object was perfectly round and just sitting out there. It seemed to glow sporadically on one side.  The lights went from bright white, to a greenish and a very faint orange.  I observed it for about a minute but as we began our decent down through the clouds I lost sight of it.  I did not tell anybody, and I dont believe anybody on the northwest flight saw it (as they were asleep)  but I dont see how the pilots could miss it.  I was the observer, I&#39;m a visual effects artist in motion pictures, and a follower of ufo&#39;s, crop circles and the paranormal.<n>

It then almost stopped and began falling as if like a leaf falls, disappearing behind tress and houses in the east. Then from the area where I last saw it (after about 2 minutes elapsed) a streak of light appeared across the sky and disappeared in the western horizon. Then 2 minutes later a streak appeared from the northern horizon to the southern horizon, like the one before but opposite direction. The streaks were like something that moved across the entire visible sky at outrageous speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my back yard looking at jupiter at 2:15 am on 08/28/98. I was facing the east when something caght my eye. That something was floating out from behind some trees to the south and was approximately 60-70 degrees from the eastern horizon when it started drifting and falling as if like a leaf falls, until it disappeared behind some haouse and trees. This object was completely round and not as bright as jupiter although it was 5-6 times the size of jupiter and approximately 1.5 miles away. It was a yelowish green orange color. After 2 minutes had elapsed something went very fast from the eastern horizon to the western horizon in a split second. Then 2 minutes later something streaked very fast from the northern horizon to the southern horizon. These streaks were the same spherical object that I had seen before, although I can not say for sure because it was moving too fast to decipher. I have seen meteors, bolides, satelites, and Iridium flares of all kinds . I had never seen anything like this before.<n>

Traveled slowly at about 30 degrees across the southern sky toward the east. No sound, long tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on the shoreline of Lake Erie. My girlfriend and I are police officers and both work the night shift.  We both are very enthusiastic about the night sky and were about to use my telescope on this date. It was an unusual night right from the beginning.  At about 2400 hrs. we both observed a spectacular display of the Northern Lights all along the length of the Lake.  That is unusual here. It lasted approximately 20 minutes.  Shortly thereafter, we went back to the telescope and were observing Jupiter and Saturn.  At approx. 0130 hrs. we were both startled by a Large Orange Fireball that appeared in the SW sky.  It traveled very slowly in a straight path at approx. 30 degrees to the southern horizon toward the SE.  The object had a very long tail which was also Bright Orange.  We did witness any sound.  It is very quiet here also.  It was difficult to say how far away it was. Although, it didn&#39;t appear to be very far away.  we viewed it until we lost it in the horizon....it didn&#39;t appear to burn up. We both have seen many things in the night sky before from many types of meteorites to having seen sattelites return to earth.  but have not seen anything like this. I probably would not have reported this if I hadn&#39;t heard of so many similiar sights on your appearance on the Art Bell Program the other night. Another funny thing happened that morning.  I had to appear in court that morning and drove my truck.  It is newer with the digital compass in the rearview mirror. I noticed that the directional indicator was off during the trip both to and from court.  It was approximately 45 degrees off from the reading that it should have been giving.  It has not done that since that date.<n>

My back yard is rather deep and is backed by a large wooded nature center. All of a sudden a Large Green Fireball appeared from the west and headed out of my sight to the east (Lost it in the tree line). It was about the size of your thumb at arms length. What struck me as strange was the green color and almost sparkler like quality of it. It didnt move as fast as other shooting stars Ive seen. I had it in view for about 5 seconds. I called for my wife to come see it, but she was too late. I scanned the papers and watched the news for the next couple of days, but no one reported anything.<n>

The objects seemed to hover at one point(near a plant called UTDC-paint trains etc) then moving away at high speeds(together).They seemed to be diamond shape from what we could tell in the darkness, and in the centre of the bottom was a light thats&#39; color is hard to describe. Sort of orange purple and blue mix(not separate lights), we tried to get under it but at this point they were travelling at speeds higher than 100 miles an hr(because thats how fast we were going).<n>
8/25/98 14:00|Winnipeg (Canada)|MB|Sphere|30 min|4 witness daytime sighting of metallic rotating ball at Winnipeg international air show.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42792.html|20|ndxe199808| 4 witness daytime sighting of metallic rotating ball at Winnipeg international air show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Metallic Ball at WPG air show  The date given is my best guess the year could have been +or- 1.  II could obtain the exact year from old friend who lived at address, but if anyone wants to check into it further it was on the first or second Day of the Winnipeg international air show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Brother, a friend and myself were watching the air show from another friend’s balcony. It was the top floor (14th?) facing east. I was on the balcony having a smoke and watching the &#34;Snow birds&#34; do there routine. They broke formation and one flew past the apartment (approx height and distance to follow).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it did I caught sight of what looked like a metal flake that came off the plane. (This was not in the area prior to the plane passing by)   After watching it for about 4 seconds it became very apparent to me that this was not a piece of the plane. It was round like a beach ball (refer to following beach ball description) 6 feet in diameter and very shiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no light except for its metallic reflection. Picture one of those beach balls that is divided into 8 different colored sections, now remove 3 of them. The larger side (5 slices) was bright polished metallic in color. The 3 missing sections were just that, missing and you could see the inside of the shiny side, which appeared dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled for everyone to &#34;get out here and see this thing before its gone&#34; they came out expecting to see some part of the air show, but all had the same &#34;what the H@#l is that&#34; reaction I did. It was aprox 500&#39; or more off the ground (snow birds might be able to provide better distances) and about 1000-1500&#39; (3 or 4 residential blocks) away. It was very clear what we were seeing, the sky was blue, only a few nimbus clouds and a moderate wind (20 kmh? could check airport weather for exact info)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It rotated consistently about 1 per second giving it a pulsating look. It remand fixed at that point in the sky for about 2 minutes, then began to move straight up over the course of 20 to 30 min (still rotating) completely unaffected by the air currents that day. We watched it until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to include here that myself and one of my friends both saw what looked like 2 specs (very high altitude approximately 5 min prior to losing sight) These specs moved very fast side by side formation from the SE to NW as they passed the &#34;ball&#34; they made some sporadic movements then continued NW and out of sight over the apartment we were in. (It is very possible that the specs were a trick of the eye from looking up at the blue for so long however we both saw them around the same time do similar motions)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure that more must have seen this as thousands were watching the air show that day and the plane I was watching would have led others to look in that direction not to mention the pilot himself might have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will include here the areas of the city I am referring to but If necessary can be removed. We were located in the ((apartment name deleted)) east phase ((floor deleted)) floor. The object would have been over Thompson Dr between Portage and Ness ave. (1 or 2 block radius but possible further out)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane was moving in a NW to SE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel this sighting must be looked at closer (daytime sighting, with the possibility of multiple witnesses, in multiple locations.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have included legitimate contact information. Please get in touch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Drawings and maps can be provided if requested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/25/98 02:00|Pebble Beach|CA|Unknown|10 minutes|Unsual light seen throughout house late at night.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60825.html|22|ndxe199808| Unsual light seen throughout house late at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and two young children and their grandmother all lived in a two story home in a very dark and thickly wooded private community in Northern California in August of 1998.  There are no street lights in this area and the nights are incredibly dark. The house lots are huge and far apart and across the street from us was a huge undeveloped tract of Pine forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2:AM on this absolutely calm and relatively warm summer evening I was awakened by the brightest blue-white light I have ever seen. I was sleeping in my own upstairs bedroom and my wife was in another next door one and my two children in their own rooms as well. Grandma was downstairs in her own bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My door to the upstairs hallway, which had windows facing out to the woods across the street, was open.  My room was so immersed in this blue-white light coming in from this wooded area direction that it was blinding. I had to actually shade my eyes.  I was very groggy when I first awoke so I was just befuddled as to what this light could be.  It took me several seconds to wake up. When I became fully awake I studied the light with incredible amazement and curiosity. It was illuminating the entire inside of our house!  I didn&#39;t know a light could be this bright.  It was like one of those six foot wide &#34;Hollywood Premier&#34; night-beam-in-the-sky lights were being shined right onto and into our house!  This light was steady and unwavering. It had a cool, unearthly, blue-white glow to it. Almost like a welders torch glow but no wavering and flashing at all like a real welders torch would have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unnerved and my mind came up with a &#34;safe&#34; scenario that there must be emergency vehicles outside our house and every one of their lights were being shined on our house and lighting it up on the inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then I listened and I couldn&#39;t hear one sound outside.  No voices or engines running.  Then I got a little scared.  I just couldn&#39;t get up and look outside to see what was directly making this light.  It was a strange &#34;sense&#34; of apprehension and fear. I actually felt cowardly for not doing so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then, two minutes after this light first lit up our house I heard my wife in the bedroom next to mine shout out &#34; what the heck is that light?&#34;  Her door to the windowed hallway was closed, and still the light was so bright it woke her up as well.  Unlike me she &#34;bravely&#34; got up and as soon as her hand touched the hallway door knob to open it the incredible light blinked out.  And as soon as it did...every electrical appliance including the humming refigerator, clocks and clock-radios in the house went out too.  We tried the lights, nothing worked.  My wife staggered into my room and sat on my bed. Like me, she was shaken and said she had never seen anything so bright in her life.   We called the gated community 24 hour security guard house about 1/4 to 1/2 miles away as the phone did work and they reported no outages or calls about anything unusual like people&#39;s electricity being out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there pondering another couple of minutes and all of a sudden the lights and power in our house just blinked back on !  It was all so strange we just sat there silent and dumbfounded.  Eventually we got up and walked down to our children&#39;s bedrooms and took a quick non-entering look inside and they seemed asleep and fine so we just went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning my wife and I got up and she started making an eggs and bacon breakfast for us all.  Not long afterwards our 13 year old son came slowly walking down the stairs.  I didn&#39;t look up but said &#34;good morning&#34; as you could hear him coming down the stairs.  He kind of moaned in response and said &#34; ohhh, I must have had the worst nose bleed of my life last night.&#34;  We looked up and the front of his T-shirt was partially stained in blood and he had dried blood underneath his nose and down his cheek and chin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I immediately walked over to comfort him and then we went upstairs to his room.  His pillow was fairly well splattered with dried blood also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day we don&#39;t have a clue as to what happened that summer evening. But the events I am describing happened exactly the way I say they did.  Our son seemed okay after this and I don&#39;t recall him ever getting another nose bleed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But that light.  I still don&#39;t know how anything could light up the &#34;inside&#34; of a house like that with absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was this a UFO event?  I can&#39;t say it was becuase I didn&#39;t see anything but the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, it certainly was a U.L.E.  &#34;Unidentified Light Event.&#34;  And it reminded me of the movie &#34;Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was during the third quarter and the Redskins were scoring a touchdown so everyone&#39;s attention was focused on the field. I noticed an object out of the corner of my eye and looked up. I saw an object briefly cross upper rim of the stadium. It was dark and diamond shaped with definite edges, but seemed flexible. I had the impression I was looking at a manta ray. On each corner of the object was a very dim light. Object made no noise at all and moved in a manner that could not have been a balloon. The object rose above the rim of the stadium, hovered briefly and then shot off.<n>

In the distance, red warning lights are visible on radio towers. Because I could see the distant red warning lights, this red light caught my attention.

I observed a white lit object to my 10 o&#39;clock about two blocks vertically and horizonally away and couldn&#39;t make out a shape. It stayed in position so I figured a helicopter at first but there was no blinking lights. I remembered from Unsolved Mysteries someone used thier mind to communicate with an unknown being in the woods so I gave it a try.&#34;Hello&#34; with my mind and to my amazement it turned bright purple. I wasn&#39;t afraid so next I tried this with my mind &#34;can I go for a ride and check out your home&#34; I received no communication back &#34;please intervene with our government their out of touch and let me be in control or be prime minister between our species&#34; no message received back to me. &#34; Move side to side&#34; it moved side to side &#34;up and down&#34; it moved up and down &#34; do figure eights&#34; it moved in figure eights at this point I wanted to go outside but was afraid of getting burned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, I wanted to see its power so I used my mind to communicate &#34;fly over my house as fast as you can&#34; while thinking of the direction it should take from the back to front of my house. It disappears in front of my eyes and seconds later it goes over my house from my 6 o&#39;clock to 12 o&#39;clock in a split second the neighborhood lights up brighter than day time for that split second while a streched boomerrang shape don&#39;t remember if it was still purple, goes towards Hartford from the speed. It was so close to my roof I heard a whamp sound which was heard after it passed over and felt like the roof was about to be torn off from the house cause of this objects energy. I told myself this was the coolest thing that ever happened to me and laid in bed just thinking about what just happened. Ten minutes later the sun started coming up and went to the porch to have a smoke and my brother ! who seen nothing was there for the past minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Looking through binoculars, another male 65 years old, sighted small lights below the planet.  A female 64 yrs old sighted three lights in a horizontal configuration, moving from south to north with a brilliant halogen-type beam coming down from above the three lights.  A fourth light came into view on the left, as if something were rotating.  Another female, 65, saw the lights through binoculars.  The lights seemed to be at approximately 20,000 ft.  The observers had been playing bridge in a mountain cabin, drinking only coffee; first observer had stepped outside for a breath of cool air, then called the others to come and see &#34;the bright light in the sky.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four observers are retired from their professional fields: a teacher, a writer, a photographic processing lab owner, and a printing company owner.  The first to notice the &#34;bright light&#34; was able to see it with the naked eye.  The other three observers needed the binoculars to see the detail of three lights in a row.  One of the observers noticed that as the lights approached, a bright halogen-type beam of light seemed to be aimed down at the earth below from a point just above the three lights.  As the lights approached very high in the sky (approx. 20,000 ft) they seemed to move sideways several times as the binoculars moved...as though the lights and observer were somehow interacting.  This &#34;interaction&#34; was very brief---perhaps 20 seconds---and then the lights were gone.  Afterwards, all four observers talked about what they had seen.  The teacher saw something but felt the binoculars were too unsteady to say what she saw.  The retired owner of a printing company was the first to see the thrr horizontal lights, first with the naked eye, then with the binoculars.  The writer saw the lights approach and then the halogen-type spotlight, and then a fourth light appearing on the left of the other three, as though rotating into view.  The photo lab owner saw the horizontal lights but later decided they were just reflections on the lenses from two distant lights that illuminate the driveway in this otherwise pitch-black mountain setting in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  All four of us tried to duplicate the lights in the binoculars to see if they were indeed reflections, to no avail---the phenomenon couldn&#39;t be duplicated.<n>

I&#39;ve watched satellites and meteor showers. This moved MUCH faster. It was a constant white light with a brightness greater than any star or planet. It moved from the WSW horizon to the NE horizon in a straight line(arc). Like the gentleman in Longmont, I thought I was imagining it. I couldn&#39;t believe its speed, and replayed it in my mind several times to get a grasp on the speed at which it must have moved.I still think it&#39;s possible it might have been a low orit satellite since sunset was only a couple of hours before the event. I took a photograph of star trails that night in a 2 hour exposure. Unfortunately the shutter was not open during this event.<n>

They were about the size of a half dollar at an arm&#39;s length.  Intensity was a little more than a street light.  I was heading to my girlfriends house and I had to turn eastbound.  So I repedidly stuck my head out my window to look back at the lights which appeared to slowly be moving up the sky.  After doing this for about 5 mins I looked back again and the lights were gone.  I arrived at my girlfriend&#39;s house to find her with her neighbors on the back porch who had been watching the same thing.  They claimed that the lights were swaying as they moved up the sky and 2 of them looked like they exploded and there were bright white sparks when this happened.  The rest of the lights then slowly faded out.  There were 6 witnesses in all, me, my girlfriend, her sister, and three neighbors.  There did also seem to be a large number of aircraft in the sky that night and I couldnt tell but some of them may had been heading towards the lights.<n>

At one point I awoke at about 2 am, my freind was driving and we pulled off the hiway to get gas, use restrooms and switch shifts. At some point we noticed a crunching sound on the road and when we pulled in to the fuel station it became apparent that there was a real swarm of crickets. Regular, large, healthy black crickets-everywhere. There were so many they were in the toilets and sinks, unavoidable and hopping everywhere. Strange. We thought. That is until we got back on the hiway. I had taken over driving. It was a pitch black night, in a seemingly unpopulated area. After looking at a map I&#39;m sure it was somewhere between Madera and Manteca. As soon as we re-entered the hiway my peripheral vision noticed movement to the left, right out over a grassy area next to the hiway. As soon as I looked over, my freind noticed as well. I beleive she said with puzzlement something to the effect of &#39;what the hell is that?&#39; At first glance it appeared as though it was connected to the ground and moving slowly north-the same as us. The reason it looked that way is because I&#39;ve never seen anything in the air ever move that slow, except birds, helicopters, and maybe a ferris wheel. Plus it was seemingly vertically arranged. The only thing visible was a bright whitish/yellowish light on top and bottom,and three triangularly arranged bluish,reddish, and orangish lights placed equidistant between top and bottom. We estimate the total height to be 15-30 feet, probably closer to 30. Right after we noticed it, it was going the same speed as us, then it accelerated with ease straight down along the west side of the hiway going north. At this point I said,&#39;That is definitely not an airplane&#39; This thing was so, so strange I felt an instant and major upwelling of fear, apprehension, curiosity. As we continued watching it almost reached a hiway overpass and smoothly, quickly and deliberately crossed the hiway and turned 90 degrees to the south.I felt like it was very aware of the fact that we were watching it.

It manuevered when it was overhead.the best way to describe the manuever was to say it appeared to &#39;slip sideways&#39;off of its path then immediately resumed its original flight pattern.It glowed with a faint silver pink color,and was totally silent in operation. It appeared to loosely follow the I-5 freeway. we are located just to the east of the I-5. There is also an airport 3-4 miles southwest of our location. this was definitely not a conventional aircraft.<n>

We watched it travel from the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada mountians over the crest and beyond to the west, then it seemed to drastically change direction, dropping below the horizon, which for us wast the sierra crest.  All this took place in about 10 seconds, Approximatly 40 miles.  The craft traveled at an altitude of about 20-25 thousand feet above sea level, estimating, and accounting for our 11 thousand foot camp.  It appearead as rectangluar from our perspective, we had a somewhat side view of it, for it traveled to our north by a few miles.  It pulsed with light originating from it&#39;s core.  It also appeared to have a glowing distrotion field around it, the atmosphere around it appeared to be bent like a teardrop around it, bending light and glowing as well, a blue/greenish hue.  It made no sound, not even a sonic boom, which I would expect from something traveling at such a high rate of speed.  I never thought to report the even but stumbling across this site has made doing just that quite easy.  All my statements are true, all times, and distances are approximations.  As far as I am aware My cousin and I are the only people to have seen the event, we were backpacking and were in a remote location, camping on a lake in the southern Bishop Creek Basin outside of Bishop California.  If we haden&#39;t happened to be looking at the sky right at that moment we would have easly missed it.<n>

These lights were seen &amp; reported From Macomb, Il. to Hannibal, Mo. The Air National Guard unit reported that there was no millitary activity in the area. On 8/22/98 a black unmarked helicoptor landed at our fairgrounds and remained for most of the day. These sightings lasted for 6 consecutive nights, with good footage shot by KHQA TV channel 7 in Quincy, Il. After the news report the Air National Guard reported that what had been witnessed was after burners of their fighter aircraft. On 9/12/98 at approx. 21:15 hrs. I witnessed 1 large ball of light in the northern sky at approx. 30 degrees above the horizon. This ball of light split into 2 balls. The 2nd ball traveled to the west and stopped staying paralel with the first. The second ball started moving up and down rapidly and then traveled back to join the first. As the two joined back together they seemed to implode into nothing. This activity lasted approx. 5 minutes from start to finish. I shut off my car and got out to witness this event, and there was not a sound.<n>

I drew picture of the ship at 0838 the next morning, and asked husband if he saw this and showed him the picture.  He answered: No (had no memory of said sighting).  This was not a dream.

She was looking at the aircraft lights and the light I was talking about but not beleiving me.  It then done a back loop to go behind the aircraft and endup directly underneath the aircraft.  With that my wife became upset and begged me to stop watching and forget about the whole thing.  I was able to observe the light tagging along with the aircraft for about another minute before my view was obscured by buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went for a walk on the beach around 10:30pm with my cousin ((name deleted)). The ocean was on our left side, and ahead of us about 300&#39; was a 200&#39; high cliffwall with a light house on top. It was very dark that night. As we were walking towards the cliff we saw a little white light flyng slowly in our direction above the light house. We stopped to watch it, as it was about to fly over our heads. It stopped directly above us. It started to grow larger and larger. It grew to be very large and had tiny beams of light around the edges, kind of like a star. I could not tell how large it was, but it was probably about 200&#39; to 300&#39; feet above our heads. I thought it might be coming down to land. My cousin and I were very freaked out and we started walking  away very quickly. As we were walking away, the white light started getting smalled and moving higher up in the night sky. It got so small that we could barely see it. It then zipped off into space very quickly and disappeared. Its seems strange to me now, how the UFO left as soon as I started panicking and getting scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was 23, male, American; others were early 20&#39;s Scottish and Canadian, both male.  Other witnesses had been smoking hash, I was completely sober.  We were on the roof of the hotel watching a meteor shower.  There was a (wedding?) party a few blocks away from us with big flood lights that were periodically blowing out all the lights in our section of the town, and there were few street lights.  While I/we were looking up, the object flew directly over us, and I watched it travel from almost directly over us where I first noticed it to the horizon. With no reference objects in the sky I can only guess at the size and speed.  If I held my hand above me at arm&#39;s length my thumbnail would have almost covered it. It took 5-6 seconds to travel about 60 degrees across my field of vision.  It seemed much lower than the stars, and I could clearly see the edges, so my guess is it was between the size of a single prop plane and an airliner, flying at about 10,000 feet (higher than a prop plane but much lower than an airliner).  The shape was perfectly geometric: draw a circle, cut it in half, then remove two half circles with the &#34;corners&#34; touching from the straight line where the original cut was made and that would be the exact shape.  The result if you were drawing it should be something like a rounded boomarang with a point comming out of the back.  It made no noise at all, and had no running lights.  It appeared to have a dull orange glow; the closest thing I can compare the color/glow to is the coil of an electric stove when the coil is just starting to heat up.  I cannot say if the glow was coming from the object or was a reflection from the lights from the party.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case, it was not very bright and since it made no noise, I do not think I would have seen it if I had not already been looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I discussed the sighting with the other witness from Scotland and it was evident he saw what I did; the witness from Canada said he was &#34;not sure what he saw&#34; and would not discuss it.  It didn&#39;t really have a &#34;haze or aura around the object&#34; so I didn&#39;t check that box, the light was more like &#34;on&#34; the object and didn&#39;t extend from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If someone wants a verbal description or clarification, or can tell me what it was, I do not mind being contacted by phone or email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was laying back with sunglasses on at the pool with my husband when he said &#34;Do you see that?&#34; Just a few moments before I had noticed something and was trying to figure out what it was just as he said that, so I knew exactly what he was referring to. I said &#34;Are you seeing what I am seeing?&#34; He said &#34;Yes.&#34; We were laying on our backs looking up into a perfectly blue California sky, the sun to our west we were able to look straight up through our sunglasses and see what appeared to be 3 totally still triangular shaped objects that were just barely visible. The looked as if they were attempting to be invisible. The shape was easy to make out the edges seemed to shimmer from the sunlight but the color was almost mirroring the sky. They stood there very still just above us thousands of feet, I am not sure how far but far enough so that they seemed small to us, but not so high that they were hard to see. We both laid back discussing what we were seeing, they were not a kite, or any such thing, they were too perfectly still. At first we only saw 3 of them, but then another one seemed to just appear. They were all together like in a formation, two side by side, one in front, one behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes one of them went off slowly to the left then stopped, not moving at all, just as still as could be, and then went back again into same spot in formation. Then one of the other ones completely just dissappeared. We never even saw it move. Then just soon after that it seemed as if they all just dissolved very slowly, as if all they had to do was tilt so that we couldn&#39;t see them anymore, as if the material they were made of could be so mirror like to just absorb the colors of the sky and blend in. Just when we thought they were gone we saw two of them come into view again and at this point a very faint teal color seperated it from the blue of the sky and when this happened one of the craft moved quickly out of view to the left and the other just dissappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We laid there at the pool staring up for another 20 minutes or so talking excitedly. There was no one else out at the pool with us so we had no one else to share this with. The thing that amazed us most is how almost invisible they were, and how still. We were not scared in the least they were too far up to scare us, and we just didn&#39;t think these objects were aware that we could see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been optimistic about ufo&#39;s being real, but I have never known anyone who has seen them, and I have never really investigated them. I was sitting here tonight ( I am in Washington State now ) watching a channel on UFO&#39;s and it donned on me that I never told anyone about that day, except for a few neighbors, but never officially reported it. My (now) ex-husband who is living in Utah now can totally back up this story, and tell you it is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes: We saw no lights on these objects, but then it was in broad daylight. I do believe these objects could have been there for a long time before we even noticed them as they were very difficult to see without starting straight at them, had I looked away and tried to find them again, it would have been pretty difficult. We heard no sounds coming from these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Once I focused on them I could see (or rather I could not see stars in the black shape that was formed by the triangle, so I assumed it was a solid object. My car radio stopped working at that time but the vehicle lights and engine all kept working. I wound down a window to see if I could hear anything, but only heard my own vehicle. The triangle passed in front of a large pine plantation ( I later checked in daylight and this plantation was about 5 km from the road, so the triangle was big and flying very low at that point (the pines were on a slight rise and were about 130 feet high). The object then gained height, but did not diminish in size very much and still kept pace with me. Then it flew into a large cloud but did not come out the other side.

I suddenly noticed a small green ball of light weaving its way around a skyscraper directly above me and my friend.  It was so sudden and it streaked downtown but at the same time, the green ball of light was WEAVING through skyscapers!!  carefully avoiding to not crash into the skyscrapers.  As it streaked across, it left a green glowing trail as it sped away.  At the same time, two helicopters were giving chase.  But the odd thing about these helicopters were that they were silent.  I could not hear either helicopters rotors whirling, nor its engines running.  The whole incident took place quickly.  The green ball seen lasted about 2 seconds.

Lloyd State Park] at 10:00 a.m., looking out over the ocean, when I noticed a metallic object occasionally glittering from the sun&#39;s rays. It was about 2 miles off the coast, and about 500 to 1000 feet high. I had my binoculars in my beach bag, and got a closer look. It definitely wasn&#39;t a conventional aircraft of any kind. It was very large and had no wings or markings, and was very smooth and oval/disk shaped. The object moved North slowly for a couple of minutes, passing in front of a small cloud for a good silhouette view, then stopped and reversed course, maintaining the same speed, and continued, as though it was looking at [or searching for] something. It then quickly &#34;faded&#34; away. The length of my observation was about 5 minutes. The beach was pretty empty, and there were no boats around, so I was probably the only witness.<n>

I had just passed the Texaco Station on my left and as I made it through the intersection I could clearly see a craft of some sort at what I would guess would be a distance of about 1/2 mile. From that distance it appeared to maintain it&#39;s altitude and I continued driving toward it not wanting to believe my eyes. As I closed on the craft I realized that although at first it appeared to be approaching from a direct right angle ( from the east to west) it actually crossed the Hwy heading in what appeared to be a southwest direction using the hiway as true north. In reality I was actually beginning to slow my vehicle as I approached the craft. I remembered looking in my rearview mirror to see if any other cars were behind me and witnessing the same. But I only at best remember possibly seeing other headlights ( of other vehicles). My attention was strictly focused on the large craft that was now beginning to cross the hiway at what appeared to be an altitude of about 100-140 feet. It appeared to be disk shaped from the side view but as it passed over the road I could detect a V-design to the rear. At first sighting, what was so obvious were the sequential lights that appeared to be flashing aroung the edge of the the disk. What seemed odd were the almost sci-fi quality to the movement of lights and the colors. Seemed like yellow, green, red. Can&#39;t fully recall exactly. As it passed over the road I could tell by the outline of sequential lights looking from a rear angle that there was a V-design of sorts. By now (the time that the craft passed over the road) I had stopped my vehicle and pulled over on the narrow shoulder of the road and had the window down, with my head out the window in awe of what I was witnessing. I remember briefly looking back again for other vehicles but my attention was quickly returned. As I watched, it continued across the road and over a stretch of tall pines. I don&#39;t remember ever! hearing any sounds like conventional aircraft would be making at that altitude and no more than 300-500 feet away from me. I had a camera in my backpack but I could not reach it so I noticed a driveway about 1/8 mile north of my position whereby I could turn around and retrieve my camera so as it disappeared over the tree tops, I sped up to the driveway and got my camera only to be obscured from view by the tall pines. It obviously did not alter course and I lost sight due to trees. But it passed within 500 feet of a residence in this farmland, tyoe  open setting. The night was clear and so was my mind as I was rested and heading in to work. No drugs, booze. Sober as a judge. The craft I approximate was about 80 to 100 feet across the beam and about the same length wise. This event changed my life. I had always, as most people, been a skeptic regarding UFO sightings. But now I know that what I saw I have never seen before and probably never again. I wish I knew what it was. I remember thinking why would something that big and silent have such highly visible lights. Thinking that a higher intelligence would have some cloaking or camoflauge to it. This thing was highly visible, but like I stated earlier, I could detect no sound over the idle of my own engine.<n>

It was a clear night, the rides had stopped, and I was looking at the stars while people sat down around me, and kids played nearby. The amphitheatre had a grass field we all sat on, with a stage at the bottom of the slope, where a screen was set up for the lasers.  Finally the show started and within 3 minutes, all the lasers quit.  The crowd booed and complained, and a voice on the PA said the usual apologies along with Technical difficulties excuse.  I went back to watching the stars while the crowd pissed and moaned.  Suddenly I noticed a spot in the sky that was darker than the sky itself.  At first I thought a bunch of balloons were floating slowly by, but I then noticed, it was a triangular shape, with a &#34;Y&#34; shape, along with many barely visible curving light traces, almost like black light neon.  I had time to say, &#34;what&#39;s that?&#34; and point, whereupon my wife looked and exclaimed, &#34;What the heck IS that?&#34; and then it just dissapeared.  It was like it Melted out of sight.  It did NOT zoom off.  It just dissapeared as it slowly drifted over the edge of the ampitheatre.  No one else immediately around me said they saw it, and as everyone started looking at us funny, we dropped it. However, the lasers never did come back up, and we drove home nervously looking at the sky.  I only told 2 close friends about this until I found your website tonight.  I do NOT know if the failure of the lasers was related to the sighting, but it sure was weird none the less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was very long and appeared to be very far away.  The anomaly would become very bright and would pulsate periodically.  The light seemed to be brighter at the top and would somewhat fade near the bottom.  An example of what it looked like would be if you looked at the profile of a spiral galaxy with what appeared to be visible stars in it.  There were 3 lights, one at the top, the middle and the bottom, the one in the middle was the brightest, they were difficult to see.  At this time I called a local TV station to report what was going on, they did not answer and I left a message, it was channel 11 KHOU, Houston.  Once I called the station the light disappeared and did not return, I went inside and approx. 8 to 10 minutes later I came back outside and my wife ask me to focus in on a craft in the sky, it was diamond in shape and had 5 white lights on it.  It made little to no noise at all and moved very quickly.  FYI: There is an Air Base near by, Ellington Air Force Base.  Once the craft went by there was an unusually large amount of air traffic.  I have both the lights and the craft on 8mm video.<n>

I watched it thinking it was a very slow moving plane at first, then I noticed the wobble, moving north to south, or away from me to towards me.it was then that I realised that it was moving very slow, because of the distance bieng so close I guessed the speed to be about 5 MPH.I started looking real close at this time and I saw no wings no tail and no windows, it moved from left to right very slowly wabeling the intire time, it then moved behind some tree&#39;s and I walked over to get a better view and when I got to a place where I should have seen it, it was gone.I then went to work (my workplace bieng only across the street and talked with a co-worker, he has lived in north plains for 20+ years and is a pilet that owns his own plane.

We all decided to watch the news tonight to see if there was anything on the sighting.  Unfortunately, we missed watching the news tonight.

It was quite a while ago.  He lives down the street from me.  The stars were particularly visible that night, so I was looking at them while I walked.  There was one star that caught my attention.  It was as bright, if not brighter than the north star, but it was overhead, slightly to the east.  I stopped my friend and asked him what star it was, and he didn&#39;t know.  We looked at it a while, and were about to walk on.  But then, four other smaller stars came out of the bright star, and seemed to revolve around it.  It was extremely high and far away, but was clear enough to make out.  The large star stayed stationary, as the other stars moved in and out and around erraticaly.  No idea what it could have been.  I am not a strong believer in UFO&#39;s.  Just stumbled on the web-site and thought I&#39;d report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have tried to convince myself that i was dreaming. So it was a thursday evening i no this as i was waiting 4 my fave program to come on TV called top gear it started at 8.30 in the evening. One of the most strange things about this sighing is that i felt compelled to go to my window as if it wanted me to see it while waiting 4 this program to start had i been watching sumthing of a longer duration i would of never seen it and to be honest would of been much more happy to not of seen it. The instant i got to my window and looked out i see this object, first i thouhgt it was a grey bollon but almost instantly realised it wasnt. After about 20 seconds i was frozen still as i watched this grey blob like thing silently glide across from my feild of view (from left to right). i watched almost till it was out of sight as it started to go behind a tree and i swear it stopped dead in the sky 4 a moment then carried on till i could no longer see it. i wanted to rush out to follow it up the feilds but i was to shocked to move i looked around to see it any1 else on the street was looking but i think it was only me. must point out that it was still daylite altho the sun had just started to go down. This object must of flown over the local airport which isnt that big as it was on a same flight path as an aircraft taking off. Later that night by about midnight there was an awful lot of aircraft activity like iv never seen b4. i have spent the last year researching various sights relating to UFOs, military top secret aircraft and the like.During this time of looking around on the net i found a short mpeg video taken from a cctv street camera in kent which shows the almost indenticle grey blob craft at about the same hight same speed as what i saw and even more chilling is that the date time on the cctv camera coincides with my sighting.

There were people at the mall, about to go to the movies, so we asked them if they saw it and 2 guys said yes.

The street was very wide, so I had an almost completely unobstructed view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As is my habit, I looked up at the sky because the sky is very beautiful there, especially in the late summer. Although it was about 7:00 PM, it was still completely light out with no stars or planets visible, the sky still a brilliant azure. There were a few scattered clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I saw a ball of light, but it was moving. It seemed to alternate between yellow and white in color, and it seemed to be quite high in altitude. I want to guess about 20 to 30 thousand feet (?). Because of the altitude, it looked to be about double the size of Venus, but not as brilliant, though it was bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see the actual shape, or if it was an actual craft, but it did appear circular. The shape remained constant, though the colors seemed to change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main reason for this submission, though, is the rate of speed with which the object traveled.  I first noticed the light when it was a little less than halfway across the horizon, almost directly overhead.  It was completely out of sight in about 6 to 8 seconds.  It also had a very flat, straight flight pattern, totally different from what you would see if you were watching a jumbo jet flying overhead, which tend to appear as if they are dragging across lazily the sky, hardly moving, and at an angle to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speaking of jumbo jets flying at about 20 to 30 thousand feet, they seem to take forever before you lose sight of them, and they travel at about 650 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though I do not possess the mathematical expertise to calculate it accurately, I am pretty certain that whatever can race halfway across the horizon in less than 10 seconds at that altitude must be able to move at an alarming rate of speed.  If it was something man made, I hope it is in the American inventory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As with my one other sighting, I was in a state of what I like to refer to as a calm astonishment, unable to speak out to my friend about it. I believe I mentioned it aterwards, but the response was pretty lackluster, as is often the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened years ago but I didn&#39;t think much of it until I started noting that many of the reports are of these triangular aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all started after my two friends and myself were walking out of Dry Canyon right above Logan, Utah after hiking and having a simple cookout.  The night sky was clear and we could see miles in all directions as you can in the desert on clear nights such as this.  We were on the way home.  No car was necessary as Logan is within walking distance of the Wasatch National Forest.  I was talking to one of my friends when the other pointed over my shoulder and said, &#34;What is that?&#34;  His voice had a timber that leant to the urgency of his exclaimation.  I turned in the direction that he was pointing. SSW.  I saw a triangular craft moving slowly in our direction.  It fit the descriptions that I have been reading on this forum.  It was triangular with 4 lights.  Three small lights at the tips and one large light in the center that seemed to slightly illuminate the ground.  It flew directly over us at about 1000 ft and we were illuminated slightly as the large central light passed over us.  It made no sound.  There were two smaller craft at each wing tip that could not be discerned except by there dark outlines.  If you were to gauge their relative sizes, I would say they were approximatly the size of a minivan next to a bowing 747.  The three craft went over us and continued NNE until we lost them in the night sky.  The silence of the craft was earie.  After some reflection on what we had seen, we thought it was simply a new form of military aircraft practicing bombing runs over Logan as Hill AFB is located near Ogden, Utah.  I am also a skeptic considering I am a scientist and yet I have yet to see a craft such as this in any of the military arsenal since.  This makes the encounter all the more interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were approaching Highlands Ranch Parkway, when he noticed a flashing light in the sky over a recently built church.  He  excitedly exclaimed, holy.... look at that!  When I looked over the church, I saw a quick flash of multiple colors of light, from red to yellow.  They came down over the church in a cone shape, with the point being above, and spreading out in a pulsing strobe light fashion, getting wider toward the bottom.  I saw it flash once more, when we noticed about 4 pairs of headlights behind us as if out of nowhere.  My friend punched the gas, as we were freaked out, and now being chased by four black Chevy Tahoes.  We pulled off the dirt road into some bushes, turned off the lights and watched one of these SUVs pass by us.  We then sped home and went to bed.  We woke early the next morning to a police officer questioning us about our whereabouts the previous night.  ! I told him we saw strange lights and were chased by some black SUVs, and asked him if they had any reports of any strange lights that night.

My home was 3 1/2 acres from a two lane highway acroos a pond. I woke up and in the middle of the night and heard a strange &#34;TONE&#34;. This tone seemed to be surrounding the mobile home. I got up and looked out the windows and the window to the front door. I did not saw only darkness outside. The tone was reverberating throughout the home and seemed very close. I walked to the other side of the bed after looking out the windows and attempted to wake my husband. I was shaking him and telling him to wake up. He sat up and I said, &#34;Do you hear that? What is that noise?&#34; And this is the weird part. My next memory was waking up in bed on my side on my back ( I never sleep on my back ) with my arms folded across my chest ( mummy style ). The first thought I had was how did I get like this! I have no history of sleep disorders and do not take drugs. I asked my husband immediatly if he remembered the night before when I woke him and his reply was &#34; yes, didn&#39;t you say you heard something?&#34; And that was all he remembered. I also had a small child at the time and she was safe in her room when this was going on. That morning I rushed to my mother-in-laws to ask her if she heard anything that night. She said no, but later that day I visited my mother and went directly to the piano and instantly picked out the single note that vibrated through my home the night before. It stayed with me for days. Naturally people thought I had dreamt the whole thing but I expressly remember going to my husband side of the bed and shaking him awake. Anyway that is my story. I never saw a thing but the tone satys with me to this day. What do you think about that? ((name deleted))<n>

It was not like the &#34;monilith&#34; of 2001 but was more the size of a large N.Y.C. skyscraper. It had no features, but was quite obviously not a shadow of a crator and looked very unnatural. There were no reflections on it&#39;s surface. As the moon made it&#39;s way across the sky we checked to see if the object changed position. It did not- it was still on the moon and in the same place(we noted the position based on craters). My two witnesses were as unable as I to explain what we had seen.

Due to the elevation we were at we could see across the Souris River Valley. At the fork of the Des Lacs River and Souris River approx. 700 ft above the fork was round object approx. 70ft in diameter that appeared as though it was on “fire.”  I use fire in quotes as the fire appeared to start at the bottom of round object and flowed upwards in expanding then contracting rings around the round object until it reached the top of the round object.  The ring of “fire” would flow slightly above the object and disappear. The flow of the fire was not very fast taking about 10 sec. from bottom to top. There was no smoke coming from the object that I could observe but it did appear as though it had heat distortion around the object.  The object hovered in position for about 5 min and we turned onto Johnson St. and after we made the turn south bound I looked back and the object was gone.  The ball! appeared a shade of red and the &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot; was yellow and flame like.  During the observation I pointed it out to mother and she still acknowledges the incident occurred. I did not see how the object left as my view was obstructed while making a turn. I only observed a single object. I did not hear any out of the ordinary noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It then quickly shined a red spot light on us and then proceeded to travel South West. The thing we thought was strange was that we were in the jacuzzi with no lights on and no lights on the patio either. We were both scared and totally speechless.

It all started when my siter, my dad, and I went out to watch the meteor shower. My dad and sister went inside because it was to cloudy to see anything. There were some clear patches of sky so I continued looking. My sister came out to find out if I had seen anything and I said no. Just then we both, at the same time, saw a UFO. It wasn&#39;t a meteor or an airplane. It was an eye shaped[oval shape with 2 pointed ends] light that moved quickly, in a straight line, across the sky. It appeared out of clouds and disappeared into clouds. The second one appeared a couple of minutes later. It was the same shape but moved differently. It appeared out of the clouds and moved in a straight line then made a sharp turn then another. Finally it continued in a straightline and disappeared into the clouds. That was all! I tried to catch the whole thing on tape but it didn&#39;t work. All I got was a very quick look at a dot.<n>

It had 4 bright white lights in the front with one brighter then the other 3. We pulled off at the next exit and came back around, by this time it was heading south pretty fast. The time it took for us to catch up to it, it was already gone. No moutain ranges so we would have seen it flying away but it was gone in less then 4 seconds. I don&#39;t know what we saw butt it couldn&#39;t have been military because Camp Pendelton was about 15 minutes North of us. The object went South, down the coast.<n>

After the fifteen minutes, I decided to check out UFO websites for reporting. When I came inside to do this the object was in the same place as I originally saw it. I had to go back outside to see if it was still there when the form asked for a duration period. The object had changed its position. It had moved farther away to the northwest by approximately 7 degrees. As of 0100 hours I can no longer see the object. I only observed 1 object. I am employed by a construction supply company.

Eventually flew directly overhead without ever making a sound.  First appeared to be leaving trail of light that did not dissipate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside the front door at 10:30 PM.  It was a clear night, and I had my exterior flood lights on as well as the rest of my neighbors usually do at this time of night.  Looking to the west, just over the treetops, I noticed a white ball with a tinge of yellow and red.  This light&#39;s flight pattern was basically perpendicular to me in a north to south direction.  As it travelled, it produced a large, long illuminated trail.  The characteristic of it was incredible.  The trail did not dissipate and appeared to move along with the front being the ball of light.  I can&#39;t tell you what the trailing was . . . if it was flying on a beam of light . . . if the trail was actually part of it&#39;s structure . . . or if its hull was superheated from atmospheric braking. I&#39;m guessing that it turned from a north-south direction to an ENE direction.  The reason why I say that is that it went from an elongated shape to a round ball shape with no trail.  I called my friend out to observe this.  It seemed to have stabalized which leads me to believe that it was traveling quite a distance directly toward me.  The brightness started to fade like turning out a camping lantern.  At that time regular red, green, and white aircraft strobes appeared to turn on. I cannot be sure that the ball of light and the stobes were from the same vehicle, but the vehicle proceeded toward me and over me at a leisurely speed similar to other aircraft I would watch leave the local airport. As it passed overhead it was just out of clear visular range, but appeared to be triangular or at least flat-backed.  We listened very hard, and we heard a whisper of some sound which really did not keep pace in any way with the craft.  If I had to make a conjecture, I would say it was a military space plane . . . but most definitely highly visible and unusual.<n>

I was with two friends of mine talking in our development outside our houses.  At the time were High School students just talking about life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were talking we noticed a helicopter object that seemed to be hovering by the Blue Mountain.  We assumed at first it was Life Lion (the local helicopter rescue service) trying to save someone around the mountain.  What surprised us was the amount of time it hovered about the mountain.  I was used to Life Lion rushing to a scene and then rushing back to the hospital.  But it wasn&#39;t the case here.  So I pointed it out in our conversation we were having and then realized the object was coming our direction, which we thought was normal because we were on the way to the hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then things got strange.  The speed of the object increased and it seemed to be upon us in moments.  Now at the time, I was taking flying lessons and I knew nothing could move that fast except a jet, and a very fast jet at that.  It would have to be approaching Mach 1 to be able to move from the mountain to us in mere seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it quickly approached we saw the object wasn&#39;t a helicopter at all but something quite different.  As it approached we saw that it had 3 points and was shaped like a triagle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer we realized that the object was HUGE and very low.  The object was more of a isosceles triangle with the front point the brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about a football field long and 50 yards wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it came upon us we thought it would fly over because it was moving so fast but then slowed to a crawl.  It came right above us at about 200 to 300 feet.  It made very little noise if any noise at all.  I kinda remember a hum though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were in shock of the object because it had stopped with its brightest front point right above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds past and then the bright front point of the ship shot a spot light on the street in front of us.  I can only describe it as human made spot light.  Everything about this object seemed completely outstanding except the light.  It just seemed like a spot light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say my companions and myself were not going to stay put and test the theory out.  So we ran for cover.  I ran to a basketball pole and by the time I got there I realized that the light stopped.  I looked up and the object was then heading South-East towards Hershey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were headed to Yosemite Valley. We crossed the central valley in No. Ca., heading east of Modesto on Highway 132. We stopped in the Sierra foothills to camp for the night. Our site was on top of some high hills that overlooked (maybe 1500&#39; above) the central valley floor, and it was clear enough that we could see across (50-60 miles) the valley to the hills on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Settling down for the night, my wife, my son (7 years old then), and me, were sitting outside the tent looking up at the incredibly clear and numerous stars that filled the awesome night sky. In the distance (south &amp; north) we would occasionally see lights from an aircraft. Then we saw this darkish object heading from west to east in the sky. What caught our attention was a small flashing light and it was headed in our general direction. At first it&#39;s shape was not clear, but eventually we all could see that it was triangular. It was moving very slowly and silently across the valley floor far below it. We watched this unusual object for maybe 10 minutes until it was above (maybe 5000&#39;) our position. Then it made an impossible maneuver: it reversed direction in an instant without ever seeing it actually change direction. That was a very curious instant. It was like for that instant something occurred that was somehow outside of time-space. I don&#39;t know how else to express it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch this triangular object, as it headed back in the direction and path that it had just come, until it was no longer visible. One thing that struck my wife and I about this object that made it seem like it was of terrestrial origin, was the flashing strobe light; just like a normal identifiable aircraft has. I can&#39;t imagine that intelligent beings from some other location in time-space or from some other dimension, are going to have strobe lights on their craft when they fly in earth&#39;s airspace: like they&#39;re following FAA rules!  The most interesting part of this sighting was the direction change instant: other than that it  was boring. It moved so slow and didn&#39;t do anything, and it just became a “normal” part of what was in the night sky, nothing special, unlike the incredible stars. These type of UFO&#39;s are seen so frequently that although they fall into the UFO category, they don&#39;t seem like UFO&#39;s. They seem like a terrestrial craft with technology that isn&#39;t known. I&#39;ve seen other incredible UFO&#39;s that create an indelible impression, but this triangle isn&#39;t even close to that level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

After viewing it for about 10 or 11 seconds, it abruptly reversed its&#39; direction but on an angle approx. 30 degrees from where I first noticed it. It did not stop or appear to slow down in any way upon changing direction.  Recently, I have viewed this same phenomenon documented on television, (shown 3/24/00 on FOX network). This was exactly, without any deviation, the same type UFO that I witnessed that night.  The one that was documented was filmed from a satellite in 1991.  I am convinced this was not from ice,debris or any man made product and in fact it was a visitation from an alien spacecraft. I have viewed satellites before at night and have never seen them change direction.<n>

I got out of bed and peered through the curtains and all I could see was extreme bright light so I grabbed my camera and took two pictures. While the light was bright no sound was being heard.

The sphere appeared to purposely single out the smaller female eagle and begand to close in on her. She obviously became agitated and broke off from the male and circled trying to lose her pursuer which followed her every move until she had completed a complete circle, the sphere then broke off the engagement and disappeared behind trees to the west as she went east and resumed her position with her mate. They then disappeared behind the hills behind my house. I had thought that perhaps the object may have been a silver coated helium party balloon, however, after reading about the Washington State Elk incident, and having just observed a real balloon floating over my house, I realize that in now way was this sphere a balloon. I now light floating objects can be caught up in the &#34;wake&#34; of a plane and sucked along a ways, but this sphere did not behave in the manner the real balloon I just saw behaved. Since this episode, I have seen video on TV of objects similar to this in Mexico City following airplanes. By the way, the balloon I saw bounced erratically and the string was easily visible with binoculars.  This sphere had no string and flew smoothly. No sound was audible.

It was about one in the morning and the campfire was beginning to wane. One of us, I don&#39;t remember who, got up to relieve himself. Following the rules we learned in the Boyscouts, our &#34;head&#34; was off the island and 100 feet away from the water. It was in a field of large volcanic rocks and sage brush. My friend, not familiar with the Owens Valley, called to us and asked why there were searchlights flashing in the distance. We had no idea what he was talking about so we joined him in the rock field. We saw what was definately beams of artificial light being shined in many directions at once much like a disco ball. The spots of light hit the steep slopes of the Eastern Sierra on our side of the valley and on the White/Inyo Mountains across the valley. We couldn&#39;t see the source of the lights because Crater Mountain was directly between our campsite and the light source. Crater Mountain was four miles south of our location, approximately. Whatever the lights were, they were over four miles away and powerful enough to illuminate both sides of the valley. We joked that it was a secret &#34;Rave&#34;. Others kidded about it being the advanced landing party of the ID4 aliens. In truth, none of us could explain the lights.<n>

The witness lives in this mountain top community that overlooks the valley lying between Fort Mountain and Grassy Mountain, both peaks lying just east of Hwy 411 in NW Georgia. The site from which this observation was made is about 2800 ft. in elevation. The witness was found to be a successful businessman in good health and a subtantial well respected member of the Murray County/Chatsworth community. This investigation was a joint MUFONGA/ISUR venture and was conducted on 22Aug98. The witness stated that on 8Aug98 at about 9:30PM EDT, he was sitting on his patio deck which has views to the north, northwest and northeast. There was a cloud cover at about 8,000 feet, no precipitation, little or no wind, temperature about 73 degrees. He observed a yellow circle or orb drop down out of the cloud cover to the NE about 1/2 to 1 mile away. It then stopped and hovered at an estimated 3800 ft. altitude (observation made from about 2800 foot altitude).  The witness watched closely for about 10 seconds and described it as being a dark object or center mass, his diagram indicated a small doughnut shaped center, surrounded by concentric layers of yellow glow.  It appeared to be about the size of a basketball held at arm&#39;s length and the glow was about as bright as that of the full moon. The object/light then vanished as he watched. These investigator&#39;s gained permission to surveil the valley for the remainder of the night from the patio deck. At about 11:00PM, these FIs noticed a very bright starlike light (brighter than Jupiter and about twice it&#39;s size) appear appx. 1/4 off of the horizon over the ridges to the NE, it then dropped straight down, displaying a &#39;wiggling&#39; motion as it descended and disappeared. Event duration no more than 1 or 2 seconds, range to light estimated at 1+ to several miles (night observation).  This writer seemed to notice a slight momentary halt in the travel downwards, but this was not noticed by the other FI. An inspection of that vicinity with binoculars revealed no aircraft that could be observed or heard. While not as close or spectacular as the event of 8Aug98, this distant observation did exhibit some of the same characteristics; dropping downward, then vanishing.  It did not appear to be a meteor or returning space junk, both of which have been observed by these FIs on previous occasions (meteor showers many times). There are additional cases under investigation in this area, including the nearby town of Elijay.  See elsewhere in this database for case of 16Oct99, &#39;Glowing Orange Orb Hovers&#39;.  That particular case was reported by a seperate witness in the same general vicinity. Detailed reports of the aforementioned 8Aug98 event were submitted to MUFON HQ and the ISUR database.

The sky was partly sunny, the sun had broken through the clouds when a fast moving shadow, as if something was passing between us and the sky, but without the sound one would expect to hear from a plane or aircraft flying over.  I looked out from underneath the boat canopy and saw a translucent object somewhat oval/diamond shaped that refracted the light as in having the appearance of reflecting the surrounding sky.  It was in the open sky and traveling from north to south for approximately one minute, before dissapearing into the clouds. I would calculate the speed as near 300 miles per hour. I am convinced that this object is not one of ours, having lived here my entire life and having seen all aircraft types in the McCord Airforce Base area. I would say the the object was cloaked. The closest thing to the appearance of this object I have ever witnessed was the visual immagery used to create the creature in the movie &#34;Predator&#34;.<n>

I was just a few miles outside of Houston.  I had just left the little town of Smithers and I was looking for a Fair Grounds that I had thought they had there to overnight with 5 horses that I had brought out of Alaska.  I had traveled this Highway lots of times and usually stayed in Vanderhoof or Quesnel but the road had been bad coming down the Cassiar Hwy and had slowed me down.  My traveling companions besides the 5 equines consisted of my SharPei dog (CharChar) and 1 cat (Sally).  It was my traveling companions that alerted me to something unusual in the beginning.  Char started talking to me and howling in a strange way and was looking out the rear window.  I could see a strange white glow on her when I turned around.  At first this registered as light coming off my front running lights on the Horse Trailer, the problem being they are orange, not white.  Still did not register with me that there was anything unusual yet.  Then Sally, the cat, started making strange noises I never had heard before and she actually jumped up on the seat in front with me then jumped back to the back and went under the seat.  Her hackles were up at the time.  Meanwhile, Char is running from the back rear window to me and is talking and whining and her hackles are up.  I was at this point starting to get spooked.  I had slowed down considerably looking for the Fair Grounds and had been leaning forward on the stearing wheel (there was some ground fog in the valleys there too).  It was at this time that I realized the truck was glowing with a white light and the ground around me also was.  It was like I was in a big spotlight with  one of those new blue-white headlights they have out now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I leaned forward and looked up and realized that there was something over me.  It was as larger than a large full moon in size in the sky and was a glowing green color with this large white light in the middle.  Like a stupid idiot I really slowed down and rolled my window down and listened. I heard no engines.  At this point I am trying to justify this with a meteor, crashing plane, helicopter, anything but imagining that I could be the perfect &#34;ufo medical experiment on wheels, 5 equine,1 feline,1 canine and 1 hominid.&#34; This my daughter latered reminded me of and we had a good laugh, however I failed to see the humor in it at the time it was happening. I don&#39;t think I directly thought of this however I know it had to be in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object suddently removed the light from me and then sped forward. I was at this point going up a hill and it appeared to be going to the top of the hill to land.  It was at this point I actually saw 3 points of light that were red or orange on the edge.  I thought they might have been engine exhaust or after burners.  It was a little unclear with the fog I was going in and out of.  This was not a heavy fog, more like a mist. It hesitated at the crest of the hill then suddenly made a sharp turn and headed due North from me.  It was at this point that I realized that I had come to a complete stop in the Highway.  Myself and Char were just staring at this thing.  I can&#39;t tell you what was running through her mind but I can tell you I was now scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went through this mist and went right up and over a small mountain there.  I could see the glow of light from beyond the mountain like it had landed.  I got going again quite quickly and stopped in the next town to call my husband.  He is in the USAF and while I am relating all this to him it was at this time I realized that the entire Convenience Store was now quiet.  Everyone in there was listening to me! One of the customers in there told me that there had been sitings in the area all Summer!  Well I ask if there was a RCMP close at hand because I still thought that maybe I should report it.  The clerk in the store he did not think the office for just reporting would be open at this time so I just determined I would call later.  There were 2 logging truck drivers there that said that I could park between them if I was still scared since they would be there until 6:00 when the mill opened.  This is exactly what I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I started off again headed for Arlington,Washington. Somewhere before Prince George I spied a RCMP on the side of the road running radar and it was a woman.  I thought this would be the chance to talk to someone so I parked on the side of the road and approached her vehicle.  I had made sure that I had picked up one of my Business Cards first.(I run a horse transport business so I do a lot of traveling at night.  It is easier on the horses especially in the Summer.  I also had lived 17 years in Alaska so I knew this Hwy and this was a first for me on it.) When I came up the first thing out of mouth was that here was my business card, that I did not do drugs nor rarely drank and certainly had been doing neither the previous night.  She listened to my tale then handed the card back to me and kind of chuckled.  Without saying anything to me she got on the radio back to Houston, BC, Canada and told them I would be calling in a report.  I interrupted her to ask if it would be a problem if I called once I got to a land line in Washington and she said yes.  Well this went better than I had expected.  I really thought that she might have been calling out the &#34;paddy wagon&#34; with the straight jackets for me.  It was at this time after speaking on the radio she got out of the car and looked at me straight on.  She then proceeded to tell me she believed me and did not think that I was a &#34;NUT&#34; since if I was a nut seeing things at night then they had 2 RCMP&#39;s that were the same and were seeing things in broad daylight.  She said that a craft had been sited in the same area just a few days before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded on feeling much better actually.  When I got to Arlington, Washington at a motel I called the desk at the RCMP&#39;s at Houston and gave them a full report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I am going to tell you something at this point.  I tried when this actually happened to give a report to you over the phone and you were very rude to me.  I had seen the lights over Texas also a month later.  THis was when they lights were appearing over Washington, Texas and several other places.  You said you were too busy to take the report over the phone and for me to file it on the Internet.  We just got a Computer here not to long ago.  So don&#39;t blame be for waiting for so long to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

There were power lines going through the woods for miles in one direction. We were just talking and facing in one direction of the lines. One friend mentioned a bright star and the rest of us looked at it and paid no attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 min, it got bright enough to look like a plane was coming straight along with the power lines and had a headlight.  When it got close enough for us to get a good look at it, it was right over the tree line. It had 3 colors swinging under it.  Blue, white and red.  We had one car window rolled down and I noticed there was no sound coming from the &#34;so called plane&#34;. I turned the radio off, rolled down my window and so did my friends. We all sat there silently watching this thing pass by. It made a silent whining sound and passed by very slowly and dissapeared beyond the trees. After we couldn&#39;t see it anymore, my friends panicked. We never could explain what it was and noone could explain to us what it was. It was about 50 feet from us when it passed by at about 5 MPH. I am now 35 and this happened when I was around 18 years old. Every now and then, we talk about it and we can&#39;t figure out what it was. Maybe some kind of high tech government plane?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I would say Summer).  The time of day was approximately early afternoon.  I was working on the second floor of a two-story building of a satellite office of a major corporation in Dickson City, Pennsylvania.  I was sitting at my desk, which faced a row of large non-shaded windows.  As I looked up from my work, I saw out the window an object that was moving nearly laterally through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was dark in color (I would say flat black.)  It’s size I would estimate as that of a small plane (say a Lear Jet) I saw no details, no markings, no marker lights, no windows, etc.  The object did not even appear to have any reflections or glare.  It was chevron in shape, like a wide &#34;V.&#34;  (There was no &#34;tail&#34; or any other protrusions.)  Each of the 3 &#34;tips&#34; of the &#34;V&#34; came to a point, with the widest section being (using this example) at the nadir of the &#34;V.&#34;  I would say the angle of the &#34;V&#34; was about 100 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving (nearly) from left to right from where I was (now standing) by the window.  It was approximately one quarter, to one half mile away from me.  It was &#34;flying&#34; with it’s &#34;wings&#34; perpendicular to the ground (like a plane would normally fly), and the bottom point of the &#34;V&#34; was pointing in the direction of it’s movement (like it was the &#34;nose&#34; of the vehicle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no exhaust or contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky that day was partly cloudy, with a good base to the clouds (in other words the clouds did not vary much in elevation, the base of each cloud was at pretty much at the same elevation).  The sky was light &#34;sky blue&#34; in between the clouds.  Other than the clouds, the visibility was unlimited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know the objects elevation, but it was flying just below the cloud layer, because the craft would every now and then &#34;skim&#34; the bottom of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its speed appeared to be approximately, one and a half, to two times the speed that a &#34;Piper Cub&#34; type airplane would fly at, at that distance and elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely rigid in its motion.  In other words, it did not increase or decrease elevation, or speed.  It made no wobbles or movements of pitch, yaw or roll.  There was of course, no flapping motion (it was NOT a bird in my opinion).  It’s flight was completely steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the moment I first saw it, I watched it for about 10 seconds, then turned to go to my office door to see if anyone else was close enough to call over and see it with me.  No one was there, so I immediately went back to the window.  I was away for approximately, 3 or 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back to the window, it was a little further along its flight path, traveling in the same manner as I have already noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed another object, exactly the same type as described, coming from the other direction (180 degrees from the first objects direction), and it was traveling in the exact same manner as the first.  It appeared to be on an exact collision course with the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the objects got almost &#34;nose-to-nose&#34; with each other, they proceeded to do one &#34;loop-de-loop&#34; around each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;loop-de-loop&#34; was accomplished by each craft, by increasing elevation.  (If you remember the old &#34;Hot Wheels&#34; toy car TV commercials with the yellow &#34;Hot Wheels&#34; track and how the miniature cars would do a loop around the track, that is how these objects each appeared to travel around each other, but in opposite directions.)  The &#34;loop&#34; was not vertical.  The plane of the loop, would have been at about a 50-60 degree angle, using the ground as the base level for the angle.  (The objects were still at their approximate elevation, just that the angle of the loop’s plane, compared to the ground, would have been about 50 to 60 degrees.) The size of the diameter, of the circular type loop that each did around each other, I would estimate to be approximately twice the length of the distance between wing tip to wing tip, of one of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After completing the &#34;loop-de-loop,&#34; each object continued flying in the same matter as I originally described, on each of their respective original courses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched each object until both were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event, lasted from first sight to last sight, approximately 40-50 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after seeing this, I quickly noted the time, date, and estimated the angles, etc.  Then I sent email to a local TV station, asking if the weather department knew the elevation of the cloud layer that day above Dickson City, PA was.  The station never answered my email.  So subsequently, I was never able to calculate the altitude, distance, or speed of the objects.  Moreover, since then, I cannot find my original notes.  This is the FIRST TIME I am reporting this to anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

No strobe or running light apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object observed 2129-2130 hours 3 August 1998 viewing east along Washington Street from SW corner of Broadway and Washington in Portland OR.  Weather clear ca. 70 degrees F. light breeze from north.  Object was very bright blue-white light, steady illumination (no variation in luminance or color).  Object was size of small pea at the end of my arm.   When I first noticed it, I thought it was an especially bright satellite given its steady  tracking characteristics,  but the object suddenly disappeared when it reached a position straight on from my observation point, and I also am not aware of many satellites in easterly to westerly orbits!  As I could see no evidence of running lights or strobe, and I could hear no noise during the sighting or for two minutes after the object disappeared.  It also did not appear to be in usual flight approach or departure lanes for PDX.   I decided to report sighting as unknown. Track:  appeared to be very high.  About 4 degrees below a very bright star or planet (slightly less bright than the moving object), and about 80 deg. above horizon.  Went through 3--5 deg. of arc in about 40 seconds.  Sudden winkout at 90 degrees azimuth. I felt strange after seeing this.  I thought I heard a couple behind me say &#34;Oh, another sighting!&#34; but no way did I want to talk to anyone about what I saw at the moment.  Needless to say, I debated a long time before deciding to report this. I am a professional archaeologist  trained in photointerpretation and physical observation techniques.  On two other occasions I have seen odd high altitude night lights behaving in ways not characteristic of aircraft or satellites, but have not reported those.  I also witnessed one of the Blue Book daylight unknowns in summer 1954 in Alcoa, Tennessee, along with several of my friends.   I am interested professionally and personally in UFO subject.  Would like to know if there were other observations of reported event.  Or explanations!<n>

We were just coming out of storm when we had just passed thru Midland. I was driving and the rest of my family was sleeping, when a orange ball of light had come down from the sky and , just before hitting the ground, it blew up. Many small white lights seem to leave in every direction. I woke my wife and told her I had just seen my first fireball lightning. I then noticed a very bright flashing strobe light on side of hill. I showed my wife. It just happened that the highway turned to where it was on the side of the hill. When I got to the top of the hill,it was about 100ft off highway. I pulled up next to it and told my wife I was going to walk over to it. She said no but I said I wanted to know what it was. I got out of my van and walked accross highway,into ditch where it was flashing. I tried to look at it but each time it flashed it blinded me. Halfway there I noticed another to my right. I called back to my wife, who was standing next to our van, look there are two of them. She yelled back &#34;no, thats the same one, it just moved&#34;. I then thought to myself that anything that can move that fast is probally nothing to mess with. My wife was yelling lets get out of here so I went back to van and told my wife to wake up my oldest son. I got in and preceeded down highway, when I noticed it was still beside our van. My wife says speed up and out run it.I was going over 100 and it still was still beside us. About 5 minutes later it seemed to fall back about a mile. I said I think we lost it, just then there it was beside us again. Down the road a ways the highway turns towards Pierre, we made the turn and noticed that the light didn&#39;t follow us in that direction. About 10 miles down that highway we stopped to check our kids. Everything seemed to be OK. Maybe we just imagined this, my wife said. I looked down the highway back in the direction that we came and saw the light in the distance.! No we d idn&#39;t imagine this, I said as I pointed back at it. We both got back in the van and left quickly. We couldn&#39;t get a look at it because it was to bright to look at, it lit up the surrounding area, as if it was day. We had a long nervous ride back to Jamestown that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A round ball...silver colored...came silently and swiftly into view. It wasn&#39;t very high in the sky...just above the treetops. It appeared to be unaffected by air currents because it simply moved in a straight line from left to right, and a bit ahead. (I was facing south or south-west).  Though it had no light(s) of its own, the shiny silver ball was quite easy to see in the bright moonlight. It was going much too fast and too straight to be a child&#39;s balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A thunderstorm was moving in around the time we headed back to town. Our kids had gone into the motel and as my wife and I were heading in, I looked up toward my left and then pointed it our to her.  She saw it, too. There was no sound. It moved fairly slowly. The sky, as I recall, was overcast somewhat. This could have made the lights look somewhat hazy, sort of like seeing a colored light through a mist or fog. There was a row of lights appearing this way. As I recall they were red and green and not flashing. Each light, based on what may have been the distance in view of the objects speed and height as best as I would guess the depth of field, would be around one to three feet in diameter.  Again, the haze of the evening may have made the lights look larger than they were. But again, no sound was heard. In view of its unusual &#34;drifting&#34; movement, it is hard to think of a plane. And it was low and not close to the airport. The hazy lights were pretty much in a straight line, but from what I recall in a slightly elongated &#34;V&#34; form. Within seconds it moved out of sight. It would be natural to write this off, but it has been close to ten years and you are the first &#34;official&#34; place to receive my report. I do not know what it was. It did not fit the usual context of normal flying vehicles. So all I can say is it was unidentified.

We were driving on Arenal Rd West toward Rio Grande High School. When up ahead I noticed a bright spot light under what I thought was a helocopter. Alot of police helocopters hover over the area looking for criminals. I live a few blocks away and was wondering if they were looking for anyone I knew. As we approached the high school we noticed it wasnt a helocopter at all. It was a triangular object about 30 long and ten feet high. It hovered next to a street light in the high school parking lot. I immediately stopped the car and starred in amazement. It wobbled in the air next to the street light like it was about to crash. The wobbling reminded me of model held in the middle by a string. My girlfriend and her sister were very scared as they noticed it wasnt a helocopter at all. The object was about 50 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, so we got a good view of the object. A few other cars had stopped and watched as well. The object had three small lights at each corner and a bright spot light under it which did not move all thought the craft was wobbling. We watched for about 10 minutes and then the object became stable and moved slowly and silently to the SE over trees and houses. Im sure someone saw the spot light over their homes as the object flew only feet above their houses. We stood and watched untill the object was half a mile away, when we drove after it. We folled it for a mile and the the object dissappeared. I immeadiately called the local news stations who said no one reported anything and I was crazy. Im not crazy and neither are my girlfriend and her sister.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We watched it move across the sky a ways and then it moved up then out of sight. We went inside and then came out again aproximately 5 minutes later. We saw two jets moving at high speed towards the area that this object was last seen. One jet was making a return and another jet went towards where the object was. After that we saw what looked like a falling star come from the general area. The orange object made no noise.<n>

In that show, Peter described (and played a tape of) several sightings of lights in the sky that were seen to apparently shoot out tracer-like light pulses. On about August 1 of last year, (I didn&#39;t record the date.) my wife and I were sitting on our front porch enjoying the evening, chatting and looking at the stars. I spotted a white light moving very high in the sky and remarked to my wife that I wondered if that was a very high aircraft or perhaps a satelite. There was no sound and, for that matter, I didn&#39;t expect any as it appeared quite distant even though it was moving across the sky fairly rapidly. We watched it for 2 to 3 minute during which time it progressed steadily moving approximately eastward. The direction and speed seemed to remain constant. The color and intensity of the light remained stead as well. Then, while we were watching, there appeared to be 3 or four streaks of light, very much tracer-like, extend out ahead of the light. The streaks were fainter than the light of object and extended directly in the direction of travel a distance corresponding to a distance that the object would have traversed in several seconds travel time. This occured twice. Both my wife and I were looking at the object and both of us saw the streaks. The two bursts of streaks occurred approximately 2-3 seconds apart. Shortly after the second burst, the object vanished as though the light were extinguished. The area of the sky that we were watching at that time had no obstructions or other fixed elements that could have come between the object and our line of sight. We watched the area closely for another minute or two, trying to see the object again or anything else, but nothing appeared. We saw nothing more that was out of the ordinary that evening.

I could see it at night as well , But it was never reported as a storm cloud , or even put in the locakl paper . A small town of 2000. i had noticed it two days before . but thought nothing odf it . Since it was been raining in St. louis for about three wks now . but no rain in our area. Anyway , i was out some nights before . checking out the ufo&#39;s  i had seen the nights before . Any way this night , after the rest of my family had went in . My oldest boy and i stayed out . we were watching for any strange happening. so as it went . it was about ten twenty , by now . I had notice to the north of me some lights . coming toward our direction . didn&#39;t think much of it at first . but i noticed it was kind of low for a plane or jet . For that matter. So i watched it for sometime as it was approaching us . It had theese bright lights you might see omn a jet landing at an airport . But knowing that there wasn&#39;t , no airport close enough for it to land on . I kept watching it . By now it wasn&#39;t more than maybe fifty feet from , us. i noticed as it approached it had about six big lights on the front . But after it got wthin a certain distance , of us . it seem to have shut off some of them . As if to disguise , its approach . So by now my son andf i are watching this . now it was about 35 ft. and closing . it was about 25 ft above the ground . we could not here no sound coming from it . but from what  i saw . It must have been between 75-100 ft wide . it didn&#39;t shine no color lights at this time . By it , was crusing maybe at about 15mph toward us . At this point my son and i have got scared , So we hid behind our car . And i would peek up for a minute to see if it was still there . It was within at least 15 ft from us , by now . Now this is what happened next . i had ducked behind the car again . hopping it would pass. So i looked and it wasn&#39;t there , but it was to the west of us, no more than 10-15ft . to our west . itwasjust hoovering about 20ft or lower above the ground . it was within walking distance from where we was . Which was about 10ft . so i took noticed to look at my watch , it was a little past 10:30pm . As we walked over to it . As we approached i could see it had a dome on top . but it wasn&#39;t low enough to see into to it . I could just make out the top of it . As we stood underneath it . I took my flashlight , asnd shined up toward it . Sincwe i figure it would reflect my light . but it didn&#39;t . there was no reflection at all. It was black at least it looked black under it . becuse you couldn&#39;t see it from the bottom . but i was able to see the outline of it . it wasn&#39;t completly round .it had small wings on itsside it looked like . anyway , as i stood underit with my son . i ask him wouldn&#39;t it be great if wee got to take a ride in it . so we looked toward this our house , and started to walk away . When this light surrounded us . And the next tthing i knew it was 11;30 . I could here myself talking to my son . But i could hear , Or knew what i was saying . until we got a few feet away from it . thats when i turned and notice it fly off. As for the next night the cloud that was there for three days , Well it was gone . if you want to read my story on , my encounters, with ufo&#39;s .then you can email me at : ((deleted)) net . i have many sighting , and contacts as well .<n>

Travelled from Southeast to Northwest. Changed color and direction erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son-in-law and I were on the balcony of his apartment. He noticed an odd light below the moon and called my attention to it. The object appeared to be a light. Without a reliable frame of reference, it appeared to be approximately one-half the size of a pencil eraser viewed from the bottom. The object travelled at a good rate of speed from Southeast to Northwest. I estimate it covered approximately 120 degrees of arc in something under two minutes. There were two aspects of this light that were odd. It was constantly illuminated, but appeared to flicker rapidly, changing colors as it did so from red to blue. The flicker rate was very rapid, changing at least 30-40 times per second. The object&#39;s direction of travel was not in a straight line. It jumped from side to side and occasionally jumped backward, appearing to make 90 degree and even 180 degree course changes instantaneously. I am 56 years old, a self-employed management consultant with a masters degree in public administration. My son-in-law is an elementary school teacher. The sky was clear and the weather was very pleasant.<n>

The reflection from the lights could be seen on the water, so they must have been fairly-low. My friend and I were standing about a 1/4 mile away. After standing there for a few minutes watching this, I flashed my high-beams in it&#39;s direction,and it stopped a minute later, back to complete silence and no lights.

The sky was absolutely clear. The local airport told me that they don&#39;t have the capability to check for passenger jets on their radar.

The window was covered almost all the way except for an opening left at the very top in which the bright light came threw.  Next, as I wondered what it could be, a being came right threw the covered window like a ghost would go threw walls,  I began to think &#39;act frighted&#39; when this being told me in my own voice &#34;don&#39;t worry everything&#39;s going to be OK&#34; all of a sudden I became calm.  Suddenly it started to walk around my bed and that&#39;s when I realize I couldn&#39;t move my body only my eyes.  I followed this being with my eyes, had the impression it was a female.  This being had long dirty blond hair, big eyes, a slit for a mouth, and two little holes for a nose, its skin was a blueish-greenish color. It stand next to my bed and again in my own voice it told me that everything was going to be OK. It sat down on the side of my bed, reached over and began to massage my bad knee in which I had p! roblems walking and going up stairs and not to mention the pain I had with this knee all day just relaxing it. Next thing I know I woke up not realizing what happened over night and started walking to the bathroom and that&#39;s when it hit me, my pain was gone. I began to jump up and down and jiggled my leg and that&#39;s when I was puzzled, and the suppose dream I had popped in my head. I don&#39;t know what happened but my pain which I had been going threw for years was gone after that incident and I don&#39;t know what to think about it. Till this day my knee is fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I looked back up at the light a chill ran down my spine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still don&#39;t know what it was, but it scared me and I stopped my truck to look at it.  I don&#39;t know why I did this because I was so scared that I couldn&#39;t move.  It was above the field next to my truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a sphere that was glowing a blueish-pink and it was moving real slow.  I could hear this intense humming that I assume was coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a beam came out of the bottom of it and it almost looked like it was searching for something.   The beam was just kind of combing the ground to the left and right below the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to get out of my truck and look at it closer, but when I opened the door the beam went out and it stopped so I got back into my truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it just shot straight up into the sky and just kind of disappeared from the inside out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it disappeared my radio came on full blast and my windshield wipers turned on on high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so scared that I drove the rest of the way home as fast as I possibly could and ended up sitting in my truck in the driveway for about 2 hours because I was scared to get out of my truck and go into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, I still don&#39;t know what it was, but I do know that I never want to see it again.<n>

I walked out of my parent’s home to get on my new motorcycle.  I went to place my helmet on and happened to turn around to see if the door at the house was closed.  As soon as I turned around I saw this hovering red glowing oblect (a very bright and dimming light).  It was about 50 yards away from the house on the right hand side.  The view of this object put me into serious shock...I was scared to death because it came down straight down towards the house (I was hiding behind my parent’s vehicle).  It then flew very fast to the left of the house and was again in a dead stop.  It then shot onto the top of the mountain for 5 to 10 seconds and back again to the same position that it was when I first saw it while it was glowing on and off.  What I saw, I could not handle the scare it gave me. As soon as stood up behing the car, the object shot into the sky in a second and disappeared. I called the binghamton airport to ask if the was any airplanes, helicopters, or any objects flying around midnight. The airport told me that there was nothing flying in the vicinity of binghamton at all.  It did not look like anything I have ever seen or thought existed.  This object made no sound the whole time. I reported this by phone the morning after it happened to the Seattle UFO reporting center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was the only one facing the ocean, and the sun had gone down.  We were talking away when suddenly I saw something following the downward trajectory of a shooting star, kind of an arc.  The strange thing was that it was green.  I remember it being in about the 10 o&#39;clock position, if straight up were 12.  Maybe more like 9:20.  Anyways, before I had a chance to say anything, though that was my intention, the thing suddenly shot straight up very quickly and vanished like a firework. It just was gone.  The whole event was strange, but I was definately struck by the almost simultaneous shift from a downward arc to a  shooting straight up with what appeared to be 4 jets or flames shooting out from below.  Of course, the color change was unexplainable also.  By the time I had my hand in the air pointing to the spot it was gone and I had to explain the whole thing to my friends, who were chatting away.  One of them, sitting facing me, is an avid UFO guy, and felt resentful that HE was not the one to witness this event!  While I have listened to him in the past, and assume a general attitude of &#34;why not?&#34;, I kind of stay away from this subject for the most part.  I think it makes people paranoid.  I don&#39;t remember for certain in this happened in August, but it was last summer, and I remember it being a particularily windy evening.  I had never heard of these green lights before, but later my UFO friend recounted to me other stories of them.<n>
