It was dark and they had a fire going.  My husband looked up and saw a bright light, and just when he said to them, “Wow look at that!” that quick it was hovering right over them about 500 feet in the air. He also said that it wobbled from side to side. His friend was terrified and ran to put out the fire, and then he ran to a tree and was hanging on to it, my husband and his brother were like froze watching it.  It stayed there for about ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said that it was oblong in shape, but not cigar shaped, and about 30 feet wide, but hard to judge the size.  He said that it pulsated white light.  He said you could not really see the craft because of the pulsating light.  It then in a flash shot up in the sky, wobbling, and stopped, and hovered about as high as the air planes fly.  Then it shot out 4 smaller white lights and they went off in different directions.  Then the original craft took off  and they watched till they could no longer see them.  He said that it was if they could hear them, and it made no sound at all.<n>

Went to that location to see what was going on and found some kids drinking beer.  While having them dump out 10 bottle of a 12 pack one of then said hey what is that.  I was facing to the west and look towards the North-West and observed a Craft floating above the ground.  I would estimate this dark Meltalic Craft was about 2000 feet above the ground and about 1000 to 1500 feet away from my location.  The craft was transiting to the south, but at a very slow pace.  When it was in a South-Westerly position the mostly full moon reflected or lit up the craft.  I noticed it had rows of square objects on the side like windows which were all darker than the body of the craft which was a dark gray-black.  The craft had an odd shape too.  If you can imagine the top half shape of a stop sign with a cylinder attached to the longer edge of the upper stop sign centered evolving into a triangular oval tail section which was flat at the back end.  This oval-triangular rear end had three circles, with one large one in the center and two smaller ones on either side of the larger. The side were at an odd angles and it appeared the upper portion of the craft was wider than the lower half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Front _____ /     \ /       \ /_________\ <n> <n> <n> <n> /   \ /     \ /_______\  Rough Example. Botton View with the rear depicted on this line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rear   They were a dull white in color almost a lite gray.  The craft was also emitting a winning sound which was barely audable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it move to the south and about the time it was over the town of Sutherland, I called on the radio to another Officer who was in the Wallace area (22 Miles to the south on highway 25.  I advised him about what I was looking at and he said he would start heading North and see if he could catch it.  Just as I had mentioned the Craft we all noticed the three circles flash bright white ( about the same shade of white as a monitor displays when you have a bland white page on the screen.) a couple of times.  The Craft started moving faster and closed the distance between Sutherland and a position just south and west of the Gerald Gentelman Power Plant about where the correction line is in the highway.  (About 8 miles) in about 40 seconds.  The craft then veered to the south east and headed on a line of travel that would have taken it close to Dickens. seven (7) miles to the east of Wallace on Highway 23.  The officer to the south called me back a few minutes after I had talked to him and stated he could see the craft and estimated it was moving about 400 miles per hour heading off the the south east towards Dickens.  He also stated it was Eluminated be the lights from the power plant whne he spotted it and disappered into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no Idea if this was an Experimental Aircraft but I would have to say it was twice as long as an Airforce C5 Galaxy and 1 and a half times as wide.  Who knows it could have been something from Area 51 that the Government was playing with or a UFO!  The Teens and myself all experenced the air around us to seem to be electrostaticly charged, because not only myself, but the others experenced the hair on our arms and head to stand up. (kind of like when you rub a baloon against your hair.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was stationed there as well, but, this was before we were married.  My husband would often drive home from Virginia to his home in Louisville, Kentucky during long weekends, on a long stretch of highway (I&#39;m not sure what the name of the highway was).   He had said that one time when he was driving home, he had looked out of his rear view mirror and he said that he saw four lights hovering above the trees that were along side of the road about thirty yards from his car.  He said that the lights were two red and two green.  He stopped the car and got out.  There were no other cars on the road at the time and it was around 5:00 p.m.  My husband said that he looked at the trees and saw no lights.  He looked in the rear view mirror again and saw the lights.  He looked in the mirror on the driver&#39;s side of the car and he saw the lights.  He looked at the tree and saw no lights.  He said that it was as if the lights were cloaked.  He said that he stood there for the longest time, about 15 minutes and then he went on.  My husband said that it was the strangest thing he&#39;d seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Craft was smooth silver metalic with no doors 30 feet in diameter, perhaps 15 to 20 feet high. A row of lights changing in alternate from orange to blue, coming out of what appeared to be those translucent glass building blocks of the common type 4 to 6 inches square. She was walking towards the craft thinking someone had moored their boat a her dock. The closer she got she is saying to herself strange boat, no railing no deck, she was trying to look through these glas lighted windows when she called out to her husband &#34;Carl&#34; it immediately went straight up in the air scielently not leaving any ripples on the water and zoomed away behind an island. With three things traveling at great speed right behind it these three craft made a whoosing sound and made her duck down for fear of being hit.Also she cannot say much about these 3 ships as they traveled so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were seen by her husband two next door neighbours and a friend they were on their way to bingo. One of the women said don&#39;t tell anyone they will think we are crazy. The year not pefic in her mind but she did report it to the local newspaper. The reeds at the end of the bay 100 yards away were pushed down in 3 circular patterns the next mornings investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The party who submitted this report also provided a lengthy audio interview of his grandmother about the sighting.  It is an excellent description of her sighting of the object described above, and we share the writer&#39;s assessment of the veracity of the witness&#39;s testimony.  She describes the event in a very matter-of-fact manner.  She estimates that she may have been within six feet of the peculiar object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We express our sincere gratitude to the witness, and to her grandson, who submitted the report, for sharing the information with our Center!

11/1/83 21:00|Kingston|NY|Triangle|about 15 min|1983 Hudson Valley UFO sighting|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88531.html|6|ndxe198311| 1983 Hudson Valley UFO sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear UFO Center:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this to report a UFO sighting my family and I had in approximately November of 1983 when I was an 8-year-old child.  (I am 36 now.)  I was only recently reminded of this event because I had listened to a brief clip of a past episode of the radio show Coast to Coast AM regarding the Hudson Valley UFO sightings of the early-mid 1980s, and wanted to add my recollection to your database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening around November of 1983, my family and I were on our way home from dinner at a local restaurant. If I remember correctly, it was about 9:00 at night.  As we pulled into our driveway, we noticed what appeared to be a triangular-shaped craft of some sort slowly traveling north along the path of the Hudson River.  (This would be about 1 mile north of the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge.)  The craft appeared to be 4 or 5 separate white lights arranged in a triangular pattern, and flew perhaps 500-1000 feet over our house.  It was moving about the speed of a small prop airplane (if I had to guess I&#39;d say maybe 80 or 90 mph.)  If you were to extend your arms above you with your two hands spread towards the sky, that would be about the area this craft covered above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was strange, however, was that every so often one or two of the lights would switch positions in the arrangement, so I believe this was not one whole craft but 4 or 5 separate ones, because I also could see no structure directly between them.  If I remember correctly as well, these lights slowly turned around as one unit and began heading south for about 5 minutes, then turned due north again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not remember them making a sound or doing any other strange motions, and they just continued on, slowly heading north of our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the same period, I vaguely remember hearing that there were a team of hangliders or ultra-lites copycating the rash of sightings in that area, (perhaps to cash in on the notoriety), so I am not really sure if my sighting was one of these alleged copycat teams or a real unidentified flying object.  The thing that made us believe it was not hangliders or ultra-lites was because we did not hear any engine sounds that would normally be associated with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your consideration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was very dark, I don&#39;t remember if there were stars or if the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a very bright orange saucer shaped object very high up in the sky.  It was stationary for about 30 seconds and then it dropped down very quickly and then shot back up at a V and disappeared.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it again and have always wondered what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest part was that it went from stationary and then dropped and shot back up so quickly at an angle.  It couldn&#39;t have been an airplane, or any other type of aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen, and it was definately not a shooting star, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

11/1/83 20:00|Gibsonville|NC|Light|5 - 10 min|Light observed in night sky followed by what appeared as military aircraft.|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26729.html|8|ndxe198311| Light observed in night sky followed by what appeared as military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s been some time since this occurred, so I am guessing as to the exact date.  However, I remember the event quite clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in high school and attending a band practice. It was a very clear night, and quite dark.  We were outside practicing our marching under the parking lot lights.   --- For what ever reason, a few friends and I noticed a small light in the sky.  The light was silent and did not blink or flash.  At first, the light seemed to be a slow moving, high altitude plane, flying in an easterly(?) direction, and quite unremarkable.  However, after approximately 30 seconds of observing the light, it appeared to change direction and start flying strait up.  This upward direction was not apparent at first, however as we watched this object, it appeared to become smaller and the light dimmer.  Finally after about 1 to 2 minutes we could no longer view the object.  This seemed quite odd, and many of us were speculating what we had just seen.    What happened next made it even more interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short time later, after the light disappeared, 5 planes flying in formation, appeared from the east(?). (Unsure of the exact direction.)  They did not appear to be flying as high as the light we had witnessed and we could hear their engines.  They appeared to be some type of military jet and were moving quite quickly.  These planes flew to the location where we had last seen the light. The planes then broke formation and seemed to be searching the area.  One plane appeared to fly strait up, the others spread out, a started flying in a wide circular pattern.   After a few moments, the planes regrouped and headed back the direction they came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the end of the event.  From the time we initially saw the light until the time the jets left the area was no more than 10 to 12 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
