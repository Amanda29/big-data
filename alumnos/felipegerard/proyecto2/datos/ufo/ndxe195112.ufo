It appeared to be floating and was very large and silent. At that time I had never heard of UFO&#39;s. On the front page of the daily paper [Daily Mail or Daily Herald] I can&#39;t remember which the next morning was a report from the Jodrell Bank Observatory which is approx. 25 miles from Crewe stating that they had picked up the object, tried communication and to identify it to no avail so tracked it until it went off their screens still going north and disappeared over the north coast of Scotland. That was the last I heard of it.  No more news items.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
