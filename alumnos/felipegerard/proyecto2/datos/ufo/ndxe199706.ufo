It moved horizontal across the sky &amp; then stopped. Next, it moved to a parallel point in the sky &amp; stopped again, then it proceeded to the original point creating a triangle. It suddenly dissapeared at this time. I recently met someone who witnessed the same exact pattern/situation 15 years ago in NM. The date &amp; time are approximate.<n>
6/30/97 21:00|Fort Smith|AR|Light|Hours for several nights|Colored, dimming, stat. light source, larger than stars seen at night SW of Fort Smith, AR, 1996-1997.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88092.html|2|ndxe199706| One colored, dimming, stationary light source, larger than stars seen at night SW of Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1996-1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between a 40 to 70 degree angle in the SW sky I saw a round focused source of light brighter or larger than stars.  It stayed stationary but the remarkable feature was how it dimmed and brightened like it was controlled by a dimmer dial.  I don&#39;t remember its color but it was perhaps orange, red or yellow rather than white or metallic/reflective.  I have seen this dimming light source on a few different nights and have used binoculars at least one.  The date of the first sighting I can only recall roughly: 1996-1997.  The time was after dark/evening, but probably not after midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the same night or at least same week of the first sighting I called and reported this sighting to a local Astronomy instructor/club leader and to a TV station&#39;s meteorologist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have any formal Astronomy, Optical or observational training.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/30/97 20:22|Port Perry (Canada)|ON|Light|1 Hour|UFO Air Show?|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67067.html|4|ndxe199706| UFO Air Show?<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in my twenties. A friend of mine and myself often went to Demera Rd. in Port Perry, Also called the Old Missassaga Trail or Ghost Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During one of these outings in the summer, the road was full of people and cars. All the usual teens and young adults out for a night of fun. We were all having a good time, and no neither of us was drinking or using drugs  What caught our attention were many (20-40) small white lights zipping across the sky. I pointed them out to people, but by that time they had formed into a line close to the horizon. When they did this they sure had everyones attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the space of over an hour they flew around, almost seeming to do acrobatics, changed colours (White, Blue, Red) and generally showed off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 1hr. of this, they once again formed into a straight line near the horizon. Then to everyones amazement. They flashed red, white, red. and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I know the sounds like an outright hoax. But I swear it&#39;s true. It was not one craft but multiple crafts indepedant of each other. And there movements were beyond any aircraft or man made device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me was the number, the time they stayed, and the strange colour pattern at the end similar to a Canadian flag. Still to this day it amazes me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I am however quite serious and no this is not an attempt at a hoax.  Like yourself I have a deep intrest in UFO&#39;s and there proper scinetific study.  So I would not peretrate a hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So in response I would say it would have been in mid june-early july around 1997-1998.  I am working on contacting others who were with me that night to coroberate what was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is more to this story, but until I can cooberate the story, and change your view of this being a possible hoax.  I will keep that to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will work hard to get you more reports on the sighting and look forward to talking with you again.  I do understand your relucatance to believe me.  And I bear you no ill will because of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

We were headed south on main and 29 by airport road in Salisbury.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was coming from the right side of us in his car.  There was a even bigger light shining from our left and I thought it was odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and him looked to our left and saw what looked like a sparkler being burnt.  The object was as big as a house.  It than took off and was gone in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound like a jet engine would make and did not make a sound.  I remember that it took off and was light years away in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When me and my cousin looked at it, it was like they read our minds and knew to get out of there fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole encounter took less than ten seconds.  It was so bright that looking at it and getting a detailed description of the craft is not possible.  It looked like a sparkler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Anyways I was walking my dog in my neighborhood when i was about 13 and glanced up in the sky.  What I saw about 500 yards (guessing) away was a vertical chrome cylinder shaped craft of some kind with rounded ends just perfectly still and silent in the air.  Nothing human made can do this.  It was a clear sunny day I just turned my eyes back to where I was going and kept walking and ignored it but after about 5 seconds then it made me curios and I looked again and it was still there I stopped walking and watched it for about 15 minutes.  It never moved just hung in the sky motionless the entire time.  Then a truck came up the road and I was forced to move when I looked back up about 30 seconds later after the truck passed it was gone.  I absolutely could not find it in the sky and looked for about 5 minutes then walked home.  I then went on my deck of my house and looked for it for about a half an hour and could not find it.  I have always wondered what it was and never talked to anyone about it. People just call you crazy for this stuff.  But I know what I saw and it still is in my mind today.  Figured you may be able to use this info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was still dark, I only remember passing one car on Port Hueneme road near the Small Private Camarillo airport. I saw a huge white light in the sky at first I thought it was the moon. Then it started heading west at a high rate of speed with what appeared to be fire behind it making me think it was a meteor. But then the object changed directions and headed in my direction. It just looked light a huge round white light. I slowed my car and watched it for a what seemed like a long time. I was suprised when it came towards my car hovering over me for a while. I noticed I was staring right into the light and it didn&#39;t hurt my eyes. It didn&#39;t make any sound.  As I passed under it.  I looked back and it was gone.  When I got to work in Oxnard there were some people in the parking lot that had witnessed the event from there. That&#39;s how big this thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/30/97 05:45|Venice|FL|Cigar|10 minutes|"Bouncing Ball" follows car in Venice Florida|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76830.html|8|ndxe199706| &#34;Bouncing Ball&#34; follows car in Venice Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a registered nurse with a masters degree and never really thought about UFO’s nor had I ever read anything  about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1997 while driving to work from Venice, FL, to North Port, FL, via Rt. 41 around 5:45 a.m., I saw in my rear view mirror a light that had just entered the road behind me.  I remember thinking that it was funny that a car would pull out from this wooded area since there is no road or driveway.  It was very dark out but from driving this road every day.  I was aware that there were no roads on that side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the orb which I had assumed was a vehicle light disappeared from behind me, but then noted in my passenger side mirror that this &#34;orb&#34; ( the color was slightly more yellowish than a clear headlight) was following directly to the right of my vehicle.  This &#34;orb&#34; followed me along the road for approximately 5 miles &#34;bouncing&#34; along the right  side of my car.  I also remember  thinking that it looked like the &#34;bouncing ball&#34; on the old  Mitch Miller show.  I then remember thinking maybe this was a UFO, but from anything I had ever seen on TV, this was not a UFO vehicle, and my radio was playing and the car was running so I  just couldn’t figure out what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in the fall of 2004 ( October or November), I was again driving in the early morning, around 5: 15 a.m.,  I was driving south on Interstate 75 and was near the &#34;Kings Highway&#34; exit on the interstate, when suddenly to my left and up approximately 300 feet (estimate), I saw this very large plane like object.  It flew directly to the left of me and it looked like a large jumbo jet but without wings.  It was silent, and I saw no lights on this object.  I felt it was a plane that was about to crash because it was so low to the ground and now just 50-100 feet above the road and to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed me and I looked in the mirror expecting to see a large explosion/smoke or some evidence of a crash but there was nothing.  I could no longer see anything as the sky was dark.  Again I did not lose any power to my car or radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up a co-worker in Punta Gorda and continued to travel south to Estero, Fl., that morning, and saw nothing more but did mention my sighting to my co worker, and she just laughed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We returned home the following night (Sunday) around midnight, and about 10 miles south of Punta Gorda, we both witnessed another bright &#34;orb&#34; like object high in the sky.  We watched this for about a minute and it didn’t seem to move, then suddenly it was gone.  We did not see it move, it was just there one moment and gone the next.  Shortly afterwards as we were exiting the highway to return to her house, she looked at her watch and commented that it was much later than it should be  when we arrived back.  It seemed to take us approx 45 minutes longer to make the trip from Estero to Punta Gorda that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had kept these 2 &#34;sightings&#34; to myself all this time until I mentioned something to my sister in law recently, and it was she who said that round &#34;orbs&#34; have been reported in the past as UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then found your web sight for reporting any sightings, and felt that perhaps this may be significant, even though it has been quite sometime ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the two sightings are approximate.

At the time, I was looking to the west at the Big Dipper when I noticed what appeared to be a satellite out of the corner of my eye, moving to the south.  The altitude was right for a satellite.  As I was about to dismiss the object as a satellite, I noticed another object trailing the first at the exact same speed, and in the same path.  The distance between the two objects had to be incredible.  As I watched these objects for a minute or so, the second object accelerated.  At the point the second object overtook the first, both objects were lost from view due to the city lights.<n>

It was approximately 10:09 p.m.  Suddenly all the dogs in the neighborhood started barking and my husband went outside to see what all the commotion was about.  He ran back in the house yelling for me to come and look.  I went out on our front porch and looked up into the sky to where my husband was pointing.  There was an object in the sky to the north, it was heading south.  At first I thought, so what, there&#39;s an airplane in the sky.  Then the object stopped and hovered in one place, it then slowly began to move back and forth, from north to south, then south to north, north to south, south to north, for about 8 or 9 minutes.  Suddenly the object shot straight up into sky then stopped and hovered. At this point I began to get the chills.  Suddenly three rays of white light shot out from this object in a downward direction.  The object continued to hover for another minute or so, then the !beams disappeared and the object began to move back and forth again (north, south, north, south).  The object then came directly toward us, heading south, and flew over us.  Until it was directly over us  there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  When it was directly over us, you could hear an engine-type noise.  When it was directly over us, it appeared to be an airplane, but I have never seen an airplane move the way this object moved.  Nor have the dogs in my neighborhood ever barked at an airplane.  It was bizarre.  What the heck was it?  I don&#39;t know how far away it was.  I would say it definitely was not as far away as the stars or anything, guessing I would say maybe about 1500-2000 feet in the air.We live in a semi-rural desert area.  My husband and I are in our early 40&#39;s.  I have been a paralegal for 15 years, he trains horses.If you wish to contact me please use my Email address.  I would very much like to know what I saw.  I don&#39;t know much about  the latest in military airplanes and all that, and if the military is capable of making airplanes that can move like this, I sure would like to know.  On the other hand, if this was a UFO I would like to know that too.  Thanks!<n>

The time of day was sunset, although it was still bright out.  I was sitting down on the wood deck and crossed legged and leaned back into a position flat on my back looking up at the clouds.  From behinf my head I saw what appeared as two white parachutes above a tree line moving southward in direction. I was confused as they appeared white but were not dropping but were traveling at the same altitude in a forward direction.  I caled my friend over and stood up to get a better look at the objects.  As they moved across the skyline the color changed from white to the burnt orange color of the sunset. It was then I realized they were reflecting light not producing light.  The sunshine was reflecting as if off a mirror and as they moved across the sky the reflection changed. Appeared cigar in shape from side view then appeared disk from rear view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I happened to look out the passenger window I saw what I first thought was one of those blimp type balloons attatched to the ground with cable that used car lots use to advertise. It looked relatively close, just off the highway, in the town I was passing. Not sure of the town, but I will say around the Willcox, AZ area. Anyway. about five minutes later, I again look out the passenfer window and see the same object, at about the same location, but I had traveled at least 5 miles. So I keep on driving and looking at this object every once and a while. Mountains and small towns are going by in the distance, but this objuct is always in the relative same spot in the sky out the passenger wingdow. I must have traveled another half an hour, maybe 45 minutes or so, and this abject is still inn the sky out the passenger window. I then thought if it was tracking me or something. I finally come to an exit on the highway, and I was to see if i can get closer to it. This must be at least 30 miles from where i first see it. I get off the highway and go south, finding the roads to get! me closer. I must have tried for maybe 20 minutes to get closer. I finally stop I get out of my car and take a look. It was cylinder in shape, like a soda can, with the &#34;top&#34; facing up. No wings, not a hot air balloon, not a hellicopter, did not hear any sounds of an engine. It was just hovering in the sky. Not sure if it had lights, but something was looking funny in the center of thios object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at it for 15 minutes or so, I get back into my car and continue east for Philadelphia.<n>

So we went to a a big rock across from Hanson&#39;s Park ( you can see the old ricketty rollercoaster ) around a quarter mile across.  There is a patch of hill than a stone patio next to a dock we have permission to fish from.  We decided to setup on the patio.  As we fished you could see the street light across the way by the park.  So we fished and some time later around a hour or two I noticed that the light didn&#39;t go out and seemed a little closer.  I thought nothing of it and fished some more.  Then I noticed it closer than BAM.......... I looked up in the sky and saw a Black object hoovering oh so slow above us moving toward our backside and were only 100 yards above the 60 foot treetops.  It looked like no UFOs I saw in books and other source before.  The shape was like a small triangle in front with another bigger triangle combined together. I have a attachment drawing it was all black.  As I ran to the road that circumferences the lake the craft went slowly out of sight, moving along the mountains behind the lake.  When I ran back tomy friend and  he looked bewildered ,  I said;  hey man did you see that and he just keep fishing with a sort of nod. At this I asked my friend  what time it was he said 10:30 am.. A hour or two disappeared !!  It sort of freaked me out and excited me at the same time.  Again my friend would not talked about the incident and that was that.

So i just left it alone,but I keep on remembering how bright it was and how still and quiet it was,but it was so bright and hot.<n>

Saw strange lights in NE not like regular aircraft. Am trucker, kept catching glimpse of lights thru trees as driving east. Not much traffic.  Looked over toward trees just as the bottom of the aircraft turned down to face me with one corner, just across the lanes of the westbound freeway.  Huge, silent w/laser type red rays emitted from opening that went deep inside craft. I could have parked my truck in that opening with a 2-3 others. Never heard anyone discribe one this close, nor the &#34;lasers&#34; from nose before. This is not my first UFO - but it was definately of the &#34;Closest&#34; Kind and felt ominous, not friendly as if trying to intimidate - following my movement in a slow turn (I was almost at a crawl by then)No other traffic. Then it slowly turned to the west and I could only make out the big dark triangular shape - no lights, or sound but it was out west of Portland&#39;s PDX in no time. More/next night and one month later. I couldn&#39;t get your number from the Seattle operator at the time - I tried when I got home.  They are out there often, but have lights in the shape of an airplane turned on underneath so you can barely make out the triangle shape against the sky, for the brightness of those lights. They always are headed West,NW.<n>

What was unusual about that event is that I established a grid pattern outside of the FAA grid pattern and the people who came with me to search in the Angela area found the plane only hours after we started that day.  The FAA led search had been fruitless until that seventh day when people were finally willing to listen to me.  I am a sensitive and was led to the area the plane was found by the dead pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Six months later, I am floating in the air with this white R2D2 type unit shining in my bedroom under some sort of white beam of light.  I realize I am paralyzed.  These probe type things snake out and attach to my head.  I cannot speak.  My husband is dead asleep.  I can only scream telepathically, &#34;In Jesus name, you will let me go! I command you to let me go ...&#34;  Hey, it had worked on what I perceived to be ghouls before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white unit said, &#34;Sleep.  You will sleep...&#34; in this hypnotic voice.  I told him to go to hell.  I was wide awake and we went back and forth while I commanded the thing in the name of the Eloihim and all angels to let me go.  I seemed to be floating above my bed almost to the ceiling with seven things that were making this weird   hum noise attached to my head. This goes on for some time and the mechanical voice keeps saying, &#34;Sleep ...&#34;  Suddenly, a new voice starts to speak to the angry and freaked out me who is eloquently telepathically telling this robot thing off, and it is a non-robotic, female voice.  She calms me down.  I ask her why they are doing this to me.  She says, &#34;We have heard about what you did in Jordan (the town larger than Angela) and we have come to see why you can operate on such a high frequency with your mind.&#34;  I get very calm.  I end up losing time.  I don&#39;t know anything for a time with this humming noise taking over in my brain.  She informs me they are done.  I ask her what they found.  She replies, &#34;You are ... a secret weapon.&#34;  I am a pacifist and am very disappointed by this conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I find myself tucked back into my bed and my husband still won&#39;t wake up.  I am freaking, but I go back to sleep, still feeling paralyzed.  I wake up, record the &#39;dream&#39;.  What is so strange about this is I don&#39;t believe in UFOs at all at this time.  I have a first cousin who claims she was abducted on Lolo Pass and I have always thought her a nut.  I talk to my husband only about this for years because I am confused to the core over &#39;the dream&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a sensitive, I talk to dead people.  Unfortunately, the ETs are making my life too complicated.  They put things into my dreams and I don&#39;t like it.  I feel like I&#39;m in some Star Trek episode some nights.  There are definitely a variety of them.  They seem to be extra dimensional.  I prefer a world view that includes my dead mother talking to me or a dead actor telling me he was murdered over these others who are coming through star gates or portals,  Even the little demon type beings are easier for me.  I&#39;m scared of being abducted again.  I&#39;m not afraid of no ghosts.<n>

Lights were approx, 30 degrees apart on outer surface leaving times when only 3 lights were visible.  Light appeared to be coming out of portals.  Structure of object not visible, only rotating lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Departed Salt Lake Airport by car at 2200 MDT on I-80 westbound at 75 mph toward Wendover, Nv. At 2305 driver saw what appeared to be two close, low flying aircraft, one seen as two lights and the other seen as one light approaching quickly from S.E.  Driver told passenger to look up to see jets.  No noise or visual above so driver looked to S. E. again to see the three lights now flying parallel to vehicle.  Now three lights could be seen to be rotating with more lights being added  from the one and the other two disappearing.  The lights were on the outer circumference of a disk and were rotating.  Rotation was approx. three revs during a 30 second visual.  After about 30 seconds, and into the third rev, while only one light was visible, this light went out and although we looked and looked for the lights, they were gone.  We never saw another thing.  I called HAFB to check on night aircraft operations and determined the 388 TFW was in the general area that night.  I also !checked with the Salt Lake Airport Authority and found that a movie was being filmed, using a helicopter with a camera pod below, outside Tooele, Ut., approximately 80 miles west of our sighting.  I still have not been able to correlate these activities with what we saw.The driver of the car has 33 years experience as an ((deleted)) engineer with a T.S. clearance and in general, with logic, tries to explain unusual occurances away.

It was a white circular craft. It was stationary for as far as i know around 10-20 minutes. After seeing it i was very frightened so i ran back in and told my parents... they refused to come outside and assured me it was the moon and sent me back outside to do my chore (I asked my father at a later time to make sure i wasn&#39;t dreaming and he says he remembers the instance and didn&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t go outside) I did the chore and ran back in. I remember it all very vividly. I am 100% sure that it was NOT any kind of balloon or swamp gas. Around my house was very woody and hidden away from other houses at the time. At a later time I remember walking into the laundry room and passing out for some reason. It was in the middle of the day. I was out for a good hour or so. I don&#39;t remember what made me pass out nor has that ever happend to me again.

It appeared to be one mile to the south/southeast of the campground. It remained &#39;flickering&#39; in a cross pattern, until I signaled with a flashlight, which caused it to abruptly change its pattern and speed; changing its location extremely quickly. and then coming back to its original spot and remain flickering once again. just above the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be of a spherical shape, maybe 15-20ft across, from where it was observed. The object &#39;flickered&#39; rapidly and it moved in a tight, &#39;tic tac toe&#39; like movement, intensifying in luminensce as it moved. After 30 min. object was &#39;signaled&#39; with a small flashlight, to which the object reacted by flashing brighter and moving even more erratically; much faster and farther. After, it would come back to its original position. There were no changes in color,as far as the light is concerned. I watched for about 2 hrs until I became extremely tired, even though I was very interested, and slept.

Sunday night (6/21/97) at 11:15 PM we were in the back yard watching the sky. The first thing we saw was a dim light we thought was a satellite because we see them all the time. The odd thing about this one was that as we watched it, it would get VERY bright and then fade to a dim light about every 10 sec. It did not seem to be as high as we normally see satellites. Julie began to count the approx. seconds between the bright and dim cycles. It appeared overhead and we watched it until it disappeared in the North. We are not sure if this was anything but a satellite.At 11:30 PM Julie began saying,&#34;look at that&#34;,&#34;look at that&#34;! I looked up towards the West and saw a squadron of small disk shaped objects flying in real tight formation, traveling from West to East over our heads. The moon was almost full in the SE. It seemed that the leading edge was illuminated by the moon, giving these object the appearance of a crescent shape. I estimate that there may have been 10-15 or more of these objects. The formation was irregular, not like Air Force formation flying. We watched them fade from view to the East. There was no sound and the movement was very smooth. They were possibly around 800-1000 ft. high, (this is an approximation as the sky was totally clear).I do not know if the pulsating light and the squadron had anything to do with each other, but the cluster of crescent shapes was certainly hair raising. They were moving very fast. We only saw them for about 7-9 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I have had another sighting.

It was the brightest and softest light I have ever seen.  Even though it was so bright, it didn&#39;t hurt my eyes to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about midnight on Saturday, 6/21/97, I was turning from Route 120 south onto O&#39;Plaine Road.  It was a nice, warm summer night with just a few wispy clouds and the full moon in the eastern sky.  I was looking southwest and I saw a bright white light bouncing above the treetops. I turned south onto O&#39;Plaine Road and as I drove I could just barely see the light through the trees. I turned west onto Route 137 to go to Old St. Mary&#39;s Road.  When I turned south onto Old St. Mary&#39;s Road I could clearly see that the UFO was a disc shaped object glowing with a very bright, white light.  It was the brightest and softest light I have ever seen.  Even thought it was so bright, it didn&#39;t hurt my eyes to look at it.  The light illumi- nated the trees all around it. The disc was hovering over a house on the west side of Old St. Mary&#39;s Road about a half mile south of Route 137.  When I was about a quarter mile from the disc it moved to hover over the center of the road directly ahead of me for a few seconds.  But, it didn&#39;t make a straight line to the road.  The disc made a ninety degree angle to the south and then to the center of the road.  Then it made another 90 degree angle and hovered over the left side of the road.  After a few seconds it made another 90 degree angle and returned to it&#39;s position over the house. By this time I was driving very slowly past the house and I looked up through my windshield at the disc.  I could now see that there was a vapor or haze emanating from the outermost edges of the disc.  I also noticed that there was no sound coming from the disc but I could hear nature sounds and the sound of my car.  I passed the house and drove around a curve.  At this point I couldn&#39;t see the disc or the light anymore.  I had some important things to do at home the next day or I would have stopped and looked at the disc more.  All in all, it was a very exciting and thriling sighting.<n>

We stopped the car and were just hanging out like teenagers do.  Out of no where i hear my buddy who was standing about 80 ft away start yelling and pointing up above him.  I looked over and immediately saw an oval shaped craft hovering COMPLETELY silent about 50 ft directly above his head.  It looked mettallic against the night sky with a rotating red light beneath it that was revolving in a circular motion.  It was completely still.  My jaw dropped. I ran towards my buddy and the object in complete shock and curiousity.  The two girls we were with saw it as well and paniced.  They started screaming and crying for us to leave and ran to car.  My friend and i however were nore intersted in watching it or trying to communicate with it.  As soon as i got to where my friend was standing the object shot thru the sky so fast to another point (which looked about a mile away)! that it appeared to disappear then reappear.  Once it reappered of in the distance we observed there were 2 more just like it!  They moved thru the air as if they were dancing following no particular direction.  Just moving erratically.  We stood and watched in awe for about 20 minutes until they all flew in one direction which we then noticed a larger craft that appeared to be triangle shaped with three huge bright white light at each point.  The three smaller craft (appearing as red lights at this distance now) seemed to circle around the triangle as if it was thier mothership?  They appeared to become part of the big triangle one and then split off again and again.  We watched this dance for a few more minutes in disbelief before all the objects seemed to shoot off or disappear.  One of the things that was strange is that we could hear dogs howling and barking for miles as if they were terrified or in pain?  If that makes any sense. We told everyone we knew thinking people would! be intersted, instead, we were ridiculed and made fun of.  So, we all pretty much never talked about it again.  I know what we saw. Im not crazy.  If i wouldve been alone i may have wondered if i was!  However i was with three other people who all saw the same thing.  I went back to the sight many nights after armed with a camera and patiently waited for hours sometimes but they never returned.  Most AMAZING thing ive ever experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I&#39;m an amateur astonomer. Every meteorite I have ever seen was always white never any color, a small point of light, and faster and higher elevation than this object.  The color was a failrly brilliant (almost neon) light green, it had lesser shades of yellow and white.  It seemed like I could actually see a round object rather than the normal point of light.  It was geading toward earth at a 45% angle.  There is no way it could have burned-up as it was near ground level when it dissapeared to the NE behind Black Mountain.  It was the same size and light intensity when first viewed high up in the sky.  There was an alomost full moon at the time and the sky was still somewhat light from the sunset so it&#39;s even more amazing how bright and visible this object was, as the sky was far from dark at the time.By the way, I also witnessed the UFO&#39;s near Phoenix on 3-13-97 which I never reported until now.They were due south of here, I would estimate directly over Phoenix.  It&#39;s dark sky here as there is no city lights in this rural area 30-miles north of downtown Phoenix, but bright city lights in Phoenix may explain explain why my view was so good. Plus, I am elevated here at 2,600 foot level, on the slope of Black Mountain.  My wife and I observed the 3-13-97 objects for about 20 to 30-minutes.  They were in a quarter-circle formation with 5 objects to the right and 1 object to the left of center and seperated somewhat from the other five. They were much larger than a star or airplane lights.  The were round and glowing a steady white light.  They were heading very slowly from west to east, almost hovering in the sky and just barely moving.  They did not lose any altitude at all.  This eliminates them being flares or baloons like I heard the military said they may have been.  Plus they were flying in a well defined and steady geometrical formation. After about 15-minutes som!e of the objects simply starteddisappearing, almost light they turned their lights off.  After 10 to 30-minutes they all seemed to have disappeared from view.  It&#39;s not like they moved out of sight, butb they seemed to have simply &#34;blinked-off&#34;.  There is no way they could be airplanes, far too slow and almost stationary.  They could not be flares as they lost no altitude at all during the entire time.  Plus, I believe they were close enough to make out the object, rather than just a point of light.  They were all equal size round white objects, except the on to the left of center was seperated from th others and may have been a little larger than the other five to the right of center.  All six were flying in a quarter circle formation and curved in a perfect geometrical arch.There is no other explanation for this than UFO&#39;s.  Being an amateur astonomet I view the night sky all the time and have never seen anything like my sightings of March 13 and June 20, 1997.My wife also witnessed the 3-13 sighting and her version is exactly the same as mine.<n>

We were driving on the NJ turn pike-black horse pike, all wooded area very late/early in am mabye around 1-2 am, and I CLEARLY visually saw a round saucer hovering slowly while spinning at a slow rate as well in front of out car and above so I had a angle to see it clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said &#34;Mom look what is that&#34; she looks at it and looks startled and says &#34; yea there&#39;s a military base over there, there probably testing&#34; what I saw so many years ago at th age of 11 which has not left my memory unlike alot of other things I can easily forget bc of the elapsed time.  The saucer shaped craft has fluorescent lights around it, of greens, blues, and yellows.  They were sort of pulsating strobing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the craft was so close about alil bit over tree level that I could see the shape and color of the craft, which was a metallic based saucer with a dome shaped top.  It was the first and only UFO I have seen since and had written down and drawn my account of the events bc I knew how serious it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I bring it up to my mom she still says she remembers it, but says she just said the military base excuse because she really was unsure herself and never believed in UFO&#39;S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was like a orange light behind a vapor or cloud. It was headed south also very slow and was maybe 100 ft or so off the ground. I slowed down and pulled over to the shoulder of the road to grab my bonoculars. Before I picked them up the object split into two objects then came back together as one. When I focused the bonoculars on the orb it blinked out. With bonoculars you can see an object( plane or helicopter ) even with the lights off but this object was completly gone. I was very surprised. But what makes this stranger is that about 4 months later I was moving from Roswell Georgia to another part of Roswell about 5 miles away. It was about 2:00am when I was driving south on hwy 9 when shockingly I saw the same object directly over hwy 9 about 75-100 ft in the air! It was kind of pulsating behind that same vapor or cloud. I drove twards it and slowed down and stopped directly under it. There was no sound, it was just floating very slowly maybe 1-3 miles per hour. I jumped in my car and drove home as fast as I could which was only about 2 miles away to get my bonoculars again but when I got back it was gone. I wish I would have stayed to see where it went or what it did. I swear to you what I am telling you really happened. Thank you for your service because there is really not to many people I could tell about that event. PS if you need any volunteers to help out in any way with your company please e-mail me and let me know. Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

I kept driving, I stop the truck, got out, I watch the 3 clustered lights as it headed northeast  and it started to gain altitude, I thought a first this was a airplane or helicopter, but it made no sound or no running lights, very little traffic at 12:35 am.  Speed was about 35 to 40 mph,  then, it started picking up speed, at about that time it was over Outlook Wa. About 80 sec. had passed, I watch it as it headed for  Hanford Wa. a total of about 5 min. had passed since I first saw the ufo, I was about to lose sight of it,  the lights started to pulsate, the lights were very bright now as they pulsated. then I lost sight of it. I&#39;m guessing it was about 30 miles away.the radio and tv tower lights  near Yakima Wa. is about 25 miles and I could see them very  clearly<n>

Hale Bopp was behind me to the right, low in the sky. I looked up at the stars and a bright white light appeared high in the sky. It slowly began moving to the left and at the same time dimmed to a faint yellow. The light became so dim that I could barely make it out. It came to a stop then it suddenly reappeared as a sharp point of white light. The light began rotating around in a circle a yellow light then appeared opposite of the white. As  both lights were spinning clockwise a blue light turned on giving the impression of a multicolored ring. the glowing ring then quickly rose up towards the stars and dissappeared. My friend asked me if I had seen that and I couldn&#39;t reply. I didn&#39;t want to blink. The lights made no sound so the noise of an approaching jet blinking in the distance startled me.<n>

I read on another ufo website about other things that ring true to what happened as well as the aftermath. sometimes i know things before they happen and i have deep seated fear of aliens and the dark.<n>
6/17/97 01:30|Petaluma|CA|Light|3 minutes|The object, which was about 30 degrees above the horizon and towards the south, moved.

It shot from its stationary position at a speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was after midnight, about 1:30 A.M., the 17th of June, 1997. I went out to the deck to have a smoke. The moon was below the horizon and the night sky was very dark. Because of the lack of moonlight the stars shone very brightly. While I was looking at the stars I noticed what seemed to be a flashing white star moving across the sky. This object was a great distance away and had no red or green lights. It was just a flashing white object. The object was due east and almost directly overhead. It was at an 80 degree angle of elevation. I called to my brother to come and take a look at it. After he stepped out on the deck he noticed a different object. It was much closer, approximately 2 to 5 miles away. It was a very bright, luminescent white. It appeared to be fixed in the sky. He pointed directly at this object and I looked where he pointed. He started to say, &#34;Hey what&#39;s that over there?&#34; He managed to get out just the &#34;Hey...&#34; part. The object, which was about 30 degrees above the horizon and towards the south, moved. It shot from its stationary position at a speed faster than either of us have ever seen anything move. It flew parallel to the fence in the backyard and was gone, our further view of it blocked by the house. Just as this object, which appeared to be about the size of a loaf of french bread, dissapeared from sight, we saw way off in the sky a shooting star and right away a second one.  Neither of us spoke a word for the next few minutes. We were, it&#39;s hard to put into words, we were both stunned, shocked.  It was so bright and moved so fast.  We stayed out for about another half an hour and speculated as to what it could possibly have been. We both had the impression that whatever it was, somehow it was aware of the fact that we were aware of it. The fact that it shot off like that just as my brother pointed to the object to bring it to my attention seemed so weird.  We tried to find out if anyone else had seen anything at all like what we&#39;d seen that night without any luck.<n>

It appeared out of nowhere and disappeared the same way lasting only seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was one white lite object, not having a smooth surface of light coming from it. It appeared above our mountain, approximately 300 yards above the mountain, and about a half a mile away from us. It flew fast to the right, and disappeared into nowhere.  No mountain, no clouds, no nothing!  My husband has never seen a UFO before seeing this one.  He found it very amazing.  I have had four sighting since moving here to Oregon.  Three in this area, and one in Williams, OR.  Not to mention one in Fountain Valley, CA, and one in Las Vegas, Nevada.  My husband and I work for ((employer deleted)).  We both have different interest.  I am interested in UFO&#39;s and other paranormal.  My husband has no interest in it whatsoever.<n>

I know that sounds crazy, but I never had anything to fear and always preferred the night over the day.  I probably should have reported this years ago, but everyone I told thought I was crazy.  I had stopped to take a breather and was watching a strange shaped aircraft that I assumed to be an experimental craft of the military.  It must&#39;ve taken it some time to get there, but I next remember seeing a saucer shaped object hovering over the trees across the clearing from me.  I could see beings that looked like children with big heads peering through the windows at me.  I wanted to run, but I felt a hand on my shoulder.  I spun around to face a little man with big black eyes and grey skin, I think people call them the Grays.  I was paralized with fear, but he said words in a language that I could understand.  He told me that I have to find the others.  He said that they would be able to answer a simple question that we are born with the knowledge of:  Who are the sisters?  I know the correct answer and now I make my plea to the world, if you know the answer contact me @ ((e-address deleted)). The next thing I remember after he told me this was waking up in my bed.

It was raining and heavy lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During a very bright lightning strike I noticed a black triangle shaped craft moving slowly towards me about a football field above the highway.   We were the only vehicle on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my son up to see the object just then the radio started to whine (I listen to AM radio stations) the lights of the vehicle went dim.  I rolled down the window even though it was raining and try to hear any sounds the object was silent.  Everytime a lightning strike took place I could see it much clearer each corner of the craft had a light (red, white and blue).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object came even with the hood of the car my car stopped dead on the highway.  My son and I leaned out the window in the rain and watched it move right over top of us.  It was huge I felt like I could touch it with my hand it was so low (illusion due to size)!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It eventually moved away and everything in my vehicle turned back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still feel the amazing sensation of that encounter even today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a highway in a state I was not familiar with so I can&#39;t tell you the name of the nearest town but I remember the big lake very well.<n>

Me and 2 of my other friends was out on a over night fishing trip which we did often at my fathers place of residence.  We was cat fishing and talking about school things of that nature.  We had even made a camp fire.  We were all sitting together when we all noticed a red light moving towards us.  We thought it was a plane at first because my father lives by our local airport here in Mena AR.  The craft was moving torward the south.  It was at tree top level and and triangler but huge!  I will never forget it.  Flew right over us and we watched it in shock in aww.  The weird thing is I can&#39;t remember it flying to me but after it was over me and moving away.  I truely believe I have some lost time I cannot for.  I know I&#39;m not crazy! Anyhow the object looked triangler but on the back of the craft there was 5 cylinders I believe was the engines. It made no sound!  But you could actually see a whitish ligh! t glowing out of theses 5 cylinders. With a red light at tip pulsing .  I still picture it perfect in my mind to this day.  My 2 other friends would never talk about it at the time.  They might now its been a few years.  I have this feeling I can&#39;t shake, that they had had a terriable experience .  so that&#39;s my story maybe you can help me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was really excited right after they told me this becuase I had never seen anything remotly like a UFO, so I ran outside with them to witness it for myself if they had come around. I then asked them, while waiting for something else to happen, what exactly they had seen. My brother told me that they had seen a green light hovering over the hills to the west of my house, and that it had stayed there for quite a few minutes. After watching it they had seen it streek across the sky to the right in a perfect line and had actually left a trail for a few seconds. He also told me that his friend had been driving to my house right before this happened and he had said that his CD players and radia had mysteriously played the CD backwards! Backwards!! Then the radio made noise&#39;s and then turned off. After he told me this it was a few more minutes that I myself had seen the lights in the sky. I was looking somewhere else when my brother yelled to me that he saw it again and pointed to me where the direction it was at. I looked up and there was a bright green light in the sky. I watched it rise above the hill and stay there for a couple minutes, It then streaked across the sky VERY fast and left a line behind it for a few seconds. It went across the horrizon in seconds. I then saw it reappear again near the same area, a little bit higher this time. Then the same thing happened but it streaked towards the ground and then across the horrizon. We then waited for about five minutes more and it had acctually appeard above us and had a sound to it this time. It was really fast and the sound sorta sounded like a crackling sound and a wisk kinda sound. After that I didnt see anything else, but days after I had heard other people saw it and even said they had seen things in that area before.<n>

We were in an open field, no moon, so dark you could not see where you were walking. At the time I had a Starlight Scope with an attached IR light.  As I looked around through the scope, I could see animal eyes, deer, coyotes, rabits, etc., glowing in the dark from the IR light source.  Then I decided to look up into the moonless night sky.  I turned off the IR. Now and then I could see an airliner moving high overhead.  To idintify the airliner, I looked at it with the Starlight Scope (2.5 X) and then noticed I could see the flashing nav. light.  Without the scope it was difficult to see the flashing nav. light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, almost straight overhead I noticed another dot of light moving west.  When I examined this light there was no flashing nav. light.  At first I thought it was a satilite, however, the dot of light changed direction and proceeded somewhat south then east, then back west to a point about 50 degrees off the horizon. I constantly checked this dot with my Starlight Scope and still no flashing nav. light. The dot of light then remained locked in position with the stars and slowly dimmed out.  I belive the object became dim because it was moving away from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusion:  This has to be a UFO in the true meaning of the word.  It was not an airliner nor a satilite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was outside in my back yard, looking at the clear sky and I saw a bright &#34;star&#34; (or so I thought). For the first couple of seconds it was still, but then it slowly started moving west and started getting a bit brighter and slightly larger at the same time, like it was getting closer until it was about double the size of the avg. star you see. If you were to hold a ruler up to the sky and measure the distance it traveled in inches, I&#39;d say it moved about an inch-inch and a half. It continued moving for only around 5 seconds and then just like that it was gone. It didn&#39;t leave a trail or anything, it just blinked into nothingness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

I do not see my report, I guess I&#39;ll send again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On two separate occasions when I was 16 years old, in the summer of 1997, I saw green glowing fireballs in the woods of Lawton, Michigan.  Something got me thinking about it again--every once in awhile when I wonder about it, I will do a search for &#34;fireballs&#34; &#34;ball lightning&#34; and &#34;swamp gas&#34; and the pictures and descriptions I find don&#39;t really describe what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw.  I know it absolutely terrified me because I didn&#39;t know what it was, and it seemed to move with an intelligence, that is what really frightened me.  That it did not seem to be moving randomly or as something seen in nature, but like it was exploring and moving in a very deliberate way around the trees--up very high, down very low, close to our window, farther away.  Each time, there were 2+ balls, although I can&#39;t say exactly how many, because we were in a! cabin looking out the window and not getting a full vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically we were frozen in fear in our beds, watching out the window.  The approximate size of the balls I would compare to an appliance like an average size washer or dryer or stove.  Even just writing about it and thinking about it makes me feel a little freaked out.  I just did not get a good impression from these things.  Both times we saw it, it was sometime between midnight and 1 am, when we were staying up late talking with the lights out.  Both times we watched for awhile until we had the courage to jump up and turn the lights on (with the lights on you couldn&#39;t see out the window into the blackness).  Both times I checked the woods behind the cabin the next morning, and saw nothing but the most unremarkable leaves, trees, brambles...completely homogeneous, unremarkable woods for as far as you could see!!

I  am 43 years old and living in NC. I spent the first 41 years of my life in NY. I have been hiding a secret since 1997 and I cannot live with this anymore. I  am afraid if I tell anyone what happened to me they will think I’m crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1997 I was living in Patchogue Long Island. I was driving to my girlfriend ((girl&#39;s name deleted)) house traveling north on rout 112 by a small wooded area with my windows open. At about 9pm   I noticed an unusually large bright orange sphere in the sky to my front right. It was only visible through the top of my front windshield.  I  thought it was a star or a planet at first but as I slowed down to look closer it looked like it was getting bigger.  I remember closing and opening my eyes to make sure I wasn’t seeing spots or hallucinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then stopped my car and turned my radio down so I could concentrate on the object and as I watched I noticed that it wasn’t getting bigger it was getting closer. At that point I knew I was witnessing something incredible. I was in total shock. The object was perfectly round, I tried to hear if it was making noise but I couldn’t tell because my engine was running. It was glowing and it was coming straight toward me. It was about 15-20 feet in diameter and it stopped  at my front right  about 10 feet from my car. It was at that time I realized It was studying me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I realized it’s focus was on me I became terrified. I slammed my foot on the gas to try and get away but it started following me by staying in front of my car no matter how fast I was going. I knew then that it was capable of getting me no matter how fast I  went. I noticed a gas station coming up on my right. As soon as I got closer to the gas station it started moving further away from me in  front of my car and started blinking on and off. It disappeared  then reappeared higher in the sky. It did this about four or five times. Its last appearance was directly in front of the road by the gas station. It then shot up until it was no longer visible from the drivers seat of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept driving toward my girlfriends house at a high rate of speed, I still thought I was in danger until I arrived at her house. I parked in front and sat in my car for a minute or two to get myself together. I decided not to tell anyone and spent the rest of the night in a daze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was working as a supervisor on the day shift in a mail sorting warehouse. One of my employees and also a friend that worked there would always talk about aliens and UFO’s. I always poked fun at him and made jokes about it. If anyone would believe what happened to me it would be him. The day after my experience I went to work at 8am and waited for David to come in. I then told him in confidence what happened and he suggested we go back to the location to look for any evidence. We looked in the wooded area where I first saw the sphere but there was none. We went to the gas station where I last saw the object to get some coffee and the clerk overheard our conversation about the incident and told us that he had witnessed the same thing. He described the object to a tee and said he had seen it appear and reappear for at least 15 minutes blinking on and off over and over again. I was so relieved to know I wasn’t crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since then I have had some strange experiences that I cannot explain. I’m having a very hard time with this and am in need of help.

6/15/97 21:00|Seattle|WA|Triangle|1 min|Saw triangle craft, news report says space junk, not from my angle.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63263.html|78|ndxe199706| Saw triangle craft, news report says space junk, not from my angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving north on 15th Ave Ne near Northgate Mall when she called my attention to a triangle pattern of three white lights, one at each corner, not far above us, maybe 200 yards in a diagonal line of sight. It was clear the lights were part of one solid object although it was too far to make out any details of the craft. I had been living in the Seattle area for all of my 28+ years at the time including living next to the Renton airport for several years. I have seen many types of aircraft from commercial to fighter planes and this looked nothing like anything I had seen before. The sunroof  was open when she let out what I would guess is the usual reaction: “what the!”. I am one who looks for a logical explanation when confronted with something I can’t immediately explain and figured at first glance it was a stealth fighter. I had seen one at about the same distance but I immediately realized that there was no sound. Stealth technology may make these planes almost invisible on radar but when I saw one it was far from silent. Also, there were only the three white lights. No red and blue warning lights that you see on a typical airplane. We both had a very eerie feeling as we couldn’t make sense of it. When we got home that night we saw on the news that “strange lights” were seen in the Seattle area that night and were dismissed as space debris from a falling satellite that crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Ok, a plausible explanation except we were heading north and the object was heading from west to east at that point, and that’s a really long way to get to the Pacific.  I can’t imagine space debris is capable of changing direction. I have since seen footage of an old Russian satellite that fell out of orbit a few years back and was filmed by a fishing boat crew as it came down and burned up in the atmosphere. It looked nothing like what we saw. Three lights in a triangular pattern that appeared to be one object, flying low and slow with no running noise. I am one who p! refers t o go from A to B instead of A to Alien but what we saw was very similar to video footage I have seen on tv of  triangle shaped objects with three or more lights on the bottom.. The lights were evenly spaced and were moving very slowly, but being one who prefers a rational explanation,I probably would have accepted the news explanation and forgotten about it. The fact they said it landed in the Pacific when what we saw it CLEARLY heading east has always bothered me, that and I am 99.9% sure what I saw was not space debris. I have searched a couple of databases (yours and MUFON) but haven’t seen anything else that sounds like what we saw. Enough people saw it that it was mentioned on the news but I cant find any other reports. I am not sure what year it was, only that it was between 1995 and 1998.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I do remember the actual incident quite vividly, though, and will do my best to describe it. I was driving north on highway 315. As I approached the exit to get on Bethel Road, I noticed a dark object moving overhead heading south/south-west. It seemed to be &#34;gliding&#34; slowly overhead, quietly, quite aways away, yet close enough that I could estimate it as being maybe 3-4 car-lengths in size. In the dusk sky light available, it appeared to be dark (black or dark grey) in color. It was still very clear out so I&#39;m positive it was a triangular craft of which I&#39;d never seen before at that time. I must mention that I was driving a convertible car with the top off so I did in fact get a clear view of the object. There were many other cars on 315 and on Bethel Road at the time so I&#39;d be surprised if no others saw it too. I only wish I&#39;d had a camera with me then. At first, I thought it was some experimental craft being tested from the nearby OSU airport on West Case Road, which is located a few miles away from where I saw the craft. It wasn&#39;t until I started seeing similar triangular UFO sightings in books and on television that I realized the craft I saw wasn&#39;t some local aircraft project. The image of the craft that was photographed in the Belgium sighting was almost identical to the one I saw, the only difference being the one I saw didn&#39;t have lights shining underneath each corner, perhaps because the sky was fairly still light outside. Not until I came across this site did I feel there was a neutral way for me to report my sighting without being ridiculed. Please honor my privacy and don&#39;t release my name.

However, just as I was about to ignore it, the three objects &#34;faded&#34; away in unison, and reappeared in the same fashion in a nearby area in the sky. The objects continued this &#34;shifting&#34; in apparently random orders every six or seven seconds.

Odd collection of hues on this orb. I would only like to add that the same type of orb was witnessed again almost 1 year later in Virginia, 2 miles south outside of D.C. at about 2 am on April 20(approximation) of 1998. Orb was moving in a south ward direction just in front, don&#39;t just how far, of me. It was up in the sky moving south and then took a quick upward direction a such great speed and disapeared behind ? blackness of the night sky. Must note that it was a clear cold night and I had just got off work. Perhaps this orb has the ability to move inter-dimentionaly. It just vanished into nothing as far as I could see. Perhaps it docked or crossed into another dimention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note--This is an anonymous report.))<n>

I was living in a very rural area. I steped out on the back deck one summer afternoon for some fresh air. As I was standing there my hair begin to feel as it was standing on end. I started looking around. The sky was clear with only wispy small clouds. As I looked east I noticed two clouds ended in a curved line. I also noticed a distorted look to the sky in that area about 100&#39; in diameter. I call two friends outside. As they came out there was a loud buzz and a blast of hot air. The leaves on the trees about 200&#39; from our position rolled and turn up as if exposed to heat. They never recovered and died. My friends asked what was that to which I had no reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date appears to be approximate.

I have never formally reported it, but it did get me interested in the UFO Phenomena because even though I am skeptical of UFO&#39;s I do in fact know that people really do see things in the sky.  I do not know if they are extraterrestrial, but I do know that people honestly do see things they cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting happened on a nice warm sunny day.  My girlfriends house was right next to a park and the fenceline was shared with the park.  I looked up as we were sitting outside and she was clipping her dogs hair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw in plain sight a chrome looking egg shaped craft which was highly reflective and travelling at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about the size of a couch and made no noise whatsoever.  It was slightly higher than a telephone pole in height and wasn&#39;t but about 50 yards away.

I got up and walked to a different vantage point so that I could see it again, but I could not find it in my field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that is what I saw, and it feels good to finally report it.<n>

I exited her house through the garage. My motorcycle was sitting in the driveway and I was approaching it to get on it and start it up. It was then I noticed a strange object in the sky. At first I mainly saw lights. Her house sat on the top of a hill. The object was not any more than a few hundred feet off of the ground. the area of the ground it was hovering over was down hill from me. It slowly moved closer to my location making no noise. I could then make out the shape. It was a saucer shaped object that was taller in the middle. classic flying saucer shape. Now, in the middle of the disk area on the side there where lights of a few different colors: red white green yellow and a brownish red. The colors seemed to alternate as it hovered there. I remember just standing there frozen staring at this thing. when it started to turn at an angle almost perpindicular to the ground but not quite perfectly perpendicular. as it moved to this angle there was a crude mechanical sound coming from it. it sounded alot like an espresso machine when it is pumping water through the coffee. once it was at the terminal point of its turn it was once again silent. then, no kidding, it emitted a beam of yellowish light onto the ground. at this point it was probably 50 feet in front of me. then the light stopped and the mechanical sound started again. As the sound was going it returned to a parallel position in respect to the ground. It hovered there for a little less than a minute then suddenley there was a sound that sounded like a bottle rocket when it takes off as it shot straight up into the air. It went upward so quickly that I only saw it for a split second. It left so quickly that I bareley saw it. so I looked around and noticed that about 15 feet away the neighbor, an older woman about my girlfriend&#39;s mom&#39;s age, was working in her garden and she was still staring in the direction of the very strange and very scary sight. She looked at me and said, &#34;that was probably a helicopter&#34;. I looked away from her, than just said, &#34;yeah&#34;. I got on my motorcycle, started it, and rode home. yep, most people think I&#39;m crazy when I tell them about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

When I looked right in front of me was a giant saucer shaped U.F.O. It was over a house that was across the street. It was still and made no noise. It was silent and had no wings and the second I saw it I knew it was no man made. I ran from side to side it was compleatly shaped like a saucer. My bike was on the other side so I turned around and got my bike.When I got it I heared the Helicoter going out of control.

I initially felt calm, but the more I processed the event the more I felt scared and started to panic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as my mom came outside and I ran inside the house because I was too scared to stay outside(I was a teenager at the time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two minutes, I went back outside to see if it was still there and then watched it bounce away in the same way it approached our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then faded away by gradually getting smaller and disappearing (it didn&#39;t fly away, it just disappeared/faded into the blackness of the night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I was not college educated then, I am now, and have never seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When I read it, something which happened to me finally clicked. (But I still have NO IDEA what it was).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sleeping, and suddenly I was awake.  I could see my VCR clock flashing in the dark, and the street light shining gently in the window from the next block. Sudeenly I felt wierd, and I found that I couldn&#39;t move. I was mostly paralyzed except for my face. I felt like someone or something was doing this to me. It also seemed like there was light in the room, but how was totally unclear...a moment before it had been pretty dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was only thinking &#34;ghost&#34;, not &#34;aliens&#34;. I really felt a presence. I began to get very angry, and something in me told me that this was my only defense. I nursed the feeling, and then when I was seething mad in my mind, whatever it was let go. The room was dark and silent again. I jumped up. Even though I strongly felt like this had been a ghost of some sort, something in me made me look out the window, and I discovered that it was unusually windy to my surprise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For years I passed it off as a ghost, but now I have second thoughts. Three years earlier I lived in Pine Bush/Walker Valley, a major UFO hotspot...where I had lived for 9 years.  While living there, I had never had an experience like this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

We were running dogs all night and stopped at the end of a road in the woods about a 1/2 mile or so off the bee line express way. It was early morning around 1 am or so. We were sitting down smoking a cigarette when I looked up and ask my friend what that was in the sky. The stars were everywhere but one was quite bigger than the rest it was blue and had to be four times larger than any other star. I started flashing my maglight at it. For about 5 minutes. Then it just took off and went to the size of all the other stars in a matter of seconds with 4 or 5 littler red lights following it. It just stayed there after that. I told my friend that was really wild . We couldnt see the red ones after they took off but I could still see the same blueish star that was much closer just a few seconds ago. My friend was just blowing it off but I knew anything we had couldnt have moved like that. We sat there for about  fifteen to twenty minutes talking then my friend wanted to go home which was a bout a mile away. So we started walking back I heard a hovering sound I will never forget wasnt loud just different. I turned around and Saw a red shape above the tree tops at the end of the pasture It had a star like light below about 50 feet and it just stayed perfectly still. Then without a change in sound it just moved left then right. It was big It was cigar shaped the light below it moved like it was part the craft but you could tell it wasnt attached. We never heard it approach or seen anything around it just appeared out of no where. I wanted to walk to the tree line where it was but wouldnt go alone and my friend just wanted to get out of there. So we walked through the woods back to his place. When we got to his house we looked over in that direction and you could see a light a little smaller than a dime red in tint with a light just below it. It is very hard to put into words what we actually saw that night but believe me it wasnt right. It took me this long to w! rite abo ut it. but it was like it happened yesterday. I never believed the stories about ufo sightings until this happened to me. To me there is no other explination for it. You can try and say it was something man made but you were not there to see what I saw.<n>
6/15/97 01:00|Peoria|IL|Disk|3 minutes|Two people see UFO hovering at a distance of 10 feet.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76907.html|99|ndxe199706| Two people see UFO hovering at a distance of 10 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard Peter Davenport on the 07-29-10 episode of Coast to Coast AM and decided to submit my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Headline: UFO at a stone&#39;s throw  This story takes place in 1992 in Illinois.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were parked facing north at night in the summer on a small concrete bridge over a small creek in rural Illinois.  We were not quite ready to go home and wanted to continue our conversation about &#34;girlfriends.&#34;  The weather was cloudy and misty.  We could see sheet lighting in the distance.  My car windows had droplets of water on them.  I sat in the driver&#39;s seat, my friend sat in the passenger&#39;s seat of my Ford Escort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The creek bridge had cement guardrails that were almost perfectly level with where the car windows started.  I suspect this was a purposeful choice by the architect. The road continued on north to a T-section about 1/4 down the road.  Beyond that intersection was a large hill that spanned for miles in each direction.  Approach to the creek bridge was as if going down a slight hill, and the incline continued on for awhile and then began sloping up again toward the T-section.  We were of a slightly higher altitude than the cornfields directly to the left and right front of us that bordered the creek.  The border of the creek was a slight hill that blocked view of the field beyond to our right (2 o&#39;clock).  Over our right shoulders at about 4 o&#39;clock (direction), was four-story tall mound/hill left over from an old gravel pit that had trees and brush all over it.  This mound followed the other creek border for about a half a mile to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So from our perspective, we could not see the field to our right front, nor see beyond over the hill over our right shoulders.  The creek was essentially bordered on both sides with land that stretched out as far as the eye could see.  It was here that we watched the lighting in the distance.   I could see the lightening from tens of miles away over the top of the distant hills, but there was additional light coming from closer up.  At first I just dismissed it as ball lighting, but I could see the light illuminating the mist just above the hill.  I could not see into the field where the light seemed to be coming from, just the effects of the light on the trees on the border of the creek.  I stopped my friend from talking and said, &#34;Friend, why is that lightening going on and off with a beat.  Nature is not that exact.&#34;  I began snapping my fingers to the rate of the light from the field going on and off.  On, snap, off, snap.  It was a perfect beat (I am a musician).  I tol! d my friend to roll down his window and just as the window rolled down, a craft popped out from behind the hill.  It was level with us, and we were approximately at most 10 ft from the craft.  I could have easily jumped on top of the craft from the side of the bridge without straining myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was speechless.  At the time I was morally opposed to the idea of alien spacecraft.  My family were strict Christians who specifically were taught at our denomination that humans on Earth were the only organic life in the universe.  I was 100% against the ideas of aliens existing.  Yet, here before me and my friend was this totally silent craft, about the size of a large SUV, hovering, silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I broke the silence by startling loudly, &#34;THAT IS NOT A UFO!&#34;  At the time that I said that, the craft was just a little past us.  The craft was almost directly to our right, but a little farther past us at that point.  It abruptly changed course (as if it heard me) and either turned off its lights, put on a cloaking device or did something else because it seemed to just go right into the opposite hill, but more likely it just went &#34;dark.&#34;  I revved up my engine and drove away very fast.  My perspective on everything had just come crashing down in one fell swoop of time no more than 3 minutes long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got to my house, where my friend&#39;s car was, and he asked me to follow him back home (because he was too freaked out to go over that bridge alone).  So I followed him home.  By the time I got back to the bridge, my fear had gone down, and I was filled with wonder.  The storm had passed, so I parked on the bridge again alone, turned on a Cure CD and sat Indian style on the roof of my car, searching the landscape and the sky for anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing.  Silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly, it was from that moment on that I started to experience the phenomenon known as &#34;synchronicity.&#34;  As I drove back to my house that night, I though, &#34;what if when I get home my family has been abducted!&#34;  I got home and went to my parent&#39;s bedroom and listened for breathing.  Nothing, so I turned on the light and the bed was empty and made, at like 2 a.m.!  I ran to my sister&#39;s rooms and they were all empty too.  I was freaked out so I just collapsed in bed, thinking in the morning this will all be resolved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke to a call from my mother that the family left town unexpectedly that evening to visit relatives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of the craft:  Closure took over in my perception of the craft, so my brain processed the craft as looking like the time machine in Back to the Future (big fan at the time).  It was the only way my brain could process a floating silent vehicle, that and it also did look a lot like that craft.  It had a metallic brushed reflective surface, with an area like a car where the &#34;people&#34; were transported, and then a front and back section much like our engine and trunk section.  It as the classic saucer shape, but without the dramatic flaring sides.   It had lights in various places on the exterior but it all happened so fast and I was so stunned that I couldn&#39;t tell you the exact placement, but my friend who had no such &#34;stunned&#34; effect because he was already a believer, said he saw lights in the back, front, top and bottom of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For now, any contact, I would prefer it to be done via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident in 1992 is approximate.

I do not see my report, I guess I&#39;ll send again.  On two separate occasions when I was 16 years old, in the summer of 1997, I saw green glowing fireballs in the woods of Lawton, Michigan.  Something got me thinking about it again--every once in awhile when I wonder about it, I will do a search for &#34;fireballs&#34; &#34;ball lightning&#34; and &#34;swamp gas&#34; and the pictures and descriptions I find don&#39;t really describe what I saw.  I don&#39;t know what I saw.  I know it absolutely terrified me because I didn&#39;t know what it was, and it seemed to move with an intelligence, that is what really frightened me.  That it did not seem to be moving randomly or as something seen in nature, but like it was exploring and moving in a very deliberate way around the trees--up very high, down very low, close to our window, farther away.  Each time, there were 2+ balls, although I can&#39;t say exactly how many, because we were in a! cabin looking out the window and not getting a full vantage point.  Basically we were frozen in fear in our beds, watching out the window. The approximate size of the balls I would compare to an appliance like an average size washer or dryer or stove.  Even just writing about it and thinking about it makes me feel a little freaked out. I just did not get a good impression from these things.  Both times we saw it, it was sometime between midnight and 1 am, when we were staying up late talking with the lights out.  Both times we watched for awhile until we had the courage to jump up and turn the lights on (with the lights on you couldn&#39;t see out the window into the blackness).  Both times I checked the woods behind the cabin the next morning, and saw nothing but the most unremarkable leaves, trees, brambles...completely homogeneous, unremarkable woods for as far as you could see!!  This location was in the woods near Bankson Lake in Lawton, MI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I heard that it had 4 lights on each side and was very large.  They called the local police and they came to see what it was.  When they got there they made everyone go inside and reported on the scanner that they had no idea what it was.I also heard from another friend that his mother was driving home from work several days ago .  She was traveling from Grove City to Slippery Rock (PA).  As she was leaving the city she saw this thing in the sky that was black and huge. A blue beam came from the object and it followed her all the way to Slippery Rock (5miles).  I am trying to get names and info. from the local police. When I do I will email you.<n>

People always look at us like we&#39;re crazy but we are two perfectly sane educated people. My cousin who I was spending my summer with in orlando well we were outside in her backyard. We were in the pool late just talking, looking at stars and I remember telling her how in south fl you can&#39;t see them the same way. We just kept looking up and we thought we were seeing a shooting star so we got all excited. I remember we were facing west. And then the star seem to just race toward us. It was coming straight at us. We were so frightened we got out of the pool and I remember just seeing this light above us. White round light it was like a sun but smaller and very quiet and I remember that we just got so scared that we ran in the house screaming. Now that I think back the light did not shine on anything else. It was like not shining on no other surface. We! ran in her room. The weird part was that we screamed so loud and no one came out to see If we were ok. It was like it was so quiet that we just didn&#39;t even make noise when we were screaming. I remember feeling tired and then it was the next day. Honestly that&#39;s all I remember till this day. That light, that star and I just wonder if anyone has seen anything like this? I can&#39;t explain it but I need to know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I am reporting is more than one sight but years apart.  I am telling the truth , if you believe me its your choice but I wouldnt be on here unless it was worth sharing or I felt like it had to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started when I was younger, around 6.  My family and I were moving ( we moved a lot due to my dads job) we were in Texas, lost.  Looking for road signs or what ever we could my dad pointed out that the sky was black, and there were lights hovering over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over and got out and it hovered there for another minute or so before it took off, when it took off it was gone with a blink of an eye like it had never been there before.  Looking back on it it&#39;s almost hard to remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that we seen another siting in FL, PA, CA and OR.  Ever since the first one I have had dreams, I can&#39;t describe them I just know its about them.  When I was younger they were worse, it felt like they were watching me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it sounds nuts.  The dreams probably mean nothing, but the sitings are real.  We got one on film and took to an expert that agreed it was a UFO.  I just thought this was worth sharing, so maybe someone with a similar experiance doesn&#39;t feel half nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

What compelled me to write was that a) I am a journalist, and you talked about why journalists don&#39;t report, and b) I heard a woman from Phoenix talk about how a laser shot down from a craft she observed in 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the date I witnessed the craft I saw, although I could do more research if you are really interested, but I think it might have been June, 1995 or possibly, June 1997. I remember that one of the Batman movies was premiering because I thought this triangular shaped black object might be advertisubg that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 4 pm... and I was sitting in the living room of my apartment, which was situated on the thrid floor of a condo adjacent to Beverly Hills. I happened to notice an object in the sky, off to the east, which I realized was not moving. After several minutes of glancing back and forth at this object, I went to get my binoculars. The object was standing practically still and it was a black tiangular shape. When I peered at it through the binoculars, I saw what I recall as orange lights along the bottom side of the craft. I tried to phone the Beverly Hills Police department, but they were not interested. They refered me elsewhere and before it was over, I&#39;d phoned the LAPD, Beverly Hills Police, and a military base, recomended to me by whomever I spoke to at the police station. The amazing thing was no one seemed to believe me. I remember wanting to got get a neighbor to see, but I was afraid that if I left this object, it would dissappear and when I brought someone back, they would think I was nuts. So I stayed put. I had no film in the camera...which I cursed myself for...so all I could do was watch. The amazing thing was that I seemed to be the only one to see it. I remember asking some one from the police department to &#39;just go outside and look!&#39; and they acted as if I were nuts. Towards the end of the experience, I saw a laser type beam come from the craft down... and because I had been in this apartment during the Northridge Earthquake, and saw the power plant expolode and all the lights flash on and off, I felt as if the beam was going down to where the power plant was. That made me wonder if somehow this craft had to gain power from the transformers there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 40 minutes, this simply dissapeared. One minuet I saw it, and the next, I did not.

I have done this route hundreds of times and as i turned a certain corner i saw a light hovering in the sky. Instantly i thought it was a police helicopter with its search light on although the light was not sweeping. As i drove closer the light was still fixed in the same point in the sky, the light was bright about 150 metres up and i could not make out a shape due to the light. At this point i started to become more inquisitive and slowed down to pass the light in the sky which was now on my left at a distance of 200 metres max. I slowed to virtually a halt so to hear the helicopter blades and did not hear anything( I had not long left the air cadets so I knew my helicopters!) A cold chill then came across me as i realised this was not right, there was no sound, i stopped my pug 205 and switched off the engine and again looked left the light was still in exactly the same position hovering above farm land. I opened my window and still no sound this was now a bit scary , a dark country lane with no one around and this thing hovering. To be honest i shit it and sped off home! I&#39;m a pretty sceptical person and like to base my judgement on fact and this certainly tested my beliefs. Only a few people have heard my story and they no I have never been a storyteller, after reading on the internet some info about freedom of information i decided to write about it.  The event is still clear in my mind to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was no wind at all, and the sky was completely clear.  The temperature was around 80-82 degrees Fahrenheit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was east bound and had looked up to enjoy the night sky.  When I scanned northward, (around 45-50 degrees up from the horizon)  I noticed what I originally thought to be three large birds heading towards the south.  I was in motion when I formed this initial impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they drew closer to my position, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that something was &#34;wrong with this picture.&#34;  It was then that I decided to stop.  I had been walking that particular route for years, at the same time in the evening and had seen all manner of birds.  This collection of objects was not behaving as birds do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects came closer, it became easier to discern what distinguished these objects from, say, the ducks I was accustomed to seeing.  The formation of the three objects was utterly ridged.  Birds maintain a basic formation, but even in the evening--at such a low altitude--one can see a modicum of relative motion between the individual members.  This formation had no such relative movement.  It was rock solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had stopped perhaps a yard west of an intersection that was illuminated by a mercury-vapor sort of light.  The formation, at their closest point, passed directly over this intersection.  I estimate that their height from the ground to have been approximately one and a half telephone poles.  I judged them to be just under a meter in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the physical details of the objects became most evident.  They had nothing in the way of wings on them.  All three of them were shaped like bowling pins, and they moved with their longest axes parallel to the ground and with their heads defining the forward most point in the &#34;flight path.&#34; When the lead pin passed over the street light, I could tell that the body of the pin was smooth, and it appeared to be pewter in color.  They made no sound at all.  In fact, it seemed that they had suppressed ambient noise in some measure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once over the lamp, the three pins continued their perfectly straight trajectory to the SSE (passing the local university) until I simply couldn&#39;t discern the bodies from the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sincerely appreciate your timely and generous response.  I&#39;m more than happy to fill in the blanks as best I can.  And I&#39;ll do my best to provide you with an illustration of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I did in fact stipulate that the date of my sighting was approximate, I&#39;m certain that I&#39;m off by no more than one day.  I recall that the incident occurred one week before my father&#39;s birthday, June 19.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember that I was wearing blue jeans and a black knit shirt.  At the time I was working as the third shift cashier for a local ((deleted)) company.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That you didn&#39;t get to visit Goodfellow is certainly San Angelo&#39;s loss.  It&#39;s been a little over a year since I&#39;ve been there, but I do know that in addition to being a cryptological training center, the base is now the national center for instruction in all manner of fire suppresion/containment.  Yes, summers can be unmerciful in San Angelo; but that&#39;s Texas in general, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have you to thank, Mr. Davenport, for my having submitted any report at all.  I had the opportunity to listen to your most recent interview on the Dr. Lauralee program.  Your presentation was very impressive:  you were factual, professional, and even-handed in your delivery.  If UFO matters are<n> <n><n> ever to be taken seriously (whether by skeptics, fanatics, or both), a voice of reason and equanimity HAS to be present in laying the groundwork for its consideration.  Yours was such a voice.  Please keep up the exemplary work.

It was going too fast to be a plane.  I don&#39;t think it was a metoerite or a shooting star.  It was coming from diretly ahead of us(east) and heading to the left (NW).  It was going at a 45 degree angle.  It looked like it crashed behind the town we could seee from the highway.  About a minute later I saw a flash of light coming from the same town.  The flassh was so bright that the mountain behind the town lite up.  It reminded me of the airport landing lightsssssss, but when I mentioned this to my boyfriend he said if it was airport lights they would repeat not just flash once and disappear.  I looked down at the clock and it was approx. 10:30pm. Unfortunately my bofriend didn&#39;t see it.  He thought I was pointing at something else.  The reason I noticed it was that it was a clear night and the object was very bright and moving very quickly.  I forgot to mention that it was round with no visible tail on it.  If we weren&#39;t in a hurry we would have gone to look for it.  For the next several days I looked in the papers to see if there was anything about it.  I also asked several people but no one heard of anything.<n>

Floyds Knobs provides an optimum view of the city skyline and is a favored area for such viewing.I glanced skyward and observed a &#34;streaking&#34; object rapidly advancing West to East over the city. The object was of the intensity of an atypical star. perhaps indicative of its distance. Having taken astronomy in college it was certainly NOT a comet, incoming asteroid or other debris. The object when DIRECTLY over the city released an apparent projectile.  Both objects were white in color. the secondary object &#34;streaked&#34; On an apparent trajectory towards the city itself. The object secondary object dissapeared from view when it was washed out by the city lights below. The initial primary object continued rapidly in a westerly direction eventually fading from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a full time college student . My companion at he time is as well.<n>

It was triangle in shape and massive in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very close to the ground..I would guess maybe 400 yards.  It was so close and so massive I could see the detail i the ship.  It did not look like it was made of metal,  It look more like it was made of some sort of stone and had hieroglyphic type symbols on the base with round bright lights underneath them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend stops the car as we both have our head out the windows observing,  I would guess the whole incident lasted about 1 min.  Hard to say because it was almost like we was under a trance as we look but was prob just in shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember we pulled into the parking lot about 30 feet away to get out of the car and the &#34;ship&#34; started to move very slowly heading east.  I never seen the ship fly off though, it moved east slowly and then just was not there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have told very few people about this over the years in fear.

(My teacher took us out to lunch at a local restaurant for good behavior over the course of the school year.)  We sat in a booth, and I faced the window with my fellow classmate.  During the conversation I kept seeing a bright light in the distant sky outside.  I assumed it was the metal from an airplane reflecting the sunlight.  I kept looking out the window because the light drew closer.  I soon noticed the light was flashing, and I thought that it could be sunlight glinting off of a helicopter instead.  My curiousity remained, so I continued to watch it as the flashing light came closer and closer.  Soon enough it actually flew over the restaurant, and I was dumbfounded and in disbelief at what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a rather large, silvery metal saucer, and the flashing [white] lights were on the outer rim of the saucer.  They seemed to be flashing because the lights would turn on and off in a line, going round and round the rim.  Looking back, I suppose the lights could have seemed to be going round and round if the saucer were spinning, but at the time that did not seem to be the case.  Either way, I could not believe what I had seen.  I asked my friend sitting next to me if she had seen it, and she said she had not seen it.  I think they both thought I was crazy, but even to this day I cannot shake the image from my brain.  I know what I saw and I believe in my experience 100%.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were at the top of a hill and the light was at the bottom and to the left.  The light shined in our direction and it was at this point we realized it was not a fixed light or object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing down the long hill, we notice that the object was going to travel over the highway at Grange Hall Rd.  We stopped the car in the slow lane as we were the only car on the South-bound side.  The Triangle craft slowly crossed the highway at just above tree-level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was metallic silver and details are as follows:  approx. 300ft from point to the trailing edge of the triangle.  There was a &#34;fuselage&#34; type of belly extending about 60 ft from the leading point with a concave area following the fuselage.  In the concave area, their were 2 lights that had a wire mesh covering (the same as found in gyms and other places where the lights are protected).  The first light was Red and the second was white and appeared to be standard bulbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom of the craft had what appeared to be rivets along the inner fuselage and outside edge. Three round lights approx. 5 ft. in diameter and appearing as &#34;pool&#34; light covers were at the craft&#39;s 3 points, illuminated but not &#34;shining&#34; down.  The craft had 2 large cylindrical objects above forming a &#34;cross&#34;.  The Cylindrical objects were larger than the craft in length and we could see a ladder with hoses attaching the two parts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was &#34;gaseous&#34; cloud that obscured the upper portion of the craft.  The craft was silent and had no effect on the vehicle operation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft passed overhead, we continued southbound to reach the next exit (Holly) to turn around and chase the craft.  We saw a &#34;traffic jam&#34; of vehicles on the North bound side, all flashing their lights heading towards where the craft had passed over the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We speculate that since there was no traffic previously during the 5 minutes the craft took to cross the highway, someone controlled the traffic on both sides and we happened to slip through their blockade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A local radio station had a short story of the object with one witness asking if anyone else had seen something strange crossing the highway.<n>

It was hovered at a very low altitude appx. 500 ft. It was angled on it&#39;s side about 30 degrees, it&#39;s shape looked like a HIGH HAT. It sat there for about 2 min. Upon viewing it, it was black in color with a silver perimeter, it had a saucer plate bottom, inside of the plate was black and the perimeter was again silver. On the top hat portion off to the left side midway up, there seems to be a shape of a door, or a square window. The distance was 1 mile or less, it was about forty ft. across, and about 50 ft. in height. It sat in a southwesterly dircetion, when it sped off, it left in the same direction. As it left at a terrfic speed, it changed color to white, and size to a ball. The sky was all blue with few clouds, it left the atmosphere into the ionesphere and beyond within a mere few seconds. This took place in Santa Clara, Ca. I have seen other sightings more astounding than this one, dating back to 1967. The 1967 sighting was more detailed and astounding.<n>

I never believed in UFO&#39;s or anything like it.  In June of &#39;97, my boyfriend and I were driving on Airport Road in Weatherford, Oklahoma.  We were in a convertible.  I was looking above the sunset when I saw a huge ball of fire fall towards the earth.  It then stopped and went straight up into the clouds.  I would&#39;ve thought it was a meteor but they don&#39;t stop or change direction quite like that.  My boyfriend didn&#39;t see it.  He was watching the road I guess, but I nearly made him wreck when I screamed &#34;What is that?&#34;  It didn&#39;t take very long at all.  At the most a couple of minutes.  I don&#39;t know what it was.  I tried to figure it out and I&#39;ve heard of sun dogs and all that, but the way it moved was so bizarre.  I don&#39;t think even an Air Force jet can manoevre quite like this thing did.<n>

Exhibited non-ballistic motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working third shift at a machine shop in Jeffersonville, Indiana.  Being the supervisor, I had plenty of free time.  I would often step outside and have a cigarette, especially in the summer.   All the machines were running well, and the operators had settled in for another long night.  I walked outside and lit up a smoke, watching the U.P.S jets line up for approach into Louisville International Airport.  There were several jets in line for their approach, as well as a few others orbiting, waiting for their turn.  I can’t remember the exact number, but I would estimate at least 10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for a few minutes, and lost interest.  I walked around the parking lot for a few minutes enjoying the night air.  When I noticed that all the jets were gone.  I know they didn’t all have time to land.  I thought this was quite strange, and began scanning the skies.  I noticed a very bright, deep red colored, pulsating light.  This light was so bright, that it appeared to ray, like the bright landing lights on aircraft.  The only difference being the color.  And I say it pulsated not blinked, because it only dimmed, it never blinked off and on.  When I first saw it, it was in the sky to the northwest.  The color got my attention, but the erratic movement kept me interested.  It’s the strangest thing I have ever seen.  As the object brightened it would move forward or backward, and as it dimmed it became stationary.  The timing between pulses was approximately 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this for at least a minute, it was slowly making it’s way in my direction.  I had to get a second opinion on this, so I ran inside the shop and yelled for someone to come outside and see this light in the sky.  I ran back outside thinking it would be gone for sure, but it was still there.  And it was a lot closer than when I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother, who was working for me at the time, came outside wondering what the hell I was talking about.  I didn’t even have to point, he immediately saw the object and made a remark along the lines of, ((deleted)).  I asked him if he could hear anything, to which he replied that he couldn’t.  This thing was nearly overhead and didn’t make a sound.  He also noticed the way it would move as it pulsed brighter, and stop as it dimmed.  We both watched this thing for several more minutes, and I wanted to see if my father was awake.  He had a pretty good digital camera, and I hoped he could get a picture, so I ran back inside a second time to call him.  I finally got an answer, and I know I sounded a little excited over the phone.  Explaining what I had just witnessed took another minute or two.  On the way back outside this time, I was positive that this thing would not be there.  But, when I got to the parking lot, it was still there.  There were no other aircraft in the sky this entire time.  The light slowly made it’s way almost directly over the building, when it suddenly released a round object from it’s underside.  We both gasped at seeing this, it was unbelievable!  The round object that was released had no light, but the main object’s bright light reflecting from it betrayed it’s presence.  At this very instant both objects disappeared.  And no longer than 10 seconds after that, a military jet, (an F-4 Phantom I would guess by the twin engines) flew right through the same spot this object had just occupied.  It was loud, and he was definitely looking for the object, because he dipped his wings left and right.  The jet turned around and left in the same direction he came from.  We both watched the skies for 15 minutes, and noticed the jetliners starting to line up again.  I didn’t know who to report this to, and I am convinced that, air traffic controllers caught this object on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was looking towards the SE. There was no sound. Several small airplanes also crossed over head that night, and those were quite loud. No light reflected on the low cloud cover, as did the many airplanes I saw that night, indicating it was very low in the sky. One could clearly see the airplanes white, red and blue flashing lights in distinct formation. What I saw actually became obscurred behind the trees in my yard at one point. It appeard to be only about 1 mile away, traveling over Bothell Way!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above description captures most of the information. I wish I had been more conscient of looking at relative surrounds to get a better idea of the objects size. I would say it was close to half the size of a lightbulb at 10 ft from the observer. I was very keen to observe the airplanes that night, to base my observations a the conditions and weather circumstances that night. It proved to me that it was definitely NOT an airplane, It was also not weather related. I do not believe it was an asteroid of some sort. There was no tail that I could see.I have lived in my house, where I observed this, for over 7 years. Occasionally airplanes on the horizon &#34;fool&#34; me into thinking they are not airplanes, when they come straight towards me, and their WHITE light seems unusually bright, and they dont appear to move. However, eventually they change course and I can see their distinctive colored lights and patters. In fact what I saw entered my vision from my left and crossed to my right. It never came straight at me. It&#39;s light was consistent in radiance.My background: I am a 32 year old female, and a graphic designer and artist. I will send you an illustration of what I saw. I may even be able to send you an actual animation, for that is also something I do for a living! I consider myself extremely open-minded to things of this nature, but to this point in my life I have never seen anything like what I saw June 6th!

I have seen every kind of military aircraft known, but I have never seen anything like or since what I saw on 6/4/97.  It was approximately 8:30 pm and I went outside to put the windows up on the car.  As I was outside, I looked to the NE sky and noticed something flying low.  It&#39;s normal for military aircraft to fly low in this area, but the light pattern was strange.  It had only red lights in the front and a very unusual pattern I&#39;ve never seen before (that&#39;s what caught my attention), and I could see that from the trajectory of the way it was flying that it would come over my head.  During this time, I noticed recognizable military aircraft flying around but keeping distance.  Anyhow, this aircraft came over my head, and I did not hear any engine noise.  It was HUGE!  I could see small white lights on either side which would be at the end of each wing(?).  I was transfixed by this sight and continued to watch.  Then the view changed as the object went over my head and was moving away from me, and there was a plasma white color in the middle of the back, similar to the color of an afterburner on an F-18.  This unknown aircraft was not flying quickly; it was not an F-18.  It continued past me in the opposite direction.  All of a sudden, two red lights shot out from it, and then I saw a triangular pattern of lights--the white light had gone off and was replaced by red.  Then, the top two red lights shot off together and one of the military jets headed in that direction, and then the object lit up the back again, and went the opposite direction, with 2 jets following along behind it.  I stood there wondering what I had just seen and my first idea was maybe the B-2 Stealth at night, but I really couldn&#39;t say for sure.  Maybe it was simply some sort of night-time military exercise---which is the impression I got, but what I saw didn&#39;t really make sense, and like I say, I&#39;ve seen all kinds of military aircraft flying (except for the B-2). I know of no aircraft that flies arou! nd here that doesn&#39;t make any kind of noise.  This whole incident I had still puzzles me to this day.<n>

HUGE, it looked like it was cominf from a mountain top, it was huge from straight acros the sky, it came on and moved a bit, then another HUGE one from the other side of the sky. ive never seen any thing like it. they shut off soon after they came on  then me and my friend saie bye, and ran back up motorcycle hil, as we neared the top. a HUGE double bladed black hellicopter slowly passed overhead, its bay door was open, it had no lights at all except for a red light undernieth. it was so close i remember i could have throwen a rock and hit it. it went northbound, although the craft was heading southwest last we saw. thats my story, im not a hoaxer, im very willing to give all information to anybody. I KNOW WHAT I SAW. i love airplanes and did at that time, im well aware of what exists, and what i saw was the real deal. i cant explain it, but its with me everyday. it frightened my soul.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I CAN DRAW EXACTLY WHAT I SAW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We stopped for a few moments at the Ft. Lincoln Rest Stop, south of Raton, NM, to look at the stars with binoculars.  While my daughter looked at the stars with the binoculars I was using a 1st generation NVD and looking at the southern horizon.  I began tracking what I thought was a polar orbit satilite (from about 15 degrees above the S. horizon) I realized the object was traveling too fast for a satellite. (speed unknown but it covered from 15 degrees to 90 degrees in approx. one minute.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object reached the 90 degree position it was joined by 2 other objects that matched vector and speed from the SW using non-ballistic manuvering.  The objects formed a triangular formation and traveled on for 10-20 seconds and then made a non-ballistic 90 degree turn to the west and accelerated until they were lost from view on the western horizon.  The objects were high in the atmosphere and undescernable as to shape.  The lights were very dim and impossible to see with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It stopped and hovered in the same place directly above us, multicolor lights dlashing around the outside edge of the disc and making no sound at all. We all screamed and ran inside, alerting her brother of the news. But when we came out, 30 seconds or so later, it was no where in sight.

At the estimated date of the event (mid 1997), I was past 34.  Any oddities in air traffic would be apparent to me.  Though some would say that what I saw were conventional aircraft, and I admit that they may have been - though with some strange twists - I felt I&#39;d post this notice to benefit the doubt.  Having heard anecdotal accounts of apparent ET craft disguising themselves as conventional craft, I think thoroughness is appropriate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier in the daylight hours, I&#39;d taken note of one or two large aircraft northbound over what I estimated to be western Richmond at unusually low altitude.  My vantage point was the vicinity of I-80 and the San Pablo Dam Road.  The aircraft resembled airliners or cargo transports...possibly C-17-like, but not grey as I recall.  It was my sense that there were more aircraft in general that day.  I e-mailed a friend in Monterey, Calif. to ask if he&#39;d seen any strange air traffic in his area, and he said he had increased activity as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the dark evening of what I recall to be the same day, from home (approx. 1 mile north of the previous vantage point and south of Hilltop Mall) I witnessed what visually appeared to be conventional airliners yet they were *absolutely silent*.  The aircraft came in a succession of three within a short period which I estimate at five minutes.  The aircraft appeared to descend from the west, and they moved eastward overhead at low altitude which I estimate at only two thousand feet.  At least one turned southward over the El Sobrante area and disappeared from view over the East Bay Hills (without a lot of clearance below).  In the many previous years I&#39;d seen only such craft as Cessnas and helicopters in this low airspace.  Never had I seen an airliner that low that far from the airport (Oakland is the nearest for things that size).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned above, the aircraft were silent.  I could hear the occasional car drive past the house, and I could hear the subtle distant rush of freeway traffic, yet no sound emanated from any of the aircraft which were closer than the freeway.  I was flabbergasted and listened intently as they approached and departed.  I was sure that even at low RPMs during a descent, I&#39;d hear something, but these things were as quiet as gliders!  I also should note that they had what appeared to be navigation lights, and the night sky was quite clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now live in Seattle, and air traffic southbound into Sea-Tac often merges over my part of the city.  They all make sound, some louder, some quieter, but none silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw in Richmond still mystifies me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of low-flying military transport a/c.  However, we do not know what the witness observed.  PD))<n>

It was probably fall.  It was quite a while ago.  Having lived in central Florida for a majority of my life &amp; my entire adult life, I&#39;ve seen many things in the sky.  I&#39;ve seen weather balloons.  I know venus, jupiter, the big &amp; little dippers, orions belt, the pleides, mars, and the moon when I see them.  I&#39;ve seen jets, planes, blimps, and rockets.  Patrick Air Force Base is in cocoa beach, florida, and I&#39;ve seen the jets taking and off and landing there many times.  I&#39;ve seen the Blue Angels do their show.  I&#39;ve been to the space center &amp; I&#39;ve been to plane shows at the air force base.  I&#39;ve seen spotlights lighting up events in cocoa village and from orlando and disney world.  I&#39;ve seen many many rockets take off.  I&#39;ve seen the space shutt! le come back to Kennedy Space Center (from my yard) riding piggy back on the jet.  I saw the Challenger blow up.  I&#39;ve seen satellites.  I&#39;ve seen the space shuttle when it just unhooked from the ISS and both were traveling across the sky - tandem stars in the sky, so i feel pretty confident about seeing things in the sky.  I&#39;ve been an avid sky-watcher my whole life.  I&#39;ve seen the perseid meteor shower several times and i&#39;ve seen quite a few falling stars and eclipses of the sun and moon.  We lived in the shadow of Kennedy Space Center - I&#39;ve been around &#34;space stuff&#34; my whole adult life.  But the night I&#39;m writing about I saw something I can&#39;t explain, that i&#39;ve never seen before or since.  I was facing east, and I saw a round whitish-yellow light pretty high up in the sky that I would say was the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length.  I figured it had to be quite a ways up, perhaps a mile or so, but that&#39;s just a guess.  As I looked at it, it moved, but not like ! a plane moves in a straight line and you can see it moving at ! a regula r pace, this thing just jumped to a new point in the sky, not very far away, but it ... &#34;jumped&#34; ... it did not flow along smoothly.  I pointed at it and asked myself out loud &#34;what is THAT?&#34; as it &#39;jumped&#39; from one point to another, moving from the eastern sky towards the north. I kept pointing at it and turning to face the north - and it kept moving on towards the west in those weird li&#39;l &#39;jumps&#39;.  Not just left or right or up or down, but randomly it seemed to me, horizontally and diagonally and vertically as well.  I kept pointing at it as it kept moving around until I was facing south and then it was still for a moment and then ~~~ ZZIP~~~ it disappeared.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it again.  Of course I did not get any pictures of it.  I&#39;m not real sure of the date.  I had looked and looked at the skies before this event, and especially since, in case I&#39;d ever be privileged to see anything else unexpected, and I&#39;m planning on continuing to do so every chance I get.! Thank you very much<n>

I was assigned to the communications dept. Our Department and the Air ops Department had interchanged personel in the CDC prior to a upcoming deployment for a better relationship and understanding of each others jobs. Our ship set sail to a military operations area known as the SOCAL Naval Operations area. During one of the nights I went to the I had went to the smoking sponson on the outskirt of the ship. There were 8 other people pointing to the sky I looked up and saw a very odd triangle shaped object with 3 distinct light at each point moving very unusally. They Ask how are our jets moving like that. I had told them that our ship had not launched a jet nor even had any to launch and we were on a ship board training mission and did not envolve any aircraft. Also that we were alone in the entire Operations area. No other Ships or Aircraft was in the area for days. We had stared at the object abit then I had went to get a freind to witness this. At that time I realized I was in a place to go catch this on a radar. I went back to the Air ops station in the CDC and told the radar specialist to look at this object. He Stated that is was nothing other then a invalid track. I ask what makes this invalid. He had stated that the object was at 1200kph and speeding up to a unrecordable speed by our radar system thus for the system reports as invalid. I ask why then the system displayed it as a fixed wing craft. He stated for some reason the the object had a IFF system aboard. It was stating that is was a comercial aircraft. Something like a beoing 707. I had logged our current position and the path of this object and it was on a desert course towards the state of Nevada. The Obejct was large Triangle and had 3 unusual looking white lights. Being around many aircraft when i was watching this object move i was looking closely and the craft did have any port,starboard,foreward or aft light systems. Just a single light almost like ! it was being shined through a crystal. I also had seen a show in 2000 of a SDPD officer had captured this same object on his patrol car camera. I believe the date said 1998. It&#39;s been a long time since this happened. I always wanted to tell or report this but I did not want to be considered another UFO nut. I don&#39;t believe in Aliens or things like that but this was some sort of UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was parked at the runways half way point in the dirt parking area at our local airport in Meriden Conn. {Wallingford-Meriden Airport} because it is away from the city lights.  At the time I had won a camera {Cannon Sure Shot WP-1 35mm using 400 film} in some contest and I was still learning to use the different settings when something caught my eye around the full moon.  A object shaped like a large round glowing ball about 1/4 size of the moon and looked like it was just above and to the left of the moon and I saw a jet [ looked military] at the lower left side of the moon heading towards the object.  I took 4 pictures at different settings so I would have at least one good picture of what I was seeing.  By taking pictures on the different settings of the camera it shows the action with some detail on a couple of frames.  The sky was partly cloudy but it was clear towards the comet and 90degrees to the right the moon was in the clear also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 1st picture is of the jet heading towards the object coming up from the left lower side of the moon and the object is at the upper left center of the moon.  Like if the jet was scouting the object.  The 2nd picture is of the jet coming around in a turn gaining on the object without any movement from the object.  The 3rd picture is of the jet level with the moon on the left side and looking like he was setting up a shot while closing in on the object and the object starting to go to the right just above the moon as to get away from the plane.  And the last picture was taken just after the jet fired something at the object and was starting it&#39;s turn into a dive and the object was by then in a ball of flames breaking into 2 parts on the lower right side of the picture far below the moon and almost out of frame on the right side.  One large part and a smaller piece all in a ball of flames,  You can tell by the pictures that the plane is a jet plane and the object is some type of U! FO.  I could not tell what it was, but it was not anything I have ever seen before. {Army Veteran 1979 - 85}  I did not see were the UFO went to nor the jet.  A car had past me at that time with the bright lights on.  I still have the camera that I took the pictures with, and the negitives.

My mother and I both saw it at the same time, but said nothing to each-other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we passed it, we both looked at each other and said; &#34;Did you just see that?&#34;  I turned around quick and couldn&#39;t see anything.  We made a u-turn and drove through the exact area that we saw it.  It wasn&#39;t there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened about 15 years ago.  I was fourteen years old and my mother was 43.  The area in which it happened was a normal city street.  It wasn&#39;t above in the clouds, afar.  It was in the midst of where we were.  I could have thrown a rock at it.  It was round.  The colors where orange, red, and yellow.  We both saw it for at least 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to Coast To Coast and was amazed at the description of the fire ball.

It appeared to have 2 smaller objects flying around it. Fom my point it appeared that the object was about 150 ft up and approximately 1/2 to 1 mile long. No noticeabe lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 2 pm, I noticed a _very_ large object north of my apartment. It appeared to have a reddish hue, and was moving fairly slow, but steadily towards the east.I then noticed two smaller objects circling around it and managed to see one of the objects through my 4.5&#34; telescope. Although I couldn&#39;t keep it in the field of view long, it appeared to be somewhat like an airplane, but more like &#34;ship&#34; shaped.&gt;From the fact that these two objects were flying around the main object, and I live close to an airport and see air traffic all the time, the main craft must have been anywhere from 1/2 to 1 mile long. I could only see the edge and it was fairly thin, probably 40-50 feet.Anyway, it was huge. I would like to know if anyone else in the area reported anything. The thought occured to me that it could have been one of those advertising banners, but I did not see anything pulling it and on second thought it was far too big to be a banner.((Name deleted)) am a computer artist, amatuer astronomer, business owner and sky watcher.<n>

I am 43 years of age.  This event took place in 1997.  It has haunted me ever since.  My son was 9 years of age at the time.  We had gone shopping and on the way back we stopped off to rest in an old cemetary not far from where we live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a boiling hot day.  There were no clouds in the sky at all.  As we - my son, girlfriend at the time and myself were sitting, my son suddenly looked up and saw what he thought was a black balloon in the sky.  He shouted, &#39;Dad, look at that balloon.  It is moving funny&#39;.  My girlfriend and I both looked toward he was pointing.  The object was black all over.  It was sort of oval-shaped and moving in slow motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement of the thing was weird.  It was sort of flipping over in the sky - like a coin would move if you tossed it.  As it was flipping over and over the edges of the object seemed to glow a sort of bright golden colour.  The sun was behind us.  This object was moving toward the sun very very methodically and slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I timed this thing with my watch.  It moved just over our heads and eventually disappered as I lost it in the glare of the sun.  The whole event lasted about 10 minutes.  To this day, I still have not got a clue as to what this thing was.  It was definately being controlled - but by what.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that sighting, my son has seen the same object 2 times more recently.  It always seems to appear in the Toxteth area of Liverpool.  My son said that, again, it was tossing in the sky, moving very slowly and the edges of the object were gleaming a golden colour.  The last two sightings of this object were 2005.  In all cases, the object was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Flipping over on itself.  Absolutely amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Summer 1997.  Apart from myself, there were two other witnesses. My son, who was 9 at the time, and an ex - girlfriend.  The sky was cloudless.  The sun was blazing - a really hot day.  We were situated in an old cemetary - which people used to sunbathe when the weather is warm. The main building in front of the cemetary is the famous Anglican Cathedral - Europe&#39;s largest Gothic cathedral.  We were just relaxing this particular day when my son noticed something moving toward the cathedral very slowly.  He shouted to me to look up at the weather balloon.  When I peered up toward the sky I noticed that the object was not moving like a balloon should. It was black all over.  Oval in shape.  And it was moving by flipping over on itself - like a coin would move if flipped into the air.  We also noticed that as it flipped, the sun&#39;s beams would hit the edge of the object, which produced a bright golden gleam from the edges of this object. We could not believe what we were seeing.  I, myself, had never seen an object like it in my life before.  To this day I still have not got a clue as to what it was.  The sighting lasted about 6 minutes.  It moved toward the cathedral, went behind the cathedral and appeared again in front of the cathedral.  It moved slowly - flipping over on itself as it moved - toward the sun before we lost it in the sun&#39;s glare. This sighting has haunted me ever since.  I have checked, since, on any photos, in magazines, books about the type of object that I had witnessed in 1997.  All to no avail.  Not one of them even comes close to what we spotted then.  I am forwarding on this report in the hope that you can shed some light on this and put me out of my misery as to what you think it was that we spotted then.  Thanks for your attention of this.<n>

I was sitting in the yard with my husband watching one of my sons and a friend play basketball.  Both boys stopped and started looking down the field toward a neighbors house.  The friend pointed in that direction and said &#34;What is that?&#34;  My husband and I got up and walked to where they were standing and we saw a triangle shaped object slowly coming in our direction.  The day was beautiful, clear sky, no clouds.  I am a artist and I can tell different shades of color.  This triangle shaped object had 3 blue lights, different than the shade of blue of the sky.  There was a light on each point of the triangle.  The object was a gray hazy metallic color but appeared transparent in form. I could see the blue sky through this shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four of us stood there with our mouths open.  As the object came over top of us, it stopped for a few seconds. It was above us about the height of a 4 story building. I really felt like we were being looked at. Then in a flash it was gone, super fast.  My son&#39;s comment was &#34; I did not see what I just saw&#34;.  My younger son was at a friends house playing.  This friend was a good drawer.  I called his mom and asked if the boys were outside and if so, did they see anything.  If they did, please have her son draw what they saw and bring it to me.  I did not give any information on what we saw.  The boys came to the house with a drawing that was exactly what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

One of my friends gets hit in the nuts, so we sit down and cool off in a life gaurd tower.  While we are talking, I see a blur come from the left side facing the ocean.  I was thinking of making a wish, but it was not a typical shooting star, my friend points out that an object has appeared out near the horizon above the water, pulsating.  We watch, wondering if its a helicopter since bellows has some military activity and exercises are performed there.  As we watch, we see this light start buzzing around doing very angled turns at high speeds.  It was mind boggling.  So we keep on watching, the light stops again after a while and then it starts growing bigger.  Eventually it flew above us the the right, not too high up so I got a decent glimpse of some red and greenish lights, maybe blue, I have a hard time remembering what exact colors I saw, but it was ovalish and it was silent.  I live near alot of air traffic and I know something moving that close to the ground at that speed should make a lot of sound but I didn&#39;t hear anything.  So we look at each other and don&#39;t say a thing.  I am an honest person and tell my findings to friends and I tried to limit the talk about only what I had physically seen.  My other friend, one being hawaiian and one being caucasion, both took it way differently.  We didn&#39;t really talk about it much, because it freaked my white friend out alot and for a long time.  I guess it didn&#39;t apply to my life so why mentally masturbate over it for a long time.  My Hawaiian friend probably has it cataloged in the back of his mind but there is no doubt between all of us that it was not anything weve ever heard of.  Probably anitgrav tech.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Vernon and Yonkers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were looking out of my fifth floor apartment window on this clear night when we both saw a steadily flashing white light in the sky over the Yonkers/Mt. Vernon border. At first it was stationary and then much to our surprise it dropped an impossible distance and effortlessly circled and shifted its position with unbelievable ease and speed. We observed the familiar lights of a commercial jet in the distance which gave us a frame of reference to place this object closer to us than the plane as it passed in between. It continued to move up and down and from side to side, sometimes at dizzying speed, for almost 40 minutes unitl at least two helicopters arrived, presumably, to investigate it.  Up until the helicopters arrival we had not noticed that the object was moving about in total silence. The din of the choppers gave us that frame of reference. Nothing had been reported on the news, however, the local authorities did state that they had received numerous calls reporting the same object.<n>

The first one was in Hamilton located flying above Wilson Jr. High school on the first day of school in 1997. As far as i can remember is was a silver rounded object hovering above the school for about a few minutes not moving at all, it was about the height that average planes fly but made no sound and many students saw it but never said anything of it. I&#39;m still unsure of what it was. It light as day out and too bright to see any kindof satellite flying that low. The second and third sightings were exactly the same and located about two miles south of downtown Hamlton at around 10PM the first and 2AM the second time. They were two glowing lights, just lights slowly moving in differant directions as I saw riding in my car by the great miami river on the west side of town. I&#39;ve seen these two lights in the same location twice and I strongly don&#39;t believe they are planes because they just hovered around the same area for about 30 minutes each time without any blinking lights. There is an airport there that just has small planes, none of them are capable of doing, or look like these two objects, They where white lights . I am a very openminded person and I would not give you a fake report or anything, as I, like so many want to know the truth about what is happening. Unfortunatly I have no proof of these objects but I read another report on your site about someone from Hamilton who sighted the two flying objects I saw. Thanks for reading my report, I&#39;m sorry that my sightings were sometime ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is a report of something that happened to me and a co-worker on a warm summer night that change the way I see things. We worked the late shift a resturant we got off in the early mouring hours and we talked in the parking lot and threw around a football I had in the car for a while. We left (I was taking him to his house in Madsion) and we where driving down US 119. There was never any traffic on the road that late at night and we normally stopped at a gas station. When we went by the 24 hour gas station it was closed. We wonder why and made mention of the clerk problay was taking a nap. As we drove on we began talking about something and then I said that car is on the wrong side of the road. It&#39;s light were off and it was parked. It should not have been facing towards us on the four lane road. Then he said my dad use to work there(refering to a coal mine) and then I sort of blacked out and when he said something to me it was like I was in a dream. When I came to I realized the car was going about 10mph on a 55mph road. My foot was of the gas. I ask him what happened and he said he couldn&#39;t remeber what he was saying. I pointed out the speed we were traveling and the parked car. He said that was weird and he felt funny. We talked the whole way home about something else. That is when at his house I noticed the sun coming up. I said it not time for sunrise. He agreed and we assumed the time had changed. His wife said it changed in the spring and that we were crazy. I was still a young adult living at home. So I called home to tell my mom that I was going to be late. Somehow that night we lost 45 minutes to an hour. He refused to talk about it at work the next day. He tried to turn it into a joke. Years passed and I saw him again and asked him about it. He said I don&#39;t know what happened to us out there but something did. That is the truth , we were afraid to talk about it. As time went on I can no longer remember the date or the exact time of departing w! ork or arriving at his house. One thing I can assure you is that it did happen and somewhere out there is the lost hour of my life. I don&#39;t know what happened to that time we lost and one thing is for sure I don&#39;t ever wish to feel that way again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were going through a small, valley on an old country backroad when I had to use the bathroom real bad so we stopped. I stepped out of the passanger side of my friend&#39;s truck and he stepped out his to use the bathroom.  That&#39;s when I noticed a bright light in the distance moving back and forth with sudden stops.  I showed ((name deleted)) what I seen and we were both shocked. It was a bright light moving back and forth in the sky, pauseing then moving back in sudden burst&#39;s. The light was moving toward us so we watched it. It was low like a helicopter but no sound. It was huge. I am still not the same after what I saw.  When it came over our heads me and ((name deleted)) was looking up. I saw a ship that was almost the size of a football field. It had 8 sides to it, and deep medal structure.  The only sound it made was that of like a beutane lighter. There was a bright light in the front and a green and red light on its side and bottom. It moved over slowly so tell what that was? I was jumping up and down and asked ((name deleted)) if he was seeing this? He was dumbfounded. I asked after it passed what he saw and he said &#34; Like a stop sign. &#34; and I said &#34;but stretched out a little. &#34; We turned around to go follow it, but it was gone. Maybe it&#39;s goverment but maybe who know&#39;s. I am telling you mine and ((name deleted)) experience on that night. Never had another one like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1997 is approximate.  PD))<n>

This show is regarding UFO sightings over North Bergen, NJ.  If I had not seen this show I would never report or admit to seeing anything flying over anywhere. In 1997 I was on my porch in North Bergen, NJ with my mother and as we were chatting we seen a group of green lights that suddenly appeared over the street in front of us.  If this was a craft we did not see the actual body but the lights (about 8-10 orbs)were lined in a circular formation and perfectly oval shaped. The lights were perfectly stationary for about a minute and then suddenly, whatever it was, tilted on an angle and just as quickly as it appeared it disappeared.  I broke the silence by asking my mother if she saw what just happened and she said it was probably the airport or some type of light show. She was clearly shaken as she started to go inside. Neither explaination my mother gave me seemed reasonable since Newark Airport is miles and miles from North Bergen and light shows after midnight are not likely either, however, seeing UFO&#39;s is probably just as silly so ever since we&#39;ve never talked about it.  I sometimes wonder what that was. Honestly, it is too disturbing to think that there might be someone/thing out there so I don&#39;t really think about it often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I woke up suddenly and shot up straight up in my bed sweating and breathing hard.  I may have been afraid or sensed an impending encounter.  My bed faced a large window directly with a pull down screen covering it.  A amazing bright light flooded the room suddenly and much slower than a conventional light as eerie as that might seem.  I was gripped, frozen by fear and hardly able to breathe.  I wanted to call for my grandfather, but nothing came out.  I scanned the room vaguely and the light seemed to suck all the color out of everything leaving only a black outline and white where color should be.  I had a terrifying sense that I was the only one awake and that I was not supposed to be.  My ears were filled with what sounded like a thousand people whispering or what I imagine inhumanly large power lines buzzing with electricity would sound like.  My body was impaled upright by fear and my head frozen in the direction of the window.  In what seemed like an eternity to me, but I believe happened in mere moments the shadow of a figure crept across my window with only the impression of his body passing by.  But for one brief moment and for what will forever fill my heart with fear and make me cringe to this day, I had the most horrifying realization that it (and I say it full of disbelief in myself as well) knew I was awake and turned to me to contemplate my intrusion.  As swiftly as it came and just so it was gone.  The light seemed to creep right back out and left me sweating profusely and cringing in a mixture of disbelief, but mostly terror.  I cocooned myself in my covers and held myself for hours before I finally found release in forced slumber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This is near where the film Eddie and Crusers had taken place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway we were standing on the porch with a view of about 10-20 miles across the marshland when I noticed a strange light in the distance. I didn&#39;t pay attention to it at first we went inside for a few minutes came out and noticed this object was much larger as it had gotten closer and was spinning brilliantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Iam ex military and very familiar with aircraft and thought for a minute it was a blimp because there was a football field not to far from there and I could see the flood lights from the game but then noticed how large this object was.  I knew how far we were from the football field and the distance between us on the barrier island and the mainland which is where this object was, was about 7-10 miles.  It was hovering, spinning horizontaly, the best description is a Faberge Egg, multiple colors, each set of lights was spinning independently, in the opposite direction of each other. This object was over the marshland where there is nothing, no houses just some waterways. This object appeared to be about a mile or so from the mainland and 200 feet in the air. A safe guess would be to say it was slightly larger then a dump truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event has been burned into my memory for a very long time and I can still visualy I guess, remember it.  Suddenly it just dissapeared.  My friend observed the same thing as well.  There is one small airport just outside of atlantic city probably 10 - 15 miles from the object and a commercial airport (atlantic city international) along with the FAA tech center with a Air Guard unit.  Also, a note...I heard no jet engines as they typically flew during the day over the ocean I do not believe their flight path goes over this area.  One also note there is a nuclear plant north of this location.  I am not sure how far.  I hope this information is somewhat helpful<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I noticed the underside of the object to appear like rippling dark black liquid motion. As the object continued slowly gliding overhead, I realized it was so huge it blocked out my entire vision of any sky, this object appeared so much larger than my apt. complex, the street, the apt. complex across the street. And at this time, I also realized, the object was completely silent. I also recall like diffuse lighting to the underside, from possibly within, tho ! no light&#39;s actually on the outer surfaces. I recall, as the object&#39;s backend glided over me, I then observed the solid appearing structure around the outer perimeter of this Chevron shaped object, as I can recall it is best described as, from my only experienc&#39;s, as girder structural design. I will admit I&#39;ve alway&#39;s believed in the existance of extraterresterial intelligence, &amp; have read a great many book&#39;s on the subject, that is probably why I&#39;ve only tried to tell a few people of this experience back then when it happened, but, I stopped talking about it, because I was ridiculed by everyone, &amp; still am today by my boyfriend of 9yrs. But, I&#39;ve alway&#39;s had the strong feeling&#39;s that I should pursue telling my story, regardless of what other&#39;s say or think, &amp; that is why now I&#39;m writing, because in my heart I KNOW WHAT I SAW! I may not know what it was, but, I definitely know I saw it. And can honestly say, that thru-out the entire experience, I felt no fear, I was calm, &amp; ! fully aware to, as accurately as I was able, observe &amp; mentall! y record all I could of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for giving me a platform to tell my story.<n>

It was late at night.  I went outside to walk my boyfriend to his car.  He was much taller than I so when I hugged him goodnight I looked up towards the sky. There were a few deem lights on the property where we were standing.  As I looked up there was just enough light to show a very large rectangular metallic looking flying craft just above the trees.  There was just enough light to show the outline.  There was no sound and no movement of the trees despite how close it was to the trees.  The craft was very large and I saw no lights.  It did however block out the stars.  I never told anyone because I didn’t think anyone would believe me.  I was so shocked I didn’t even say anything to my boyfriend.  It was moving slowly, but would have passed behind the trees before he would have seen it.  I just said goodnight and went to bed.  I have tried to forget about it all of thes! e years, but after seeing all of the reports of sightings lately on T.V. and the history of UFOs, I felt I should at least let someone know. Maybe someone else saw what I did.  I never made note of the month or time, I just know I was living there from Oct 1996 thru 1997.  I actually felt privileged to see such a sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1997 is approximate.  PD))<n>

I didn&#39;t watch tv, listen the radio, or talk to anyone about anything except law and polotics. It had been visible for about a week or two when a friend had called me one evening. He asked what I thought about the awsome Hail Bob comet. I asked what he was referring to so he insisted that I walk outdoors and look. First, I went in the back of my apartment and looked into the feild. I told my friend that I couldn&#39;t see anything which looked like what he had discribed. Then, he said to go look on the other side of the building. I saw the Hail Bob and wondered How I could overlook it for so many days while I was coming and going from my home. I went back into my apartment and decided to step out my back door again and take one last look at the stars before shuting the door. When I looked up I saw a white saucer shaped object with a dome which had windows, and the ring around it was rotating. It was lit up like an extremely bright flourecent light. It was flying low in the feild and went up into the clouds. It blended right in with them. It moved swift as it went up and then forward. It was coming away from the direction of the Hail Bob comet. As this was happening, I asked my friend if he saw what I was seeing. He said yes, and we discussed it. It looked smaller to him because he was talking to me from Porter. After this event, I told my neighbor about seeing a U.F.O. and before I could discribe it she interupted. She said that she saw these all of the time from her apartment and they were white and lit up. It was a blinding light which made it look as though there was an aura around it. I was amazed because I hadn&#39;t seen one before and she lived in the same complex as I do. I hadn&#39;t discribed it to her and yet her discription matched mine. The reason I am reporting this 1997 event now is because I just discovered this web site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The Hale-Bopp Comet was visible during late March of that year, I seem to recall.))<n>
