It was moving north to south parallel to the curvature of the horizon. It traveled for approximately 30 seconds at a tremendously high rate of speed. There was no trail behind it, and it did not lose shape, speed, or intesity as long as we could see it. Did anybody else see this? Please submit your sighting. As it dissapeared into the southeastern sky it almost looked like afterburners of a fighter jet. With the speed of it, I have never seen something like this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports.  PD))<n>

As I approached Reagan, TX on State Highway 6, headed in a south easterly direction, I saw a light that seemed bluish in color traveling in a path perpendicular to mine. At first, I thought it was a lower flying plane. But upon further inspection, it was clearly not a plane due to shape, speed, altitude, and lack of any further lighting. The strange thing to me was that I&#39;ve witnessed meteor showers and they have always seemed to be coming straight down, are very fast, and are very short lived. The object I saw was traveling in a very horizontal direction angling slightly downward. As I was driving, I noticed it in about the 11 o&#39;clock position from the direction I was driving and proceded to follow it visually for 3-8 seconds as it continued to head perpendicular to my SE traveling direction. It seems the light strength faded somewhat as it continued until I lost visual sight of it at about the 3 o&#39;clock position to the direction I was traveling. I didnt have time enough to slow down and stop and track the thing. My initial thoughts after I knew it was not a plane, was that it was that fallen satellite I had vaguely heard about. But then, I recalled that it had supposedly landed much earlier in the day in the Egypt area. While I am a young college graduate with an engineering degree, I can not say what it is I saw. From my experiences, it was no type of meteor due to it&#39;s relatively slower speed than all the meteors I&#39;ve seen and it&#39;s brightness and direction of travel. It could have been a plane in the process of crash landing, but I have heard nothing of that in the news today. Also, an argument to it being a plane is that it was just a brighter bluish light. It appeared round and not very distant from my location. As I have grown up close to the DFW airport. I have seen thousands of planes come and go, and for the object to have been the same size I saw without seeing wings or the rest of a plane, it would have ! had to b e at extremely high elevation which it was not and was traveling much too fast for a planes at most heights. I hope this was witnessed by someone else...<n>

Not arcing downward, moving STRAIGHT across the horizon from Northwest to Southeast. From the time I first saw it coming toward me from the Northwest to the time it disappeared out of my sight to the Southeast was only about three seconds.<n>

I got out of the car, unhooked the bungee cord holding my hood closed, and as I was lifting it, I noticed a cross-shaped stationary object hovering in the eastern sky. It was the brightest object in the sky. I got on my CB radio to call a trucker to confirm what I was seeing... but it was dead. As I stepped out of the car... I suddenly lost all balance, and landed in a heap next to my car... receiving several scratches in the process. As I looked up to the sky again... the &#34;cross&#34; disappeared. Just then, my car started up and started to roll towards a creek bed off of the side of the road... I must have left it in gear. I started to walk home... and managed to catch a ride from a police officer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This account was also recorded in the Hamilton County Sherriff&#39;s Department booking office, as witnessed by two police officers and my attorney.<n>

In the middle, as I stared, I saw something very bright, like a bright star, and surrounding this I saw several blinking red lights in some type of circular pattern. First the blinking red lights were in the &#34;front&#34; of what seemed to be a craft, and then on the &#34;side.&#34; The strange thing is that this object with the bright white light and the blinking red lights lingered in one place for what seemed to be one or two minutes, then moved out of my view (horizontally). Also at the same time I saw the object, there was a very distant blinking red light (looking like a blinking star) also seen, which I believed was connected in some way.<n>
1/31/02 05:30|Jewell Valley|CA||1 minute|INS Border Patrol Officer observes cluster of discs, and a boomerang-shaped object,  fly over his patrol vehicle.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21935.html|11|ndxe200201| Telephoned Report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> An INS Border Patrol officer called NUFORC to report a dramatic sighting on the U. S.-Mexico border the California desert, approximately 70 miles east of San Diego.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 0530 hrs. (Pacific Standard Time), on Thursday morning, 31JA02, the officer was seated in his patrol vehicle, facing south toward the Mexican border.  His dog became visibly agitated, at which time the officer began to discern a warbling sound, which fluctuated in pitch.  For a moment or two, the officer thought that the sound was being generated by his vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The officer reports that he was quite surprised to see a disc shaped object, with a noticable bulge on its top, and fluctuating illumination around its flange, fly from west to east, directly above his vehicle.  A moment later, the officer looked back to the area of the sky from which this first object had just flown, and was equally surprised to see a cluster of discs, similar in appearance to the first disc, fly across the sky in the same direction in which the first object had flown.  In the center of the cluster of objects, the officer witnessed a &#34;boomerang-shaped&#34; object, which he at first took to be a &#34;military bomber.&#34;   ((NUFORC Note:  Presumably a B-2 bomber, which looks like a flying wing.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The officer quickly jumped out of his vehicle to get a better look at the objects as they moved fairly rapidly to the east.  At approximately that moment, the boomerang-shaped object, the officer reports, suddenly accelerated in velocity, began to rise at a sharp angle into the cloudless, dark morning sky, and disappeared from sight.  A short time later, the discs also accelerated, and flew off in the same direction that the boomerang-shaped object had flown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC hopes to be able to obtain more information about this incident.  Audio excerpts of the officer&#39;s report to NUFORC, played during the Jeff Rense Radio Program on February 12, 2002, can be heard from the archived radio programs at the website, &lt;www.rense.com&gt;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report entered by Peter Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center.<n>

He said &#34;What color is that thing you&#39;ve seen before? I think it&#39;s outside.&#34; The object was almost directly over the house, located in the SE at about 500-1000ft in altitude, floating slowly NW. Within a few minutes, it stopped in a hover and was close enough to discern a vague gray colored triangle shaped outline behind the main point of round orange light. At this point, the object began alternately glow brighter orange and fade, then it began to kind of change in appearance. Several times the object was clearly visible as a line of small bright orange dots which would then resolve into one large orange glowing object again. It did this &#39;dance&#39; at least 3 times. During the times it would again resolve into one object, smaller white sparks appeared to fall off the bottom. After approximately 12 minutes, the object began to fade in brightness and float off towards the west. Shortly thereafter, it faded altogether and since the night was clear with an almost full moon rising, the gray outline was visible clearly at this point. It picked up speed and then disappeared altogether from visibility behind some trees in the neighborhood. We then witnessed a local police patrol turn down the nearest street in the direction that the object went, and I have little doubt that the officer probably saw it too. My 15 y/o daughter who also witnessed the event was on the phone to one of her friends; her parents have a police scanner and she told my daughter that the radio traffic from the local police stated it was &#34;balloons someone set on fire&#34;. That doesn&#39;t make sense. Helium filled balloons would not be able to stand up to the heat of any attached fire source, and this object emitted no smoke trail. Nor did it make any sound. We tried to get videotape of the incident, however, the batteries for the video camera weren&#39;t charged up. This is like the 5th or 6th time I&#39;ve seen this object in various locations in the a! rea.<n>

I always look at the sky when I drive just to see if I can see anything out of the ordinary. Well this night I did. What I witnessed were three lights. They were larger than any star, and had a yellowish orange glow to them. They were in a triangular patern like an isoceles triangle, almost perfect. They seemed to bee about a kilometer up maybe less. They just sat there for about five minutes and then two of them on the northern most sides of the triangle took off so fast they seemed to be at a constant velocity, not acceleration, but velocity and were gone in a matter of seconds. The last one stayed and hovered for at least another ten minutes, but I wanted to go home and show my girlfriend so that I didn&#39;t think I was crazy. I was talking to her the whole time on the phone explaining what was happening. When I arrived at my house the last object was no longer visible. I know none of our aircraft with the ability to hover could have accelerated at the velocity that those two objects left at, it was just to fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This red light blinked out and a circular ship with bluish-green and white rod-like rotating lights appeared in it&#39;s place. They yelled for me to come and see it, and at first it followed a similar flight path to the space shuttle when it goes by our house, but much faster.  Then it dropped down suddenly closer to the horizon, until we could see it no longer.  My husband is an Engineer at the military base and has always been skeptical about this kind of thing, but this morning he&#39;s asking alot of questions.  My daughter was frightened and wondered if it had something to do with the war. I didn&#39;t see the original red light, but it was a U.F.O. with rotating lights around it&#39;s perimeter.<n>

As we started heading south, I noticed something falling from the sky in a straight-down vertical path.  It looked like something on fire dropping from the sky.  For a split second, (having flashbacks to 9/11) I thought it might be a plane heading down.  Then, I see other objects falling too, in more of an arc fashion.  Also, I notice about 5-6 silvery round objects at about a 40,000 foot height in the sky.  My friend and I watch all of this, and notice one of the fiery objects, turn and go north after it had been falling south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We initially thought what we were seeing was &#34;space junk&#34; but that was quickly ruled out with the other vehicles flying around and also the fact that the fiery object went north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two different objects.  The silvery round ones high in the sky and the fiery Rocket like objects falling and climbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening (1/28) I observed the same thing again (that is when I got a better look at the fiery objects).  There were the 5-6 silver round objects and the falling fiery ones at 445 p.m. in the evening at the same location in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live between Ft. Belvoir and Quantico, but on information I could find said anything about air shows or testing of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone have any ideas as to what we could have seen.  Our third witness was my husband&#39;s coworker (not with us at the time) who saw the same objects we had seen on Sunday.  I haven&#39;t found anyone else who has seen it from people that I have asked.<n>

It faces slightly ENE. I looked into a tree and spoote two Morning Doves on two different Branches. While I studied them, my attention was attraced to a streaking object from my right to left in a clear Royal Blue cloudless sky. I was watching a replay of &#34;Wall Street Week&#34; with Louis Roukeyser on WMPT. As he finished with his banter with is weekly guests, he said &#34;Now it is time to answer some questions from our viewers&#34;. It was precisely at the start of this sentance that the object was first seen by me and it was gone before the end of that same sentance. It was travelling at a speed that was unbelievable. It made no sound and left no trail. I went to my neighbors and told him of my experience. We then watched above as the Commercial Airliners made their con-trails above in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1300 -1310, we both observed a USAF Tanker travelling from South to North. I mentioned that it had a small craft beneath it. My neighbor said it was part of the plane, until about two minutes later when a silver white object detached from the Tanker, dipped below, moved left and the up and over. It then headed South towards DC at a high rate of speed as detected by sound, but not visual.<n>

The object was not displaying its own lights and could only be seen from the reflection of lights below.  I aimed a hand-held radar at the object, but did not receive a reading.

My fiance and I have witnessed this fireball about 5 to 7 times now. I have filed a report on here once already for an event on 01/18/02. The same type of fireball object travelling across the sky, this time from east to west. Tonights siting, the object was moving extremely fast. I estimate about 500 NMPH. Altitude is too hard to determine at night. Also this siting tonight was not dropping sparks as the other sitings have done. This is driving us crazy trying to figure out what it is. But, since it is un-identified by us, we consider it a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for responding. My Fiancé and I saw this again tonight and we think we have determined it to be a type of flare.

I guess our only real mystery is who is sending a flare up on a regular basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again and if we ever do encounter anything that can not be explained, we will be sure to let you know, not to mention check your website now and then for some interesting sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

I saw an object, shape unkown, perform manouvers which seemed to defy the laws of physics. I saw a lighted object, perhaps eight lights in all. It seemed to be literally &#34;tumbling&#34; across the sky. It would go from the West end of the San Fernando Valley to the east end, and then back again. It did so very rapidly, and with no noise discernible to me. The strangest thing about its journeys, (even more strange than its speed an silence) was the fact that when it stopped, it stopped almost as if it was at the end of a pendulum swing, and then it swung back.

It was headed south toward Estrella Mountains. I see airplanes constantly flying in this area and know that couldn&#39;t have been a plane.It was amazing. The altitude appeared lower than the usual planes flying by. I saw this just over the roof of the houses 1/16th of a mile south of me. Object looked like it was about two miles away possibly.<n>

Long and winding roads, through alot of hilly areas.  I took notice of it first, at first it looked like a radio tower with one light at the top, white light with a slight out of focus haze.  And also another light just above and to the left, wasn&#39;t sure if I thought it was a star or what.  Then as I looked at it right before my eyes a light of the same size and shape dropped out of the bottom of it, went straight down, and we started on a patch of road that led us by some leafless trees, but we 3 all seen it.  My wife I believe only seen one drop, because of driving and watching the road, but I kept turning and watching.  I seen three lights drop in a vertical strait line, then the light that was above and to the left seemed to move strait about what I origanally thought was a tower light.  They started getting close to each other, the lower one did not seem to drop in height but the one above did.  Then we went around a corner and came back around again after passing a few trees and the lights had vanished.  I never seen the ligts hit the ground or what exactly happened to them that dropped.  It was a creepy feeling.<n>

I was dusting off the floormats when I caught a flash in the corner of my right eye really bright and brief when I turned in the direction it came from I saw what I believed at first to be an airplane heading towards me. After a few minutes the lights began to flash red and blue and back to white. I wanted to get a better look so I walked to the back of the property and watched it dance for a solid twenty minutes. I had my phone in my pocket and called my friend who left his camera in my truck from the previous weekend I told him what I saw and he asked me to tape it for him to check out later. His camera was a high eight with a ffity power zoom and when I started taping I had to ask him how to turn it on and how to focus. As i was taping he was coaching I found a perch on a fence rail and sat motionless taping for fifteen minutes I suppose and decided to call my neighbors to get another opinion. They saw it too. I asked my neighbor if they would watch through the little three inch viewer to see if what I was seeing was real it was a glowing and pulsating orb of indistinguishable size was hovering in the atomsphere right on the horizen it was covered or enclosed partially in some type of banded material which fit around it similar to that of a globe it had a cylindrical snout that seemed axised to some point in the center of the sphere and the whole sphere seemed to rotate around it. Also I was sedintery with a stable position and the thing appeared to jump in and out of focus repeatedly with no notice of sound at times it would flutter back and forth and others would seem to flash away in a millisecond. I live in a small town where the night sky is highly recocnizable and anything differant is noticable, both the Leonid and Gemini showers were visible here in September, November and December.

It was a cobalt blue sky.  I was observing the appearing stars and planets when a bright light caught my eye to the left.  Of course, I figures it was landing lights on a circling plane.  There is a small airport approxamately 4 miles from that location.  As I followed the road,  i lost sight of the light several times.  I hit a long stretch of road.  I saw a red light in front, green on one side, and blue on another.  The light that seemed to be coming from the belly was no longer visible.  I quickly pulled over and rolled down the window.  It was now at an altitude of between 2500 and 3500 feet.  It creeped across the sky, and made no sound.  At that point in time, I was a bit shocked.  I felt a nagging urge to drive on.  I was disturbed that no one else seemed to notice this, or didn&#39;t feel the need to invertigate.<n>

My mother (68) was on her way to my brothers house for a birthday dinner when she saw a strange cylinder shaped object moving down the valley toward an Amish house.  She at first thought it was an aircraft that was making an emergency landing but then it came to a complete stop and hovered near the Amish house, approx. 100 feet in the air. She watched it for several minutes in disbelief.  Then she started driving toward my brother&#39;s house, a couple hundred yards, keeping an eye on the object.  When she pulled into the driveway she turned around to look at the object and said there were what appearded to be two engines but there was no noise or lights.  It was a charcoal colored craft. Then without warning it took off at a high rate of speed, faster than a jet according to her.<n>

I would describe the object as a series of white lights lined up horizontally, similar to what Tim Edwards saw in Colorado a few years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were flashing/strobing in a very strange way, some of the lights would &#34;flicker&#34; while others would &#34;strobe&#34;. I have never seen this type of lights before on aircraft, I&#39;m a retired air force aero medic, and I have had many aircraft firefighting/rescue schools and I&#39;m quite familiar with military aircraft types.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I received a similar sighting report in the same area a few years ago, I have it detailed in my book, &#34;5000 years of UFO&#39;s&#34; by America House publishing, here is a part of that report, &#34;The next evening, Thursday, February 26, 1998, Ms. H saw &#34;a huge white light just south of Clinton Lake. The light was seen near the Clinton/Sherman Air Force Base but it was at treetop level. While (she was) observing the light, it &#39;instantly&#39; came forward to the edge of the tree line...and the light could be seen through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then moved up a few feet in altitude and moved over the interstate directly over her truck. It then flew along I-40 for a few seconds.&#34; By the time Ms. H reached mile marker 47, near Canute, Okla. (population 538), the mysterious light had vanished. She added, &#34;The light was so bright it illuminated the (truck&#39;s) cab.&#34; Continuing with my sighting, the object appeared to be moving very, very slowly to the south. I watched the object as I got into my vehicle and moved to a better viewing spot. I also turned on my radios, (I&#39;m a ham radio operator, KA5UFO), and tuned to the Clinton-Sherman ATC tower frequency, 119.6 along with the local airport channel, 122.8, hoping to hear the aircraft talking to the tower. No luck, then I remembered that the CSA field is closed to air traffic until 7 am. This helped me to rule out an aircraft. It wasn&#39;t a star, planet, weather balloon, blimp, or swamp gas. This object was in my sight for about 5 minutes when it appeared to make a fast turn to the east, and the lights &#34;winked&#34; out and it disappeared within 5 seconds. I saw no other aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Mr. Jim Hickman, noted UFO investigator from Oklahoma, for submitting this report.  PD))<n>

I saw a bright light coming from the south, very low to the horizon, at quite a distance.  I thought it was just a low plane.  After about a minute, it seemed to be much closer, but still very low.  I kept sky watching, looking at planes, Jupiter, Saturn, and Orion.  Then, this object was very close, still low.  I thought it was a plane, but that something might be wrong with it.  I focused it in the binoculars and saw nothing but the light and total blackness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object, other than the light on the bottom, could not be seen except for it displacing the stars in the sky.  As it came closer, it was triangular shaped with one white light in the very middle.  There were no corner lights as often described.  This thing headed right for me.  I practically buried myself into the back door of the GMC Jimmy I had at the time.  The object flew right over my head and it was HUGE!  If it had landed, it would have filled 6 to 8 acres.  As it went over, there was no sound other than the air moving around it.  It flew over me so slowly that I have no idea what held it in the air.  I have never seen anything go this slowly and not fall out of the sky.  The light in the center was extremely bright but did not hurt my eyes at all.  The light was constant, no flashes, strobes or pulses.  The object flew off to the north and out of view.  It was very low, seemingly just above the tall trees around my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very night before, I saw a similar craft, but much higher in the sky, going quite fast.  It had the same white light in the middle.  I would have thought this object was just the white light, but in looking through the binoculars, I could see the triangular shape displacing the stars.  It also traveled south to north.  It was earlier in the evening, ~2100 EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On both nights, a few minutes after the object had left my view; military planes were every where and flew around in my visible sky for about 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know you get a number of reports about triangular craft.  I just wanted mine counted among them.<n>

Then saw another fly accross the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live approximately 15 miles outside of the city of Malvern, Ar.  I was on my way home from a friends house in town and I was alone.  I live on a road that turns off of Highway 67 south almost to Donaldson.  I turned on the road and could see a bright light through the trees.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it at first.  I got up to a clearing where there is a field and could clearly see what the light was.  There was three objects hovering approximatly 50 feet above the trees.  The lights from the object made it very easy to see them.  They were triangle shaped and they were black with lights all the way around them.  The lights were white and did not flash or move or spin or anything. The objects were the quite larger than a C-130 military airplane. The objects were not moving at all.  I paniced and sped up trying to get away from them as fast as I could.  I could still see the objects in my rearview mirror as I drove away.  I did not slow down or stop the rest of the way home.  When I got home I told my mother, my sister, my cousin and her children about what I saw and they all laughed at me.  I convinced my cousin (who is in her 30&#39;s) to come with me to see if the things were still there.  Her and her two sons got in my car with me and we set out on the road. She was still laughing at me until suddenly she stopped laughing and said &#34;Holy ****, what the **** is that?&#34;  I looked to my left (I was driving) and one of the objects came up out of a clearing and flew accross the road until it disappeared.  We watched it fly away to the south.  It was definatly the same thing as the other three I had saw 10 minutes earlier. None of these objects made any sound including this one. When we got to the place where the other three had been, they were gone.  We both started to panic and get scared as we sped home.  The two children that were with us began screaming and crying (one is 11 the other is 8) when the craft flew over the us on the road.  I could not sleep at all last night and thought about it while I was! going t o work at 4:00 this morning.  I have never believed in anything like this until last night.  It was one of the very few times in my life when I have ever been scared.  It is something I don&#39;t ever care to see again.<n>

When we went out the door my son said Mom there&#39;s the big dipper  as I looked up a group of 25 circular lit objects appeared where the big dipper was.  The group stopped and hovered together for a minute.  While this was going on a helicopter came from the east and hovered there.  We assumed they saw the objects as we had or that the helicopter had been tracking them.  The objects began to move as a group and headed east.  As they did this the helicopter turned and watched them go.  Then another group of about 25 appeared and appeared to stop at about the same place  as we watched a third group came along.  When they reached the stopped group  they all traveled the same path the first group did.  After that we did not see any more.<n>

While I was driving home, a couple of blocks from my house, I was on a red light and for a few seconds I glanced up and I saw this HUGE formation of lights! I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing but I know it was not a reflection from some billboard and it was neither a helicopter nor an airplane! This is the description of what I saw: A bright light at the top of what I believe was the object (I couldn&#39;t see the object because it was very dark to determine a shape) and a group of lights horizontally grouped at the bottom. The lights that were at the bottom part were moving very fast from left to right and vice versa.  The bottom lights had a squared/rectangular shape, but the one at the top, was round. They all moved together so they definitely were part of an object. They were also very bright! This object  was moving from west to east slowly. It wasn&#39;t producing sound, but what really shocked me was the SIZE of what I saw! I&#39;m not telling I saw something at the horizon....NO...I saw something that was the size of a roof top and was just of few feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, I wanted to keep looking at it but I had to make a left on the light...and when I tried to find it again...it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove for almost a half-hour looking around everywhere but nothing else happened...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m TOTALLY SURE about what I&#39;m describing! I cannot believe nobody else looked up the sky and saw this object! The event was enough to produce more than one car accident! I hope somebody else in the city could appreciate this event and hopefully they will also report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the brother of the witness, and found him to be quite credible in his rendition of his sister&#39;s report.  He reports that she was quite shaken emotionally by the experience.

My sister and I were so stunned we didn&#39;t think to look at it as it left to go east but after a few seconds we looked to the east and it had dissapeared.<n>

They produced 5 of these messages within the course of an hour and 1/2.  The ships were clearly visible.  No sound accompanied this manifestation, and they &#34;winked&#34; out one by one, then would appear about 15 minutes later to make another one.  Three messages ran from north to south over the ocean, and two of them went from east to west right above my car.

We were not intoxicated or under the influence of any form of inhibiting substance.  One of my friends was looking at the night sky, and told us to run over as quickly as possible.  She pointed upwards, and pointed out five, possibly six bright yellowish lights flying in a tight formation.  I thought they might be military craft, but as they flew, one of the lights turned a dark red, almost crimson color, and darted off at a ninety degree angle, flanking it&#39;s fellow craft and passing to the rear.  The other craft split up and circled in violent turns to rally on the first ships rear.  One of my friends reported hearing a sound, but that is unconfirmed, as neither my other friend or myself heard this sound.  Suddenly, they broke fast and vanished.  I know for a fact that no craft currently in use by any military force on this planet can manevuer like that.  After the event, we ran inside to get a camera, and waited outside for quite some time, but nothing happened after that. I have reported a somewhat similiar occurance in the same neighborhood quite some time ago, and I have heard rumors from this area that sightings have occured in the past five or six years.  Please DO NOT contact me via mail or telephone, but rather e-mail.  Other people I live with are extremely skeptical, as was I before the first of these occurances happened.<n>

There were 6 to 7 lights in that similiar pattern, with the pattern tilted about 5 degrees from level. I could that this, whatever it was, was very low in altitude...approximately about 1,500 feet or so (using the mountains in the background as a guide to aiding altitude and distance). The object was approximately, based on diatnce with respect to the mountains (object in front of the mountains), looked about on the order of 1 mile across, perhaps, even bigger in size. It was enormous. After watching the object for some minutes, I decided to move down the hill to try and get a better look. The object may have, initially, been sighted near the Indian Casino off the 10 freeway...Morongo Casino is the name of the place it appeared to be closest...in morongo. Now in the time I took to drive a few hundred feet or so down the hill (which took me only approximately 10-15 seconds)...we saw that it had moved...very fast from where it was first sighted. It now appeared to be very close if not over the Palm Springs International Airport (they had to see whatever the hell this thing was...absolutely no mistake about it). We lost sight of it after this time. The lights were of a goldish, coppery color...very distinct...could not miss this object. Time of sighting was about 1910 to 1920 hours. The sky conditions were absolutely clear...unlimited visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a ((personal information deleted/public servant)).

Object was stationairy and appeared to be a bright pinpoint of non-flickering white light, like a street lamp or airplane landing light in the shape of a weather balloon. Looked like big white weather balloon. Sky was blue but slightly hazy, with a few high clouds. Object did not change position in sky, and I was able to observe it through 10 x 50 binoculars. Object looked like grayish-white sphere with black edge along bottom side. Object also appeared to be glowing from within and reflecting sunlight at the same time. Binoculars were hand held, and slight wind made still observation difficult. Object seemed to glow brighter as I observed in binoculars, and when I attempted to view the object without the binoculars, I lost it and could not find it again.

All of those things follow the physical laws of orbital mechanics. These lights that I saw, did not.

(I have predicted the appearance of sightings I have had, due to a feeling I get, to which I have had all my life).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was blue - not hazy or cloudy - just blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed outof the drivers side window two jets flying in formation. The jets were very far away and were tiny - you could just make them out in front of their chem trails. I lit myself a cigarrette and watched the jets for a while, by now the jets were visible from the windscreen. I said to myself, that feeling must be just a coincidence (for the last  several sightings I have had) when out of the blue canopy a star shaped and star coloured object descended and hovered above the jets, (it was quite a long flight down for it)I was just thinking YES! when not 1 but three other crafts descended 1 by 1, identical to the first and just sat there hovering with the 1st. I was blown away by this but then the second and forth &#39;Stars&#39; ascended back up through the blue canopy. Just as the first &#39;Star&#39; started to ascend, the other 2 &#39;Stars&#39; came back down. Now there were three hovering. The first &#39;Star&#39; re-descended and now all four were hovewring there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Friend came out of the store and by now I had got out of the car and was leaning/sitting on the bonnet. I asked her to tell me what she could see in the distance, she replied, I quote: &#34; I can see two planes - why?&#34; I asked &#34;what do you see above the planes?&#34; She replied: &#34; I can see some stars - so what? You can see stars in the daytime sometimes!&#34; I asked: &#34;ok - what are the stars doing?&#34; She then became anxious and shouted: &#34; so what! I wanna get out of here, lets go, I don&#39;t want to be here!&#34; As it was my friends car, (I was driving for her)we had to go. Since this happened I have told people and although they think me insane I kinda knew that they would believe me once they heard my friend tell what happened. (she is a teacher and held in good regard and standing)So a couple of times we bumped into each other whilst I was with a person whom I had &#39;relieved&#39;the story with and I asked her to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her reply has been, on both occaisions: I don&#39;t want to talk about it!&#34; This is not a story but a true account of 1 of my many sightings, it isn&#39;t just the fact that I see a fair few ufo phenomenon it&#39;s the fact that I predict their appearance.

I was driving on the highway 5 Km north of Swan Hills, Alberta when a bright object in the sky caught my attention. This bright object remained stationary in the sky while directly above it a commercial jet aircraft flew over. I would estimate that the Bright object was halfway between the ground and the flight corridor of the jets. I continued to watch as the jet passed wwhile the &#34;object&#34; remained fixed in the same position in the sky. Many minutes elapsed and another commercial jet aircraft followed on the same flight path with a smaller jet following very closely behind. This in itself seemed very odd as the distances betweeen the two jets was very close. The bright object remained fixed in the sky while the two jets passed overhead and flew out of site. The UFO finally disappeared from the sky. I watched this episode for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After a few sexonds the sun seemed to turn into a gray haze. It moved like a mass higher in the sky, then veered to the side and appeared to be coming towards me. At this point it split into two separate masses. These masses moved in opposite directions, 1 east 1 west, until they were enarly out of view. At this point, the reversed directions, headed straight toward eachother, and impacted with a flash of light. I did not physically feel any wind or heat, merely stood staring at the sky for a near ten minutes before heading off to work.<n>

It was just there, as if it just appeared from no where. At first, I thought I was dreaming, but I felt sick to my stomach. I realized it was really happening. I had just stepped outside to scare off some fighting cats that were waking the dead. I looked up to star gaze for a moment when I saw it. It seemed to have no real shape, almost gas like, only it glowed. It was like lights being shined through dried ice or fog. Only the fog was hovering higher than the night clouds. I wasn&#39;t scare, just in awe. It lingered for about a minute, then it stretched out very thin and long. It stretched longer and thinner until it was no longer visible.<n>

Four mornings later, at about the same time, I saw the same or an identical object moving in precisely the same way over the same stretch of ocean.

There was no sound that I could discern from the object even though I was inside.  We can usually hear an aircraft even from indoors here in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was far brighter than any aircraft lights or helicopter lights, and was much larger.

At around 6:55 pm I saw something shoot across the sky and thought it was a plane on fire because ther were several flying around than night...I just figured it was Dyass AFB doing test runs.  When I looked again I saw this red light just hanging in mid-air, this was no airplane...it hovered there for a second and I could see a small white light underneath the red light and some kind of haze around both of them. Then the object shot straight toward down and disappeared probably about ten feet before hitting the ground.  I nearly had a wreck trying to pull over and see if I could see it again.  I found my video camera and filmed the sky for about five to seven minutes but never saw it again.  I saw no evidence of any kind of crash or anything.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my entire life.<n>

My nieces and nephews were assigned an astronomy project, it was city-wide,  and the subject was to study the different phases of the moon. Heavy cloud cover the night before had hidden the moon, also there were no entries on my calendars for a moon viewing. I awoke early, it was a cold, crisp, clear morning. I was restless, I always look out the window. The moon was the biggest that i had ever remembered, it looked as if there was a red spot on it, I got my binoculars but couldn&#39;t make out the spot. Anyway, dawn was approaching, the rays of the sun were visible, thought I was going to see the moon and the sun in the same frame. As i was watching the rays of the sun come up, a cigar shaped thing, moving extremely fast, came up from either a stationary position or a hovering position, and flew right across the face of the moon at a 45 degree angle. I thought, you&#39;ve just seen a ufo. I called my father and told him.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very large and seemed reasonably close to where I was standing. The shape was odd in that the bottom portion was somewhat oval, but like an oval tilted with an appendage attached to it. The appendage was triangular in shape, but seemed attached to the tilted cylinder like a sail. The point of the sail pointed to what would be south/west. The object did not move at all for about 15 seconds as I watched it, before running into the house to call my wife to come look. She came out immediately, by which time the object seemed to have moved far to the north/northwest and appeared only as a bright circle.  As we watched it suddenly got smaller and smaller and faded out and disappeared, all within about 6 or 7 seconds. I have never seen a UFO before, and don&#39;t know if I saw one this time, but this was by far, the oddest object I have ever witnessed in the sky.  My wife and I were both amazed. Have you any idea of what we might have seen?  Our phone number is (702)363-2212. I called your hotline and left a message. My e-mail is benpearlman@lvcm.com Ben Pearlman<n>

I thought a plane was low-flying and perhaps ready to crash..I thought the lights I saw were strung across the front of the plane and wings. However, there was absolutely no sound to be heard from the object. I then supposed I maybe saw a searchlight going across the mountains but it did not really make sense since I heard no sound of either a helicopter or plane. It appeared to be a string of beaded lights in a horizontal pattern. I ran inside and got my daughter and son to come out and look at the strange object, since I had no clue what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom brought my brother and I outside to see some sort of object...I asked her what it was that she was taking us to look at but she didn&#39;t know. At the time I thought she had seen a wild animal in the woods and wasn&#39;t sure of it. When we were outside we went to the top of the driveway and looked out over the mountains. We then saw about 50 lights-ones you might see on a passing airplane, none flashing- about halfway down the mountain. It moved slowly across the mountain in a horizontal fashion, with a few lights disappearing from the left, and then reappearing on the right. It gave a creepy sound, one that you might hear if a person was trying to sound like a ghost...one you might hear one an episode of the Twilight Zone. The sighting of this object frightened me and I wanted to go back inside, which we did. When we got inside, the object was gone with the sound from our view, down south towards Bennington. My mom and I were baffled of what it might be, thinking of all we could, we only came up with ideas like &#34;A stealth plane&#34; or &#34;A helicopter sending out a search light across the mountain&#34;, none made any sense...except a UFO.<n>

I looked out of the car window to my right (i was in the driving seat) and i could see in the very far distance of the sky, 2 # jets leaving a vapour trail. <n>The jets were so far away and tiny that it took a long time b4 they were in the front windscreen view about halfway up the windscreen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole of the sky was a clear blue and there were no clouds nor was there any mist cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> because i had not seen anything &#39;abnormal i was beginning to think that &#39;the Feeling&#39; was rubbish and coincidental to the other sightings I have had when the UFO&#39;s came into view. This was the definitive proof for me that all the other sightings i have had were legitimate and that now i can relax and evolve spiritually. I now understand and accept that we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jets that i had mentioned were flying one above the other and one was slightly behind the other approximate distance would be a little finger nailif i held my hand outstretched in front of me. above the jets and one by 1 four UFO&#39;s descended and hovered above the Jets. all four were motionless and just hung in the sky for approximately 5-10 mins. I was totally amased at what i could see and thought to look around at other people to see if they were seeing what i was but they were just going about their every day lives and quite frankly no-one was even looking up into the sky. I watched in amasement as i was beginning to think perhaps the Jets had &#39;let off&#39; some flares when 2 of the objects ( I think it was the 1st and third one that came down, went back up through the atmosphere and out of view. the two remaining UFO&#39;s stayed above the Jets. it was then that the 1st UFO came back down.  Just then my friend came out of the supermarket and i had got myself out of the car. she asked me what I was doing and in order not to prompt her and to see if she could see the same thing as I, I asked the question &#34; X, what can u see in the distance&#34;? I also pointed in the direction that the incident was happening. X replied &#34;I can see 2 planes in the sky&#34; I then said &#34;ok. what can you see above the Jets&#34;? X replied &#34; there are some stars..so what? you can see stars in the daytime sometimes&#34;! I then asked her &#34;what are the &#39;Stars&#39; doing&#34;? and X said &#34;They are moving up&#34; (it was at this point that either my friend was scared or didn&#39;t want to aknowledge what we were observing when she sternly said &#34; so f*****g what! lets go - I dont want to be here&#34; I really wanted to stay but i had no way of recording the incident and reluctantly got in the car and drove us home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The description of the UFO&#39;s are as my freind said, it was like watching stars come out of the blueness of the sky and hover above the Jets and the would then after a few minutes go back up to where they had come from. I have had many more encounters with witnessess and they have been as good and better than this one described. you may email me for more info. I do not care what others think for I now know the truth and know a lot more about reality than most.  ((e-address deleted))<n>

Then my wife saw a light which looked like a bright star about 9oclock(using moon as center) 10 degrees from the  moon.  This was a clear day with bright sun. then at 5 oclock, using first object as center, about 5 degrees from the first object,another appeared. After about 10 minutes 3 less visible (about 1/4 as bright) objects appeared, in a straight line (using second object as center), at 6,5,4 oclock at about 2 degrees below the lower objet and lined upward at about a 45 degree angle to the horizon.  Because these were less visible the two witnesses could not see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us saw the first 2 objects . All objects seem to be stationary. With the bright sun and clear skys I feel that what we saw was indeed 5 objects that were stationary and the sun was hitting them at an angle to reflect light  towards earth.<n>

I thought to myself it was a helicopter at first but it kept sitting still and didn&#39;t have any movable parts like a helicopter blade.  The object had no wings and just seemed to be hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for 2 minutes and then the bus drove by a cliff that blocked my view.  I was baffled.

As it was travelling, smaller orange lights were dropping from it. The smaller ights looked almost like sparks and we at first thought it was a flare from a flare gun. Once the object travelled out of site, a second identical object was seen coming from southern sky heading northbound. This object was not dropping smaller lights as the other one did though. While the first object was visible, my fiance ran in and grabbed our digital camera and several shots were taken of both objects. Unfortunately, the detail does not show up in the picturers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to review the video tape.  PD))<n>

I looked down my street ( I live in a small village about 1 hr north of NYC at the foot of the catskill mountains). All of a sudden I saw an orangish(?) ball of light go from left to right across my street. It was pretty fast, but from what I can recall it seemed to be about 100 feet over the rooftops and I would guess about 200 feet away, but the distance could have been deceptive. It seemed to be about the size of a basketball. It vanished about 1-2 secs later behind the house on the other side of the street. There DEFINATELY was no sound of engines. I&#39;m not really sure if I want to call the police and ask if anyone else had seen anything. They&#39;ll think I&#39;m nuts ! I would love to know if anyone else had seen anything. I&#39;m not sure if it was Fri or Sat night , but it was before the recent snowstorm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date of January 26, which is not possible.  We have requested clarification.  We assume he may have in mind the dramatic fireball event seen on January 20, 2002.  We have amended the date here.

I checked several sources and the date was DEFINATELY the 18th of January!  I know you said dates were very important, so I checked with several people as to the date of the storm over the long Martin Luther King weekend. It occured approximately 10:30 the previous night- the sky was clear and it hadn&#39;t snowed yet, so that would definately would have been the 18th.

1/18/02 05:45|Hamilton (Canada)|ON|Light|2 minutes|lights in a seemingly semi-circle pattern; an 'X' outline on the vessels underbelly with white lights and a red light|1/29/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21518.html|93|ndxe200201| lights in a seemingly semi-circle pattern; an &#39;X&#39; outline on the vessels underbelly with white lights and a red light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was partying at a friend&#39;s house on Friday January 18. Everyone had fallen asleep by about 5:00AM and i was the only one left awake . I decided to clean up my friend&#39;s rather attrocious house and this required taking the garbage outside to the garbage bin. It was a somewhat clear night with only a few clouds in the sky.  There wasn&#39;t anyone up and the streets were silent. As I placed the garbage bags into the bin I noticed a bright light far away on the horizon. I remember only glancing at the sight as I assumed it was merely a plane or chopper. It should be noted that I had previously been a skeptic when it came to UFO sightingings. As I turned to enter the house the light began an unbelievable ascent into the sky. I say unbelievable because of the rate at which the object could climb. It was at this very moment that I first entertained the notion of this vessel being an unidentified flying object. The light seemed to be emanating from one source but if I glanced away for the briefest moment the light appeared to be made up of mutiple lights that were arranged in a semi-circle pattern. The object had risen to an enormous height in the sky and I thought it was going to disappear into the night when suddenly it began a descent with the velocity at which it had previously risen. I remember a feeling of fright coming over me. As a rational person I was terrified at the notion that something inexplicable could exist, and yet here it was before me. The object appeared to be coming in my direction as it descended. I lost sight of the object for a second and then it re-appeared directly overhead. I estimate it must have been about a mile-and-a-half above the ground. It sliced through the clouds effortlessly and as soon as it had appeared overhead, it was gone. The underpannel was marked with an &#39;X&#39; and had white lights outlining this shape. There appeared to be a red light moving around the object in a circular pattern. I remember hearing a low buzzing sound that accompanied the vessel as it flew overhead. ! I was co mpletely overwhelmed and spent the remainder of the morning debating whether i had actually seen what i had thought i had seen and whether or not it would be worth telling anyone at all.<n>

The road came to a straight a way and in the distance I saw what appeared to be headlights coming over the hill. Then it got closer, raised itself above the hills, and looked like two sets of bright headlights on top of each other. It was right in our path getting ready to cross over my car. I saw a triangle shaped object with the 4 bright &#34;headlights&#34; and a red blinking light underneath it.We panicked because we didnt want to be right under it, so I veered off the road onto a dirt road out of its path. It started to turn towards us, and by that time my friends were watching it and I was trying to drive as fast away from it as possible. Unfortunately I drove down a dead end. So i stopped and turned the car around. When I did, the object was accross a huge field about 6-7 football stadiums away. All within a few seconds.  I decided to report this after I saw more people in the same area saw the same thing within a few days. It was strange, but I dont believe we had any missing time or anything. It was all within a few mins.<n>

I looked up and saw a whitish, glowing, cylindrical object with four bands of bright red lights spaced along it&#39;s length.  It was spinning in an anti-clockwise direction (just like an electric drill going in reverse) The craft was travelling approximately in a North Westerly direction. It was travelling very fast and disappeared within about 10 seconds.  There was no sound and the craft was below the cloud level.<n>

( We take high blood pressure medication and so never drink)  When we left the Casino to get in our car,  we saw a glowing ball the size of a basketball floating in and out of  the clouds over the water  by cherry point. We watched it for  a time, and suddenly the ball no longer had any cloud covering. It glowed, and then out of the ball came seven small bow tie shapes that flew around the ball and then  flew over the cherry point oil  refinery. The bow ties were small about 1/20 of the size of the main ball of light. The bow ties then returned to the ball of light and the ball simply disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness means a date of January 17, 2002.

However, when it got closer I noticed that there were only red and white lights (typically the planes that fly over here also have green lights and thats why this caught my attention).  The lights were very bright and as the object got closer I saw that it was not a plane at all but an object that was shaped very much like an octagon with bright red and white lights.  I watched as the object headed east. The lights were so bright that I could see the object for several minutes a long way off.  I called my sister in Springfield (which is approximately 20 miles from here) and told her to go outside to see if she could see a UFO.  I could still see the bright lights with my naked eyes when she told me that she saw the object but she thought that it was a plane.  When I asked her if she saw any wings on the plane she said that from the angle that she saw it she couldn&#39;t see any wings.  Then she said she saw another aircraft heading her way.  What seemed very strange was that both of the aircraft seemed to turn and they flew back this way (West). I watched until the object finally disappeared heading South. (The second aircraft was still in sight when the octagon shaped object disappeared).<n>

It sat in the same place for about 2 minutes and then streaked a crossed the sky headed to the southwest gaining altitude at a amazing rate. It had no exhaust trail or light trail. It made no noise.  I have witnessed military jet fighters powering up to break the sound bearer and this was moving much faster.  My wife said I was nuts and it was just an airplane.  I don&#39;t think it was. Let me know if anyone else saw it please! (A follow up e-mail with the witness on Friday the 18th of January 2002, revieled further information...) I told my neighbor (who has lived in the same house for 20 years) about the sighting and he told me that I wasn&#39;t the first person to see the red light in the neighborhood.  According to him, as many as 6 people have seen a red fuzzy light over the last 20 years.  I asked him if he was one of those people and he declined to answer. He then excused himself and hurried back into his house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (An exact location of where this object was seen is presently being sought through a follow up investigation and some reseach into whether other aircraft were in the area at the time will be conducted to see if other witness can be located.

I came out to actually find 2 bright balls of light no more than 2000 feet in front of me across the street from my house where a sand pit is located. They blended the colors of red, green, blue and white. The larger of the 2 was approx. 3 car lengths in a circle and the smaller was about 2 car lengths in a circle. they were about 50ft above the tree tops. The smaller of the two fled N.E. at a high rate of speed and the other one hovered above the tree tops. It hovered back and forth and up and down for about 8 mins. And the wierd thing was it made NO SOUNDS!!! Not a hum, Not a wisper!!!!then it gradually continued over Rte 107 and headed off toward Danville NH area at approx. 20-25 MPH. It stayed at about 50 feet above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After researching, I found that I have a power grid 1/2 mile N.W. of my house and there have been multiple sightings there dating back to 1965!!<n>

Dropping vertically from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 3 children &amp; I were driving home on Woodville Hwy when my son and I seen a large d ball of light dropping like a rock from the sky.  We watched it descend in less than a minute.  The best way to describe the shape is to say it looked like a ghost made out of sheet &amp; flying upside down.  It was very bright and it had a light blue hue at the tail of it.  It was not moving diagnoly but vertically-straight down.  I called my mother(this was all within 15 minutes of spotting the object) when we reached home to tell her about it and while she was on the phone with me she also seen what she said was something as bright as the moon with a bluish hue and very large and solid falling by the woods off of Hwy 20.  She was freaking out and called my dad outside but he missed it by a second.  She also said that it was falling straight down like it was very heavy.  You can reach Hwy 20 by taking Hwy 267 from where I was driving on Woodville Hwy.  Is it possible something fell in the stretch of woods on hwy 267?  My husband made an inquiry to the Wakulla Sheriff&#39;s department, however nothing had been reported.  I am a very skeptical and would like to know if anyone else see something falling from the sky that night.  None of us that witnessed this object heardany sounds.  Can anyone explain?<n>

It also appeared to be blinking smaller, colored lights: orange, blue, yellow, in a regular, rhythmic pattern. Appeared to be high altitude, much higher than aircraft going to and from Oakland and SFO, and also much brighter than lights coming from these aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Jupiter, which is very bright currently, and would be in the eastern sky at the time indicated.

Myers to Naples when I saw an object in the sky. It was bright, and it seemed like there was more than just the light, but too far away to make out a shape. It wasn&#39;t a star or a plane or a planet. It kept moving with me as I headed to Naples. It was really, really far up and seemed distant--not like how most people see stuff close. Between exits 19 and 18 there were two empty cars parked together on the side of the road (contacts?). As I kept going another object crossed the path of the first and went behind my car. The other object remained visible until I got home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Event may have been a missile launch, possibly from a submarine.  Please see other reports.  PD))<n>

My husband and I have seen this on several occassions (together &amp; idiviually) since Sept. 1999. The first time we saw it was at about 9pm on a clear night in September. It was an extremely bright light racing toward the south. It did not have a trail nor did it make any noise. I don&#39;t if you would classify it as a fireball or a light. It was as bright as a fireball or perhaps like a meteor. It streaked across the sky in a matter of seconds. We never saw anything fly that fast. It actually seem to dissapear into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both professionals and realized after mentioning it to couple of friends in passing coversation, that it was best to stop talking about it because they thought it a strange topic and in laymans terms didn&#39;t want them to think we were nuts. A few months later a friend had told us that while she &amp; her husband were walking the dog, she too, had seen the same light. Her husband did not because he was not looking in the same direction. Since then we have viewed this same strange light on several occassions. Twice at dusk. On a clear evening and on a overcast evening and also late at night. It has been a few months since we saw had seen the last occurance and we forgot all about it until recently. Another friend of ours (a little skeptical) told us about a green light she viewed during the daylight hours. Unlike what we had seen, this light (fireball) appeared to change directions and then disappear. We were very interested in what she had said because now we personally know of two other people in the same town who saw this and think that others must have seen this too. It is ironic that to see such a event like this you would have to be looking at in the right place at the right time because it happens so fast! We thought that living amidst so many Government bases that perhaps they have experimental aircraft they were flying... but then again, why would they test it over such a highly populated state like ours. Who knows...! We are left wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in January 2002 is approximate.  We have arbitrarily assigned the date of January 07th, since other reports from the east coast were submitted from the east coast for that date for a sighting similar in description to what is submitted here.

I then noticed a very large bright red stationary light and quickly discounted Mars, a satellite, plane but not yet a helicopter. I assumed it was a helicopter at first by its apparent static movement but it slowly moved in circular pattern and then the light flickered and got dimmer/brighter. It appeared 10 times larger then any planet and many, many times brighter then Sirius in the winter. As I watched I noted the background stars (2 faint ones) and I moved away from the neighbors porch light and positioned myself with a better view. I moved around to see it pass behind the power lines and to get a different angle of view. I noticed when I stopped moving that it was making a slow circular motion in a small area. I continued watching and heard nothing and it started moving in a linear manner to the south. I then alerted my neighbor. He came out and observed it. I asked that he turn his porch light off and he stated it would take forever to turn back on but he turned it off anyway. We both continued observing it and then I stated, &#34;Stay here while I grab my binoculars.&#34; I quickly retrieved them and came out and started viewing it in a wide angle and saw that it seemed to have no shape other then seeming very broad. I zoomed in and still no shape, I zoomed out again and focused to see it better and followed it as it moved. I noted no other lights or surface. It seemed to have a sphere shape but more like a very large bright red orb or sphere shape. I handed the binoculars to my neighbor and he looked for 10-20 seconds. I regained the binoculars and spotted it quickly and as I did it dropped a light from the bottom (not as bright, and much smaller and slightly orange/red) which moved very quickly at a right angle to the bright red light. I stated loudly &#34;What was that?&#39; and continu! ed follo wing it by eye and binoculars, it then dropped 4-5 more small bright reddish/orange lights that dropped quickly at a regular interval and they seemed to drop just over the hills or tree line. We both witnessed this. They seemed to be like flares shooting down with some sort of trail but they moved quickly, much faster than I would expect from a free fall. They were each slightly different in intensity/size and color. At this point the larger red light continued moving away and dimmed giving the impression of moving quickly away and out or dimming and moving away. I was watching with the naked eye at this point and could no longer locate the large red light nor the multiple smaller lights. I heard no sirens after and no other witnesses. My neighbor returned to his apartment and I sat at my computer recollecting any and all details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally lucid and credible.

At first, it had a sort of tail like a comet, but it faded away.  The light continued to &#34;glide&#34;forward through the sky till it slowed down (almost to a hault) and split into 3 red lights, but a less intense red.  The first object continued on the same path, but the other two stayed behind to form a triangle and became a white halogen light.  The two lights that were left behind aligned parellel to each other.  Those two lights began going up and down (like the cylenders of an engine) and dissapeared into space as the first light (which was still red)continued on the same path and dissapeared into the sky as well.  Shortly after the sighting, when the car was parked and the key was out of the ignition, one of the windows was left down.  Out of coincedense, the passenger pushed the button for the window to go up (without the key in the ignition)and the window rolled up.  To our surprise, all of the windows were operating with the car completely off.  After a minute or so, the windows stopped (almost like the battery died).  After we had dinner and came home we were observing the sky around the area where we previously sighted the UFO.  There was a military search plane (we know this because one of us had served in the army) circling the same area we had seen the object an hour earlier.  It circled around a few times, almost like it was trying to find the UFO.  We assumed they must have picked it up on radar because it seemed to be flighing low.  It was very strange.<n>

It was about the length of a fingernail at arm&#39;s length, and angled at about 45 degrees upward. This initial light seemed to &#39;grow&#39; a tail which streamed downward along a 45 degree angle with a bright golden glow, stretching to approx. one finger length (at arm&#39;s length). The cone of the light itself did not move. The cone or head seemed to have points like a 5-pt star which extended slightly beyond the circular light center. After about 20-25 seconds, the &#39;tail&#39; shrunk back until only the original light was visible. Then, from the center, two lights emerged and created a triangular pattern, half a finger-length across at its widest span. These 3 lights were differently colored: red, blue,gold. Two lights moved away from the center one, creating a larger triangular shape. First the red, then the blue light gradually faded out. Then the gold bottom light slowly moved toward the horizon where I lost sight of it.<n>

We watched what we thought were some kind of strange aircraft then as we studied more we noticed that the aircraft was not anything of this earth. They moved in ways that i have never seen. Then they just stopped and hovered for a long period of time. My co-worker and I were pretty spooked about the whole thing so we went back inside. We went to leave work just a little while later and there were several military jets flying over Jamestown. We thought this whole thing was pretty weird!!! I got home and told my husband about this. He then called and reported this to WGHP Fox 8 television in High Point, NC. They said they didn&#39;t get any reports on this but that they would follow up on it. They said they usually don&#39;t get much cooperation on these type of things. He then called and reported this to WFMY CBS ch. 2 in Greensboro, NC and got the same response. He then called Piedmont Triad Int. Airport and spoke with the airport authority. They said that they didn&#39;t get any reports from air traffic control, but they did say that the military doesn&#39;t always report what they&#39;re up to.<n>

Possibly a UFO?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, Im like any other 12 year old girl, interestd in UFOs and outer space. Well, I always wanted to see a UFO and I just guess this day was my luck day. It was about a year ago and My mother and I were driving to my grandfathers house for a nice long vist. Well we went out to eat for breakfast about 10oclock and when we were driving back to his house I saw a line in the sky. Its wasnt long, nor short it was in the middle. It wasnt a cloud because it was moving in a different dirrection as in the way the earth was rotating. It wasnt one of those plan theat leave the smoke behind either. So my first 2 thoughts that it couldnt be them so i thought UFO!! Well i starting yelling at my mom look next to the sun (since thats were this craft or object was located). Of corseshe starting yellin back at me I cant look at the sun im driving. Well I got really upset because i saw a UFO (or atleast what i think it could of ben) and noone was there to witness this with me. We then were in my grandfathers house for about 2 hours. We starting drinvin down a really big hill and all of a sudden i scaremd at my mom and yelled &#34;there it is! its still there!! see i wasnt lieing!!&#34; Now since he sun was almost down my mom could of looked over in te location this craft was. Now the first thig that also cam to her mind was it cant be a cloud or a plane, so she also belive it was a UFO. We then got to the bootom of the hill, not taking our eyes off this craft, and suddenly, it dissapperd!!! That was the last my mom and I talked about this. When I got home my mm went searching onthe computer and said there was a meter shower cominig, and said it was the start of the meator shower. I said wat ever and just agreed. But u wanna know sumthing? I dont believe it and I never will. I no there is life out there. and if u dont believe me ask yourslef these questions. Why would earth be the only plant with life on it? How do you explain The Bumerta Trinagle? Stone Headge? things like that. Well I just wanted to share my story with you, and ! this isn t a lie..its may or may not  a UFO but its a true story.<n>

Before me and my girlfriend was going to bed I took a look out the window to see if it was raining as I looked up to the sky above the back side of the house I saw something black falling out the clouds the object was pitch black. It fell fast at first I thought it was a ballon but it came so close above the house that me and my girlfriend got to look at it for about to 2 whole minutes. We got a very good look at it. It came down and it looked like it was out of control then it stoped above the house trying to get control of its self. It woobled for  almost 2 minutes to get control of its self and fly away it gave me and my girlfriend enough time to really get a dam good look at it from all sides because it was turning in all directions as it was out of control. This is what it looked like, It was pitch black in color with no lights at all or windows. It was flat round on the bottom and it was round on the top but it had a bump in the middle like a cock pit with no windows on each side of the bump/cock pit it had silver/gray ridges I figure it might be the wings but it had no wings.On the back it had a short triangel shape tail which was also pitch black in color. This object made no noise it was silent It almost looked just like a sting ray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

While enjoying a valentines evening on the 12 floor of the Grand Hotel 22nd Street Ocean City , Maryland, 5 glowing orbs came into view from over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly approach. Size of large beach balls in single formation. Upon reaching approximitely 250 meters beyond surf breakers and hovering at 50 meter elevation,for 15 minutes ,orbs united into one and disappeared below the water. A similar incident occurred about 3 years ago while Ocean City was hosting a political event. The news papers (local) covered the story and there were high profile witnesses. For several days after ,large Sikorski helicopters from the Navy and un-marked black helicopters scoured the area. Black Boston Whaler type boats were also barely seen in the area after dark with no lights on. Co-incidence or not, this area remains saturated with &#39;chemtrails&#39; EVERY day !

At the start of a straightaway that&#39;s just over a mile in length, a brightly lit airplane appeared to be flying towards us from just above the trees at the opposite end of the stretch of road we were traveling.  Having a Navel base near by and a small airport even closer, aircraft are common and none of us gave it a second thought.  Once at the end of the straightaway the highway veers and proceeds to the left, the object was still in the same spot although now to view it one would have to look up out of the car windows on the right side and look through the branches of the trees.  It seemed to travel along side us for another mile where I turned right onto a side road to get a better view where now the object in fact paused momentarily and slowly moved down the hill towards the water and the town of Coupeville on the other side. The object was moving slow enough that I was able to turn left onto the street I live, stop at my house, run inside grab my digital camera.  Get back to the car drive to the end of the street where it meets back up with highway 20, get out and snap a few pictures.  The object more clear to us now appeared to have several sources of light close together, mainly white but later turning red (unlike that of an airplane).  The object turned left and started heading east traveling along the opposite shoreline.  Just past the town the object again took another left which put the little airport mentioned earlier, in its path.  We decided to go to the airport and wait to see if indeed it was an airplane.  No airplane landed and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear and the sound of jets could not be heard and the prop sounds from smaller aircraft was not heard.  It was not until twenty minuets after arriving back at our house could the navel jets be heard throttling their engines.  To my knowledge no other reports were made.  Although the following day there was an unfamiliar navel plane flying low through the area just before dusk, with a strange array of lights on its wings and body.  Large bright lights arranged in the shape of a triangle with a red flashing light in the center of the three.  That night the plane flew over the area again, slow and at a low altitude. The sounds of the engines were audible.  In this area it is very uncommon to see any navel aircraft flying in that pattern and altitude.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Train Collision<n> <n><n> <n><n> At exactly 2:47 a.m. on Jan. 14 02, while working a coal train enroute from Russell Kentucky to Shelbiana Kentucky, our trailing unit and first two cars were severely damaged as we struck an unknown floating or hovering object.  I know it was 2:47 because my watch froze, and to this day shows that time.   Along with my watch the entire electrical systems on both locomotives went haywire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approaching a bend near milepost cmg 42 in an area referred to as the wild kingdom, for the many different types of animals spotted there, my conductor and I saw lights coming from around the way. This ordinarily means another train is coming and will pass on the other track.  The outlay of the area is this, the river, #1 track, #2 track and a straight up mountainside, carved out for the laying of these tracks.  I killed our lights as not to blind the oncoming crew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we rounded the corner our onboard computer began to flash in and out, speed recorder went nuts, and both locomotives died.  Alarm bells began to ring and thats when we saw the objects.  Apparently scanning the river for something, the objects, (at least 3) had several &#34;search&#34; lights trained there, the first object hovered about 10 to 12 feet above the track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Metallic silver in color with multiple colored lights near the bottom and in the middle, no windows or openings of any kind that we could see.  Approximately 18 to 20 feet in length and probably ten feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With both engines dead as we rounded the corner we made little noise and the first object did not respond in time, I estimate that we hit the object at 30 mph with 16,000 trailing tons behind us.  It clipped the top of our lead unit then skipped back slicing a chunk out of our trailing unit and first two coal cars.  The other objects vanished into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our emergency brakes had initiated due to the loss of power and we stopped approximately a mile and a half to two miles after impact.  Our power restored after we were stopped and we notified our dispatcher, located in Jacksonville Fla. of what had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were told to inspect the cars to see if they&#39;d hold the rail and try to limp into milepost cmg 60 which used to be the Paintsville yard which is no longer in full operation.  We checked everything out and the cab of the rear locomotive was demolished and smoking, the second two cars looked as if they had been hit with a giant hammer but looked like they&#39;d hold the rail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled into Paintsville yard at approximately 5:15 am. The huge overhead lights lining the yard were noticeably dark and the only lights came from what we assumed were railroad officials vehicles parked near the end of the track.  We pulled to a stop and began unloading our grips off the wounded train.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could hear what sounded like an army of workers immediately tending to our train.  Vehicle doors slamming, guys running by in weird outfits and lights glaring from all directions, the one thing missing was railroad officials.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A guy named Ferguson shook my hand and asked me to follow him into the old yard office.  We did, once inside they, and by they I mean I have no idea who these people were, began to ask us hundreds of questions, they then told us for our own protection we&#39;d be medically tested before we could leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked repeatedly to talk to my road foreman or trainmaster and not only were these requests denied but they confiscated my conductors cellular phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hours later we were led outside the old yard office and the strange things continued to happen, the 2 locomotives and two cars were removed from the rest of the train we had brought in and my only guess was parked 4 tracks over under a huge tent like structure buzzing with activity.  We were lead off property and told due to national security our silence on this matter would be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were then put in a Railroad vehicle and taken to Martin Kentucky were we went throgh questioning again with railroad officials and were then drug tested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all of this we were sent on to Shelbiana, where we took rest for 8 hours and worked another train back to Russell.  Working back we passed by Paintsville, no sign of the engines, cars, tent, people,  nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((COMMENT/ADDENDUM FROM VISITOR TO NUFORC SITE, MAY 16, 2006))<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it&#39;s worth, as a railfan I can say the terminology/slang the witness is using is accurate and how he describes the train&#39;s reaction seems likely.  Since he says his dispatcher is in Jacksonville, FL, I can tell it happened on CSX.  You might want to ask him about that and if he remembers the unit numbers or model.  Locomotives last between 15-20 years unless they are totally demolished in a wreck.  That means the units involved are most likely still in service and can, perhaps, be examined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another FWIW would be the Portland, OR, railcams that operate 24/7 with some sky in the views.  I doubt that they archive their feed but you never know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> JUST A COMMENT  AND  OPINION.

No other colored like red or green that you would usually see. It got bigger and bigger, and we realized it was not an airplane at all. What the heck is that? All of a sudden, it appeared to get smaller and smaller until it finally disappeared. Where the heck did that thing go. It moved forward and then backward and finally, completely disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the skies, suddenly from the left and below the point where we observed the light, a big fireball with a long streak of orange appeared out of the sky and headed for earth. We actually stood and waited to hear the explosion when it fell, it seemed so close, but we heard nothing. Have checked the local news and have heard nothing about it. We thought that terrorists had started shooting missiles at us!<n>
1/13/02 14:30|Denver|CO|Other|5 seconds|Daytime black wing-like configuration flying low and at rapid speed over Denver|1/29/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21425.html|134|ndxe200201| Daytime black wing-like configuration flying low and at rapid speed over Denver<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a mostly sunny, breezy, warm day.  My teenaged daughter and I were in our car, just about a block away from my house, when from the top part of my windshield I saw a very rapid West to East (right to left) flyover of something I could not identify.  I ducked but they had passed over some trees and I yelled to my daughter to look to the left, as the &#34;object&#34; came through a clearing.  Whatever it was, it had seemingly transformed from two closely-spaced but possibly separate black Vs (almost like birds flying closely together) into one slightly tilted black line with 4 distinct, shallow Vs connected to a straight black line making up what appeared to be a wing configuration (no fuselage seen, i.e. it appeared to be a horizontal line while flying away from us).  It was flying at tremendous speed -- much faster than any small aircraft would.  During the lapse of 1 or 2 seconds between my first seeing it out the windshield to seeing in a different shape (different perspective?) from my driver&#39;s side window, it was by then probably about a half mile away and flying at no more than a mile in altitude, yet still about a full inch from side to side at arm&#39;s length.  Therefore, it was good-sized, yet did not appear to be any kind of typical aircraft -- and not two very fast-flying birds which was what my split-second initial view of it had reminded me of.   My daughter was also amazed and said, &#34;Mom, follow it!  Turn up here and let&#39;s chase it!&#34;  By the time we got to the end of the block, I turned, but with buildings and trees obscuring our view, we never caught sight of it again.  I rolled down my window, expecting to hear some kind of sound, but didn&#39;t hear anything.  I would say it was definitely unidentified, low flying, and large, with a totally unique shape, and my daughter thinks it was a military aircraft.<n>

This object was slowly spinning between two prominent stars, and appered to be receeding, i.e., traveling away from earth.  The skies were clear, with little light polution from the city.  As I recall, there was no moon.  My son and I watched this object for approximately :08 minutes.  As there was no way to judge it&#39;s size I can say only that it was massive.  At arms length it would be approximately the size of ones thumb.  It was white in color, similar to the moon.  It&#39;s surface was marked with relatively dark areas.  As it spun, or rotated, it appered to be a thin object (relatively).  It eventually grew dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared.  Asteroid? Possibly.  Again its an unknown!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report is submitted by a retired airline captain, who had accumulated 13,700 hours of flight time at the time of his sighting, and who is well known to NUFORC.

At first I saw them and thought it was a airplane. And then it never moved and the lights where arranged differently, and they where to big and bright to be a airplane. At the same time I looked around because they would keep disappearing and reappearing. And I saw a plane way to the right of me and that was moving and blinking (like planes do). So I kept watching for this formation, I finally stopped my car and watched for it, because when the lights would go away, there was NOTHING there. Then it would appear in the same spot again, not moving. The area I saw this is over the hudson river between Mechanicville – Saratoga area. When I drive home I can see this stretch of the river for about 20-25 mins., because I drive parallel to the river.  All of the sudden it just disappeared and was gone. I just got the nerve up to tell the guys at work and they gave me this site. My Husband just laughed at me, but I had a really weird feeling when this whole thing was happening.<n>

We were travelling north on Macadam Boulevard right near the industrial area on the west bank of the willamette river when I looked up and noticed two rainbows that broke off mid way up in the sky as above them loomed a thick cloud formation that covered most of the eastern sky. While examining the rainbows my girlfriend (who was driving at the moment) noticed little lights which were floating either in front of or within the cloud formation. The lights, looked EXACTLY like stars but it was 4:10pm in the afternoon and they appeared to be in front of the clouds. There were 6-10 lights all hovering and moving both in formation and separately (I definitely counted 6 I could see at one given time while my girlfriend claimed to see as many as 10 at one given time). These were not like any planes I have ever seen as they remained stationary and were able to move back and forth in relation to one another with surprising speed and no need for turning radii. One moved in the northern direction, then stopped on a dime, hovered for a while and then returned in the direction it originally came from. They moved quite quickly and seemed quite agile.  The group of lights occupied no more than 35 degrees of the sky  horizontally and all appeared around the same altitude (guesstimate of 200-300 feet high) Neither one of us could tell the size or distance of the lights as they appeared as little more than pin pricks of light but we both agreed that they appeared to be somewhat close and the way they moved only heightened that sensation. If I had to guess I would say they were no more than 2-3 football fields away. This is my first UFO experience and I hope other people were looking in the direction of the rainbows and can back up our story. Did anybody else see this? I have no idea what they were but it was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.<n>

First, it was a flock of ducks flying southeast and as I looked at the ducks, another object caught my attention. It was a white object I thougt it was an airplane from one of the private airports around here but it didn&#39;t have an airplane shape nor did it make any sound.  I hurried home and grabbed my binoculars to have a better look at the object.  What I saw had no wings or propellers. Instead it had what appeared to be a black stripe of some sort or maybe a narrow window.  For a minute I thought it could&#39;ve of been a remote control plane like the ones the airforce is using in Afghanistan, but I observed the object moving at a slow speed as if it were floating in place. I thought about calling the AFB to verify if they had picked up anything unusual flying around.  I watched it for about 11 minutes and then it diminished away...<n>

Object descended far enough to disappear below my horizon (terrain to my right at that point is below elevation of 17, only treetops and rooftops of buildings are visible).  I did not pull over to shoulder because of traffic risk.  Within seconds saw roadsign saying &#34;Pine Bush&#34;. Passed same but doubled back onto 17 and then 302 and a side road off 302 in direction of apparent landing looking for object but did not see it again.  No airport close by.<n>

I noticed it when I was approaching vineyard avenue in the city of ontario, California on I-10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object at first in my eyes was a plane preparing to land on Ontario airport which is just south of I-10 approximately 1-3miles when I seen it but then to my surprise it when back in the same northern direction where it came from the for approx. 1 minute then it does a 325 degree turn for what I dont know when it could of just veared right instead of almost making a 360 turn for no reason. Like it was lost. After the 325 degree turn it was traveling East and continues for the next 2 minutes the it slowly turns a little bit and heads North East. My eyes where focused so much on this object that I missed my exit not one offramp but two. After realizing I was about 5 miles from my missed exit I immediately got off because at this point the object was to faint to see anymore. When I first saw the lights on this object it approximately was about 2-3 miles, I could see the objects shape or form, But the amount of lights that where horizontal on the object from my distance seemed like a wingspan of a jumbo 747 jet. I also noticed alot of other flying objects around the sky which looked like planes and helicopters all aroung the Inland Empire as if they where sent to observe the object.  I also looked at the person driving in his beige trcuck to see if he was also observing what I looked at.  But to my dissapointment he wasn&#39;t.  All I could say is that im not the only individual that night go wisualize the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates incident occurred on January 12, 2001.

I was getting into van to pick-up daughter from dance classes.  I just entered vehicle and was getting ready to start van and observed a bright flash hit the window.  I thought, I had blow car battery or some electrical problem.  I leaned forward and saw an object threw van window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed object for a few seconds and exited van.  The object was dark or black and had a rectangular shape. I estimated from a lamppost nearby that the object was about 80 ft above me. It was sort of a large trunk like shape.  It had multicolored lights that were at the ends of what look like rods that projected out from the structure of ship, like needles in a pincushion.  It was about three medium- car lengths long and about two car lengths wide.  It did not emit any sound.  I walked to a parking lot next to my driveway and that object was motionless for about 5 seconds.  The object begin to move in a southeast direction slowly and then made a turn to the northeast and began to rise.  I moved to follow it and went to corner of street and major intersection.  I looked up and down street to see if anyone else was able to see object.  I did not see any persons or vehicles in the area it was very quiet. It then began to move and suddenly seemed to stretch out and then disap! peared from my view into what was northeast direction,  After incident, I went back to my van and attempted to start engine but it would not start and the following day or days I removed battery and took it to nearby car radio and video shop.  The shop guy stated that battery was blow and he noted that battery cables were fused when he returned with new battery to replace blown battery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was beautiful and seemed to just float and move with little effort.  The effect of it stretching out was like observing in going into a tunnel and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

1/11/02 20:00|Santa Barbara|CA|Diamond|20 plus minutes|Bright diamond objects with pulsating blue lights.|1/29/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21418.html|146|ndxe200201| Bright diamond objects with pulsating blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Jan. 11, 2002 around 8:30 p.m. and again on January 12, 2002 around 9:00 p.m. diamond shaped objects were observed in the sky over the Pacific Ocean just off the coast of Santa Barbara. On Friday night, I noticed what I first thought was a very bright star from the window of the second floor of my home. I went downstairs and outside for a better look. It was too bright to be a star and it had the shape of a diamond with a blueish color and it seem to be flickering. I waited to see if it was an airplane or helicopter. I waited. It was not. After about 5 minutes I went inside to my office and got a pair of binoculars and was followed outside by two other persons, who witnessed this object. What appeared diamond shaped to my eyes was actually(looking through the binoculars) something very large and round. It was spinning in a vertically. Colors of bright unique shades of some light red, blue and greenish yellow could be clearly seen. The colors were in circles and spinning in alternating directions. The blue color was pulsating and their was white like sparks all around the edges (like electricity popping out of a broken line). At one point a beam of wide white laser like light went from this object towards the mountains. This made us nervous and concerned. We remained outside for another 5 minutes and it remained in the same position. Everyone went in and I called the airport tower but they had a recorded message that sounded like it was for piolets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the next evening my 31 year old daughter was visiting about 9 p.m. I told her about the previous evening and what we experienced. She said it was on the news because several people had called. The news said it was space debris from a satellite that probably broke up. I told her it was to low, it would have fallen or something. It was visible for at least 20 plus minutes. I took her outside to point out where it was when we noticed three of the objects. One over the Pacific and two almost overhead. There was plenty of space between them. One was almost in the same place it was the previous evening. She used the binoculars  and we were joined by three others who also looked at them and reported seeing what I stated above except that one of the objects had a something like a tail extending from it, that looked like a long streak of electricity. We remained outside for about 15 minutes and during that time all objects remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10 p.m., I looked again and they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise. No movement except for within the objects themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a very concerning sighting. The laser beam triggered thoughts of some sort of high tech a terrorist controlled satellite. Because it remained undisturbed and returned as three the next night, I assume this is some sort of government project. I don’t but space debris.<n>

Then i saw her looking up in the sky, i looked up to see what she was looking at. I then saw a bright orange circle suddenly, very quickely, it splited into 3 other circles. The three Circles sort of floated in the air, suddenly one of them &#34;blitzed&#34; to the left, and left a bright tail. around 3 seconds later, the other two circles &#34;blitzed&#34;, but to the other side, one, a little farther then the other. The buildings blocked us from seeing any further. It was something I&#39;ve never seen. Very interesting.<n>
1/11/02 18:45|Daytona Beach|FL|Light|more than 1 hour|Bright lights seen over ocean in Daytona Beach area on January 11, 2002|1/29/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21422.html|148|ndxe200201| Bright lights seen over ocean in Daytona Beach area on January 11, 2002<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 11, 2002, at approximately 6:45 pm EST, I arrived home with one of my coworkers.  My roommate, my coworker, and myself were all of sound mind at the time, getting ready to have a few beers but hadn&#39;t quite taken that initiative yet; all three of us work for the same company, a timeshare and travel agency in the Daytona Beach area, and none of us have ever made a claim or filed anything like this before.  My roommate was out on the landing, looking into the early evening sky when I heard him exclaim, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;  I raced outside, thinking maybe he&#39;d seen an accident of something, but he was looking up at a bright light in the sky.  Jupiter had recently been overhead, just one or two nights ago, so at first I thought it might by Jupiter or other planet, but it moved.  We were facing east at the time; the object was over the ocean, and at great altitude.  He said that it seemed to be made of one light surrounded by smaller ones, but I was unable (at first) to make out those details with my glasses.  He ran inside to grab his binoculars; our coworker came out to see what we were making a big fuss about, and when she saw the object she also said that it looked like multiple lights.  I grabbed the binoculars from my roommate and ran downstairs into the darkest area I could find in order to avoid any ground light.  When I zoomed in I could see that it definitely looked like one bright light surrounded by smaller lights.  However, the &#34;shape&#34; was not constant; at one point it appeared to be a single light, then a bright light surrounded by four lights, then two lights, then as much as a dozen lights.  In addition to the changing shapes, the object&#39;s colors were cycling, from blue to white to yellow to red, although I wasn&#39;t so observant that I was catching a pattern.  Anyway, our neighbors started coming out, and we showed them where to look, passed the binoculars around; we wanted as many people to witness this as possible.  We live not too far from the Daytona Beach airport, and as pl! anes, an d even a helicopter, passed overhead, we could tell just from the object&#39;s altitude that it wasn&#39;t a plane, at least not one that was coming to or leaving from the Daytona Airport.  Also, its pattern of movement was unlike anything any of us had ever seen.  Though it seemed like it was climbing in altitude, it was moving north, then south, in a snake-like pattern, and at several times it seemed to have dropped in altitude.  We asked around for a camera, but it seemed like nobody had a camera, or they weren&#39;t willing to take pictures, although I saw one of my downstairs neighbors taking snapshots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We phoned the local authorities, but they ignored the report.  We called the local newspaper, who told us to call the local authorities; no help there either.  I even tried to find a local number for MUFON, to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 hours, however, the object moved out of our field of vision, and we left it at that, with no explanation and nobody taking us seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If, in fact, the object did move abruptly, it could not have been a celestial body.  However, we believe that the first possibility to be eliminated is the star, Sirius, in the southern sky.  It can be very bright, and it gives off a very brilliant chromatic display, as described in this report.  PD))<n>

When I arrived back in the UK a few days later I uploaded my pictures from my digital camera to my pc. On looking closer at the shot of the Empire state building I noticed a bright object to the top right hand side of the building. At first I thought it could be the moon but then I recalled that it had started to rain and therefore the sky was clouded over. On zooming in on the unknown object I found to my surprise that it was saucer shaped and had a ring of blue lights on one edge. I tried severall different filters to asertain if the object was just rain on the lense but several of the filters showed it was a solid object. This object was not sighted at the time of taking the photograph.  Although judging by the size it must have been visible to others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed the photo, and confirm that there is an unidentified object to the right of the Empire State Building.

The only possible thing I could have mistaken this for is a meteor.  However, it was a definite color of bright green and had a defining shape of a cylinder.  It did not resemble a shooting star or a meteor in the way that they both appear to have tails as they shoot through the sky. This did not, it flew through the sky like a perfect and very fast craft.<n>

The object appeared to be headed in a southwestern direction from the north when it appeared to me in the left peripheral area of my sight.  I shouted out excitedly to my 8 year old daughter who was with me to look at it while I pointed it out to her with my right hand.  Then the object seemed to explode into an orange and red ball of flame then blinked out.  A moment later it flared up again directly below the point I had last seen it and was falling toward the ground and no longer streaking across the horizon as before.  Then it burned completely out just before reaching the horizon.  Before and after the orange-red blast, the object was burning so brightly that it cast a faint blue hue on the horizon, lighting up everything in sight.  It also had a burning white tail that trailed behind it.<n>

I saw a star in the small gap between fog/clouds and looked to see if there were anymore visible, when I noticed a bluey green round thing just in view to the left of a cloud.  It was only stationery for a split second, almost as if it realised it had entered a gap in the sky, and then it shot accross the gap (right to left) and disappeared behind the fog/clouds.

When we pulled up to the stop sign it was almost over us and we could see that it was a round silver disk with colored lights all around it with a smaller silver disk rotating in the center. we pulled over and got out of the car to see what it was and we noticed that it made no noise. It was heading west towards the water. and we watched it go off into the distance.<n>

After a few minutes I caught the familiar sight of a satalite, looking just like a normal star with the exception that this was moving. It seemed like any other satalite I&#39;ve ever seen. It was moving at a typical speed, it&#39;s color was solid white and it was moving straight line in a south easterly direction. After watching it for about 30 seconds it began to cross through the constellation of Orion. It was approaching Orion&#39;s belt and should have passed just above it, but not through it. As it passed above the third star in the belt it began to change course and slow down. It made a clean 180 degree arc through the belt and actually stopped just under the center star in the belt. I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. Then it began to move again, this time in a straight line to the north. After about 5 seconds it slowed and stopped again. I was in total disbelief of what I was seeing. It started to move again, this time slowly arcing from a westward heading to an easterly heading before stopping. Once more it began to move, only this time very slowly in a straight line going south. Then it stopped once more. After a few seconds it seemed to get brighter before it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told this story to a few people who all tell me it was just a satelite, but this was no satelite. Though I may not know lots about satelite design and propulsion I can tell you this. No satelite can make such extreem changes in it&#39;s heading. It is impossible. Though some can change heading it is only minor changes, not tight arcs and course reversals. It is also impossible for a satelite to stop dead in it&#39;s tracks. There are two reasons for this. First, it needs to maintain a minimum of about 18,000 MPH to stay in orbit, otherwise it will fall back to Earth. Second, the &#34;g&#34; forces that were inflicted on this craft are enormous. To go from about 18,000 MPH to a dead stop in seconds would flatten our fragile satelites and liquify any astronauts if it were piloted by a human. Though I can&#39;t say it was not of this earth, it did break all the rules that govern it. Whatever it was or was not, I found it beautiful to watch!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The entire sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds. Both a report was filled out at the Review as well as a phone call made to the Research Hotline regarding this sighting.

Illinois<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north on a country road and looked over to my right, just above the horizon were 3 orangish/white lights,  they weren&#39;t blinking and seemed to be still,  I turned right on the next road keeping my eye on them the best that I could, after I turned the one blinked out and the 2 remained,  they were so close and bright it seemed I could easily catch up to them and see what they were for sure.  No matter how fast I went I couldn&#39;t get close.  I noticed the one up ahead of me looking as if it was going to cross over the road ahead of me, so I thought I&#39;d be able to see it just over the next hill because it was a clear view of the sky for miles around, well I get over the hill and it is totally gone, no where to be seen, the next time I caught sight of one of them it looked as if it was all the way over Rockford Il. so I gave up my chase and came home.<n>

It was flying high, at an altitude I&#39;d expect to see planes, and it moved directly across as much of the sky as I could see in about a minute, heading south at first. When it was in front of me it started to veer off to the south west. At first, all I saw was the totally red oval light. After awhile it seemed to change position, and then what looked like 4 red, glowing &#34;legs&#34; became visible.  It brought to mind some kind of bug, maybe even a crab, except that it had fewer legs. The way it flew reminded me of a helicopter. After turning the corner and heading north onto Mill Rd., I waited at the light for about a minute, still keeping the craft in sight.  After turning left(west) onto Harrison Ave., I watched it for about another minute, until losing sight of it.  It never made any sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total illumination of the body and legs, along with the fact that there were no white or green lights on the craft, made me wonder where it was from.  After checking with MUFON, I learned others have seen &#34;the spider&#34; as well. This happened on the same night, a few minutes prior to the sighting of the famous &#34;yellow lights&#34; in Freeport, IL.  Freeport is about 40 minutes west of where I was, straight up rte. 20. Route 20 is about 1 mile south of Harrison Ave., the road I was on.<n>

Off to the left there was a cellphone/radio tower. about a half mile northwest of the tower aprox. 150 ft in the air I observed a cigar shaped craft hoviering in place. It did not move a inch for the time W was on the side of the road. I had to get moveing because there was not much of a  berm on the roadway and people were honking at me. I have no clue what it could of been. it was too big to be a small aircraft stuck in high winds(and it wasn&#39;t a windy day). it appeared to be the size of a medium sized plane.<n>

At first I thought it was a boat as it started to move across the water.  The two lights moves together very smoothly, that I then thought it was a plane flying very close to the water.  As it moved steadily across the Bay I ran into my room to get my binoculars.  I then watched the two lights move from right to left.  With the binoculars I still could not see anything but two round lights.  There was not any craft or any kind of mass around the lights.  If it had been a plane, the object would have had to be coming in our direction.  As the objects reached towards the shore on the left of the Bay they rose like a plane, then disappeared.  At this point they were going away from our direction and they were still two rounds lights.  If it had been a plane there would not have been two round lights because of the direction they were going.  Besides I would have seen the outline of the plane while I looked through the binoculars.  All of this took only approx. 2 minutes.  Even a speed boat would take longer to cross the Bay.  It was a beautiful clear morning.  There had to be someone else who must have seen it as there are many tourists out whale watching around the Bay in Maui at this time of the season.  We left that same day for home, so I don&#39;t know if anything was reported.  I asked one of the employees at the hotel but she didn&#39;t know what it might have been.  I don&#39;t know what this was, if anything.  It puzzled me and I could not could not come up with a reasonably explanation for these lights.  I know there is an observation station on Maui whether it had anything to do with it.  If someone could explain it to me I would appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> No, I have not attempted to contact any news media etc., I feel uncomfortable inquiring about it for the obvious reasons.  My husband was the only other witness that I am aware of and he is as perplexed as I am.<n>

I looked down Commercial st towards Albert Park to see an object floating in the air level with the top of the nearest biulding to us in the st.    It was very close to us, approx 20 metres up and 20 metres away and looked very big!! We saw a disc shaped craft (classic looking UFO) with a lot of glass looking windows on the top of the craft with lots of white light inside.   The bottom of the object was tilted towards us and I could see the flat disc shaped bottom of the object.    There were several half spheres prodruding from the base with lights shining from the edges of the spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at that point I thought &#39;Its a UFO!!&#39;    It reminded me very much of many pictures I have seen on TV and magazines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was quickly lost from our sight when a biulding obscured it as the taxi driver had not seen the object and had continued driving.   I made the driver go round the block and then drive around the area for 20 minutes.   We never saw anything further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I scoured the papers, news on the tv and internet for other reportings, I never saw any other mention of this object.   This did seem strange to both me and my girlfriend as the object was very big and in the middle of Melbourne??? We went back the following night and nothing looked similar to what we saw.   I also walked down the street one day and there is a helicopter landing pad further down the st for a hospital.   I called them up and asked if they had spotted anything with there radar, etc.   They had had nothing reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day we do not know what we saw, though it certainly was not a helicopter, reflected lights, etc.<n>

( approximate|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23062.html|174|ndxe200201| On the evening of January 8th, 2002 my girlfriend and I were coming back from my brothers house that lives in Mosely, Va. ( approximately 20 miles south west of Richmond, VA) I was driving in the east bound lane on highway 360. I spotted this cluster of yellowish orange lights with a large red pulsing light from a distance of about a mile away. The most peculiar thing about this, at that moment in time was the distance of the red pulsing light to the cluster of lights. The red pulsing light was hanging below the cluster of lights. This object/craft was heading west(towards us). I had the video camera with us in the truck. The model is a Sony TRV520 digital video camera with a 20X optical zoom. So, I found a good spot to pull over. My girlfriend and I both got out of the truck.  I grabbed the video camera and she grabbed the binoculars. After realizing that we still had the lens cover on the camera I was able to get the craft focused and zoomed in on it. This is the most bizarre craft I have ever seen. It flew under a star, and as it did, you can still see the star. Transparent? The craft is a cluster of small lights in a hexagon formation. There is a triangular portion in the front from which the large red pulsing light is affixed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video of the craft. I will be submitting still images which are video captures to Peter Davenport/NUFORC<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video and the stills, and some object apparently was captured on film by the witness.  We do not know what the object was, but judging from the video, it seems to have generated a noise that sounds to us similar to the noise generated by a jet aircraft.  However, I emphasize that we have no idea what the object is.  PD))<n>

My wife and I were sunbathing close to the Las Vegas strip at about mid day.  I was observing a plane in the sky, holding up my hand to obliterate the glare of the sun, and I noticed a glare in the sky near the sun at high altitude to the south.  I observed it for a minute with the naked eye and said to my wife I think I might actually be seeing a UFO.  My Wife said run and get the Binoculars.  I ran and returned a minute later with 2 pair of high power binoculars.  I was now apparant that the object had moved north closer to us still at a very high altitude, however.  Through the binoculars we could make out the colors and shape of the object.  It was a brilliant, shiny, bright red hemisphere on the bottom surrounded by a bright silver band.  The band was like the outer edge of a traditional flying saucer like you might see in the movies.  We do not know if the sphere continued to the top of the object or not.  We never got a view of it&#39;s top side since it never rotated.  It was far above cloud level, so it must have been pretty big for us to see it.  However, I would not be surprised if no one else observed the object as it was very small in the sky at that high altitude and there were many contrails in the sky from planes. The object was slowly traking due north and was soon directly overhead.  It continued north at a slow steady pace and went eventually out of sight.  The Las Vegas strip runs south to north, so coincidently or not the object was tracking directly over the Strip.  My sceptical, scientific mind tried to reason that maybe it was a wierd high tech weather balloon.  But the wind was blowing east and the object&#39;s path was perfectly linear from south to north.  I can only conclude that the object was a craft of top secret government or Alien origen.  I wish I had a high power telescope with a camera mounted, but fate did not provide me that option.  I&#39;ve never observed a UFO before and have been very sceptical about these t! hings, b ut now I really consider it likely that contact has been made  and they would rather play peek-a-boo than come right out with it.<n>

1/7/02 21:03|Turlock|CA|Circle|10 seconds|5 White luminescent objects were seen in single file, equally spaced, East to West path and covered 115 degrees of sky in 10 seconds.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21123.html|183|ndxe200201| 5 White luminescent objects were seen in single file, equally spaced, East to West path and covered 115 degrees of sky in 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Particulars: Objects (5) were observed in single file, equally spaced, East to West trajectory (plus or minus 5 degrees).  Objects had no navigation lights. Objects were white luminescent.  Objects were observed for approximately 10 seconds and were first observed at 35 degrees elevation East (plus or minus 5 degrees) and last observed at 30 degrees elevation West (plus or minus 5 degrees).  Objects did not deviate trajectory, but remained single file, equally spaced.  Objects had approximatly 1 degree spacing (from ground observation point).  No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer was in process of aligning Jupiter with 6.3mm eyepiece and looked up from telescope and noticed what first appeared to be meteorites, however, objects were only 1/2 speed of meteorites (compared to Leonid shower average).  Jupiter was beginning to blurr slightly due to fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hypothesis: Objects appeared to be in low Earth orbit, allowing sulight to be reflected, causing white luminous appearance.  Objects may have been space debris, but unusual due to the exact same spacing between them.  No classification set at this time.  UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer qualification: 27 years in Aerospace environment, with full knowledge of all nonclassified aircraft, and limited classified aircraft.  SR 71 experience, Air Transport experience with nightime identification capabilities for most aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local Weather conditions: Ceiling: unlimited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visibility: at ground level, 1 1/2 miles; at 20 degrees elevation, 30 miles; at 45 degrees, stars are visible at 3/4 normal intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Temperature: 46 degrees F Humidity: 97% Barometric: 30.25<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally good, and qualified witness.  We do not know what he witnessed.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ...What concerned me the most about my sighting, was the uniformity of all objects.  I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever seen that in nature.  My second concern was the speed appearing to be about half of what you expect a meteor to be - especially those that wander in from between Mars and Jupiter.  I have not<n> <n><n> calculated the estimated speed yet.  I need to sit down and do this, my calculation can only be a guess at best, using &#39;apparent&#39; altitude.  If it was sunlight I was looking at, reflected from the objects, and it was 21:03 local, that makes the sun about 4 hours over the horizon, leaving about 1/8th of the earth curvature between myself and the sun, a rough guess puts the altitude at about 2000 miles for the objects to reflect the sun as they first appeared in the east.  I don&#39;t think they were 2000 miles away, unless they were really big!  For some reason I want to say they were above the tropopause, somewhere around 25 to 50 miles altitude.  If they were meteors, then the beginning of atmosphere would be in this region (but they would leave a trail, albiet even a short one - and no tail was observed).  Roughly, and with no figures to back this up, the objects covered over a 1000 miles<n> <n><n> with an estimated altitude of 30 miles.  This makes their speed to be slightly over 6000 miles an hour - very slow for a meteor, but not necessarily for the US government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing that bothers me is that their luminosity remained the same, and did not change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an interesting sighting.  I will continue to figure on this one.  If I reach any conclusions, I will forward them to you, in the meantime please keep me posted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks very much,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

Ellington Air Force Base is about 5 to 6 miles south of my house. and the lights were about 25 to 35 degrees from the ground. at first i thought it was just aircra! ft and d idn&#39;t think to get the camera and by the time that i realized something was going on i didn&#39;t want to leave the scene, and soon after it was all over with.<n>

The light moved smoothly and in a manner similar to how I&#39;ve seen a meteor travel through the sky.  It seemed like a point source, and had absolutely no trail whatsoever, ruling out, in my mind, it being a meteor.  The location of the light as it moved was to the east of my vantage point, and I would estimate it&#39;s location, based on where I was and where it was, as being perhaps somewhere over the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.  I heard no sound, although I was in a moving car travelling approximately 55mph to the South.  It was of very short duration, visible for no more than a couple of seconds.  My wife was unable to see it from her location in the passenger seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this entry is late, but I feel it&#39;s worthwhile to do so as I recently found this site, and when I checked its archives to see if there were any other reports of what I saw, I was very suprised (and relieved) to see many other sightings that clearly were of what I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as professional, with considerable technical experience.

It was traveling from northeast to southwest it seamed to suddenly drop from the sky and followed a path that started high and decreased lower in the sky even though when the object did disappear it was still very high but lower from where it started.We lisitened for an explosion like fireworks, but we heard or saw nothing. We figured it could not have been a meteor because the object would have been white, red, or yellow and it would have not followed a curved arc shaped path. The object from our car window was very large and it was travling at an extremly fast pace, like a falling star. The object had a faint blue center surounded in green. There was no tail. You could defiently see a blue dot in the center of the object and you could also notice where the objects edges were. When the object disappered it was going very fast and was still very high above the horizon. It disappered instantly with no explosion, sound, or change of shape or color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from the east coast for this date.  PD))<n>

He then summoned the rest of us out to take a look. Directly overhead, at an extremely high altitude, were what appeared to be just 5 objects moving in a SSW direction. After focussing a little more on the area of the objects, more faint objects appeared and as it turns out, there were no less than 15, and perhaps as many as 25 objects in a cluster moving in a SSW direction. There was no activity on the flightline at the airport, sicne it is mainly used as an overhaul facility for military and commercial aircraft, so if those objects were planes, we should have been able to ehar them, but there was no sound. Nor was tehre any contrail. Looking at other portions of the sky were planes had recently flown by, there were contrails. These objects left no trace of contrails. Less than a minute into this event, 3 objets on teh west flank of the cluster shifted and moved to the east side of the clutster while the other objects went in a straight line to the SSW. It is difficult to describe the shape of the objects, because they were at an extremely high altitude, well beyond jetliner altitude. My best guess was that they either an oval or circular in shape, and definately did not have tails like a jet would have, but they were at too high an altitude to be aircraft anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also a weather enthusiast, and 2 hours after the event I decided to check upper level winds (38,000 ft and above)and they were moving at a general easterly direction at the time. So, this rules out balloons and the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 or 4 objects that swapped from the west flank to the east flank appeared to have some kind of intelligence behind it. They were distinct manouvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting this report in hopes that others who saw this event will come foreward and report it to this database also, because I realize that the thought of seeing this many objects at the same time is rather rare and incredible.<n>

I live in Houston Tx. It appears, several sightings were reported to that local TV station. One couple took a video which showed on the screen. It seemed to be a very erratic fireball of unknown origin.I think it was Channel 13, but I could be wrong. It was exciting and I wish I had more info. for you. I did not see anything myself; just the news.It may be worth checking into it. I don&#39;t know what they did with that video.In Houston, we have Channels: 11, i3 and 2. We also have 26 and 39. I guess I could call all of them and find out what they did with that footage. Let me know what you think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the video footage on the station&#39;s website, and our first impression is that the object may, in fact, be a contrail behind a high-altitude jet airliner, which is flying away from the witness.  However, the quality of the image on the website is not high, so we are uncertain as to what the object was.  The erratic nature of the object may be due to the fact that the video camera was not on a tripod, and was moving.  PD))<n>

When it finally got close enought the first object, it made a 90 degree turn, and just took off to the south and was gone in a blink of a eye. Then the second fighter turned a round and headed back towards Mirimar Base. I have never seen an object change direction and have a speed well over any thing we have, I would guess it would have gone at a speed of 5000 miles an hour, it was gone out of sight in a less than a tenth of a second, I just got a glimpse it&#39;s speed out of the corner of my eye.  The strange thing we rarely ever have any military fighers fly over, and not at low altitude probably under 20,000 feet and none have ever kicked in their after burners.<n>

I am not sure what I saw.  I got up at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, January 6, 2002. As I was going back to bed, I looked through the blinds to see if it was still raining.  I noticed it was crystal clear and the stars were really bright.  I noticed an unusually bright light to the west and watched it to see if it was a plane.  It didn&#39;t seem to move for a while and then I noticed it getting closer.  I just felt it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  I grabbed my robe and ran out to the back stoop and as it came closer, I was surprised by how quiet it was.  It had a really bright light in the front.  It passed directly over my house.  Underneath, it had two white lights and a red light.  I likened them to round recessed lights in the ceiling of a house. As it went past there was a bright green light on the rear.  I could just see the outline of the craft in the lights from the craft and I remember saying &#34;Wow&#34; because I was so surprised how quiet it was.  It had a very soft roar.  I thought I was seeing a stealth go over.  My husband says there would have been blinking lights on it somewhere if it were an aircraft and I don&#39;t remember seeing any blinking lights.  Is it possible it was a military aircraft?<n>
1/6/02 15:00|Spring|TX|Sphere|30 seconds`|Silver sphere/rectangle object seen in clear blue sky above Spring, Tx.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21130.html|203|ndxe200201| Silver sphere/rectangle object seen in clear blue sky above Spring, Tx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday, Jan. 6th., my sister saw something in the sky around 2pm above where we live in Spring, Tx., approx. 20 miles north of downtown Houston, off I-45. Sister was only one who saw it on this day. She said it looked silver or metallic in color, and flew around in circles then suddenly couldnt see it anymore. My sister told me about it the next day on Mon. the 7th, and she took me outside to show me where she saw it at approx. 15:00 hrs. (3pm), and lo and behold, there it was again in the same spot ! I saw it this time, and my description is basically the same as hers -- appears to be the size of a ballon at arm&#39;s length, but I think it&#39;s more like the size of maybe half of a Volkswagen. The object looked more round than any other shape, although at one point it looked kind of oval as it would turn. The UFO was flying haphazardly like a bird fighting the wind, but definitely wasn&#39;t a bird. The UFO made no sound whatsover, and looked to be approx. 1000 ft. or lower on a clear blue sky. The Sun at this time was behind us in the west (we were lookig south at it), and whenever this object would turn a certain way towards the Sun, it would shime very brightly, as if only part of it was made of shiny metal (it didnt reflect off the Sun the whole time, just silver in color most of the sighting). I get email news updated from our local ABC News channel here in Houston (channel 13), and somebody else in Pearland on Sunday (Pearland is maybe 30 miles south of us - same direction we saw our object), and the took a video of it, which can be viewed, and their story on the ABC News Houston website).  The picture they took does look a lot like what we saw, but more rectangular than what we saw. These people said it appeared to be burning, which might be the Sun reflecting off of it like I said how it shined very brightly when it would turn towards the Sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s it, I&#39;ll report any more sightings promptly the same day it happens next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the video on the television station&#39;s website, and did not note any significant movement of the object, as described above.  If, in fact, there was no significant rapid motion to the object, we believe that one of the first possibilities to be ruled out would be a condensation trail (&#34;contrail&#34;) behind a high flying airliner.  However, the image on the website is not sufficiently high-resolution for us to be able to reach a conclusion on the issue.  PD))<n>
1/6/02 12:00|Mumbai (India)||Triangle|3-4 days|Kite shaped probe in the sky over Bombay, India|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58440.html|204|ndxe200201| Kite shaped probe in the sky over Bombay, India<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a kite shaped object (slightly curved around edges) in the sky a few years ago. I do not remember the exact dates but it remained in the sky for about 3 to 4 days. The reason I am filling this in right now is because when this happened over 4 years ago when I was around 19, it did not seem as serious to me as it does right now. I was just watching a show on YouTube about alien sightings a couple of minutes ago. At one point they spoke of a probe that hovers silently in the sky and that virtually every country has reported such sightings. This is where it struck me that I have seen this myself and did not realise it well enough that I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it to be a kite. But it just stood there at one point in the sky for days and no stings appeared to connect it. This was very unusual for everyone I showed it to, but no one really gave it much importance. I observed it for all the days it remained in the sky and did not notice much change in the position of the object. I have filmed this object on my camcorder and am therefore reporting this. I would like to submit this video to the appropriate authority. However, I haven&#39;t seen this video since the incident took place. Just reviewed it a couple of times immediately after shooting it. The video is back home somewhere in the video collection of our family videos. I am currently studying away from home and dont have immediate access to the video, but i&#39;m sure if the situation is serious enough, I can sit through all the tapes and find the one that has the footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video camera is a sony camcorder and had some 350x zoom or something and I tried zooming in as much as possible till it started getting very blurry and my hands were too shaky to remain steady at such strong zoom levels. It was during the day and the total video length must have been atleast a couple of minutes at all levels of zooming. It is a clear video as per whatever a normal camcorder at the time could handle. The day was clear as well so no cloudy distortions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I don&#39;t know what to do beyond this reporting, so if important please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I always thought aliens, Loch Ness monster, and all that crap was just a bunch of lies used for us to explain the unexplainable. Well, my thoughts changed a little more than a year ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my father&#39;s home in Baltimore, about 11 o&#39;clock at night. I was looking out the window as I always do at the street life, waiting for Saturday Night Live to come on at 11:30. I was the only one home at the time. As I was looking around, I saw a helicopter take off, very silent. It seemed much more silent than a normal helicopter...but, oh well. Anyway, as I tracked its movement I saw out in the dark of night two lights slowly making their way across the sky. I thought it was other helicopters, or planes, or anything like that. But then, the lights vanished. I looked again, and they were gone. The helicopter I saw before was making its way towards the area where the lights were, and it had turned it&#39;s search light on. Then, about...say...300 feet from where they appeared, the two lights came on again, but there was this haze around them, and they were heading away from the helicopter. But, they were going straight up in the sky. Then they went down, left, and finally went out again. I thought it was just some sort of light on the ground making this, but the helicopter was now flying as fast as it could towards the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another helicopter off in the distance heading towards the lights, it was coming from the opposite direction of the first one. It also had its lights on. The two hazy lights returned quickly right near the second helicopter, then went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I didn&#39;t see anything for a few minutes, but then as the helicopters were about to meet, two hazy lights that seemed to come from the ground shot up into the sky, and vanished. They looked like the two lights I had been watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the police station the next day to ask what the helicopters were going after, but they said that no helicopters took off last night. I believe firmly to this day that what I witnessed was something, and something that someone didn&#39;t want to tell me about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also did receive about 5 calls within the next week, and when I picked up, the person on the other line hung up. On about the third call I heard someone talking to someone else when I picked up, but when I said &#34;Hello?&#34;, they hung up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to contact me through my email address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When a video camera is set on &#34;Auto Focus,&#34; if it is used during darkness, the lens will &#34;hunt&#34; for something to focus on, and double images will result.

I was looking out the window at the sky towards the west when I saw a silver disk hovering stationary in the sky and reflecting the morning sun.  It didn&#39;t move or wobble at any time but just hovered in one spot.  It was very high up, I would guess above 10,000 feet or more because there were passenger jets above it to the left and right (southwest &amp; northwest).  It looked like it was part of the sky.  It was hovering without any movement in the same spot.  After watching it for about 15 seconds as it hovered, and without looking away, it disappeared.  Just like that.  It was no where to be seen.  It looked about the size of an air rifle pellet held at arms length.  The reflection on its surface from the morning sun made it stand out against the white clouds behind it.  (I&#39;ve seen jets at night approaching and facing me that look like one big light head on, until they turn into their landing pattern and you see the landing lights).  Again this sighting was at 8:40 a.m. in the morning with the back drop of the sky full of white clouds and other air traffic in the vicinity.  It resembled the Mexico city OVNI&#39;s and looked sort of hat shaped.<n>
1/5/02 02:00|Florissant/Hazlewood|MO|Rectangle|2 to 5 seconds|MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  It appeared to me to be a 2 story rectangle w/ large windows on the side of the obj.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46596.html|209|ndxe200201| I was driving home from a friends house on HWY 67 (Lindbergh Blvd.) Traveling South bond towards the City of Florissant border with the City of Hazelwood approximately 1 mile from HWY 270 and within 5 miles of Lambert International Airport.  I noticed a Florissant police officer had a motorist pulled over to the right of the road and was walking back towards his cruiser.  He was looking up towards the sky near a grocery store with his mouth wide open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to look towards the direction he was gazing and that is when I saw the object.  It appeared to me to be a two story rectangle with very large windows on the side of the object.  It appeared to be very dark or black in color.  I did notice some lights but cant tell you the exact place they were situated on the craft as it was night and very hard to tell where the edges began and ended.  The exterior lights were bright and seemed to have a bluish hue to them like you see on some of the newer BMW or Mercedes cars.  The object was flying nearly directly over the Schnucks market at approximately 100-200 feet(very low like a police helicopter height ). The object was almost silent, maybe a slight hum as it flew in front of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my attention in the short time I saw the object was that the interior of the object was dimly lit up enough that I could see inside the windows I described above.  I couldnt tell much detail other than the interior was massive.  I would estimate the total size of the object to be the size of a football field.  I make this assumption because it nearly spanned the entire roadway (4 lanes plus a turn lane ) as it crossed my path.  The strangest thing about my encounter was that as it floated by I noticed movement in one of the rear windows.  I cant say how many total windows there were on the craft.  In the one I saw into, it looked as if a person was moving from the inside towards the window to look out in the general direction of me and the police officers car with its flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didnt report this story initially to anyone except I did tell my friends and my now wife the next day after my sighting.  About 3 years later I happened to be watching the Discovery channel and saw a documentary that had several police officers from Ill. Talking about witnessing the same object on the same day a few hours after my encounter.  I have since given my statement to a local videographer  (WWW.DBARKERTV.com) who did some interviews with Melvin Knoll, and the P.O. in Illinois.  Mr. Barker has recently done a video interview with me as well about the incident. I contacted Ill P.D. and they told me the officer who saw the object was now dead I&#39;ve never seen my account published except on D.Barkers site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Report received by Missouri Investigators Group.

Others had to have seen it as my wife was traveling north on I-17 from Pheonix toward Flaggstaff, AZ. My wife is a truck driver and a (or was) sceptic of UFO&#39;s. She and I used to run teams but she is running on her own now. My wife was leaving Pheonex, AZ on her way to Albq, NM. She was well rested and doing well on her time. @ 21:45 to 22:00, she observed three cylender shaped objects &#34;dance around&#34; each other, first to her left, (west) then crossed over to her right (east). She called me on her cell-phone during this time and was describing this event to me. I asked her if any flashing lights could be seen, she reported &#34;No, none, just a steady bluesh-silver bright glow&#34;. I asked her to stop if she felt comfortable enough, shut off her engion and see if she could hear anything, an engion or the like. She stopped and told me that it was totally quiet, no sound at all. I asked how close she thought thay were to here. She insested that thay were between one-half to one mile at the most from her. She continued to tell me that they were flying up and down and around in irregular patterns and turned at very rapped speeds around each other. she could not see any markings or any other identifiable shapes or lights, just that thay glowed. Believe me! My wife is no crack-pot! I wish I was ther myself to see this. She has NEVER lied to me and was totally serious. What she saw does not sound like any aircraft that I know of. I am an ex-marine comming from a family strong with avation and military history. With present &#34;known&#34; technology, it is impossable to fly and turn a complete right turn as sharply as my wife described to me without the cintrifical force slamming one to the side of the craft causing blackout, sever enjery or death! Mabey our military has this but I shure have never heard of it! It would take computer controlled anti-gravity internally to counter the G forces!<n>

THE LIGHT WAS STATIONARY &amp; I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT LANDING LIGHT, A SEARCH LIGHT OR POSSIBLY A TOWER LIGHT BUT REALIZED THAT IT WAS TOO HIGH ON THE HORIZON TO BE A TOWER LIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS STATIONARY. AT THIS TIME AND FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MILES, THE LIGHTS DID NOT CHANGE IN SIZE OR INTENSITY. THERE WERE BLINKING RED &amp; GREEN LIGHTS DIRECTLY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BRIGHT CENTER LIGHT FLASHING IN A REGULAR PATTERN AND APPEARED TO BE DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE CENTER LIGHT RATHER THAN OFFSET FROM IT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHEN I EXITED I95 AT EXIT #25 SOUTH, I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BEHIND TWO OR THREE OTHER CARS &amp; TRUCKS THAT HAD ALSO STOPPED TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT, I WATCHED AS IT BEGAN TO MOVE DIAGONALLY FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST VERY SLOWLY IN THE DISTANCE.  AT THIS POINT I EXTED MY TRUCK AND OBSERVED IT FROM THE ROADSIDE ON FOOT WHILE SPEAKING TO YOUR OFFICE VIA CELLPHONE. IT THEN CHANGED DIRECTION AND FLEW ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT THIS POINT I COULD SEE THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT FROM BELOW AND IT APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE A WEDGE OR CHEVRON WHEREIN I COULD MAKE OUT WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PAIR OF SWEPT WINGS ATTACHED TO A CENTER FUSILAGE WITH SOLID WEBBING BETWEEN THE WINGS AND THE FUSILAGE.  THE LENGTH OF THE APPENDAGES OF THE VISIBLE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE EQUALATERAL WITH A SLIGHT CURVITURE OF THE WEBBING AT THE TRAILING EDGE.  ALL OF THE UNDERSIDE SURFACES OF THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE EQALLY WELL LIT WITH A DIFFUSED LIGHT AND THE SURFACES APPEARED TO BE SILVER-GREY BUT CLARITY AND LIGHT QUALITY FADED AT THE PERIFERY OF THE OBJECT.  THERE WERE NO DICERNABLE MARKINGS OR OTHER INDICATORS ON THE OBJECT OTHER THAN THE VISIBLE &#34;WHITISH&#34; LIGHT NEAR THE LEADING POINT OF THE OBJECT AS WELL AS THE BLINKING RED &amp; GREEN LIGHTS NEAR THE LEADING POINT. THE CLEAREST DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT I CAN RENDER AS IT FLEW OVERHEAD IS AS THOUGH SOMEONE SHINED A SPOTLIGHT DIRECTLY UPWARD AT THE UNDERBODY OF A SWEPTWING AIRPLANE AND ONLY ILLUMINATED THE CENTER PORTION OF THE PLANE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE OBJECT FLEW VERY SLOWLY OVERHEAD AND APPEARED TO PROCEED IN AN ELLIPTICAL PATH FROM SOUTH TO NORTH THEN SOUTH AGAIN RATHER THAN CIRCULAR SINCE THE VISIBLE CHANGE IN DIRECTION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATE AND DIDN&#39;T APPEAR TO ALLOW TIME FOR A WEST TO EAST ARC. THE PATH OF TRAVEL BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF FOUR BASKETBALLS (WHEN HELD AT ARMS LENGTH).  THE MOON WAS NOT VISIBLE (AS A REFERENCE OBJECT) FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT AND THERE WAS AT LEAST ON STREET LIGHT NEARBY AT THE COMMUTER PARKING AREA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THERE WAS NO DICERNABLE SOUND FROM THE OBJECT AS IT FLEW OVERHEAD.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT OR ITS RELATIVE SPEED. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY SLOWLY WHEN CONSIDERING THE RELATIVE CLARITY AND SIZE OF THE VISIBLE UNDERBODY AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD. THE RELATIVE SIZE FROM MY VANTAGE POINT WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE SIZE OF A QUARTER WHEN HELD AT ARM&#39;S LENGTH. THE SKY WAS EXTREMELY CLEAR WITH SEVERAL CONSTELLATIONS CLEARLY VISIBLE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UNTIL I SAW THE UNDERBODY, I THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLY THE OBJECT WAS A POLICE OR SEARCH HELICOPTER WITH A SEARCH LIGHT GIVEN THE SLOW RATE OF SPEED, THEN WHEN IT FLEW OVERHEAD I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS POSSIBLY A SEARCH OR TRAINING FLIGHT FROM THE BRUNSWICK NAVAL AIR STATION. BUT REALIZED THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE, GIVEN THE EXTREMELY SLOW RATE OF TRAVEL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I HAVE IN THE PAST OBSERVED SWEPT WING (MILITARY) CARGO AIRCRAFT FLYING (VERY) LOW OVER THE TOWN OF RICHMOND, MAINE (AFTER THE 9/11/01 ATTACKS) TRAVELING TO OR FROM BRUNSWICK N.A.S., BUT THE SOUND COMING FROM THOSE AIRCRAFT WAS ENOUGH TO STARTLE (OR IMPRESS) YOU AS THEY FLEW OVERHEAD. TRAFFIC ON I95 WAS EXTREMELY LIGHT AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT AND THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO ROAD NOISE TO MASK THE ENGINE SOUND OF A PLANE OR HELICOPTER THAT WOULD FOLLOW AFTER A PLANE PASSED OVERHEAD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE OBJECT MADE TWO CIRCLES OF THE FLIGHT PATH THEN DISAPPEARED OVER THE TREELINE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MY BACKGROUND IS CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY MANAGEMENT/ENGINEERING/TECHNICAL AND I AM A FORMER EMS PROVIDER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be both lucid and credible.

The city of Marion has about the population described, and the largest city nearby, Cedar Rapids, is actually not as far away as described and as small. Cedar Rapids borders Marion and the whole metro area of Cedar Rapids/Marion/Hiawatha has around 200,000 people. The aerospace center mentioned is Rockwell Collins, which builds radio and other equipment for military and civilian aviation is in Cedar Rapids, within 2 miles of the Marion border. The nuclear power plant mentioned is Duane Arnold Energy Center is in Palo, within 6 miles of Cedar Rapids northwestern border. So it is not as nearly far away as described by the person who posted about the flashing lights, and by the way is the only nuclear power plant in Iowa and does carry a lot of importance because of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/3/02 19:30|Marion|IA|Unknown|still happening now|4 objects of flashing color over city of 30,000|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20986.html|216|ndxe200201| 4 objects of flashing color over city of 30,000<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:30 ish, I noticed 4 motionless sources of light, flashing red, blue, and white. The one craft I could see from my bedromm window, and am looking at as I type this, appears to be in the shape of a &#34;+&#34;, but this may be due to the window. It wasn&#39;t, and at this time, which is now 9:02, still hasn&#39;t moved from its spot. The other three reamined motionless too, but I cannot view them at this time. I did, however, witness one ascending to above my window&#39;s view, and I went outside, it is still there. I see the possibility would arise that, on a night when both Saturn and Uranus are visable, that some would say that these are planets. Well, there are two things wrong with that. 1: there are four objects, not two. 2: What planets flash blue and white, then occasionally red? Another issue could be &#34;Well, they&#39;re hellicopters&#34;. This town is a town of only 26,000 and the biggest city in a 50 miles area is only 100,000. Why would 4 helicopters be over a small town in Iowa, not moving one inch in nearing 3 hours? Nonthing of national importance is in this town, although an aerospace technology center and a nuclear powerplant, but let me remind you those are both nearly 50 miles away. My conclusions: They are unknown to me, I would LOVE to say alien, but I can&#39;t without reasonable doubt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The first possibility that should be ruled out in this case would be &#34;twinkling&#34; stars.  The description above is not inconsistent with that possibility, we feel.  PD))<n>

It had flashing lights that were very bright.  The lights would flash on for a second and go off for about 1 and a half to 2 seconds and then back on again.  It had windows, 4 or 5 on the side we could see.  The light seemed to be coming out of the windows.  It was saucer-shaped and had a dome-shaped top.  It came toward us on highway 61 last Thursday night.  Then it seemed to change directions and go the way we were going for a few seconds.  It was about 50 feet above us.   Finally it started flying away from us and it disappeared, so we thought.  Then I seen the light blue lights again in my rear-view mirror, which lasted for about 6 miles.  The lights weren&#39;t getting further away from us as we drove on.  By the time we got into the city, it was gone.  I used to think people that believed in aliens and UFO&#39;s were insane.  Now people think I&#39;m insane when they hear my story.  I had 4 other people with me too.  Oh well.  We know what we saw and no one&#39;s going to tell us any different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from other witness in Marion, IA.

1/3/02 17:55|Littleton|CO|Light|20 seconds|Two fixed star-like objects in Littleton, CO|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21002.html|218|ndxe200201| Two fixed star-like objects in Littleton, CO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside talking on the phone to my nephew in Ohio trying to instruct him on how to find Saturn from Jupiter in his telescope (he was not outdoors in Ohio at the time).  It was a crystal clear night sky in Denver at the time.  As I was talking to him, I looked to the North of Saturn, just East of the constellation Cassiopea and saw two bright lights fixed (not moving)approximately 10 degrees apart at an elevation about 45 degrees above the Eastern horizon.  They were very bright, both with the same magnitude, nearly that of Jupiter.  They looked beautiful, like a wide double start system.  As I continued talking I saw one light begin to fade, then about 4 seconds later, the other faded also.  They both became dark.  They appeared to have angular dimention, as opposed to being like point star light sources.  They also appeared to be very high.  When they both faded away, none of the other stars in their vicinity faded.  I then, about a minute later, saw two aircraft with navigation lights flying in the vicinity (about 20,000 feet)in differnt directions. I can only surmise that I was looking at two satelites in a fixed geosychros orbit.  It was about two hours after local sunset.  I&#39;m thinking the objects faded when the earth&#39;s shadow engulfed them.  I wanted to look at the same time tonite (01/04), buts its snowing and overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Second report from same source.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two bright fixed starlike lights dimmed and faded to darkness on a cloudless evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside talking on the phone trying to tell my nephew in Ohio how to find Saturn from Jupiter in his telescope.  The sky that night in Denver was clear, about 5:55 pm, 2 hours after sunset.  As I was describing this I looked to the North, just East of the constellation Cassiopeia, about 45 degrees up from the Eastern horizon, saw two bright starlike objects.  They looked beautiful.  They looked like a set of double stars separated by 8-10 degrees.  They were fixed, not moving.  Both brightness magnitudes were as bright as Jupiter. They appeared to have angular width, not points of light.  It&#39;s difficult to say, but I&#39;d estimate altitude at 20,000 feet.  As I was still talking, one of the lights started to dim.  After 2-3 seconds, the other light also dimmed.  Both dimmed to darkness.  No other surrounding stars &#34;dimmed&#34;.  Following my observation there were two aircraft with navigation lights that flew into the vicinty.  My best explanation is that they are two satelites in close proximity to each other in geosynchonos (fixed?) orbits.  They dimmed when the earth&#39;s shadow enveloped them?<n>

Rutland, Vermont on January 3, 2002 I saw an orange streak in the sky.  I thought it may be a reflection on a jet from the sun going down since it was about 4:45 pm.  Then I noticed 3 other streaks.  I slowed my car then noticed the largest streak (the 5th and last streak I saw).  It was much darker orange than the other streaks and much longer and appeared wider.  It seemed to be moving toward a mountain, but because I was still driving, I may have imagined that.  But, I saw 5 orange streaks.  I can&#39;t believe that there were 5 planes or jets in the sky at once since we don&#39;t often see planes in the sky in this area of Vermont.  I am not saying these were UFOs but I don&#39;t have any reasoning of what they were. Also, I do not think they were jet fume trails. But, I don&#39;t know.<n>

I was out delivering a country route , out in the middle of nowhere. I had stopped to get a drink of my soda and looked up into the night sky. I caught a glimpse of a white streak across the sky. Then a few seconds later, I saw a round, spherical (or oval) object hovering over the tree line about 10 miles away. It moved up, down and side to side, in quick movements. It rotated and as it did, it would change colors from white to green to orange. Every few minutes, I would see a disbersment of 1 to 3 tiny red streaks, like smaller crafts. They flew away from the main UFO and in different directions. It was silent and stayed there for about 10 minutes, then it vanished into the sky as quickly as it came.<n>

I was stone cold sober, awake and lucid, and I know the following event was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later this evening, aprox. 10:05 pm - Jan, 2, 2002...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading into Waikiki on Punahou street -- many buildings ahead of me -- above the Pan Am building 3, maybe 4 blocks away, I saw a huge triangular formation of extremely bright, white lights.  Very clearly!!!  They made the following shape; [example: below] * *      * *     * *      * * Though it was facing more horizontal (thiner on the leading edge) than the limits of my typed diagram will allow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The pattern did not survive transferring to the database.  ))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately I studied it closely to be sure of what I was seeing.  My two sons were in the car with me and saw it also!  I was driving toward it, but the end of the road came and I had to turn the corner.  Before I lost sight of it, it was moving, hovering gently above the buildings -- its left wing dipped slightly and the nose pivioting [the lights held formation solid and firm -- it was a solid object!!!) out to sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got through traffic, to its exact location, it was gone -- vanished.  Its lights and its size (slightly larger than the building&#39;s rooftop) were so obviously unlike any other kind of aircraft, period! When I arrived to the spot there were no lights, aircraft, crowds, promotinal events... nothing else that could have been mistaken for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was real.  It wasn&#39;t my imagination.  The object was soild and obvious!!!  From this day forword, at least I will know!!!  I have seen solid physical evidence myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the police, the FAA, the airport (was it too low for radar) in hopes of confirmation from others who may have seen it, with no results.  I was finally led to a number to the University of Hawaii -- an answering machine.  I left my message...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ll see.<n>

There was no way this was a plane, and it was the scariest thing we had ever seen.

What was viewable at the time was only a bright light, about half the size of the moon or twice the size of Venus &amp; larger than most plane &amp; helicopter lights I&#39;ve seen.  After rounding the corner I was looking for the object &amp; I saw it again, hovering about the trees over an area where there are boat garages &amp; little else, near the Osage Beach City Hall, &amp; across from Lake of the Ozarks General Hospital.  It looked to be approximately the size of a large jet airliner &amp; was very low &amp; appeared to be ready to land.  It didn&#39;t appear to have wings &amp; had two blue lights in the back underneath it, then two other clear lights &amp; two red lights toward the front, &amp; of course the extremely bright head light.  We continued on down the road but were a bit shaken up by what we&#39;d seen.  I expect to hear an explosion or something because I thought it was a jet plane that was about to crash, but I didn&#39;t hear or see any explosion or anything else.  We continued on to our friend ((name #2 deleted)) house, but she wasn&#39;t home so we turned back around &amp; went back to the area just below where we had saw the object.  There was nothing to indicate that anything had landed or anything else.  We also looked at the nearby Lake of the Ozarks General Hospital, but the helicopter there appeared to have not been used recently &amp; still had tarps over the propeller blades.  (The object I saw was larger than a helicopter anyhow, but I wanted to rule out the possibility of it having been the helicopter, just in case)  We continued on to our friend ((name #3 deleted)) house &amp; left around 7 pm.  (19:00 hours)  We went back over to check &amp; see if ((name #2 deleted)) was home yet, but before we did so we checked out the area where we had seen the object again, but still saw nothing.  We continued on all the way down the road &amp; then turned around when it was obvious we weren&#39;t going to find anything.  ((name #2 deleted)) still wasn&#39;t home when we went back to her house so we continued on to my home.<n>

My mother was in the passenger seat of the car and I was in the back waiting for my father.  The sun had just went down and it was dusk.  My mother suddenly asked me &#34;What are those? Are those birds?&#34;, and i glanced at the two objects flying in our direction and I just said &#34;No, those aren&#39;t birds, they look like planes&#34;.  Both the crafts moved like planes would and they were parallel to each other and dark in color with no lights.  Then, as I continued to watch them pass overhead, I noticed the odd shape of the crafts.  They were shaped like spiders, with a solid body in the middle and extensions from that in all directions.  There were maybe 4 or 5 extensions.  At that I became fearful of terrorism by another country, and my mother ran into the store to get my dad.  By the time they came out it was too far away to see.  I&#39;ll repeat that they moved like airplanes, in a straight line, but no sound was heard, and although it was becoming dark, there were no lights on the crafts and they were very dark in color.  The unusual shape of the crafts scared us both.<n>

I noticed a yellow-orange light raise up over the mountains behind our apartment (Eagle Trace Apartments) and then just hover there. I was joking aroung about it being a UFO when all of a sudden 5 more came up to the same level one after another and spaced about an 1/8th of a mile apart all of them were evenly spaced and at the same altitude, about 100 ft. above the mountain. We lived right across the street from Nellis AFB and we could hear planes taking off. We thought they were just going out to the range but instead they headed twords the mountain. We thought ,ok they were just flares even though they were not over the range and this is when the lights faded to very pale blue lights and were much smaller in size, almost too small to even see unless you knew they were there. I dont think the objects got smaller. I think it was just the intnsity of the lights was far less. But anyway, as the jets, F-16&#39;s I&#39;m pretty sure, got closer towards the lights, the lights went from hovering to heading left twords downtown Las Vegas at a high rate of speed. Eventualy we couldnt see the lights anymore because of the city lights but we could see the jets for a while. It was really weird. Another thing that has nothing to do with this night but I have always noticed about this mountain. This is the mountain right behind Las vegas Speedway. During certain times throughout the year there is something very shiny reflecting the sun on top of the highest peak on the far left of this mountain. I didnt see any antennas or anything up there. I used to notice it when I would come home from work at Nellis. Always wondered what it was, still dont know<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

But this was so bizzare that I had to write.  This event happened in the middle of the desert.  The nearest person lived over 5 miles away.  The small city of Sierra Blanca was about 10 miles away hidden behind mountains.  My boyfriend and I were staying in this cabin which had no electricy and not running water.  We go there every year for New Year&#39;s to get the hell away from people for about 6 days.  We were coming back in the pickup truck from Calsbad Caverns (about 100 miles away). It was dark and the road we were traveling on was an old dirt road back to the cabin.  This place in the middle of NOWHERE. As far as you can see there is desert and mountains.  There is not one other home or light...nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We topped a ridge and suddenly over to our left there was what seemed to be the outline of a line of &#34;windows&#34; in which the lights were extremly bright.  A bright yellow...very intense.  In fact, for a moment I was very disoriented and thought it was a builing and then I remembered that it was impossible for that to be out there.  At the same time my boyfriend said, &#34;what in the hell is THAT?&#34;  Our truck went down the road into a gully so the we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  We thought that perhaps it was our cabin on fire;the were so bright and there were two rows one on top of the other.  We raced to our cabin which about a mile down the dirt road thinking it was on fire and the cabin was dark and quiet.  We both agreed we saw the same thing.  My boyfiend refused but I went back to look at the place and saw nothing.  The next day I drove to the place and there were no buildings that could have done that.  It was freaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  We would like to speak with the individual who submitted the report.  PD))<n>

It floated on a very smooth, level path about 5 or 6 meters from the ground in the same direction as the train. Speed was probably about 20 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be about 20 meters from the window. Size and distances were guessable because the object was seen to pass both behind and in front of trees, telegraph poles, etc.  After about 30 seconds or so the object suddenly reversed direction and shot off skywards at extremely high speed and was lost from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ocurred in a rural area of pastoral fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was just coming home (i  was  NOT drunk) from a new years eve party and happened to see a strange light in the sky.  It was strang only because it was acending in the sky next to another aircraft which was obvisablly a airplane.  For a moment i thought the strange gliding light was also a airplane but it was asending highter and it was brighter then a airplane.  Also this object appeared to be made of light and did not blink.  When stopped acending in the sky it changed its color from a white light to a brighter yellow light.  It was in the western sky which could mean it was flying right over NYC no more then 25 miles away.  It flew in the sky at the same altiude for a few mins and then did  a small, barely noticable zig zag movement and then changed back to its org. white light color.  A min later is disapeared in the very clear night sky.  There was no sound heard, it seemed to be very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know if this is releated but the night before i heard what i thought was a airplane over head but the sound seemed to &#34;hoover&#34; longer then an airplane would passing.  When looking out the window i still heard the sound but there was nothing i could see in the sky.<n>

I took my new digital camera and took various photos throughout the night. It wasn&#39;t until I loaded the photos up on my computer that I saw the object which looks strangely symmetrical and like it was flying.<n>
