1/31/01 23:45|Georgetown, Penang (Malaysia)||Disk|more than one hour|Orange UFOs|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16124.html|1|ndxe200101| Orange UFOs<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia. On the night of January 31 2001 at approximately 11.45pm (GMT +8.00) I saw many bright orange dots moving at slow speed coming from the north travelling southwards. It was a clear night and many people who were outdoors praying on this 8th day of the Chinese New Year were puzzled as to what these objects were. With my &#34;not so powerful&#34; binoculars my family members and I could make out that it was disk shaped, had a very bright orange flame burning at the center and it rocked slowly at approximately 45 degrees angle. In all there were more than 15 of these objects and the display lasted more than one hour. Some were just little dots but a few flew quite low but there was no noise to indicate that it was an aircraft. A similar sighting was on the 24th of January 2001 at approximately 10pm.<n>
1/31/01 21:20|Washington|NC|Circle|20 minutes|Three rotating round  orange lights in the south-southeastern sky.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48953.html|2|ndxe200101| Three rotating round  orange lights in the south-southeastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend, daughter and I were returning home from Washington when we saw a bright orange light in the south southeastern sky. At first I thought it was a grain elevator light so we rode around to an open field where the grain elevators are. Then we noticed there were more than one and thought maybe someone was using flares to get help, sometimes boaters use them to signal for help on the Pamlico river and they were orange like flares or fireworks look in the distance. We live near Pinetown, at an intersection on HWY 32 N. called Five-points. It is north of the Pamlico river and north-northwest of Cherry Point MCAS which is in Havelock, and we thought maybe they (marine corp) were doing some type of manuevers there, maybe using multiple flares. We watched and to our amasement, there were three lights, two lights closer together, southsouth east of our position, with one which was further to the west of the first two, directly south of our position. They were orange round lights and they turned, like a lighthouse, they would go out and after 3-4 minutes they would come back around. We were about 5-10 miles as the crow flys north of the Pamlico River and as distance is very hard to judge in the night sky, I would say these objects were at least as far away as the river. They were higher than the tree line but definitely in the southern horizon, not overhead. It put you in the mind of a helicopter with a search light flying in a circle looking for something only they were too high to be a coast guard or police helicopter and be effective and they had no other tail lights, wing lights, or other marking lights of any kind. They didn&#39;t do any exceptional manuevers but my 8 year old daughter did get a little scared when the southern one seemed to be getting closer. We observed them a good 15 to 20 minutes. I will not be surprised if this is explained but it was no burning space garbage or meteor, it was some type of aircraft or spacecraft. I would like to know what it was and if anything was seen on radar in that general vicinity at that time. This is no joke.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then noticed 3 more amber lights in a straight line to the left of the first light.  The lights were all the same color and none of them moved.  The lights were much brighter than any other lights in the surrounding towns.  About 1 min. after I first spotted them the lights went out in order from right to left.  I didn&#39;t think much about it at the time but was watching a UFO special on the sci.-fi. channel the night of 2/14/01 and saw the same lights.  But on the TV the lights were in reverse order. I wonder if anyone else saw the same thing.<n>

At 17:50, on 1-31-01, we were traveling west and saw two, cloud-like shapes, one smaller above a larger second shape appearing in the western sky almost directly above the sunset. The shapes were very unusual with no vapor trails or other clouds nearby. We stopped in a parking lot to observe them. The smaller shape appeared to begin to dissipate. At this point, we noticed two dots of light,one to the right and one to the left of the smaller shape and above it. They moved very quickly toward the centerline, crossed over the smaller shape, moved to their original distances right and left and disappeared (or became unviewable). The smaller shape dissipated further to a dot of light, then rose rapidly upward and slightly to the south, then disappeared (or unviewable). The larger object remained unchanged as the sun set and we saw no further activity.<n>

I was about a block away from the building I worked in when I notice  something flying above the building it was round and dark and moving very slowly sometimes stopping, when I got closer I relized the thing I saw was black and metallic.(it look like an eight ball) I did not say anything to my friend the whole time this was going on I wish I did. I was not sure of what I was looking at.The sun reflected off the craft as it did the cars in the parking lot,it was about forty feet above the building and the size of a car I think it was looking for something or somebody it kept going back and forth from over the building to parking lot and then after about four minutes it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

1/31/01 08:00|San Dimas|CA|Oval|30 minutes|Unusual objects videotaped over San Dimas, Ca|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17274.html|7|ndxe200101| Unusual objects videotaped over San Dimas, Ca<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is kind of late reporting it, but because my sightings involved video footage that had been under study for nearly 2 months, I wanted to wait until the results of the analysis, which has been released. Here is my story: On the morning of January 31, 2001, as I was about to leave for work, something caught my attention in the sky that didn&#39;t look like anything that I was familiar with. As I observed for a few moments I realized it was definitely nothing conventional, so I ran back in the house, grabbed my Sony camcorder, and took an amazing video of several strange objects. There were two actual sightings that morning. The first sighting was of a single object that appeared circular with a highly reflective surface or blinking light, and possible rotation. Estimated altitude was above 10,000 feet. The object was in motion from west to east most of the time and blinking or reflecting sunlight at intervals, but did stop momentarily at one point, changed direction in a slow pace, hovered for several minutes, and then changed direction once again gaining altitude where it eventually disappeared behind a cloud. The second sighting occurred about 10 minutes after the first sighting ended. This sighting was of two different looking objects moving in tandem from north to south at a slow pace and appeared to have originated in the same general area of the sky where I lost sight of the first object. These objects appeared higher in altitude, possibly 20,000 feet or higher. The two objects were different in color from each other. Leading object was white with gray accents and some noteable structure, and the trailing object appeared black in color with a tinge of white reflection. At one point the leading object moves up and over the top of the trailing object and takes a position just behind it. After about 5 minutes I lose sight of them in the glare of the morning sun. After reviewing the tape I decided that it needed further study, so I sent a copy to Tom King for his expert opinion. His findings including stills and downloadable video clips of my footage can be accessed from his Skynet web site at www.ufovideo.com Later I sent a copy to Chris Miller of www.ufofootage.com. He was able to generate some great enhanced stills and video clips from the raw footage. One interesting characteristic of the first object that Chris discovered was a powerful light source emitting from the object. Only by slowing the footage down and viewing it frame by frame can you see a distinct blue to red color pattern of this light. I recently received a letter from Jeff Sainio of MUFON with results of his analysis of my video. His findings were inconclusive as he was unable to determine in any capacity what the objects are or are not. My story as well Chris Miller&#39;s comments and pictures on it can be viewed at: http://home1.gte.net/res0cs5f/ufo-1/ufo-1.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC rarely allows either names or URL addresses to appear in this portion of a report on our website, but we will make an exception in this case.  Dr. Jeff Sainio, Ph.D. (Physics), State Director for the Mutual UFO Network for Wisconsin, is as skilled photo analyst, and we know that Tom King has considerable experience with UFO&#39;s and video footage of UFO&#39;s.  We have had less exposure to the work of Chris Miller, but his website does have an analysis of the footage alluded to in this report, and it appears to be carefully prepared.  PD))<n>
1/30/01 22:00|Independence|KS|Light|20-30 minutes|Giant white 'Sparkler' wedged in tree during snowstorm|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56025.html|8|ndxe200101| Giant white &#39;Sparkler&#39; wedged in tree during snowstorm<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, I don’t remember the exact date because this happened about 5 years ago…  I was driving along the road around the lake near Independence, Kansas about 10pm or so. It was snowing steadily. I was looking for a place to park and sleep as the next day I wanted to track deer in the new fallen snow. There were no other tracks in the snow so I am sure I was the only person to witness this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I passed along the edge of the lake (about 100 yards from the road, right on the shore of the lake), I saw a very bright white light in the upper branches of a tree (maybe 25-30 feet off the ground) across the field. The trees, of course, were bare at that time of year, so I could plainly see the branches both in front of and behind whatever this thing was due to the light. I first thought that it must be a broken power line due to the heavy snow, but I couldn’t see any power line. It wasn’t moving at all, just flashing in the same position in the tree. I only saw a brilliant white light flashing intensely, very similar to a 4th of July sparkler. I didn’t see any flame or sign of fire, which was strange as it seemed to be lodged in the tree branches somehow. I would say the whole ‘thing’ was about the size of a basketball or slightly larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove down the road and managed to turn around. I came back and stopped the car (same position as before) to watch the light. Finally, after about 10 minutes, I decided to investigate. I opened the car door, felt the cold air, and quickly reconsidered. I was either too lazy or scared to hike over the snowy field to get a better look. I regret that to this day because later I found out there was no power line along the side of the lake. I didn&#39;t return the next day to investigate either...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw objects very high in the sky near the constellation Orion.  We went out to look every so often between 9:00pm and 10:30pm.  They were there the whole time.  The UFOs were brighter and seemed to be closer than the stars in Orion. At first they seemed to be stars but when we took time to look at them we could see there were two lights very close together.  Every 10-30 seconds (approx. it varried) a sparkling light would shoot out from each &#34;craft&#34;. They remained mostly stationary but we occaisionaly saw one move  a short distance, suddenly. The second night, we saw them again in about the same places.  We invited our 19 year old son out to see them. One seemed larger, brighter, (we assumed it was closer) but the second night everything was about the same as the first night.  Tonight, 2/1/01, the third night, there were clouds early in the evening but some of them (5-6) were still visible, even though Orion was not visible.  The one that seem closer than the others was now even closer.  Later in the evening, 10:00pm the sky cleared.  At that time the one that had been close was gone and only 4 remained. My husband and I are educated and our son is in college, we are a stable, Christian, family.  My husband works for a department store and I work in a college library.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with these witnesses, and they seemed quite sincere.  We believe they may have been looking at bright planets, or &#34;twinkling&#34; stars, but we are not certain.  That would not explain the number of objects they allegedly witnessed, and it would not explain the objects that allegedly were reportedly ejected from the lights.  PD))<n>

While observing this cluster three of the &#34;stars&#34; swooped down and headed south at a great rate of speed.

There was a clear reflective highlight from the sun that ran the length of the object.  I noticed the traffic slowed down.  Other drivers must have also seen it.

We will attempt to get more information, or other reports.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Diamond Shaped UFO in Houston<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked outside my kitchen window as I heard the neighbors dogs barking I decided to go outside to take a look I noticed an extremely large white bright light in the western sky positioned south east of the crescent moon. I looked to the sky to compare the many other stars on this clear night and this was about ten times the size of star and appeared to have the shape of a diamond. From my driveway the light or object was not blinking nor did it have any color distortion and seemed to be close in vicinity of my home. The moon was low and the object in perspective was seemingly above a rooftop. I wanted to verify if it had any movement so I gauged it next to a tree limb. It moved up and down slightly within seconds when I had it positioned in the tree. I jumped into my car, driving from Kirby and Westpark at 35 mph and chased it going west towards Newcastle &amp; Westpark. It seemed to be unusually dark in this area of the overpass at Westpark &amp; Kirby (near the midsize electricity plant). It was larger than I previously thought and it seemed to move quite fast in front and away from me going west. At one point I thought I would lose it so I sped up eventually driving around 60 mph passing red lights. On Westpark underneath the 59 overpass I noticed a helicopter flying low coming from the south, going north, the light then dimmed, became hazy and barely visible when the helicopter passed. I pulled into a parking lot on Rice Street and Westpark, to observe the object. Once the low flying, low speed helicopter passed that area, the object dimmed and suddenly disappeared, I assumed it traveled at high rate of speed heading west which made it impossible to see.  This occurred less than a half mile from my home. Upon arriving home the object was no longer in the sky near the tree branch where I had first had seen it. Keeping track of time the entire event took less than 10 minutes.<n>

It first looked like 3 balloons together, but was moving oddly, like skipping in the sky, moving weirdly, but steady across the sky (not up like a balloon would do) and then it began to change shape or gave a different view and I noticed it was paper thin, and then realized it was not balloons and looked very foreign in the sky. Watched it slowly crossing the sky heading north west in a steady path, but the object was flexible or flexing. Very hard to describe, but watched for awhile and kept the object in view for a long time. It did not go up or down, no noise and I wish I took a photo. I&#39;m hoping someone else saw this thing.<n>

My friends and I were out four wheeling in my friends truck. It was some trails by the Des-Moines river. We were dirving back over this ledge, when plain as day, there was a green light in the sky. At first it looked like a green star. It sat there for about 2 to 3 secounds, then it seemed to fall from the sky, green light was trailing behind it. My friend and I started to freak out. I still can&#39;t belive that it happened. It was only two hours ago. Any ways the object was a perfect orb. You could tell that it had three deminsions to it. One of my friends and I are the only ones that saw the whole account. Another member of our party just saw it fall. My other friend that was driving didn&#39;t see any of it. We couldn&#39;t stop talking about it. My friend that was driving started making fun of us when hiw head lights cut out. We started to go up a hill and couldn&#39;t make it up it.I then looked back and I saw a flah of light come out of the woods were the object had apeared to fall. It was a bright flash that looked like a giant flame for about a secound.Nothing else happened after that.<n>

We were driving westbound Hwy 50 from Mather Air Field. We saw a bright white light, which we thought was an aircraft leaving Sacto. International Airport flying southbound.  This object was not progessing southbound like the many aircraft that we have observed daily. (We live in the flight path of Mather Air Field) The object&#39;s light remained bright and round instead of changing as a normal aircraft would as it flys. Once we got home, we got the (10 X 50) binoculars out to observe the object.  The object had moved from the area of the International Airport to (what we can only guess) as the area of West Sacramento. The object was low in the sky and now hovering or stationary.  Two different airplanes, on their normal flight paths from Mather Air Field &amp; Sacto. International Airport were in the sky at the same time.  We compared the object to these aircraft.  Thats when you could really see the difference between the &#34;object&#34; and the two aircraft.  Both aircraft had easily identifiable flashing navigational lights, the object had no navigational lights of any type.  The &#34;object&#34; could be described as a round white light which slowly pulsated to completely orange, then completely red and then back to white again.  It slowly decended until it went out of sight.<n>

I saw a moving light for about 6-8 seconds travelling as if making a descent towards the ground at a fairly rapid pace.  Suddenly the light seemed to break apart into 2 lights.  One started falling at a pace perpindicular to the ground, the other followed the trail it was previously was on.  After about 2 seconds of viewing these 2 separate objects, they disappeared from view, they faded out as if they had burned out.  The lights were bright white light.<n>

It didn&#39;t look like an airplane because of the way the lights were.  They were blinking on and off from the right and from the left side.  The lights were coming on in succession from the right side and the left side.  It seemed to have 2 sets of lights, one on the left and one on the right.  There appeared to be about 5 lights on each side.   I think at the same time.  The lights were a white color, nothing unusual.  There were trees in the way and we were trying to find a place to pull over so we could just watch this thing, by the time we went up and over the hill (lost sight of it behind the trees), it was gone.  We pulled over anyway and watched for a few minutes and it was no where to be seen.   There was only one of them.  We were wondering if anyone else saw the same thing. Thank you.

Aircraft from Ohara airport could be seen circling around behind this object. Object appeared to change shape half a dozen times, but stayed a constant brightness and distance from us. We watched it thru binoculars, but couldn&#39;t make out any definite details.After about 45 minutes object slowly moved to the north at a slow but constant speed until our view was blocked by buildings. No noise accompanied this object, although we could hear aircraft that were in the area. I myself have an extensive back round in the aviation field, having worked as an aviation ordananceman in the USMC on 3 different aircraft and I work for a military subcontractor that makes parts for aircraft cockpit displays. This was no aircraft, ballon or other flying object I have ever seen before! One other witness had been a tech on an Hawk missle battery in the USMC and he couldn&#39;t identify this object either. The other three witnesses were my wife, daughter and her boy freind. We all were excited to see this and stood outside for 20 minutes in the cold to look at it with the binocular&#39;s.<n>

About 23.45 last night (01/26/2001) when I was walking the dog I seen something in the sky over the Dingle/Toxteth area in Liverpool, England. There was no engine noise at all - It was silent. There were 4 red lights in a diamond shape. They went on and off about once a second, not flashing but fading smoothly up and down. It travelled south east passing overhead, but not directly over. When it was over our area the size was similar to a large commercial aircraft a few miles from an airport coming in to land. There were no red and green port &amp; starboard lights nor any flashing white lights, only the 4 red ones. The speed was much faster than a commercial jet. Within 30 seconds it had travelled in to the distance and I lost sight of it. There were patches of cloud but otherwise the sky was very clear and the stars were all clearly visible. Perhaps someone else might have seen it so I thought I&#39;d let you have the details. Yours Sincerely, ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

I was intstantly stunned by how bright it was. It &#39;s as if it was above my house, because i was heading directly home and the object seemed to be directly in front of me. As i drove up my street the object seemed to sort of bob up and down but didn&#39;t appear to be moving laterally. As i rushed down the street and pulled into my driveway, i stopped my car and jumped out to run out to the street to see it, and it was  gone.  This object seemed to almost eminate this soft bright white light in a pulsating, circular way . It was brighter and purer of a light than i&#39;ve ever seen. I was very large in the sky, about the size of two full moons, but more oval. It was also completly silent out. If it were a helicopter or aroplane at that distance there would of been sound. And it couldn&#39;t have vanished in the time i went from my car to the street. Which would have been about 3 seconds. I stood in the street waiting for it to return for about 15minutes, but it never returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the sighting might have been caused by Venus.

I got in my car and drove to the beach to investigate (about two minutes away) and got out of my car and walked down on the beach.  The light was orangish and very bright.  I thought it was a planet at first(as bright as Jupiter) but Jupiter was straight up above me, along with another minor planet.  Watching the light, I noticed it was moving in a northerly direction very slowly over the ocean, and in the meantime descending gradually.  At that moment I assumed it was a plane coming in to land at the airport here, but it never approached the airport. I then drove north along Pebble Beach Drive to another pullout where I sat awhile, and to my astonishment the object began to move up and down and began to slightly accelerate at certain moments (the object was still very far in the distance) and then it would slow again.  At this instant I just knew it wasn&#39;t a plane.  The light then began to appear brighter, and then fade again, where it faded altogether and didn&#39;t reappear. I drove down to the end of the road to Point St. George to see if it had appeared again, but the sky was pitch black and there was no light to be seen.  I know there were other vehicles driving along Pebble Beach at the time, and I know someone else must have seen what I had seen--it was too bright to ignore it.<n>

At first sight, I thought maybe it was an airplane but upon further examination it clearly wasn&#39;t an airplane.  I think my first words where &#34;what kind of airplane is that?&#34; or &#34;what the heck is that?&#34; as I pointed the object out to my cousin. The object appeared burnt-orange or amber in color.  There were no distinguisable lights or strobes on this object as you would see on an airplane or helicopter.  The whole object appeared to be dimly illuminated and slightly shimmering or hazy.  Although the object seemed fairly close, the manner in which this object was illumination made it very difficult to determine exactly what shape it was.  I would have to identify it as triangular shaped and it appeared to have a flat bottom surface. When we first saw the object it was just slightly in front of us and traveling away from us in an east, northeast direction.  At one point, as the object was moving away, i thought the back of the object seemed to have the shape of a boomerang with the ends pointing down.  The object was traveling in a very smooth, fluid-like motion and was completely silent.  It was also traveling deceptively fast too.  Upon first sight the object was roughly the size of the finger nail on my pinky finger held at arms length but in about 5 seconds it had traveled far enough to appear as a mere point of light.  As we were both watching this thing in disbelief and trying to figure out what it was it instantly shifted directions and was heading north for about 1 second the shifted directions again and was heading east for about 1 more second until it vanished from sight.  I have never seen any plane or helicopter on television or in real life that could change directions so rapidly.  We were both completely awestruck by what we witnessed that night and I have been thinking about it o! n a dail y basis ever since.<n>

REPORT OF FOREIGN/UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT: UNUSUAL AIRCRAFT OBSERVED OVER CAMP PENDLETON. JANUARY 26, 2001. To: Department of Defense Re: Marine Base Camp Pendleton. United States Marine Corps. Dear Sirs and To Whom It May Concern, Please indulge this report from a former Marine regarding what I believe to be the most astonishing visual sight you can imagine. On Sunday morning, January 20, 2001 at  0130 hours I made the following observation from my own backyard that borders the San Luis Rey Riverbed on the South side. This is directly South of Camp Pendleton. The river-bed is 10 feet from my backyard and goes West to East. I noticed an unusual aircraft coming East from the coastline, directly over the river-bed. At first I could not process what I was looking at. It continued toward me at approximately 25 mph and 300 feet above the ground.  This vehicle was illuminated occasionally by street lights and headlights of cars on the road nearby as it slowly headed past my back fence. Personal Visual Report Following: 1/26/01 by ((personal data deleted)). 24/7 Unknown Air Vehicle Identifiers By Sighting: This aircraft is approximately 50-60 feet in diameter and shaped exactly like a tall slice of pie.  It was of equal dimensions on all three sides and these sides were 15 feet high. There was no lighting, no visible ports or venting. The color was dark (amphibian) green with black splotches. THE FORWARD POINT OF THIS &#34;PIE&#34; WAS ALSO THE FORWARD-DIRECTED SECTION. This color scheme is nearly (if not) identical to a large tropical frog.  The backside was black-framed with black paneling and exuded no light or visible exhaust whatsoever. The underside of this aircraft was flat (as were all the sides) and had two large white pods (looked like tap lights you see on TV) and each was 10-12 feet in diameter. They were located where you might expect landing gear to be placed. This aircraft rumbled as it went by in a very hushed tone. It sounded like a jet engine encased in a steel room with no porting or exhaust sounds. The ground slightly shook. Perhaps it sounded like a reactor core, utterly encased, strong with no venting.  This vehicle floated at 25 mph over my house and was in my plain sight for over 30 seconds. I got a very good look at it. It made no effort to conceal itself except by color and no use of lighting. The 25mph speed was constant and level at 300 feet as this aircraft followed the San Luis Rey River-bed East and beyond my sight. I also want to tell you that I have been observing the skies over Camp Pendleton since last Sunday. There are several  things I have seen that defy explanation and current (public-known) technology.  I have seen white dots evade your helicopters and also follow your helicopters very closely.  These white dots seem to duck-and-cover when an aircraft is coming toward them. They seem quite bold and brazen when the aircraft is heading away and has no visual view behind them. I have seen these white dots follow your helicopters very closely. It appears to be a game of hide and seek. The more helicopters you have in the air at once, like January 24th at 2100 hours, the more visible this activity is. Your flights seem to stir these white dots up and cause them to &#34;blow cover&#34; and start evading. I strongly recommend the following operation to document this nocturnal activity over and near Camp Pendleton. Recommendations for Video-Recording UFO Events: 1)  Have an Audio-Visual platoon set-up an Observation (OP) station on very high ground with a 360 degree view. They must be in a location that is very dark with no street or vehicle lights to diminish human night-vision.. Use telescopic and panoramic lens on digital video recorders using strong and stable tripods. 2) Have these video-crews scan the skies for one week, all night. Have them take visual note of civil aircraft. Have them follow the civil aircraft through the sky with the video lens. Have them watch with their finger on the RECORD button the entire time.  Watch for lights moving ahead of these aircraft or behind them in close proximity. 3) Notice lights in the sky that appear stationary or cosmic. Some of these lights will move away suddenly and very fast if an aircraft comes between them and the ground. These white dots sometimes leave trails of light when they move abruptly.  These white lights tend to flash at times or go entirely blacked-out at other times.  The movement can be from one quadrant of the sky to another in mere seconds. If you can arrange this kind of video-observation operation, or I should say, If you choose to do this, you will eventually get good video tape of UFO aircraft activity right over our heads. What I have seem so far defies explanation. Your own video-tape can then be analyzed by your experts. I am available for polygraph or Sworn Affidavit if so requested.

Since I live near a Marine Air Station, I thought nothing of it. I went out to my truck to get my keys at about midnight. On my way in I saw the three sets of lights again moving toward the coast in a stop and go pattern. They looked to be the same as earlier. What got my attention was that they were flying close enough that if they were Hornet&#39;s I would have heard them. Also the stop and go movement, the changing of formation, and the lights. What I mean is, I was stationed at MCAS Beaufort and I have never seen lights on an aircraft that flickered like these. I watched for about 30 minutes as they made there way over towards the the twon of Beaufort. They were so close that I could see the objects rotate and almost flip without breaking their formation. I just went outside and the dogs around the neighborhood are going nuts, but it is really quiet. They are just barking away. I know the air station has a few helicopters(CH-46&#39;s) and I know the sound they make. There was no sound but what ever they were stopped and accelerated with no noticeable noise. I called MCAS to enquire but was hung up on. I didn&#39;t know who else to contact.<n>

I saw a small aircraft flying lower &amp; South of the sphere, but headed in an Easterly direction.  I looked back at the sphere &amp; noticed it wasn&#39;t flashing, but there was a blue &amp; red light, then it disapeared again.   I haven&#39;t seen it since.   The sphere appeared to be large{it was slightly over my neighbors garage...from my angle/visual prospective}.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the star, Sirius.  PD))<n>

It was a cloudy night with rain falling sporadically, I was letting my cat out to do her thing when I noticed a Saucer shaped vehicle moving very slowly with no noise whatsoever. It was approx. at a 200 ft. altitude level and it was close enough that I could tell it to be about the size of an 18 wheeler truck. If you put your arm out and stuck your thumb out horizontal it would be the size of your thumb from nail to knuckle. My best guess is that it was about 300 yrds out. I was looking west from my porch, and the vehicle was traveling from north to south at approx. 5 miles per hour, coming to full stops occasionally for 1 or 2 seconds then continuing on till it disappeared from my sight. It had spinning lights red, blue, white and green it had the appearance of a circus Ferris wheel. The sighting took place within a 2-3 minute period. When it started to rain , I realised that I was standing in my front yard with nothing but my underwear and I returned to my home .<n>

It varied from two miles from my house to maybe ten miles Looking through binoculars it appears to be two lights which are very bright and white .Sometimes these lights criss-cross one another or appear to merge together.I can not tell if there is a craft attatched to these lights. Tonight I first saw the light about one mile from my house, about 30 minutes later I could barely see it . It appearred to be about ten, maybe twenty miles away. Then within five minutes it was within two miles from my house again. Around nine oclock at night the lights just dissapear. They do not appear to fade away into the horrizone, they just shut off instantly.Having been in Vietnam I know that these were not flairs.Also living within 5 miles of Luke Airforce Base the possibility that the lights could be from a helicopter occured to me,however two hours in one area four nights in a row would seem strange. In addittion the lights were to large to come from an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus, but that is a guess.  The binoculars may not be perfectly columnated, which might explain the two images.   PD))<n>

My name is ((name deleted))t and I am writing to you on behalf of a friend ((name deleted)) who does not own a computer. This is her account of what happen. I was walking to work at 06.10am on Thursday 26th January down Alpine road in Ventnor when something caught my eye in the sky. The object round and bright, with colours of red, white and blue and were circulating around the object at rapid speed. In the middle there was a small round black shape inside the flashing lights. The object was hovering over houses for about 8 to 10 minutes, then started to move at slow speed towards Ventnor downs and then stopped, it hovered again over the houses for 5 minutes and then moved slowly towards Ventnor downs. The object moved again at slow speed into the darkness where I lost sight of it. The time was around 06.31am. Could you please let us know what you think it was?. Thanks. Yours sincerely, ((name deleted))t.

It was a bright clear night and I glanced out the kitchen window, where an unusually bright star in the southwest sky, perhaps 40-45 degrees above the horizon, caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never seen such a sparkling, colorful star before! Red and blue light flashed from it, in a way similar to the flashing lights on police cars.  I watched it, fascinated, for a short time and then ran for my binoculars (I don&#39;t have a telescope) but they revealed no details.  The object looked like a ball of glowing light emitting sparks and spikes of colored light.  It didn&#39;t move at all during the approximately 30 minutes I observed it, but a couple of times it appeared to fade slightly and then brighten again, and it was still there when I finally went back to bed. I haven&#39;t seen it since. I was prompted to submit this report after I read of a similar sighting that occurred in Telford, Pa., which is about 30 miles from Prospect Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It sounded as if a helicopter was taking off right in our backyard!  My wife sprang up and looked through the blinds, seeing only a bright white light.  She ran through the house to catch a glimpse out the arcadia window, but within a second or two the object had completely vanished, leaving no sound, no light, no trace.  The time was about 4:30am.  We both had trouble going back to sleep.  Just prior to waking I was having a dream that I was floating or bouncing down a long dark street, accompanied by strangers (possibly police officers) and arriving at a house or a window.  The sound I awoke to reminded me of a military helicopter, but why it would be in or just outside our backyard I cannot understand.  A month or two earlier my wife was driving on a fairly desolate road and saw a very fast-moving &#34;helicopter&#34; with a bright white light &#34;coming toward her.&#34;  She turned and it vanished quickly.  If you have had any reports of helicopters appearing outside bedroom windows in East Mesa, please let us know.  We are curious to learn what is going on.  Thank you.<n>

And i know at like 10pm the air force isn&#39;t flying, but i was like  maybe its an exercise.  then like not 3 seconds later this thing is on the other side of the highway about 30 feet in the air, rite on top of the trees then comes around in front of us and it had like two headlights and underneath it had lights shinging down, and it was like a round disc shape, BUT there was no noise, absolutely none, and if a F-16 was flying that low and rite in front of us there would be lots of noise.  And for the half a second it flew in front of us it seemed to slow down then went off the highway too my right and hovered over a trailer (the only plane that can hover is in England), then zoomed off the way it came very quickly and like disappeared.<n>

It was rejected because I could not give an exact date or even the year. I knew that it was in the winter and I knew the time because of a meeting I was going to that meets at 8pm. regularly. However I was unsure of an axact month or even the year.  I knew it was between 2001 and 2002 and it was in either January or February.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon speaking with a friend about UFO&#39;s and about my experience,I have re-thought the date of my siting.  I believe that it was in January of 2001, to the best of my recollection.  Anyway, that is my best guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is all this reporting site has asked me for, so if this report is not accepted then I will not try again. I was surprised when the report was rejected because I could not give an exact date, especially when I seen a report from a man who claimed to see UFO&#39;s in the 1970&#39;s  with no specific dates of the sitings. I found the reply to be insulting, particularly when this site is supposed to be looking for reports from people.  I am not looking for any special recognition or for anything for that matter, accept to be believed, however, if I am not, than so be it.  With all this said I will report what I seen one last time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling down Main Street in Salisbury, heading to an AA meeting, of which I had been a sober member for many years at the time and still am.  It was just before 8pm and I was just going to make it on time because I was running late.  I noticed that the street became suddenly and very strangely deserted, even for a street Salisbury, which is not a large city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a very errie presence that I find hard to describe. I did not know where it was coming from. Somehow I felt that this presence was around my car and felt that I could not shake it even though I was driving and was in motion.  I looked around in all directions but saw nothing.  I knew there was a definate presence though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally I looked up to see, directly above me, a saucer. I stopped the car immediately and it stopped as well.  It then took off in a slight foward motion from my car and angled upward where it dissapeared into the sky at lightening speed.  I remember seeing it become smaller and smaller until it dissapeared into the sky.  It was a metallic blue/silver color and had an aura about it.  The lighting about it appeared to fluctuate, although there were no actual lights on it or that were coming from it.I could not tell how large or small it was or how close or far above me it was, only that it was above me.  My guess is that it was closer rather than further away and that it was not particularly large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, that is my siting report and that is what I had seen.I have never before or since seen anything like that. Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I remember that from meeting times but do not remember month or date since this happened a few years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling down S. Main St. The first thing i noticed is that it was strangely deserted. I felt an intense erie presence and looked around but didnt see anybody or cars. I looked up to see a saucer directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was at the point that i had stopped the car cause i sensed that the presence went at the speed and where my car went. i was feeling this thats why i looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as i looked up at the thing it took off at a slight angle and then straight up in a flash. i could see it getting smaller and then dissapear.  It made no sound. i have never before or after experienced anything like this but it was as clear to me as anything because ive been sober over 20 years.  The object was a metalic blue and silver.  It had a strange glow or haze in the sense that the colors almost faded or interchanged with each other and did not stay solid if that makes any sense. Like a fluxuation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was between 2001 and 2002. In winter i believe. This is the only thing i am uncertain about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always said i should report it but never got around to it and just recently thought to do so when the debate came up again. I guess once youve seen one you get a little annoyed when people discount it and thats why im reporting it. nothing to gain but a little off my chest.I know what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting me share this with you and i do hope more evidence comes about and classified information is released. once again thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is unknown.

We had an unobstructed view out the front windshield of the car--a wide horizon.  We saw a single blue light travel from the far left to the far right raising in altitude.  The light took about 30 seconds to travel that distance, about 2-3 times faster than a commercial jet would move, and then disappear to the far right.  We estimate that it travelled at approximately 5-10,000 feet, where you usually see private aircraft fly at.  There were no other tail or running lights, just a single spherical blue light.<n>

A short distance east of Venus I saw two lights close together about the width of my thumb held at arms length. The light to the right was brighter and faded slowly out. The light on the left faded and brightened a few times then went out. Both lights were stationary. Shortly after they vanished a commercial airliner flew over where they were. The lights were circular and had a pale yellow or golden hue. They were slightly less brilliant than Venus and had a softer definition with some haze around them. I am a fine art conservator with a keen sense of observation. I am also an avid skywatcher and have been interested in UFOs since my first sighting in 1967.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have observed landing lights on approaching commercial airliners, but that is a guess.

The object itself seemed to ba also made of white light, but the lights at the edges were brighter. The shape was hard to discern, as it seemed very high, about an inch between my fingers, and it glowed with light. The more amazing part to me is that, I had been reading about contact before I left my flat, and I had requested to be able to see &#39;someone&#39;. I first thought it to be a plane, but the lights did not seem correct. After seeing this thing, I watched it on and off overhead as I walked. Then I entered the building I was going to and felt satisfied that I had seen it, and walked in. I realize this may be explainable, and i would welcome opinions. Mir station? There is a US Army helicopter base in town, so I guess anything is possible. Although this thing gave me the impression that it was very far away. Almost as if it was in space.<n>

It appeared to have a scalloped texture to it, and was quite large-I was viewing it from about a mile away, and it was as large as the sun.  This object was obscured by clouds that were slowly moving north, while it was moving gradually south at a slow pace, as if it was a cloud and not a giant boomerang made of light.  I was 16 when I saw this object, and had quite a nice view three stories up from a panoramic window in a public library.  There was one other person around sitting by the window, but she never looked up from her book.  There were also cloud formations near this object that were very strange.  To the north of the UFO was a perfectly circular hole in a very large cloud that hung over the northwestern part of the downtown area, and in the center of the hole it looked like a rocket had taken off and flown through the direct center of the hole and left a trail of emissions from behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Their were other stars in the noght sky, very vivid, this just didn&#39;t seem like a star. I started almonst feeling very uncomfortable, almost eiry. Again I went to the window and it was gone. Not a glimmer. Just sky, the stars were still visible, but this star or seemingly star disapeared. The object was located based on my orientation on long island, it would be west.

The flying objects flew in various formations first in circles then in a line at a 90degree angle going straight &amp; upwards, then all six objects went into a circular motion.After a while they form another formation by &#34;falling sideways&#34; at a  slant of 45 degrees with the the 1st from the top till the fifith objects moving and the sixth (bottom most) remaining stationary. After that they went back to a perpendicular position, evenly spacing themselves out.The scene was more &#34;entertaining&#34; than intimidating with all the 38 kids (most of them orphans &amp; some from poor or broken homes. Next, three of them formed a straight line and the remaining three formed a circle, then the three objects that formed a circle converged into one, appearing like a small letter &#34;i&#34;. Then all the 6 flying objects remained stationery prancing around in all kinds of formation emitting bright orange lights.I took some snapshots using the school&#39;s compact camera.As it is now &#34;festival holidays&#34; for the Chinese Lunar &#34;New Year&#34;, I am unable to develop the negatives. There are six teachers and 38 students here and all of us were standing in the school field to witness the phenomena.

I think it was heading north-east to east direction. It streaked and then just disappeared into nothing, no trace of anything in the sky.

It was a really really clear bright day (crsip and cold) but not a cloud in the sky and really really clear, (which is unusal for Manchester anyway!-and we had had nothing but bad weather recently.  But this morning was really clear blue sky (not one single cloud in the sky). Anyway i am driving up and glanced up to admire the glorious blue cloudless sky, when i noticed (as I am looking through my windscreen (towards my left hand side in the sky) the shape of a transulent/transparent, what i can only describe as tearshaped object in the sky.  It reminded me of a Christmas bauble/decoration.  You could clearly see this thing in the sky at first i though it was a hot air balloon, but it was see through, but you could clearly see the outline!  i couldnt comment how far up/the distant in the sky (same as planes - but i would say that size wise it would be about the size of 4/5 jumbo&#39;s.  Obviously i was driving but kept looking up to see that it was there and it was for at least a good two minutes or two.  I arrived at my desination and turned left of the Ashton Old Road, and when i pulled up and got out of my car, it was gone!!! -   Couldnt belive what i saw, as like i said it was such a clear day/sky - and it was so obvious/prominent<n>

After the object stopped hovering it just disapeared after about 10 minutes but as it went i could see a streak of yellow from where it had shot off.<n>

She saw a bright light that she thought was a sattelite moveing north in the southwest sky. When it stopped she called me outside to see it. She pointed out a big bright star just over the tree line southwest of our home, &amp; told me to watch it. It wasn&#39;t moveing when I saw it, but started to move eraticaly in a small area.We continued to watch it, It then went left realy quick &amp; stopped on a dime, &amp; went right, she asked me what it was &amp; I said I did not know, but it wasn&#39;t an airplane, because airplanes can&#39;t do that. We continued to watch it. I went and told her mother about it &amp; she came outside to see it.  We all watched it for about an hour,  it stayed in the same general area all this time, It&#39;s brightness would sometimes dim for a little bit then go bright again, You could occasionaly see a red flash go off near by it like a flashbulb,there was a flash of blue light low on the horizon just to the east of it,but very quick &amp; faint. Ive worked in aviation for the last 19 years &amp; this was not an airplane, they don&#39;t move like that, &amp; sattelites don&#39;t stop. There was even an airplane that flew through the vicinity way below it. It moved rappidly towards it then stopped still far away. It just slowly moved in the same direction as the airplane was moveing &amp; then went back up to where it was before.<n>

From the window I noticed a bright, white light low in the sky over New Jersey. I went to the rear deck of the boat to get a better look. It appeared to be brighter than any planet I&#39;ve ever seen in the night sky, and too low on the horizon to be a planet of such brightness. I got to the Manhattan side, and noticed the light had moved North and was now somewhere near Newark. It then changed in color to bright red, pulsed periodically, and moved Westward eventually fading. I returned the next nigh, at the same time, to the same vantage point at Battery Park, and It was clear it was not any planet, as there was nothing in that part of the sky and at the time and the weather was quite clear. Anyone else see this?  ((URL deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We think there is a possibility the witness may have been observing a planet or a twinkling star.

1/21/01 19:30|Los Angeles|CA|Triangle|20 seconds|Unidentified Craft Hovering Over Los Angeles Freeway|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16020.html|74|ndxe200101| Unidentified Craft Hovering Over Los Angeles Freeway<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from Encino on the Ventura Freeway (CA Freeway 101) at approximately 7:30pm Sunday, January 21st, 2001. As I live in the city of Los Angeles, I am quite familliar with the presence of helicopters in my day-to-day life. I happened to notice one such helicopter ahead of me as I drove in a south-eastern direction. I paid special attention because I noticed that the &#34;spot light&#34; was on. This was of particular concern to me due to the fact that a lit spot light on the freeway could mean that there is a police chase in the nearby vicinity and caution my be exercised. I kept my eye on the craft as I drove and I began to notice that the spot wasn&#39;t acutally on at all. In fact, I noticed that the helicopter seemed to be hovering through the air very slowly and smoothly. I then noticed that what I had mistaken for a spotlight was simply one very large white light. Further, I noticed that the craft had NO BLADES. The altitude of the craft was approximately twice that of what a normal helicopter would be navigating at, yet the craft, itself, was large enough to where my perspective of it&#39;s altitude was skewed due to it&#39;s size. Alarmed, I began driving directly underneath the craft and looked up to see that it APPEARED to be triangular in shape and had a series of ODDLY-COLORED lights flashing on it&#39;s underside. I am a skeptic now as I was prior to last night&#39;s events. Nonetheless, I&#39;m entirely certain there were/are others who saw what I did. The freeway was fairly busy, although not bumper-to-bumper. If there is anyone out there who could verify that something was hovering over the freeway, it would be greatly appreciated.<n>

Something was glowing to my right and this illumination was about 30 feet in the air.  As soon as my vision settled on the clump of mass, and my vision is ultra clear and good at distance viewing, the glowing orange yellow fire transformed into a ball object about basketball sized.  This ultra fast change appeared to be through a small explosion.  There was no shockwave or noise.  All of this happened in approximately 1.5 seconds.  100% quick rings then traveled across the front of the house.  This is what that ball changed in to.  It seemed the rings emerged simultaneously as the ball emerged and exploded from the growing clump of mass.  The rings were 3 or more feet in size and they kept their shape as they flashed and strobed.  They went from the street to the roof area of the house in what appeared to be a tiny sliver of time.  I was still able to track these parts through time.  These ring forms then combined into a single perfectly circular disk about 4 feet across.  This object was reveled to me in its unobstructed entirety.  I had a full frontal view of this disk.  It was stationary at the roof area of the house and perfectly circular.  It&#39;s coloration was off-white.  The object was not empty.  I saw shadows within.  They were about 2 feet long and narrow.  The sides of these shadowy objects were wavy.  There was not a flicker of movement as this disk levitated in front of me.  I gazed at it for approximately 2 seconds.  It then left my field of vision on a vanish.  It did not fade away or streak into the sky under some discernable propulsive power.  This single series of unique events occurred in the sequence I report.  The specific moments and incidents occurred at that time and place.  The events that happened will be remembered.  For the remainder of my life I will have a blast of total remote recall.  It will be remembered vividly.  On that morning something alien fully entered my consciousness.  Something unc! anny and mysterious inserted itself into my consciousness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed quite sincere.  We received a large-scale map from the witness, which indicates where the object was sighted at a corner on 35th Avenue.  PD))<n>

Me and my girlfriend were in the car, when the car lights suddenly started to turn brighter and brighter, i stopped the car, and the fuse box uderneath me blew, and the engine shudded to a halt, around 3 seconds after this, a dimish-yellowish-blurrlyish object passed us in the night sky, aorund 10 metres above us, to be very honest we fucking nearly shitted ourselfs. the object passed us at around 50kph (35 mph) and gained altitude and started to ben around the the right, it curved around and did a large loop, it made another pass over the car at around 20 metres at around the same speed. it stopped, around 10-20m off to the left of our car. it looked like some sort of trianglar shape, with like a half-circle dome on top of it, a yellowish glow emitted from the underneath of the craft... the colour of the glow changed to yellow to blue then back yellow, it did this in 5 seconds, still hovering off the ground, there was a general humm you could hear. me and alex (my g/f) where holding each other in our arms witnessing this, the craft then turned around so it faced us, and then increased speed, it lift our car to the right as it passed us at amazing speed, the glow left a trail then climbed and was out of sight within 6-8 seconds. the trail behind it slowly faded away behind it.<n>

This second submission is intended as an update after a time of reflection. I originally described this object as some sort of fire ball moving across the western sky into the south in a continuous arching fashion.  I previously mentioned that I had fortunately grabbed my digital video camera and tapped this strange event .  I have viewed the tape over and over in slow motion frame by frame.  This object resembles a golden sphere that sometimes can be seen quite clearly. Unfortunately a was excited as hell and could not hold the camera perfectly still.  Upon using the telephoto lens and also zooming out for scale,the object  is definately something that is unexplainable by myself, or the 12 other people that have viewed the tape so far. Highly educated and professional standing people that I presented it to have no clue what it is, however, together they all agree that it is definately eerie. I&#39;m not into UFO&#39;s, nor do I really want to push this issue with anyone because I dont really want to get hung up on reserching the hell out of it, but it was so strange that I decided to call Transport Canada, Enviorment Canada and believe it or not, I was connected on Sunday morning to Pearson International Airport&#39;s control tower shift manager because I actually thought I had a video of a plane in an emergency and wondered if they would need it.  I spoke to the shift manager and he had said that there were no reports of trouble in the air earlier that morning. I described to him what I had on tape and he came up with expanations such as a meteor or a plane burning surplus fuel.  I see alot of aircraft in this area and they make noise, even high up in the statosphere.  This did not make a sound. I even went sofar as to record aircraft and a star from the same window last night to see how they would compare to my original fireball/sphere recording. NOT EVEN CLOSE! After seeing this thing I went to the internet for explanations.  I have never been to your site nor any other UFO sites before.  I managed to read some similar sounding occurances and have concluded in my own mind that what I saw was definately strange. I will leave it up to who ever views the tape to conclude what it is for themselves.  I can&#39;t wait to hear the next &#34;explanation&#34;<n>

Something out the window caught my eye. Thinking it was an aircraft from Toronto Pearson Airport I resumed working on the board.  Upon taking a second glimse, I realized that it was pretty strange, I grabbed my digital video camera and taped the object by hanging dangerously outside my second story window.  I managed to get a couple minutes of footage.  What I saw seemed to be a slow moving fireball. There were no common green, red, blue or clear aircraft navigation lights.  This was a fire orange colour that seemed constant. I was wondering if maybe it was an aircraft in trouble.No reports yet of any. This object moved form the Western sky to the south.  I ran outside to get more footage.  Any way I called police asking if there were any reports of aircraft trouble but they could not help. Oh well.  Anyways, I thought I would see if there was any way iIcould report this strang incident.  Pretty amazing!  This does not seem to different to your report on the main page with the orange glow that was also picked up on video.  Thanks. ((initials deleted))<n>

Strangeness of it was that there were absolutely no lights or sound coming from it as it skimmed across the sky no more than 100&#39; from the ground. It had to be large enough to be seen in the same area of view for about three seconds. When I called for a friend to see this, it was already gone. I could definately tell that the nose had a point of a type, but could see nothing further in the way of detail. ((name deleted)) Portland, Oregon seen in SE Portland near Willamette River<n>

It wasn&#39;t the first time we saw something like that where we are actually living. An interesting thing, is that every time we see it, it has almost the same duration, about 50 minutes. When we look at the same place during the day, nothing is seen. However, it&#39;s no sattelite, it moves too slowly and disappears quickly, when it&#39;s near to the ground, from our point of view.

The light would dart in the sky from side to side.  Then for no reason went up faster than any other plane I have ever seen in this area.  The light began to grow a slight bit dimmer as it rose and went away from me the opposite dirrection that it was moving.  It seemed to have a bright light coming from the bottom.  I could also see 2 beems of light coming off from it for a few minutes.  This could have been do to fog or something and strobes bouncing off from it.  The object then moved closer and went to the other side of the house.  It was gone in no time at all.<n>

Looked up and saw two parellel lights decending and transited over my head. They  moved simultaneosly out over the ocean. They were larger than a shooting star (about 3x) had a lumenescence, no tail, and much lower to the ground (about 10,000-15,000ft).They did not make a sound, and were moving very fast in perfect formation with each other.Were decending as they came closer to the ocean. I believe I witnessed something extraordinary and unexplainable. I went to the local Coast Guard office to file a report and see if anyone else (fishing ships) had witnessed it. They gave me this name and number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length, and we found her to be a very convincing witness.  Her description was quite precise.

So we stoped to get a better look. The object  was moving extremly slooooow over a building about 1 mile away. At first we thought it was a plane or helicopter, then we realized that if it were either one, we would of heard the sound of the engine or the spinning of the copter blades. Another thing that we noticed was the size of this thing. It was &#34;HUGE&#34;. because at that distance, it covered the roof tops of a few buildings. The best estimate we can give, is that it was probably the lenght of two football feilds, but we may be a little off. Anyway after 6 minutes or so, we heard a loud sound approchaing from behind us, when we looked up there were four airforce or army jets heading the the direction of the craft. When the jets got closer to the craft, it moved away slowly and faded out of site and It was a pretty clear night. no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We don&#39;t know what it was the witnesses observed, but we would want to rule out a blimp as the first step in any investigation.

What was interesting is the next day I flew to Maui for vacation.  When reading the Maui Sunday newspaper I came across  a small article about   a large orange fireball in the night sky moving east to west on Saturday night (Jan. 20th). The zetatalk website (which, regardless of who is &#34;supposed&#34; to be giving out the information) is a very thorough, and food for thought site to study. According to &#34;them&#34; the orange fireballs are part of the precursors to the approach of the so called l2th planet.  Apparently this l2th planet, or giant comet, or ball of redemption, or whatever one wishes to call it, can be viewed now by telescope in the night sky.  What are your views on this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC does record fireballs in its database, but we are not aware of a 12th planet.  As far as we know, there are only nine planets in the solar system.  PD))<n>

It was roughly between Jupiter and Venus and at an altitude of about 45 degrees.That was the last I saw of it.<n>

Then I realized that it seemed to be slower and closer to the tree tops than I would expect from an airplane. There were no other cars coming so I stopped the car on the road and watched as the object seemed to stay in one place. There were  lights on it. I believe they were red and blue. They were flashing as they moved along the length of tubelike thing. I was just about to roll down my window so I could hear better when it took off very fast and smoothly with it&#39;s long edge forward. I watched as the lights  flashed across  the tube until it disappeared from my sight.<n>

It was light  outside, the sun was already up. I looked up for some reason, and I saw a metallic sphere floating in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but then I noticed that there were no others like it around. I also noticed that it seemed to be reflecting sunlight, because it was really bright on one side, brighter than the other anyway. It hovered there for maybe 30 more seconds after I saw it, then in an instant, it was gone. I knew then, no star could just vanish like that.<n>

All of a sudden a search light came out of it, it was shinning on the clouds in front and to the sides of it.  I just sat there watching it.  The search light went out, and within seconds, the bright sphere went out.  I sat a while longer waiting to see if there were blinking lights which would have made it a plane...there were none.  There was also no noise of any kind to be heard.  When planes fly on that side of the lake, it echo&#39;s to our side.  No noise, and the object was gone.  I asked at work if anyone had seen it, butno one had noticed it.<n>

I opened the blinds all the way, and thought I was seeing shooting stars until noticing that their direction was odd. They looked light very bright stars, and one in particular was moving up and down, side to side stopping on a dime, and moving from one axis to the other at 90 degree angles. I called a friend that lives a few miles away, and he witnessed the same thing. A second person that was in the house with me witnessed the same thing. These objects were located in the sky at about a 45-degree angle from view (elevation) and South Southwest to the left and slightly below Orion&#39;s Belt (I think). There was a triangular constellation of similar objects to the left and slightly below the initial object that were moving around also, but they were dimmer. The objects resembled stars, but seemed to change from bright white to red and blue. They were also flickering between colors. It seemed as though the object left a small trail at times, and sometimes it looked like two stars connected by a thin beam of light before they merged into a single light source. I watched the objects for about 90 minutes before going back to bed. I thought that this object could possibly be a satellite. I have a high quality video camera tonight, and will tape the sky if this happens again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness describes two bright planets, Jupiter and Saturn, that would be in that part of the sky at that hour.

It is very bright in the southeastern sky, and it &#34;twinkles&#34; vividly.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of Jan.,15,2001 I was driving to a friends house when I first noticed the object in the sky. Since I was almost to his home I didn&#39;t give it much thought although I did think that it looked out of place or strange since it seemed brighter than any of the stars around it or even other aircraft lights that I could identify. I spent about 45min. at his home and then left. on the way out his driveway I saw that the object was still in the sky but seemed to have move to the south of it&#39;s original position where I had seen it earlier. this peaked my interest enough to stop my vehicle and watch it from a stationary position. I thought to myself that a aircraft would have been long gone by now unless it was a rotorcraft that was hovering. After watching this object for mayby two to three minutes I was convinced that it was not behaving in a  familiar way. It would move periodicaly in a direction (up,down,left,right) and than stop. The movement was rapid and the distance traveled was not great, but it was difficult to tell just how far it was moving. After it would move I could see a small cloud of something appear where it had been then this cloud would disappear in just a moment,it looked like a small patch of fog. With the naked eye the object looked like a ball of light very bright in intensity and periodicaly I would notice red and green colors also. I returned to my friends house hoping that he might have a pair of binoculars that I could use to help identify this object. My friend had both a pair of binoculars (10X) and a spotting scope (20X to 60X). Both myself and my friend along with his wife and daughter went back outside to observe this object with the above mentioned items. Once in a position where we cold see the object it was clear to my friend and his wife that this object was nothing that they have ever seen before. We all agreed that we could not positively identify it with the naked eye. The binoculars were too unstable to get a good solid look at the object. My friend drove his truck up to where we were to use as a rest for the spotting scope. When the scope was on target it was even stranger looking at 60X magnification. To me the object looked like a single cell organism as seen with high power microscope. The color was easier to see with the spotting scope, it appeared to be changing slightly in intensity between white,green,red,and yellow but none of the colors ever completely went away. even with the help of optical magnification none of us could identify this object. My friend and I continued to watch this object and at about 8:50pm it faded than disappeared behind some hills.    During the time that the object was observed it traveled in what I would say was a southwest direction. I have been a professional firefighter for 15 years. My friend is self employed as a welder/fabricator and his wife is a local 911 dispatcher.<n>

I don&#39;t know how long they were there before I noticed them, but the just seemed to disappear after about a minute. I don&#39;t know what altitude they were at, but I would guess it was a few thousand feet. Because I couldn&#39;t judge their altitude, I can&#39;t estimate how big they were. I was walking north on Westwood Blvd in Westwood, CA at the time and the objects were in the sky slightly to my right, so from my perspective they were to the northeast. The sky was clear. Most of the time the objects appeared to be white, but at one point one of them seemed to reflect light and appeared shiny for a moment, hence my description as &#34;metallic&#34;. There didn&#39;t seem to be a particular pattern in their movement, but they did circle around each other at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Could be advertising lights, possibly.  PD))<n>

What first drew my attention to the sky was this orange smoke in the northeast...and then moving on into a trail as what a jet speeding across the sky would leave. To the east I saw a little gray oval-shaped disk moving in the sky. It seemed to be coming from the south toward the north. As I followed it - it turned back around and started going south again. I thought of the possibility of it being a UFO but was skeptical of such a thing. I looked farther into the south and saw 2 or 3 more coming...again, gray oval-shaped disks. I looked back at the first one I had seen and followed it with my eyes. A orangish light on the side of the UFO blinked 2 times and then stopped. In the northeast, a plane was going in the southwest direction. The UFO looked as though it would collide with the plane once they got close enough to do so. When it looked as if they were about to collide, the UFO ended up just passing underneath the plane. In the south, the other 2-3 UFOs were getting nearer. One thing to point out is they were not close together at all. They were all spread out individually in the sky. The train then arrived, and I boarded. The reason I chose to report this is because I read in the newspaper about light sightings over Rockford Thursday night. My sighting occured Friday morning and may have some connection to the Rockford sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC Note:  We suspect the alleged incident occurred in 2001, not in 2000, as indicated.

There was a full moon and I assumed that I was witnessing an aeroplane flying low. I then realised that it was in fact four or five seperate trails and immediately called my son to witness it.I opened the window and looked out and the white light trails were moving very fast inland leaving a long trail behind them.They were all travelling in a horizontal line in a formation so it would not appear to be debris falling to earth. I went out to the back and looked up in their direction of travel but the lights had dissappeared.I am a retired Police Officer and my son is thirteen years of age so we are definately not going mad!<n>

My friend dropped me off at my house at 9:27pm one evening in january of 2001 it was most likely after the 10th, but before the 14th (which is the day I went back to school).  My friend and I had just gotten back from town when I stepped out of the vehicle and then he left.  For some reason both of my parents came out of the front door of the house and out onto the side walk.  I asked them why they came out and at that exact moment all three of us looked up at the sky (it was a very clear winter night, no clouds at all) we saw a very large and strange circular object flying overhead.  The only reason we noticed the object was because of the different array of lights (it did not make any noise, but an airplane would flying so low).  My mouth gaped open because I knew exactly what I was and so did my mother.  My father was very skeptical, but we all concluded most diffinitely it was not an airplane, helicopter, stealth bomber, weather balloon or anything we had ever seen before or anything else that people blame these accounts on.  The circular craft flew very slowly and did not make any noise.  The craft was at a very low altitude (I will venture to say 300 - 400 feet) and we watched it for about 3 minutes as it passed over the trees and out of view.  I know what I saw and no one can tell me any differently they just dont make planes circular in shape and that large.  And another thing the craft had a sort of central piece that did not move, but the outer circle of the craft seemed to be spinning very slowly around the central part i could draw it for you if i had some paper.  My mother and I have told people that we know about this account and the only people that seem to believe us are the other three people we know that have had similar accounts.  I did not know about this website or i would have posted this account much earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Maybe penlighs or those lights that can be used when camping where you break the glass tube inside the plastic tube.  I do not think it was anything from another world.  The lights moved around within each group, like the wind was making them move.  It reminded me of the ballons that businesses send up during the day to advertize a sale.

1/11/01 22:45|Beloit|KS|Fireball|1-2 seconds|Fireball Over North Central Kansas|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15882.html|130|ndxe200101| Fireball Over North Central Kansas<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the above stated time I was on my way home from work headed west on the Tipton road about 3 miles west of the Highway 14 and the Tipton road junction.  My actaual location was approximately 3-4 miles south west of Beloit Kansas.  A yellow-orange ball with a bluish trailing edge appeared to fall to the ground at a high rate of speed.  It did not appear to be perfectly round.  It was as if the effects of falling through the atmosphere were effecting it&#39;s shape, not actually causing a distinguisable tail but rather making it somewhat egg shaped.  The object appeared to be dense and not transparent at all, but also it appeared to me to be a ball of fire rather than a solid object.  It fell at not quite right angles to the ground.  I would say more like 80 degrees in relation to the horizon moving from right to left as it fell.  I would say that from the time it entered into view in my windsheild and disapeared behind the horizon was a little more than one second. I was in a low spot and when I topped out on the next hill I saw no further evidence of the object.  I neither heard, nor felt, nor saw any impact, but as far as I could tell it had to have hit the ground because it disappeared behind the horizon.  As far as size I would say that if it were possible to extend my arm infront of me and try to cover the object with my thumb it would have just barely covered it.  Because I have no way to know it&#39;s exact size it is impossible to accurately judge the distance it was away from me.  However, I had the sense that it may have fallen somewhere around the Solomon Rapids or Glen Elder lake area and between the Tipton road and Hiway 24 which run fairly perallel to each other about 5 miles appart.  I contacted the 911 dispatcher and within about 10 minutes a deputy Sheriff contacted me by phone.  I related the event to him and he told me he had been on the tipton road also but had not seen it.  He said that if something had fallen it must have been behind him or he would have seen it also.  His location at th! e time w as west of glen elder eastbound heading toward me. He did not tell me how far west he was but I was about 7-8 miles east of glenelder at the time.)  If the object was behind the officer it would have to have been atleast 8-10 miles away from me.  If that is the case, in my estimation the oblect had to be fairly large for it to have appeared as large to me as it did.<n>

It reminded me of a firework with a trail behind it, and since it appeared to come straight down over my neighbor&#39;s house that&#39;s what I thought it was.

I had just put in gas in while on the southwest side of Las Vegas, NM, at 21:30 hours. At approximately 21:50 hours, about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon to the north, looking through my windshield, I saw bright green light appear, and it made a straight line to the horizon leaving a trail. It startled me and I thought someone had set a single &#39;roman candle&#39; off and it was falling back to earth.  It was so bright and so distinct, it looked as if it were right beside the road near me, and I looked for cars or people as I went by.  I did not see anyone in the area.  And I did not suspect this being a &#39;atmospheric&#39; event. There were several aircraft visible in the night sky before and after the event; even though there was a full moon it was very, very distinct. I would suspect someone on those airplanes also saw the event. A few minutes later, while listening to the Russ Johnson show on KOA in Denver, I realized this event was visible in many other states, and described as traveling &#39;north to southeast.&#39;  From my point of view, it was coming directly down in a straight line, so it must have been moving North to South.  One caller commented it landed in the &#39;Texas Panhandle.&#39; No, as I was way north and west of the Texas panhandle, and it did not go overhead! As I stated above, it appeared to fall straight down from a position 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon, directly north of my position.<n>

We live near state and I90 and the lights disappeared into the clouds just above our house. They floated like ballons, but the lights were very bright. If they were ballons, they must have been tied together because of the way they circled each other. The sky filled with clouds. The cloud cover was low as well.

The report from the AP states &#34;The helicopter crew spotted the fireball while flying about 30 miles east of Greeley. The light came from the east, around the Nebraska-Colorado border.&#34; But what we witnessed (just happened to have just reached the top of Bear Peak and were looking out across the plains toward Denver) was definitely traveling east and came from the west along a trajectory more like Salt Lake/Denver than Nebraska/Colorado. The glow from the illuminated gases around the object were bright enough to light up my face and allow one of my friends to realize and turn around and catch the end of the spectacle. Also, the AP story states that the observers in Sydney saw a blue fireball. Our observations were definitely of a bright green fireball. Not sure the exact length. I&#39;m guessing around five seconds. Very amazing.<n>

Thinking they were helicopters, flying in two random formations, I stopped to observe them for a couple of minutes. They were not flashing lights, but very intense and didn&#39;t seem to be moving. I also noted a plane or helicopter with flashing lights to the north approximatly 1-2 miles, and since it was cold and damp and I was not wearing a jacket, I returned to the warmth of my home. The next evening a friend related he&#39;d seen them as well. They were remarkably similar to the in color and intensity to the lights used to light I-90, which was 1/2 mile behind me in the opposite direction.<n>

I looked to the west and observed a formation of 5 circular objects the appeared to have a row of lights on the outer edge.  A little east/northeast of my location I noticed 2 smiliar shaped objects ahead of the others. The objects appeared to be moving at a moderate pace. Not as fast as a standard airplane would travel, but enough to observe movement. The lights on all of the objects were orange in color.  The sky was clear of clouds, it was pretty cold out, about 20-25 degrees, would be my guess.  The formation of 5 objects looked as though they would change spots very slowly, almost as if rotating places.<n>

1/11/01 21:15|Rockford|IL|Light|15-20 minutes|Several orange lights moving about each other across the sky, but as a pack and then disappeared.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15901.html|146|ndxe200101| Several orange lights moving about each other across the sky, but as a pack and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a police officer and was on duty when my radio operator sent me a message in my squad computer indicating they were receiving numerous 911 calls about lights in the sky and ufo&#39;s in my area that I was working and asked if I could see anything.  I was on a traffic stop at the time and was stationary, when I looked into the north east sky and saw very clearly, 4 orange, bright lights that formed a diamond or box shape.  The lights were constant, not flickering, and were drifting to the east. The lights then drifted together as a unit either behind a cloud or they just went out because it appeared as though they kind of fizzled out like a flare going out or as if they were going behind cloud cover.  Immediately after this event, I scanned the sky looking for additonal objects and noticed a cluster of 9 additional lights that again, were moving in a pack but these lights were moving independant of each other and creating different geometric shapes.  I had a pair of field glasses in my squad and viewed the lights. I was unable to see any structure between the lights or anything hanging or connected to them.  Over the course of about 10-15 minutes, this cluster of lights which seemed to rotate and move about each other, drifted east in the sky never gaining or losing altitude and when it reached the same spot as the first cluster, the lights all one at a time seemed to &#34;burn out&#34;.  Traffic was heavy and there was alot of noise at my location (perryville rd at newburg rd looking northeast) so I could not hear any noise that these objects may have been making.  The objects moved slow like they were drifting.  I had my radio operator contact the airport to verify if these objects were visable on radar and the airport indicated they could not detect anything in that area.  After the event, I spoke with another officer who also saw them and was about 4 miles north west of my location and he explained that he saw the same series of events but to the south which indicates the lights passed between us somewhere! between Springbrook rd. and Newburg rd. from the north to south and traveled in an eastward dirction.<n>

I first saw a group of 7 that were moving slowly, but not falling -- they were moving laterally.  After a few minutes, a number of Rockford residents (hundreds) had pulled off the side of the road to watch the phenomenon.  There was also a second group of about 18 circles that appeared and began moving east.  Our local police department had over 100 calls, and the local news and TV media still have not determined what caused the lights. The lights were just below cloud level (which was high that night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the correct date should be 11JA01.  PD))<n>

Then it struck me that the lights were rather bright and the dipper is not orange, besides this being the wrong time of the year for it. I watched the lights for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes trying to get some kind of clue to what the were. The lights were moving from west to east at a rather slow rate of speed so I didn&#39;t take them for aircraft. The sky was mostly cloudy and the lights occasionally moved through one of these cloud banks. I didn&#39;t hear any aircraft noises and the lights seemed to be moving rather aimlessly along their path anyway. I would have taken them for a group of hot air balloons except I don&#39;t think anyone would be crazy enough to take balloons that high at night in the middle of a January night. The lights were circling each other and changing formations rather aimlessly as they headed east. There were no aircraft in pursuit of these lights nor did any chase while I watched them. If these were extra-terrestrials they obviously had a few beverages during their pit stop on Earth. I finally got in my car to head home to see if I could get my wife to see these but they disappeared from my sight about five minutes after I started driving. I&#39;m not one to put a lot of credence in reports of LGM&#39;s and abductions and those types of things but I sure would like to find out what these were because I&#39;ve never seen anything like them before.<n>

((NUFORC Note:  We think is should be 11JA01.  Date indicated above is correct.  PD)) Then we saw 9 others in in 3 lines, one line of 4 balls, one of 3, and one of 2. they appeared closer and therefore larger, in relation to the first bunch. They moved at a steady pace in different directions and at times,flew very near one another. while watching these lights move, the first cluster gradually dissapeared. The second group countinued to move and at times would change light intensity. a couple seemed to stop moving, and the others behind countinued to move forward and pass up the stopped lights. They at times appeard to form shapes like a square or triangle; but it didn&#39;t look intentional. There was no sound as far as I could hear, but I was standing next to a busy road. As I continued to watch the orange shpearic shapes move through the sky they began to fade away and then come back; until some compleatly disapeard.<n>

There were about 18 of these objects aloft in the night sky changing in geometrical shapes. And before the last one vanished it also changed to the color green. On the news some &#34;experts&#34; said that they were a result of sun eruputions. And on another channel they said it was a strange weather pattern. ((name deleted))....Age 18<n>

I hardly expected to receive a &#34;personal&#34; reply,<n> <n><n> particularly so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, anyway.  To address your questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ALTITUDE<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude was guestimated based on a hypthetical or presumed size of the<n> <n><n> targets.  In other words a 4&#39; or 3&#39; lighted object at approximately 1500&#39;<n> <n><n> might appear not as a pinpoint but a larger light point, yet not as large<n> <n><n> enough to be definable as a vehicle or airship.  I realize size and distance<n> <n><n> are difficult to estimate, particularly at night when there is nothing to<n> <n><n> calibrate with.  But if you visualized a very tiny aircraft at a very high<n> <n><n> pattern altitude that would be consistent with the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OTHER OBSERVERS<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with a group of 20 to 30 people.  Apparently the sighting had been<n> <n><n> going on for several minutes.  I was called outside to join the group for<n> <n><n> the last 5 to 8 minutes of the sighting.  At that time all of the points of<n> <n><n> light became extinguished.  There was much discussion and there has been<n> <n><n> much subsequent discussion.  The 3 local TV stations are collecting many<n> <n><n> observations and theories.  The sighting included perhaps 1000 or more<n> <n><n> people in the area.  There are reports of sightings from outside the local<n> <n><n> area but it is difficult for me to believe that we are all talking about the<n> <n><n> same sighting.  Numerous amateur videos exist of this particular sighting so<n> <n><n> comparison can no doubt be performed.  You may receive other reports; your<n> <n><n> web site was mentioned by one of the TV stations which is why I decided to<n> <n><n> file this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WINDS<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surface winds were calm.  I&#39;m not sure how to obtain past observations for<n> <n><n> winds aloft.  You may be able to do that for the date/time that I specified<n> <n><n> for RFD.  I would expect winds aloft at 3,000 to somewhat correlate with<n> <n><n> what we appeared to observe, e.g. a movement from SW to NE over a period of<n> <n><n> several minutes.  Interestingly the RFD airport is located approximately 6<n> <n><n> miles SW of the position where this observation occurred.  Direction of<n> <n><n> movement would have placed the path prior to our sighting somewhere in the<n> <n><n> vicinity of the airport.  If my theory is correct a possible point of origin<n> <n><n> would be from rural areas south of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BINOCULARS<n> <n><n> <n><n> No binoculars or other viewing aids were available.  Sightings were<n> <n><n> unsupplemented naked eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FUEL SOURCE<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fuel source is a hypothesis based on color and apparent behavior, e.g.<n> <n><n> yellow color, reasonably constant intensity with occasional minor<n> <n><n> flickering.  An observation that may have some significance is that the<n> <n><n> light or flame of each target appeared to diminish before it died out, one<n> <n><n> by one much as if whatever might be burning was ultimately consumed.  During<n> <n><n> the time that I observed, all targets eventually disappeared at an average<n> <n><n> of 1 minute intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this is helpful.  It will be interesting to triangulate various<n> <n><n> reports.  All the best,  ((NAME DELETED))<n>

So the blue fireball was seen in Pueblo aroun 8:45pm then was spotted at 9:30 near Kimball, Sidney, Chadron and in the Denver area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the witness that there may have been more than one object, and at different times.  We would like to receive reports from anyone who witnessed the object(s) on this date.  PD))<n>

I knocked on my friends window to show him, at first we thought it might have been 3 helicopters flying in formation 1 above each other with the centre light being of to the left, which caused like a unequal triangle effect. The centre light then appeared to move to the right and line up with the other 2 making a verticle straight line. The top light of the 3 suddenly went out like a light bulb would. The other 2 kept on flashing and staying in line with each other. Then i noticed a faint light beam pulsing from the top 1 of the 2. the light travelled upwards and then to the side and finally to the bottom light, this occured about 3 times. then both objects went out as the first 1 had this all happened in about 2 minutes. the sky was generally clear of cloud. has i walked home i kept my eye on the sky for further sightings but to no avail. the walk from my friends takes about 4 minutes.<n>

The kids walked off but me and my husband stayed and watched it as we thought it may be a weather ballon or a hot air balllon.We then thought it couldnt be a air ballon as it was static in the sky and it was dark and it couldnt be a weather ballon because of what happeneed next. The object then moved very quickly maybe 200-300 miles per hour in a straight line and as we watched it seemed to change shape in to a squashed diamond. We lost sight of it but new what we had seen was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I beleive to this date it was some sort of surveillance object either government or Extra Teresteral.<n>

Was looking towards Port Angelos and saw a configuration of lights moving west that was approximately in the shape of the Great Bear Star System.  This configuration of lights was moving towards the west at about 1 degree of angle per second and because it was directly over Port Angelos about 1 degree above the city center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because the whole configuration was moving in a united fashion with the shape of the configuration not changing I don&#39;t think I was confusing the lights with those of moving vehicles.  This lasted about 5 minutes and fortunately I had 8 power magnification binoculars with me so I checked by examining the configuration through my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being very jubilant I proceeded back to my condo on the 23rd floor of Orchard House, Victoria, and went out on the balcony.  This was about 25 minutes later than the first sightings.  I sensed three consective flashes of light originating from the sky S.S.W. and about 30 degrees above the horizon.  I sensed at the same time as these flashes a subtle current going through my body.  Was expecting a ship to appear but was disappointed that one didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/10/01 19:36|Friendship|WI|Formation|15 minutes|From Friendship, Wisconsin, bright orange lights seen in eastern sky below full moon on 1/10/01.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15864.html|170|ndxe200101| From Friendship, Wisconsin, bright orange lights seen in eastern sky below full moon on 1/10/01.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I saw what appeared to be AT LEAST five bright orange lights at a considerable distance of perhaps several miles in the eastern sky toward the full moon but only about 1/2 as high up in the sky. These lights appeared to be ascending southward at a steep angle, were about as bright as Venus (which was in the western sky), and appeared about the same &#34;size&#34; as Venus. They only appeared for about a second or two and then faded out, one at a time. They were spaced somewhat equidistantly from each other. When one was fading, another was increasing in intensity. I counted five in one short interval of time; however, there appeared to be more similar lights (southward) through the clouds and treetops as we turned and proceeded to go to our home about 1/4 mile south. I called this observation into the Sheriff&#39;s Department (Adams County, Wisconsin) and then went back outside to see if we could see anything else. We saw what appeared to be two very fast strobe lights, probably on two jets, coming from the south. These &#34;lights&#34; circled the area where the orange lights had appeared and then headed back south. We saw the orange lights at 7:36 p.m. and the strobe lights were last seen at 7:51 p.m. this evening. We have never seen anything similar to this before.  So far this morning,January 11th, we have not heard any reports of others sighting these lights.<n>

Several long stream blinking lights. I was bewildered<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my living room window which overlooks terrific views of San Gabriel Mountains, 6;20pm. I noticed a helicopter hovering in a still position in front of the house clsoer towards the 134 West freeway are. AAttempting to shine its spot light upward into the sky at something. Then noticed an object approaching helicopter it appeared to be very elongated/ tubular/ cigar shapped with one long stream of white strobe blinking lights from front end to back end. Moving right towards helicopter/ helicopter fled and flew away extremely quickly. I maintained my visual sight of this craft for about 2-3 more minutes until it got so far away, i couldn&#39;t see it anymore.It flew in an up and down position as it wa fyling away. I saw the color of some of it. Dark Grey. No Wings, No extra lights, no other colors of light except one small red light on back end of the tube shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found her to be extremely credible and convincing.  We contacted the Pasadena Police Air Unit, whose jurisdiction this area is in, and, due to bad weather on this date,  they had helicopters in the air for only 26 minutes.  The illustration submitted by the witness is reminiscent of a Hughes 500 helicopter, which has a distinctive egg-shaped fuselage.  We would like to talk to the crew of the helicopter.  A similar sighting was reported from Woodland, CA, several days earlier, we understand from the witness.  PD))<n>

It seemed to have lights at each tip indicating a possible triangular shape-- however, we weren&#39;t underneath it so it was hard to tell. What caught our attention though was how it moved: It seemed to be moving faster than a normal airplane. It made large circles in the sky for some odd reason, then it headed northwards and crossed Bellingham Bay, rather fast I might mention, and then we noticed that there was another light up there with it-- by this time though they were pretty far away. That&#39;s it. Also, when it was closest to us it appeared to by quite long, and dark black too, it seemed to be larger than a plane should be from that distance.<n>

I watched the object until returning to the farm that I drive a delivery truck from. I thought at first of a meteor but there was no tail involved. I also thought about an aircraft yet there was no jet stream coming from it. When I returned to the farm I told my bosses girlfriend to take a look at it. Her daughter and she and I  looked at it out the back window. We got a pair of binoculors to try to get a better view of it as we could not tell what it was. on closer examionation with the binoculars we still had no idea. It was red like it was on fire and a cigar shape to it. We did not see any blinking lights or anything that made it look like a plane. ( I thought it may be a plane with the sun setting reflecting off of it) The object was traveling horizontally in the southwest direction.<n>

Briefly I can tell you this was in broad day light, I was comming back from Lowell MA with my friend and co-worker heading down 495 south. Traffic was pretty heavy so I was driving slow.  We were about in Berlin MA when my eyes started to drift and then became fixed on an object that was off in the distance, I stayed with the confersation that my friend and I were having when I knoticed that the object was comming closer to the high- way at a very strange angle and speed.  It was going very slow and very low.  It got so close that I finally became unable to talk, my friend noticed what I was looking at and both of us were in complete awe.  I remember realizing that about 100 people in traffic must be looking at this same object. By this moment is so close I can actually see the strange details on it&#39;s underside.  Im serious when I say it huvered from quite some distance away and ended up comming so close that even my friend who is an athiest admitted that it was nothing that he had ever seen.  There&#39;s alot more too this , Im an architectural AutoCAD drafter by trade and as soon I was in front if my computer I drafted what I and others saw .  Please get back with me so I can elaborate more , because I think I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that what I saw was not manufactured by a human being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -I have a very descriptive Draft of what this object looked like, because I was able to use AutoCAD (Computer Aided Drafting)to draw this, it is a very good representation of what I saw. Everything is cemetrical as I saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

It hovered for about 3-4 mins. at approximately 500-700ft above the tree lines and highway below. Traffic on the highway below was moving rapidly but other motorists must have noticed this object just from it&#39;s sheer brilliance. After hovering for some time the object proceeded to move slowly West following Hwy.20 below. Stopped and proceeded East along the higway slowly at first then gatering speed as it proceeded East. As the object moved it left a trail infront and behind of the craft. As it moved it also changed shape, from cigar shaped to saucer shaped.<n>

I noticed off to the left some lights in the sky. They appeared to be staionery over open field.  I kept my eyes focused on the two lights until I had passed.  The lights were side by side.  They were easy to see since the sky was dark at such an early hour.  They were so distinct.  They just sat there.  The lights were facing west and I was heading east.  I saw this twice.  I would say a week later possibly later.  The exact same thing.  Two stationery lights.  I had never been so awed.  There were no flashing lights, no random movemtents.  They looked like a set of head lights in the sky.  I have never seen anything like that.<n>
1/10/01 05:13|Arden|NC|Cigar|30 secs|High SPeed Cigar Shaped Object - Sky Turning  Brighter Than Noon for 1000 Miles For Over 20 Secs|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31667.html|179|ndxe200101| High SPeed Cigar Shaped Object - Sky Turning  Brighter Than Noon for 1000 Miles For Over 20 Secs<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have the news footage talking about this night... was mentioned right after the discussion of the loss of the Mars Lander crashing into the surfice.  At 5:13 that moonless night was walking out to get the mail... was facing the S/W sky.  I saw the sky was lighting up on the holizon... was as bright as if an atomic bomb had hit Atlanta 400 miles away... the light came towards me, and looking up saw that that were 2 clouds over my head and they were so fully charged with electrical energy you could see plasma like activity on the clouds.  The light in the sky continued to get brighter and wider till the whole sky was illuminated.  As the intensity increased i was able to look around and saw street lights turning off, and could view objects far away as if were high noon.  The light was not coming from any one location... rather the whole sky was as if suspended in cloud to cloud lightening.  The intensity after 15 secs was so bright -- that it was actually brighter than high noon on a sunny day.  The light was odd... made everything appear the wrong color.  Some pine trees near me appeared blue.... a blue shit was wearing had a green tint.. was like a the lighting a &#34;black lite&#34; gives... all had that odd tint to it.  Well 15 secs after the lighting had built to a peek saw moving across the sky at a VERY high rate of speed a cigar shape object...  the object appeared like something out of a 1950s B grade movie.  It had a metalic look to it... like a needle on the end.  It looked cheaply made .. but the speed was one of the fastest objects ever seen cross the sky and am aware this could have distorted my perception of the shape.  From the back appeared to be sparks like a fake spaceship would release in a B grade movie.  I lost site as the objected entered clouds behind me.  The sky remained illuminated for another say 10 secs. You could see the light receeding behind the object and vanishing back into the edge of the N.E. sky line.  About 5 mins later 3 fighter craft passed over and ! was obvious they were following the object and they vanished in the same area of the sky as this object had vanished towards slighly before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The offical news report said the object was seen from Montgomery Al. to past Asheville N.C. by 1000&#39;s.  The offical news release went on to say that while hundreds of calls were made to police and sherrif&#39;s depts across the flight path, that it was believed to be a meterior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While i saw no signs of any course correction... and as fast as the object was moving realize i cannot swear to the appearance... what has struck me odd all this time was a few things:  1.  The amount of EM energy that it would take to produce this much lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  The lighting in the sky came BEFORE the object by at least 10 - 15 secs at the peek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  Watching the clouds... the plasma moving on the edges was so odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  The craft was actually the least amazing part of the siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.  Aircraft do not chase meteriors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish i had been able to take EM / mag readings during the passover or gotten some video footage of the event.  If you are curious have the WLOS TV news coverage with some police officers talking about it on this night and how freaky it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked and never got a reasonable explanation to why the lighting came so long before the ~whatever it was~ and just how much energy it would take to excite what i assume is the ionasphere during this siting to be so bright for such a duration over so wide an area as this was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At ab|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16379.html|186|ndxe200101| On a road in between Sonderborg and Graasten in Denmark, on the way to work at the parent Danish firm that I work for in the USA. At about 45-60 degrees from the horizon, on a very dark morning (prior to sunrise) I spotted a huge perfectly shaped rectangular object glowing with white light. It was startling since this is a rural area and their are no large buildings nor large lights of any kind even close to this area of Denmark. I pointed this object out to both the driver (a Dane) and another American in the back seat. As we continued to drive to work we all searched for expanations for what we were seeing, with no clue whatsoever. We observed this object for about 5-6 minutes at which time it seemed to collapse from both the top and bottom (long sides of the rectangle) while still maintaining a clearly defined shape, until it vanished. The Dane who was driving was just as flabergasted as we were at this sight and checked the local radio and television news shows, as well as newspapers for any reports, but their were none. We also noted at the time that the position of the moon made it impossible to make it any type of reflection or moonglow through the clouds. We also tracked the position of the moon the remainder of the week while travelling the same route to work, and each day it was not even remotely close to where we had seen this object. We were also unable to find any other witnesses to this event. We also observed what appeared to be an unusual amount of military aircraft activity in the daylight skies the remainder of the week.<n>
1/8/01 21:00|Fulton|AR|Oval|1.5 hrs|I was watching this oval object from my house on a full moon night and the sky was clear as it appeared to change to red and green.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15837.html|187|ndxe200101| I was watching this oval object from my house on a full moon night and the sky was clear as it appeared to change to red and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this date a @ 21:00 hrs me and my father in law were taking the garbage down the drive and I noticed a bright round light approx 200 feet above the tree line.  I asked my father in law if he sees that light and he said no only the tower with red lights I told him to look left of that  and he then saw it and said he didn&#39;t know what it was and went home.  I went into my home and got my video camera and binoculars.  It was a full moon and everything was bright,  so I put my camera on low light setting and could not see anything with the camera.  I then got my binoculars and could clearly see a roundish bright object that had been hovering in the same place for approximately 25 min.  On occassion it had changed color from bright white to green to redish orange.  This whole time the object never moved.  I noticed movement  @ 2130 in a downward vertical movement until it got into the tree line, then it moved southeast in the tree line and I lost sight of it.  I went in and called the hempstead county S.O. and the miller county SO  and asked if anyone had reported a light over or around the town of Fulton, Arkansas.  they both said no.  I went to the door approx 10 min later and saw the light out again but it was now what appeared to be over the small town of Fulton or in that area.  I watched it with my binocs and watched an airplane vear off its flight path and fly towards the light. After the plane came near and made an upward left banking turn the object again changed colors and went into the tree line and started moving south southeast.  The airplane continued to circle the area for approx, 15 min and then flew toward the town of Texarkana, Arkansas.  There is a minimum sized regional airport there, and my house is in the flight path of may planes.  I live on top of a hill in a rural community and have seen planes turning with their landing and wing lights on, and in fact the plane tonight had his/hers on for a while, when circling over the tree tops in the approx area the light dissapeared.  The second sighting lasted only 10 min and I came back and and called both SO&#39;s again and made a report.  The Miller County SO had sent deputied that way but did not see anything.  I explained that the main reason I called back was seein the airplane circle and look for the light and flew back toward their airport.  I thought maybe the pilot would report it or the radar control person. I am an 34 w/m and have a degree in psychology and another degree in nursing.  I am an emergency room nurse and am open to all things.  I do not drink alcohol, and only take prescribed medication.  I do not use glasses to read or see.  I have a daughter who is 3 yrs old and a wife who is 33 yrs old.  My wife saw the object only for a moment during the second sighting but did watch the plane circle with wing and landing lights on.  I was a army officer for eight years,but am no longer in the military.  My father in law is 55 yrish old  and does not drink alcohol or take medication.  He is retired from the army.   My mother in law was in the car when he saw the light but I am not sure she observed the object. The object appeared only to move in verticle and horizontal directions.  It could change directions quickly.  Once during the second sighting the object appeared to zig zag for a couple of second while changing colors before moving south east and out of sight into the tree line. I am amazed that my video camera would not pick up the bright light on such a clear full moon night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not state explicitly what direction they were looking.  However, it they were looking to the southeast, the first possibility to be eliminated would be the star, Sirius.  PD))<n>

I was heading almost due south. I noticed a shooting star, but this was not run of the mill, I drive truck on a 12 hour night shift 1700 - 0500 and see lots of shooting stars and i usually check for active times (showers) on the internet.The one I saw this night was different in all respects...size, brilliance, colors and proximity in the sky. I had visual contact for 1.5 seconds or so. It was a brilliant white ball with a blue and tuquoise type of halo around the core following back to the tail. The tail was impressive. It was a bluish and turquoise color but what was unique, it had two tails of smimilar thickness and length. It was at about 50 degrees above my visible horizon and pased very quickly from east to west then faded like a regular run of the mill falling star.  It seemed to be closer to the earth with more of an arc in it&#39;s flight trajectory. Size about a dime at arms lentgh. What really struck me was it&#39;s beauty as it passed. When we got to our destination I asked the driver in the lead truck if he had seen it, He got a bit enthusiastic about it and remarked on the brillinace and the many colors and stated it was kinda pretty wans&#39;t it. The reason I decided to post this is i was listening to KOA in Denver and callers were calling in reporting an almost identical event this date some three days after my sighting. I do not blieve it was a UFO in the extraterrestrial sense but a metrorite or deorbiting satellite. I won&#39;t forget this one soon.<n>

I observed what appeared to be very bright star. I traveled along with me as I headed toward Antelope valley. I had seen this thing the previous night. I talked to my friend who said he saw it last night. So I drove to his house in Antelope Valley. It followed me all the way there . When I stopped at my friends house. It stopped too. I ran to my friends door. To show him. He went outside and observed the bright light. We were pretty freaked out. After that I began to drive aroud in Antelope Valley. Every direction I went the light followed. At first I believed it was a planet. And my eyes were playing tricks on me. I stopped at the Antelope Valley Kwik Shop. It followed. From there I went to the Antelope Valley Park. The light followed. It began to dim then get real bright. I ran to the top of a hill located in the park were I observed the light for 5 minutes. Were it remained motionless. As I headed back down to my car the light started to come closer. I started running towards my car. I was scared. I drove to the Antelope Valley Kwik Shop to use a payphone . As I pulled up My friend _____ pulled up I hopped in his car and pointed toward the light following me. I questioned my sanity here. Was I just seeing it. No. I showed my friend _____the light. I told him it was following me. He did not believe me tell we proceded into Gillette to a friends house. It followed at high speeds.  We stopped at Eagles Nest Apartments at a friends house. ____ and I ran inside to show our fiends the light. It was hovering motionless about 3 miles above Flying J a gas station. We left the apartment to go visit friends that live about two miles out of town on echeta road. The light followed. On the way out we saw a fire department blazer parked on the side of the road observing the light. We proceded on echeta to a friends house. It still followed. Now we were really freaking out. We pulled up to our friends house. It followed tell we stopped our car. It then stopped and remained about 20 miles away from us just hovering in the sky. We ran into our friends hot tub room. I told them what we saw. They didn&#39;t believe me. So we took them outside. My two friends both saw it. We observed the light with binoculars. It was the strangest thing It was  and had bright white lights aroud the border of the craft. All of us observed the lights. I decided we should all drive in my friends car to see if the thing would follow us again. My other friends were skeptical. We left and proceded farther down echeta road. It followed once again. We drove about 10 miles down the road. It kept right up with us. We stopped the car. It stopped. My friend that was driving got scared and turned around. It followed. As we headed toward the direction of our friends house with the hot tub room. We observed another light that looked exactly like the one we had jus seen. That was behind us still following us. In a sec the new light appeared to have dissappeared. About  a minute later all four of us observed a red light with blinking strobes lighting up aroud the red light in a circular motion. We stopped the car and went outside of the vehicle It flew right over our heads. The other light we had been chasing was still behind us following we went back tho the house with the hot tub. As we pulled up two other friends were leaving the house we were going to. We told them a u.f.o was following us. They didn&#39;t believ us. We told them too follow us to the house. Went went up the driveway to the house. We showed them the light with binoculars.  i observed the light once again with binoculars It appeared to be changing shapes and colors. It had a current of electricity running   between two lights. The current had a rainbow aura. Two other friend showed up. They saw it too. IT was getting kind of boring observing it for so long . It was just hovering there. We went to the shop and started talking I kept leaving to check if it was still there. It was. I checked every 10 to 15 minutes. It pretty much stayed the same until . I went for another check It was now a reddish hue and really close to the ground. I above the craft about 2 miles was two blinking strobe looking lights . They were alot smaller in comparison to the red light. I looked  at these lights with binoculars. It was a giant triangular shape. It was huge compared to the other light. I showed everyone there. After about ten minutes I went to call kaml radio station. I went to check if it was still out there it was gone this was at 10:30 at ninght. That is what happenend. I have many witnesses to testify and pictures. I am are devoleping them today. It was the strangest thing that I have ever seen. I will e-mail photos as soon as possible<n>

We watched for a few seconds, and the lights totally disappeared, as though behind a cloud.  The trajectory was from the Northeast.  We had the impression the lights were getting closer because the distance between the two lights in the front increased.  These were not falling stars, as the trajectory appeared to parallel the earth, rather than descend to the earth.  The lights were 15-20 times brighter than the brightest of stars (closer to the size of car headlights at a distance).  There was no noise associated with the lights. The speed of the lights was much faster than that of an ordinary airplane. We do not know how long the lights had been visible before we chanced looking up to see them. I did not see an object, but my neighbor sensed there was an object associated with the lights.<n>

I looked up to see what I originally thought were airplane lights traveling North, but they seemed too high for our proximity to the airport.  Then, I noted that the light appeared to be moving too fast to be an airplane that high.  Just before it disappeared behind the top of one of the buildings, the light faded out like a meteorite would and was gone. The light appeared to be generally round in shape. There were at least two colors as if it were landing lights, but they were not spread out like landing lights on a jumbo jet. I suppose it could have been a small, private jet heading for a landing.  That would explain why it appeared to be too high and fast to be a jumbo jet.  But, then, why did the lights fade out?<n>

To the unaided eye, it seemed motionless but with binoculars it was moving in relationship to the stars.  We first noticed it just under Orion&#39;s Belt heading towards Gemini.  With binoculars, it was a vibrant red light with no distinguishable features; just a beautiful red.  It was as bright as Jupiter.  As it passed between Castor and Pollax, it then turned 90 degrees to the East, began blinking, accelerated and then vanished.  I was observing it as it vanished and I&#39;m certain that it didn&#39;t disappear into a cloud bank or anything since I could still see stars.  It was a single point of light; no other lights were present.  I am an amateur astronomer and have witness many things in the Heavens, but this was the strangest event so far in my life.<n>

Pulling the curtains closed for the night I looked out and into the the sky over the cascades. I do this habitually as we live under a commercial flight path and on a clear night you can sometimes see several commercial craft stacked &amp; staggered. Low in the sky at an altitude of what my eyes told me was just a small cesna was a very bright erratically flashing light that seemed to be jumping up &amp; down and from side and heading West sraight towards us! Yelled for my wife to come see. Stepped out the door &amp; watched as it turned to the South and was obscured by the trees. This light was moving right along but I wouldn&#39;t say it was going faster than a conventional craft. A few weeks before this a navy jet, think they call them A6&#39;s flew over the valley only showing ulta bright strobs on the wing tips. This jet was so low you could not discern it from the trees untill it zoomed dirctly overhead. I thought at the time somebody must have thought it to be a ufo. It sure lit up the sky in an eerie way. This might explain the unidentified light I saw. OH yes, the flashing light made no sound I could hear.<n>

I have read alot about the &#34;string of pearls&#34; exhaust contrails left by possible expieramental aircraft. Tonight,,we witnessed 2 contrails alongside each other,,demonstrating the &#34;string of pearls&#34; type exhaust. Behind them aprox. 3 miles was a &#34;chase&#34; plane. The three crafts where heading from the south,very high altitude,towards Seattle,,&#34;Madigan&#34;. Lead aircraft had not lights,,,chase plane had white flashing lights. Thought you might be interested. There is a site that really wanted to hear about any sightings like this,,although now I can&#39;t locate it.. Take Care Joe<n>

I came out of my workshop where I was playing guitar into the night.  I looked outside to the hills and saw a shimmering light then as I watched for several minuetes the light decended benenth the  hillside.  then ascended then descended.  Much more followed. I saw a red light in the sky.  This is not the first time I saw a red light hovering.  In 1992 or so I saw a red light fly right over my head about 200 Ft at this same address.  It was silent, glowing red and moving about 5 miles an hour, I would say.  It was about 50 ft in diameter.  I saw it coming over the same hills that I saw this tonight.  I think they are still here.  When I came in to write this the light moved to an illuminated tower, where there wasn&#39;t a light before.  The light I was staring at previous was gone.  It moved to the tower. Hey, I wrote to the editor before.  Can you ask him to reply?. I haven&#39;t seen a ufo since 1992.  But today marks a new turn of events. I think this is real. ((name deleted)); I am scared of who this could be. but at the same time I envite them. but I really am scared. thanks. ((name deleted))<n>

They appearred to have six red lights or red glowing power sources on the bottom of the craft. Initially they flew in a horizontal pattern with the red glowing portion parallel to the ground similar to what one would see with a military aircraft with afterburners on. The craft then stopped abruptly and turned 90 degrees so the the &#34;afterburners&#34; were facing downward toward the ground. The craft were lost from view when the went behind a hill.<n>

Then all at once we could hear some noise like a computer would sound when connecting to the internet, it was deafening.  We ran inside to call the cops and came back out and they had gone.  We have seen them often about every three weeks now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  To the best of our knowledge, we have not received other reports from this part of Kansas for this date, or the earlier alleged dates.

A second later it speed off to the right (going south) really fast. It was really high in the sky, I think. It at first looked like a comet, but I would have heard of it, they don&#39;t come that close to earth, and when it speed of it apeared to be a shooting star. I think it had a greenish tint to it when it moved, not when it &#34;exploded&#34; though. It all happened sort of fast, but I can not explain it. I have saw another ufo a year or so ago, but I did not report it. But I would really like to know if any one else saw it/ what it is.<n>

This light started very small and was very bright. I was driving about 65 mph, I rolled down the window, it was pretty warm. After Willis road the light was &#34;nickel&#34; sized at arms length and at &#34;eleven o&#39;clock&#34; above my side view mirror. At the Weigh Station (it was open), the light was at &#34;nine o&#39;clock&#34;, half-dollar sized, very bright. Suddenly, it shot straight up, leaving a bright streak on my eye, it was gone. It dissappeared, it didn&#39;t fade out. It kind of freaked me out, I felt scared and very emotional. It felt like a couple of seconds, but it was at least 3-4 miles of driving at 65mph? As I was watching I noticed partly cloudy conditions, with clear above that. A couple of planes at average altitudes with blinking lights were coming from east and west. I kept expecting to see airplane lights on this light. From several angles there were no other lights or form. At the brightest, this light had a dark band in the middle that could be seen. Upon driving back past this area, Waterloo Recreation area, I noticed that it is a particularly dark area (between Ann Arbor and Jackson) no towers or airports in this area. Did anyone else see this?<n>

We slowed down and then stopped along side the highway about one half mile after initally spotting the light to get a better look. The light was a steady red color like the top light on the communications tower except there were fainter secondary lights. The unknown light was somewhat further from the highway and appeared to be about twice as big. Upon stopping and watching for a few seconds the object accelerated incredibly fast to the South at very high rate of speed changing from a steady red to a blinking orange light with dimmer secondary lights of red and white. The object traveled a distance of two or three miles in a matter of a few seconds and shortly after disappeared from sight.<n>

THE SKY WAS STILL BLUE WITH A HIGH CLOUD OR TWO REFLECTING ORANGE   COLOR ON THE CLOUDS.    I OBSERVED A BRIGHT OBLONG  OBJECT MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A METEORITE WITH A TAIL ON IT MOVING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE.      I  PULLED MY CAR INTO A PARKING LOT TO WATCH IT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES OR SO. THE OBJECT WAS MOVING ABOUT THE SPEED OF AN AIRPLANE. AS I WATCHED IT, THERE WERE OTHER AIRPLANES MOVING AROUND WITH LANDING LIGHTS ON AND I COMPARED THE OBJECT TO THE AIRPLANES.  THE AIRPLANES LOOKED DARK EVEN WITH THEIR LANDING LIGHTS ON AGAINST THE BLUE SKY.   I SAW NO WINGS ON THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE FLYING MUCH HIGHER THAN THE AIRPLANES AND WAS TOTALLY COVERED WITH A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,  NOTHING LIKE THE AIRPLANES I OBSERVED.    THE OBJECT MOVED COMPLETELY ACROSS THE SKY IN ABOUT 7 OR 8 MINUTES, FROM OVER BAYTOWN TO HOUSTON, AND THEN SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP AND THEN START MOVING AGAIN.  THE OBJECT FLYING AS HIGH AS IT WAS,  SEEMED TWICE AS LARGE COMPARED TO THE AIRPLANES FLYING AT A LOWER ALTITUDE.     IT ALSO SEEMED TO ME THAT THE SUN MIGHT HAVE BEEN REFLECTING ON THE OBJECT BECAUSE THE OBJECT MAINTAINED IT&#39;S BRIGHTNESS WITH A SLIGHT ORANGE COLOR THE ENTIRE TIME I OBSERVED IT. THE OBJECT DID NOT LEAVE ANY VAPOR TRAIL LIKE A HIGH FLYING PLANE MIGHT DO.    THE OBJECT FLEW INTO A SMALL ORANGE CLOUD AND EMERGED A MINUTE LATER AND THEN SEEMED TO CHANGE DIRECTION TO THE SOUTH.    I LIVE ABOUT 30 MILES EAST OF HOUSTON AND THIS OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER HOUSTON TEXAS THE LAST TIME I OBSERVED IT. THE OBJECT STOOD OUT BECAUSE OF IT&#39;S BRIGHTNESS.     I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS AN AIRPLANE AFTER  COMPARING THE PLANES TO IT.   IT LOOKED ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THE PLANES.  I HAD TO STOP WATCHING IT BECAUSE I HAD TO PICK UP MY GRANDDAUGHTER FROM THE LIBRARY AT 6:00 PM.<n>

Was visible to traffic going north and south on Route 50 in the Town of Ballston Lake, Saratoga County, State of New York. Initially the appearance was similar to a military craft coming down for a landing, but as you approached it you could see the craft was hovering and not propelling forward. The craft appeared to have a central nose like the tip of a B-17 but without propellers. A central large light at the tip surrounded by a ring of lights further down the cylinder. What appeared to be wings were rows of white lights on the sides of this cone....appeared something like this... 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0( 0 )0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0 this being the center as I approached the craft, at a snails pace driving, I could see the shape of the craft was not an airplane but a disk....shaped like a teardrop or like the shell of a horseshoecrab. I drove directly under it and saw that the remainder of the craft was not lit. I drove up about 30 yards and turned around to take a second look, it was gone.<n>

I looked up and saw a object, very quiet, and I was wondering what kinda plane would be so quiet.  Not only so quiet, but also, very close to the ground.  The more I thought about it the more I realized it wasn&#39;t a plane at all, and I can only guess that it was a UFO.  It went south about a block, turned around, went in a circle like, and then came towards me.  Stopped, then took off north and disappeared.<n>

On my return home is when I witnessed something I can&#39;t clearly explain. I&#39;m not certain what it was I saw, and would love for you to respond to inform me what I saw was a series of meteorites burning up in the atmosprere or a formation of non-conventional aircraft. However, whatever it was, wasn&#39;t of the norm. I&#39;ve tried to dispell what I saw as not what it appeared to be, but I can&#39;t let it go. In summation, I hope the following will help to determine what I witnessed in the western skies of Oklahoma. I was traveling generally west into the setting sun on the Chickasaw Turnpike just on the outskirts of Ada, Oklahoma. It takes roughly 15 minutes to drive from begining to end of the before mentioned roadway. I was approximately two minutes into the first part of the turnpike when I noticed three strangely shaped objects suspended in the sky. My first thought was thin clouds reflecting the setting sun. Still driving and annalyzing these objects I noticed what appeared to be in a formation. One following the other. Maybe a quarter of a mile seperating one fron the other. Further, what was once three was now four. My next guess involved some type of aircraft. I pulled the car to the side of the highway to see wether or not the objects I was seeing were moving or not. After coming to a complete stop I exited my vehicle and stood on the side of the road. Whatever these things were, they were definately moving and moving quick. Like I said, I was travelling west. These objects were moving from the northwest going to the southeast. Driving an hour both ways to work everyday, a person sees a lot of planes flying on the horizon. These looked like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen. From my viewpoint, the two nearest objects were throwing what appeared to be flame hundreds of feet behind them. Also, they moved from a speck on the horizon to possibly a half-mile away to completely out of site within minutes. My last thoughts before the objects suddenly vanished from site, was they could be some type of meteorite or space debri plummeting to the Earth. This thought was a litle scary. I like to watch the Discovery Channel and have seen severel documentries showing what type of damage an object hitting the Earth can do. I attempted to find out some kind of news about just such a thing the rest of my journey home with no such luck. I then spent the weekend wondering if television would report some type of occurence. Once again the answer was no. I don&#39;t know what I saw. I&#39;m asking you. I&#39;m not some mental case who makes up things either. I have a steady career and a solid home life. I don&#39;t drink or do drugs. To my knowledge, neither am I insane. Please respond.<n>

From a distance, driving east on Indiana 45, I saw a bright yellow light with a white light, not as bright, next to it [on the same craft] hovering in the sky. There were tiny red lights on top, none on the belly. As I rounded a bend [between Bloomington and New Unionville, Indiana] I saw that the craft was about 50 feet above treetop and crossing the road right to left, directly overhead. I pulled off to watch and noticed other vehicles behind me had also done so. There was no noise - I rolled down my window to listen - nothing. As the craft passed over my car, I got a good look at it against &#39;night sky light pollution&#39; from Bloomington - it was triangle-shaped, with a white light in each of the three wing tips and appeared to be black in color. A mile or so down the road, the snow looked blown across the road like drifting. The rest of the roadway was clear. I thought &#34;copter&#34; at first, until I saw the thing. Not like any I had ever seen. It seemed like when motorists had pulled off to watch it flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time appears to be approximate.  PD))<n>

That big figure moved little bit, then suddenly disappeared!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Å@I&#39;m a Japanese man. On this January 5th,I was in my room of Hotel San Remo(in Las Vegas) and brushing teeth seeing out side of window. Time was about 5:00pm. I suddenly noticed a big ball figured object flying above the airport.  At first, I thought it was a big airship, staying at the same position for some reason, and that circle(ball) figure should be the top of the airship. And  at first, I thought that it seemed as a big ball because the airship was pointing it&#39;s top to my hotel&#39;s direction by some reason. But,,,,  after a few second, I was dreadfully surprised. That big figure moved little bit, then suddenly disappeared!! It happend while I was brushing my teeth. I couldn&#39;t believe the scene happening in front of me!! I can&#39;t believe even now that such a big object would disappear suddenly!! After that , I told what I watched but nobody believe me. I understand them, because I myself can&#39;t believe eather. Now, I came back to Japan. I write this letter from Japan. Most of friend said that I&#39;d better not to say about it anymore. See you,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We know that one, or more, blimps are hangared at the Las Vegas airport.  However, we have no explanation for why, or how, a blimp could disappear as quickly as the witness suggests.  PD))<n>

My husb was driving me home from work (@aprox 16:20-16:50) ant the fireball/smokeball was falling over lake Nipissing (looking WNW). There was only 1 object and it looked like a huge smokeball decendng from about 2000 feet.  To approxomate the size, I would say it was 2-3 km away and could be blocked from view with a match held at arms length, but not with the head of a pin. As we drove it became obscured by trees here and there but from what we could see it fell fairly fast.  As we reached the waterfront, it appeared to be 500 feet from the surface of the water when it burnt up/dissapeared from view.  We jokingly assumed it was jetsam from the MIR controled crash, but seeing as that took place on the entire other side of the world...  There were no plane crash or other reports that could explain that sighting. There was no debris flying off, no sparks or flame but it did have an impressive tail. It also seemed no one else had seen it. The whole sighting was 20 minutes at most.<n>

It moved horizontally again for about a minute.  Then, it curved downward, much like a shooting star but to slower.  It continuted to arc downward directly into another star.  It appeard to merge with the star and never re appeared.  That particular star remains visible in the night sky.  During this time I also saw 2 small planes fly over.<n>

It was because of this that he called out for someone else to come out to see what he is witnessing. I grabbed my torch, thinking that a goat had got out, and ran out to where my dad stood.  I had no idea it was lights he wanted me to see. By the time I got to where my dad stood, most of the lights had goen, but then he pointed to the NE, towards &#34;Butler Valley&#34;, which is about 10 or so miles away.  Where all of a sudden a bright amber light came on.  Stayed on for a few seconds, then went off.  As this light went off, two blue lights appeared, seemingly from nowhere, as if they were subterranean in origin.  These lights flashed a bright blue, and in between flashes, showed a medium blue.  One of the blue lights rose sharply to a medium altitude into the air, and then appeared to stop and hold it&#39;s position above the ground.  I then fixed my attention on this light.  This last blue light was heading Southward and could have been a few hundred yards off or so off the ground, as it flew at what could only have been at supersonic speed, which made a rumbling sound, just as if a train was passing by would.  After watching for about 10 seconds, I had to take care of something for my dad and when I returned it was all over. That&#39;s when dad and I went in to tell mom of what we saw and to call up to report this occurrance.<n>

They have reported a number of similar events in their area of Arizona, some of which have been reported by others, as well.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> While going to feed animals, I saw flashing blue lights rise out of the desert floor and stationary amber lights appeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> January 4th at 7:20PM MST. Bouse, Arizona. I went out to feed the animals.  When looking towards the NE in the &#34;Butler Valley&#34; area, I noticed a bluish light just above the ground, then another appeared.  The first light rose very fast at about a 50 degree angle going South off the Desert floor...it grew very faint then my attention gravitated to the second, then third light coming from the same area.  After the second and third bluish light, then the usual amber lights came on and went out above the same area where the blue lights appeared.  The amber lights always appear most of the time in the N.E. above the &#34;Butler Valley&#34; area and directly East at about 30 degrees above the horizon. When the amber lights came on, they did so from Right to Left and you could see a thin a horizontal gold thread connecting the lights.  The thread would disappear and the lights would go out. The duration of the amber lights was about 5 seconds per grouping. I watched the blue lights rise from the desert floor and move Southward, all were at different altitudes going South.  I noticed  all the blue lights were flashing like aircraft lights but the blue lights were two colors.  A bright medium blue and a light flashing blue---I have never seen blue lights appear from out of no where off the desert floor as it seemed that they just came out of the ground.  But never before had I seen the amber lights appear in conjunction with moving and flashing blue lights.  The whole episode lasted less than 5 minutes.  The last blue flashing light looked to be no more then a couple of hundred yards off the desert floor going South at a fast rate of speed and it made a very loud roaring sound like a roaring train. This last blue light was the only one to make any sound that I could hear.  My son and I both saw and heard this together.<n>

The object was white,not a light,norsilver,nor reflecting sunlight.It stopped in it&#39;s slow movement for about ten seconds or more when it was about 10 degrees off my 12 O&#39;clock position. The sky was clear with only some cirrus clouds in the West which were only visable from the horizon to about 10 degrees above the horizon. I watched the object then went for my wife to verify what I was seeing. She came out and watched it for a few minutes.I went back insidefor my binoculars but had misplaced them,this taking about 5 minutes. When I went back outside the object w2as still in view and moving verybslowly. Eventually it went behind the view to the cirrus clouds. As a pilot I am familiar with judging altitude etc.,and this was above 30,000 feet. As mentioned before,it was white in color.not reflecting the sun. The object was over an inch as measured with my hand in front of my eyes. This was very unusual to me as it was moving toward the jet stream for today. I did not say to my wife what I thought it was,nor color etc.,but I did ask her to explain what she saw. She said the same thing I was thinking,color,shape etc. The shape as we could make it out was long with no wings. It certainly was NOT a weather balloon. It was in our view at least 12 to twenty minutes from the 11 O&#39;clock position that I first observed it until it was about 3 O&#39;clock in the NW sky.

The light was pulsating on and off, them began to explode and dispersing the light until it was no longer visible.  Then the light would appear again and re-shape it self into  an oblong shape similiar to looking at a full moon with the north and south poles choped off.  The oblong shape would then very quickly implode into a  brighter light souce with different color gasses surrounding it and changing shape.  The movements the object  were quick jerky back and forth movements across the sky.

It was grey in colour almost the same colour as the sky and boomerang shaped. I pulled over into the slow lane and watched it fly over a field to my left. Then it stopped and spun around very quickly like helicopter blades and just vanished. I travel on the same road every day and have never seen anything before. The road is called the M11. I have never seen anything like it before and I keep trying to convince myself that I imagined it or it was a plane or something, but I keep remembering that at the time I kept looking at it for those 30 or 40 secs and saying to myself, &#34;I am really seeing this and I dont know what it is!&#34; Please belive me I have always laughed at storys about UFO&#39;s and I don&#39;t really belive in them even now but I really dont know what I saw. The road was quite busy so maybie some otther people saw it as well. Anothjer thing is that it was weired to look at. Although it was quite clear and very sharply defined it was a bit like looking at one of those magic eye pictures.

It was late night and me and my friend were on a university campus in Birmingham. Neither of us was intoxicated in any way, and although my eyes are slightly less than perfect my friend had correct glasses and we both concurred in what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about a 60deg elevation I noticed an area of the sky (virtually cloudless - no clouds near event) where the stars appeared to be moving around in relation to each other, as if seen through a dynamic lens. What caught my attention was that a) it was a windy night and the object/region was barely moving relative to us or landmarks and b) the &#39;stars&#39; refracted through the region were not accurate, that is not only the colour and luminance but the number of stars was different when the object cleared a section of sky. The slow movement of the region and the steady &#34;pulsating&#34; of its shape was entirely inconsistent with wind or thermal rising (I&#39;ve been known to dabble in parascending and gliding - I know airborne objects).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember observing the object for 20-30 seconds before mentioning it to my friend, in case I sounded stupid. When I directed his attention  to the area, he also remarked that it was not behaving like anything subject to the wind, or flight. The best way I can describe it is not as a craft or solid object, but as if an object roughly the shape of the familiar weather-map &#34;cloud&#34; was wandering about the sky, pretending to be transparent. Size and altitude are very difficult to quantify, but my best *guess* would be 2,000ft. The region was roughly the size of cigarette pack at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Plastic sheeting or other natural phenomena (with the possible exception of some sort of thermal or other atmospheric anomaly I&#39;m not qualified to identify) was discounted by both of us in our conversation, for the reasons mentioned above and (I&#39;m fairly sure) other reasons I can&#39;t readily recall. My recollection is crystal clear in that we both agreed it was unexplainable at the time and after watching it for a while, we said something along the lines of &#34;Well, that was ****ing strange&#34; and moved on to our destination with no explanation other than &#34;we just saw a UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only recently have I come across some vaguely similar sightings (there is one from a Sean Amundsen at the base of this page: http://www.rense.com/general50/whatthe.htm) and decided to document our sighting for posteriety. Sean&#39;s description of a &#34;magic carpet&#34; sums it up very well to me, although his sighting was in the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this tallies with something, or adds something to the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I woke up at about 11:00 to go the bathroom, and I witnessed a very shocking sight: a triangle shaped craft about 500 ft. up with lights at the corners and a bright light shining from the center.  I estimated it to be about as large as a big jet airliner and the strange thing was it was completely silent.  The light in the center seemed to be searching for something, and I screamed at it defiantly!  It shined the light on me, then suddenly went dark and bolted into the sky at an extremely high rate of speed.  I tried waking up my friend, but he didn&#39;t seem to believe me, and as I climbed back into my bag, the only comfort that I had was that at least I wasn&#39;t alone down in this valley, or we weren&#39;t alone in the universe?  Needless to say I didn&#39;t sleep and it has bothered me ever since.<n>

He has training in a number of academic subjects, as well as in other practical subjects, which significantly enhance his skill as an observer.  We were very impressed with his report.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> truly bizarre &#34;anomolous satellite-like&#34; observation<n> <n><n> <n><n> 21:20 local time (evening) Tuesday 2nd Jan near Sydney, Australia. (ie, Roughly Monday morning in USA.) 50 miles north of Sydney. Conditions perfectly clear, warm, 70 deg F., dark country area.  Event happened roughly in Orion (roughly overhead at that time). I am an mildly experienced skywatcher, meteor-shower watcher, aircraft spotter and satellite watcher. I have a science degree major in phyics and math. I am 36 years old and own a programming company and was perfectly sober. At about 21:20 I noticed what looked exactly like a satellite moving through the sky, just as when you see a LEO satellite moving through the sky. Oddly it was moving on a North to South (approximately) track (perhaps 10 or 20 degrees west of North to 10-20 East of South, but not sure). Of course satellites generally move in east and west lines, not north and south lines. I thought to myself &#34;cool, that must be a polar satellite&#34;. The point of light looked exactly as it does when you happen to see a satellite moving overhead.  Similar magnitude. The speed was somewhat faster than the typical satellite. At one point there happened to be a conventional wide-body jet also overhead (on a normal track to Kingsford-Smith airport) for comparision; in short the object looked exactly like when you see a satellite (except it was wierdly going N-S). Amazingly enough the object deccelerated, and then STOPPED (!)  I watched it clearly do this and kept concentration on it the whole time.  I notied it&#39;s position relative to some stars (near the west-south &#39;foot&#39; of Orion).  Obviously I yelled in amazement, told my fiance etc. Then, maybe 10 or 15 seconds later I happened to see another identical &#34;satellite&#34;, which was moving on a parallel track, but coming from SOUTH TO NORTH.  The two tracks were maybe 1 or 1.5 degrees apart. Amazingly the first satellite (or whatever) then STARTED MOVING AGAIN, but this time NORTH, ie backwards, the way it had come from. IE, the first &#34;satellite&#34; started moving again (in the reverse direction) when the other one approached it (the first one staying about 1/2 a degree ahead of the second). Both then moved at the same speed and direction, in &#34;formation&#34;. Although &#34;unspectacular&#34; this was (of course) the strangest and most bizarre thing I have ever seen in my life. Satellites don&#39;t stop, pause for a few seconds, and then go the other direction.<n>

We entered our driveway and driven to the top and stopped near the house.  My son looked out the windsheild and asked me- (Dad what is that!).  We both saw a White light that was very bright and brighter than any star.  It made a zig zap pattern across the sky.  It stopped once and started up again.  It seemed to know that we were watching it.  Very strange.  We watched it for about two min. and it dissappeared.  Clearly this was not a star or a aircraft.  Then my son told me that one time just a few months earlier that the members of my family watched a strange light in the sky.  It was night time and I work the night shift so I was not at home. My son said the light that he saw then was like the one we saw tonight.  That light moved very slowly and that it just dissapeared.<n>
1/2/01 17:00|Santa Barbara/ Highway 154|CA|Chevron|1 minute|Huge boomerang-shaped object seen over San Marcos Pass/Highway 154.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15779.html|252|ndxe200101| Huge boomerang-shaped object seen over San Marcos Pass/Highway 154.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling back from the Santa Barbara area over Highway 154 (Northeast, towards the Santa Ynez Valley) when both my mother (the driver of our vehicle) and myself (seated in the passenger seat) witnessed a very low flying, extremely large, &#34;boomerang&#34; shaped craft fly over the mountain top.  We witnessed it approximately 1 mile or 1-1/2 miles ahead and above us. Highway 154 is a curvaceous road that has been cut into the contours of the Los Padres Forest mountains overlooking Santa Barbara, California.  At the top of the pass there is a sort of &#34;gouge&#34; or small cleft in the mountain tops, where the pass reaches its summit before descending into the Santa Ynez Valley. It was my mother who first pointed the craft out to me.  We had our car windows rolled up.  Therefore, we were unable to discern at to whether or not the craft made any noise.  It caught my attention for a number or reasons.  Some of which I outline below. 1.  It was larger than any conventional aircraft that I know of, including the huge military personel and equipment carrier planes that occassionally are seen flying from the vicinity of Vandenberg Airforce Base (Lompoc, California = approximately 35-45 miles from the Los Padres Forest witness site). 2.  It was &#34;boomerang&#34; or chevron shaped, much the same as pictures I have seen of stealth bombers.  I could roughly make out its shape because of the time of day in which it was seen.  The event took place during dusk/sunset.  I watched it fly and then bank near the summit of the Santa Barbara side of Hwy. 154.  I watched it on this side of the mountain for approximately 30-40 seconds. 3.  I have never seen anything, other than a rare helicopter, fly so close to the summit/mountain top.  The craft was witnessed by us to be heading over the summit of the 154 pass, towards the Santa Ynez Valley.  It was approximately 200-300 feet from the summit/mountain top.  This placed it very close to the cleft in the mountain pass when it banked to the right.  This banking maneuver struck me as unusual for something so large.  I brought this to the attention of my mother. 4.  It had 3 white lights at each point of its chevron shape.  This also struck me as unusual because I am under the awareness that all conventional aircraft must use red and green lights.  As the craft made the banking maneuver it &#34;turned on&#34; some red lights which seemed to &#34;pulse&#34; more than to blink.  These were only on a few seconds.  My mother witnessed these also.  Thereafter, on the Santa Ynez side of the mountains, at a distance of about 3+ miles, I witnessed the object for a short time  (approximately 20-30 more seconds) to be flying very close to the ridge tops of some neighboring foothills.  I pointed out to my mother that I thought that the object was SO large still, even though it was getting further away from us.  Its sheer size is and was a mystery to me.  When I viewed it after it had &#34;banked&#34; it no longer had any red lights on (only the aforementioned white).  Total sighting time (including Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez sides of the mountains) = 1+ minutes. FYI:  I am almost 30 years old, college educated and employed in the medical field.<n>

I was awakened in the middle of the night approximately 2:30 or so. The room seemed to be filled with blue light, sort of like a neon light would give off.  I tried to say something to my husband who was sleeping next to me but everything I tried to say seemed to be coming out in slow motion.  At a few different intervals the light grew more intense and there was a sutble noise.  Kind of like the sound an x-ray machine makes. At the same time the light would intensify and I could feel a vibration though my body, like a very weak electical current. I kept trying to say &#34;what is that?&#34;  but my husband was asleep and I really couldn&#39;t seem to move or make any real sounds.  I&#39;m not even sure this has anything to do with UFO&#39;s , actually my first thought was the nuclear power plant about 30 miles from us. It continued long enough for me to try to think of other  explanations.  I even wondered if I was just dreaming but it was too real to be just a dream.<n>

We went out side adn they were doing the same thing. hovering in the sky they brgan to move a little closer together adn then simultaneously they blinked out then back on. then they took turns dimming back adn forth then they remained on for a minute or two. They began moving to the west adn one finally went out the second was dimming in and out still and suddenly it kind of sparked or something. I noticed something very faint falling straight down underneath it. I&#39;m not sure if it came from the amber light or if it was a falling star. It eventually faded out. Please if anyone knows what this might be let me know! I am going to try to get video of it.<n>

Approaching Green Ridge I saw what appeared to be a disc of light (such as a planet). It was the color of and amber sodium light. It remained motionless for a minute or two after I first saw it, and then started to move to the right. As I approached the 35 MPH sign in Green Ridge, it moved to the right, and seemed to spiral (like a kite without a tale). It spiraled at least once and I thought twice. At the 35 MPH sign, the road turns to the North East and I looked over my shoulder to the right and saw it plummet to the ground leaving a long tale. The light and the tale remained the same color as when first observed! Thursday night while at work, a person said to someone else that there was a report of a UFO in the newspaper. I had to go ask him where he saw it and he said it was in the break area. I went to find it and someone else said he saw it also in the paper but did not read it. Subsequently I asked a the school in Green Ridge, at the Casey&#39;s store and asked the police officer, but no one was familiar with the incident. This is not the first UFO I&#39;ve ever seen! I saw one in 1967 directly over Udorn AFB Thailand about midnight, some time probably in June.<n>

In fact I think they had either Dr. Sky or one of those astronomers on the radio that night to speak about how the Moon was phonomenally close that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a Red Pot Bellied Telescope that I bought from Edmonds Scientific so I pulled it out and decided to take a look. I set it up in the front yard and as the moon came up in the North East, I looked at it through the telescope. It was about 2/3rds of the way up the sky well above the neighbors trees. I am guessing about *;30pm or so because it was after dinner but the housekeeper had not left yet. Since I don&#39;t remember what season it was I can&#39;t really tell the time by the darkness, but I was cold, it may have been November or December, and it was definitely dark nighttime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was looking at it I suddenly saw several dark things go across the moon. It took less than a minute for them to cross the whole moon and I stared at them in amazement. It happened again maybe about 20 minutes later. I I didn&#39;t report it because I surmised that it must have been something close to the earth that came through my field of view. But they didn&#39;t flap like birds, but moved smoothly and all at the same time. When I saw them again they weren&#39;t in the same exact juxtaposition amongst themselves, but I still thought it might have been something close to earth, or perhaps satellites or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when this guy tonight said that because they were in focus they had to be close to the moon, I decided to report it because they were in sharp focus. Several dark shapes against the brightness of the moon. And just as the guy said on the radio tonight, they would have been about the size of a pea if the moon was the size of a beach ball. But the optics on my telescope did not reveal any spherical nature, they simply looked like flat dark round or oval shapes, not all the same size because I remember my first thought was like a Momma and some baby birds, but they didn&#39;t have wings or appendages nor did they appear to flap.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anybody else report anything that night? I am sure millions of people must have been looking at the moon that night like I was. In fact that&#39;s another reason I didn&#39;t report it because I figured if there was something there, then somebody else with a stronger telescope than I had would have reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Me and my girlfriends Father seen two UFO&#39;s over Manitoulin Island.  I was facing SW.  They appear to be bright yellowish lights and they didn&#39;t move.  Each had its own shape.  One cicular and the other was shaped like a comet with two tails and a round head.  The sky was clear and the sun was setting.  They looked like they were on the edge of earths atmosphere.  I video taped about 30 to 60 seconds.  Me and a friend kept an eye on the UFO&#39;s as we traveled west on the island.  And as we dipped into valleys we couldn&#39;t see them (we were not in a line of sight).  We watched them for about 5 more minutes then we lost track of them.  They appeared to change into a circle as we traveled west.  I have them on 8 MM video. I asked a local store owner about UFO&#39;s there and he said he sees them all the time but is afraid to tell anyone in fear they might think he is crazy (its a small town). Does anyone know of any similiar sightings on this island or around the world?  What should I do with this video? Thanks. ((name deleted))<n>

And to be honest, it&#39;s the first time that I&#39;ve actually come to &#34;grips&#34; with what I&#39;ve seen and decided to try to get to the bottom of it. My sightings have been numerous the past six years but this is the first time I have seen them early enough in the evening to get my husband and my son to look also. You may think I&#39;m nuts (I know I did until I had witnesses to it) and I hope that you don&#39;t have a text limit to this report because I have quite a lot to tell. Although I&#39;m reporting a sighting of four craft tonight, January 1, 2001, I&#39;d like to begin by telling you about the first time I saw this craft and the events thereafter. It was about 6 years ago and I woke at about 3:15 AM. From where I was sleeping, I could see out the window that faces to the east. I saw what first appeared to be a twinkling star in the distance over the treetops but I noticed that it had colored lights and it was moving incredibly fast. So I closed my eyes and opened them again and tried to focus on it, thinking I was seeing things. It went zipping around the sky, up and down, left and right, like nothing I&#39;d ever seen. So I got out of bed and went to the window and watched it. I kept blinking my eyes, thinking I can&#39;t be really seeing this...but I was. And then it zipped off out of sight. A few months later, I was cleaning out a mobile home on our property that had belonged to the original owners (an elderly couple) of our house and they used it for a summer home for years while they lived in California. I found a box of photos and in it was a VERY CLEAR picture from 1967 of a &#34;flying saucer&#34; over the same treetops that I had seen this flying object, only it was taken in broad daylight. I showed it to my husband and said it sure looked like a UFO and that I had seen one in the night some months ago. Anyways, I mailed that packet of photos to the owners in California and they have since passed away. I am going to contac! t her so n to see if I can retrieve that one photo. Since that time, I have seen these same lights in the sky on many occasions and always in the same place. I live in Maine and about 30 miles from Brunswick NAS so I&#39;ve always kind of hoped what I&#39;m seeing is just some kind of military secret and not something extra-terrestrial. Here&#39;s the real kicker though. This past summer, I was sitting at the picnic table in the backyard talking with my husband. The day was overcast with cumulus type clouds...not really low in the sky but not terribly high either. I remember they were gray looking and seemed to promise a storm. While we were talking I saw a triangular craft with four very large &#34;balls&#34; of light on it appear briefly just below a cloud and then disappear back into it. I said to my husband, &#34;What the hell was that?&#34; He didn&#39;t see it as he was facing me but recalls me mentioning it to him. That&#39;s always bothered me what it was. And while looking around the internet tonight for what the heck it is I&#39;ve been seeing out there to the east, I happened to come onto a picture of what I saw in the western sky. It was the same triangular craft with the four lights that I&#39;ve found on a number of sites like the sighting in Belgium in the late 1980s. Well, that&#39;s pretty scary! I freaked out and made my husband come look at the photo. I wanted to pass that one up as some kind of military craft too but it was just so huge and now I&#39;ve seen a photo of it seen by someone else on the other side of the world! Sheesh! But again, I live close to a Naval Air Station and was raised a &#34;Navy Brat&#34; and I just suspected it was classified military stuff even though it sure seemed strange at the time. Been around airplanes all my life. Sorry for rambling here but there is just so much to tell that I have kept locked up for the past 6 years. Anyways....I have seen the &#34;craft&#34; I saw tonight on many occasions and more in the last year than in the prior 6 years. It stays pretty much stationery and always appears in the same place in the sky no! matter what time of year. Call me silly but I&#39;ve always thought that if I watched it too closely, it might start watching me. That&#39;s kind of the way that it acted the first time I saw it 6 years ago. So, when I&#39;ve seen it, I just kind of tried to put it out of my mind and pretend it wasn&#39;t there. Okay, here comes the part when you will think that I am totally crazy but I need to tell you this so you will understand why I made a real effort to try to see more of this sighting tonight. Last Summer, it was about midnight, and I was up late reading in the livingroom. My husband was in bed and I heard a car drive up, slow down and pull into my driveway. My first thought was &#34;Who the heck is coming here this time of night?&#34; We live in the country, we never go anywhere and we rarely have visitors at night, especially late. So...I got up and went to the front door and looked out and it was MY car that had pulled into the driveway and it was still running! Okay, okay, I know you think I&#39;m either nuts or making this up but my husband will tell you that it happened. He woke when he heard the car pull in and thought the same thing I did...who could be coming here? And I called my parents in Florida a few days later and told them of this. They can tell you it happened. This could be related or not related but I have to add it into this report since it is a real mystery that we can&#39;t solve. Anyways, right after that, I started seeing this craft in the sky more frequently and tonight it started with the usual one in the usual place. I decided to become brave and try to take a closer look at it. It was quite a ways off..as the crow flies the coast is probably 15 miles from us to the east...and it seems to sit near there...quite a ways in the distance. I first spotted it at 7:00 PM tonight when I took the dog out. It always seems like a twinkling star but I see the colored lights on it. I went in and asked my husband where his binoculars were. He said, &#34;Why do you want them?&#34; I said I&#39;m going to look at a UFO that has been bugg! ing me f or years. I wish I had a telescope because that thing sat there for 3 1/2 hours without moving much. It moved three times...all three times that it did move was when an airplane entered the airway between where I am and it was. Each time, the craft blinked red and green lights more frequently (more like a plane&#39;s lights will) as the airplane would near the area of space it was in, and it would move horizontally and a bit vertically. When the airplane passed, it stopped and remained stationery until the next plane came along. About 75 minutes after I spotted this first craft, a second one appeared. I watched it approach from the north and take up a position above and to the left of where the original craft sat. About that time, I told my husband there were two of them out there now. He started to take me serious and went out with the binoculars to look and agrees that he&#39;s never seen anything like it. About an hour later, two more showed up, each taking a position to the left and north of the previous. But I just checked outside and can only see the original, still there but has moved a bit north. The others are no longer visible. So there you have it. I&#39;m glad I have finally told someone about this...it&#39;s been bugging me for years. I would love to receive a rational explanation for all this. I don&#39;t know if you respond to these reports, but I would appreciate hearing from you and if you have had similar reports and if you know what this is.<n>

Mainly, I have heard many stories in my life of ghosts and UFO&#39;s.  I&#39;m not one to believe everything I hear.  Until recently, that&#39;s been my view.  So, skeptic?, absolutely, believer?, still working on that one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my past, I&#39;ve been in the Marine Corps for nine years and 8 months.  I am an operator of a type of Amphibious Assault Vehicle. Google: AAV for more information.  Deployed to the Asias, Iraq and several Floats (stationed aboard Navy Ships).  During these times, I have literally flown in every single type of helicopter that can carry a human being, CH (Cargo Helicopter).  Due to my type of &#34;Job&#34;, I have come into contact with most AH (Attack Helicopter)types.  Reason why I&#39;m saying this is, I know how they sound.  It&#39;s kind of a show-off technique that I can name most Helo&#39;s by the sounds of their rotors.  Each one, each type, each speed approximately can be relatively determined by the the sound of the rotors and how many rotors they have.  I can also fairly judge the distance and estimate where and abouts their &#34;buddy&#34; is, since no single helo can fly alone, there is always a buddy located nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I know what loud vehicles sound like, sounds can identify many things without seeing them.  My times in Iraq fine-tuned my ability to identify sounds, especially while on patrol.  All this being said, here is my account of what I have seen and heard of through my military career.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During MCT (Marine Combat Training), approximately 15101999 0200, we experienced an earthquake. My instructor was livid in the morning, his truck which he had parked off the side of the road was rattled off the cliff.  Yes, a cliff.  You can imagine the pain we experienced that morning, he was quite mad.  Later on that evening, the instructors were commenting on the report given by the firewatch during that time.  Apparently, a helo came hovering by at a rapid speed.  When asked how fast, &#34;it was fast&#34; was given the answer.  Now consider, the Marine was probably 18 and never exposed to such things until then.  So &#34;fast&#34; in Marine terms: It was flying at ridiculous speed.  I know, I was young once too and would have said the same thing.  Also, he said it made weird sounds and was close enough he could have thrown a rock at it before it dipped into the valley.  Camp pendleton has numerous valley and hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that day, when asked, no one felt the earthquake and still, no one has really been able to explain how the instructors truck was pushed off a cliff sideways, when nothing else moved nearby.  I would think that if a truck could be rattled and shaken enough to move it sideways, things around us, such as ourselves since we slept on isomats on the ground would have moved also.  I think I would have awoken when I felt another man pressed up against me!  At the time and still to this day, it&#39;s a funny as hell story. Looking back though, it&#39;s always intrigued me just how...odd it really sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next account, jets don&#39;t fly over pendleton unless it&#39;s when the President or another very high staff member comes to pendleton.  Due to the runways limited size here, it&#39;s a helicopter Air Wing, few planes land on the runway.  Mainly small jet type passenger planes.  So, when something flies over your car, on Basilone road, at the speed of a jet, you take notice.  Especially when it&#39;s about a hundred feet over your car.  Basilone road is a road that cuts through base from I-5 to vandergrift rd.  A very long and lonely stretch of road at 2 am in the morning.  That&#39;s what time I was Designated Driver to 2 friends coming back from the bar.  This was around Christmas time the same year as the one account prior to this one, 1999.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next account, a close friend borrowed my car to go see his girlfriend in San Clemente.  The drive from Oceanside to San Clemente is about 20-25 minutes on the I-5.  When he came back that night to give me my keys, he said the strangest thing happened, a bright green ball of light flew along the coast, up and over the car, then headed back over to the coast, the entire time heading in a northerly direction.  He said it flew way faster than a helicopter and when it was about 1000 meters off to the side and in front of him, the thing just &#34;took off&#34;.  Faster than he had ever seen anything go. His girlfriend, now wife, said exactly the same thing and she was &#34;totally freaked out&#34;.  On a side note, the stretch of highway has few lights where this happened.  What lights there are, do not reflect green off your windows.  That was my first assumption until driving down the same highway several times over the years, at different times, and I have NEVER seen any type of green light reflection.  Only yellow or white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Okinawa, Camp Schwab, I was snorkeling with several friends at Naha island, about 1000 meters from shore.  I&#39;m sure Naha Island is not the actual name, just our name for it. Naha means south.  There is an area on this island where it&#39;s covered and is quite cozy and perfect to have a sort of camp fire party.  In other words, it&#39;s canopied and we could have a fire and get very, very drunk without anyone seeing us or caring to swim out there to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around midnight, some of us went to the closest cliff to &#34;relieve ourselves&#34;.  The cliff faced away from base. While, doing this, one of my buddies who was apparently gazing up at the stars in a slight stupor, pointed out, &#34;Holy shit man, you see that?&#34;  Yes, that is exactly what he said, still funny to this day. We all looked up and about 2000-4000 meters above us,  It&#39;s sort of hard to judge distance slightly intoxicated, there were three lights spinning but not spinning...it was like they were rotating about 45 degrees and back again but 75 degrees that time.  Thinking about it now, I don&#39;t think it was rotating as in parallel to the ground but was an illusion.  I think now that it was more or less tilting in different directions. What ever it was, if the lights were separate craft, I have never seen helo&#39;s do that in such perfect unison.  Odd thing was, it didn&#39;t just &#34;shoot off&#34;, it moved slowly away from base, over the ocean until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next account, flying back from Okinawa a few years later, around 2003, I looked out the window of the plane and saw several objects off to our left moving the opposite direction of us.  Probably around a mile.  Could have been planes.  They had to have been larger than C-130&#39;s and were definitely not passenger planes, unless they fly escort for one another.  Reason why I know they weren&#39;t C-130&#39;s, they were large.  Huge would be a better adjective. While in Iraq, I did see a Hercules plane. That was about how big those craft were.  Could have been that but still, I&#39;m pretty sure I would have been able to see the shape of the wings.  Those planes are massive. Either way, I thought I would include this one since it is a iffy situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next account, Al Anbar Province, Iraq. I was on a night raid in a village in Bubaydah. I&#39;m sure that spelling is incorrect. I was in the turrent of a Humvee. My LtCol asked me what the hell are those Helo&#39;s doing here. This was a very important operation, Helo&#39;s do not fly close to a &#34;snatch and grab&#34; for obvious reasons. My captain got on the hook and radio&#39;ed whoever it is they radio to find out who and why someone was compromising our mission. Radio reply was they didn&#39;t know but be advised, jets are inbound. Bebeydah is very very close to the Syrian border, cause for alarm was very just. I was watching the light for about 5-10 minutes. During that specific time, it just sort of moved around, like it was searching for something. It was about 5 miles distant, 1000 meters altitude. It was bobbing and weaving. Acting much the way a Helo would during a sweep mission. Then I noticed, where is his buddy? If it was a Cobra, a Huey would be flying at a higher altitude and a little distance. If it was a &#34;Huey, then the cobra should have been able to be seen around it. Cobras are difficult to see unless their light is facing you and at that distance, it would have to face us for us to see it. It could have been there. That&#39;s what I was thinking. When the jets arrived, thankfully not over the city, they closed in on the Helo. I swear to this day, I saw them shoot rockets at it. I saw four contrails following the glow of four rockets headed straight for it. I know what rockets look like at night, you can see the smoke through the burn of the rocket, it lights it up, hard to explain typing but, I know what a rocket looks like. When those rockets got close to the Helo, they just lost power and fell. Still moving forward, I&#39;m sure of that, inertia and all but, it was the craziest thing I have ever seen, the burners just stopped, when that happens, usually an explosion can be seen, not this time. They just winked out. When this happened they were about 3 miles away. The Helo, and I&#39;m calling it that because, it could! have be en at this point, started chasing one of the jets. Not really chasing it because it would fly in front of it, behind and then under it. I then realized, this wasn&#39;t a helo. Helo&#39;s don&#39;t fly as fast as a jet, especially maneuvering like that. Common sense does replace rationality eventually. After about 3 minutes of this &#34;taunting&#34; it flew off. Simple as that, no explosions, only sound was the jets. Eventually, they took off back to where they came from. This occured in 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, that&#39;s my experiences. I have heard of many many more. Specifically the lights that follow you and pass you on the I-5 going to LA. I&#39;ve heard probably 10-20 accounts of that. As I said, I&#39;m a skeptic. Not really one to accept an explanation without hard facts but, I also know, if the facts don&#39;t add up, then how do you explain it? I&#39;ve seen some odd things and usually at the time, I blow it off. The incident in Iraq pretty much made me reassess those situations that I kind of didn&#39;t really care about the first time. Thinking back, I should have looked a little closer and took notes a little better. So, I think you should possibly check into sightings over Camp Pendleton, especially along the coast. On another side note, my fiance was telling me about how she saw a craft rise out of the ocean from her house. She on the other hand, fully believes in greys, white&#39;s or blues, whatever color they are referred to as. She is a conspirasist to the utmost degree. Needless to say, I really don&#39;t take her seriously, but, she apparently has seen some things while living in Carlsbad that she explains as UFO&#39;s. She also said something about Illinois but I hate to say, I kind of tune her out after awhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading this and I hope it somewhat helps you out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We we in the livingroom, the window here is very big. It was getting dark (I am not quite sure of the time - somerwhere between 16.00 and 17.00 I suppose), but the sky was very clear. I suddenly saw about seven (7) &#34;aircrafts&#34; moving over the city about one kilometer or less away. They moved as if wind and weather had no influence on them.(Not at all like helicopters or other manmade aircrafts). I saw them very distinctly. Their shape was more rounded than cigars. I called my brother and my two kids (10 and 12 years old) and they saw exactly the same as I did. The objects were white or metallic, and they all had lights within and to the sides, and light under theem, shining in all directions. They moved rather fast, in a cortege, so near each other that there is no doubt this was no manmade fenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being an autodidact artist, I am rather used to observing forms and colors, and rendering what I see. I immmediately sketched down what I had seen, and not being satisfied by the fact that I had not sketched exactly what I saw - I must have been nervous! - I asked my daughter of twelve to draw this. She did so very well, and I still have the drawings in my notebook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother was reading a book when this happened. Being sceptical to all kinds of supranatural phenomena, he barely looked up at first, but finaly admitted that what we were looking at could only be ufos.<n>

It was about 7:30 am and the sun was coming up on my left and I suddenly caught a flash of something on my right as if the sun hit something shiny, as I looked to my right to surprise and shock to see a UFO coming up on my side.  My first response was to make sure I was awake and next to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing by getting on the C.B.  Radio and asking other drivers if they were seeing the same thing and about 10 drivers responded and said they sure did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 12 feet off the ground maybe a little more because at that point in the road it&#39;s a little elevated, it was your classic UFO that people talk about circular and the center was its drive point because that&#39;s what was spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I would have known at that time that it would have shadowed me four about 10 miles I would have stopped and taken pictures.  It stayed with for that long and instead of taking off in a hurry I actually got to watch take off towards the west at a nice slow pace and disappear over the Rockies.  I was close as 15 yards away at some points, there was no windows or any lights flashing that I could see, even though I only saw the one side.  The center as I said before was it&#39;s drive and other than it&#39;s spinning, I also noticed how it switched for a better term to raise and lower it&#39;s self<n>

They kept on ging up in the sky for aound one minute and then they began moving for another one minute towards my direction. When they were above my head they slowly fainted in the darkness of the sky. They were certainley not fireworks because they kept on for 2 minutes without exploding. They can be airplanes bcause their depature from earth was very very quick.the color did not change at any time<n>

( who are also unable to identify the craft and want very much to have a copy of the video )Object was filmed against night sky , however there are stars clearly seen in the background. Object was filmed as it was departing, so video taken is from the rear. I am not sure what you mean by asking for a description of the background/s of the observer/s but I am interpreting that as information about myself.....I am a psychology student..46 years of age and NOT given to lying . I am frustrated at trying to get anyone to take my video and statement seriously...the local tv channel has however, shown some interest but I think their sincerity at discovering the truth about the craft is spurious.I am getting no-where reprting this event here in Australia hence the reason why I am reporting the event to you.<n>

Just after midnight on New Years we stepped out side and we notice our little UFO&#39;s in the Northwest sky. They we sitting still and there was no sound. They flickered on adn off a few times but were very bright when on completely. They moved a littel to the South and then hovered around a little more. They seemed to be floating in the sky not just stationary. They got closer to each other and then farther away. They began to move to the west and got smaller as they went. sthey still flickered a little until they faded out completely. We are watching for these every night now. the first time we witnessed them was the night before Halloween but that time they were right over our house adn we could see them more clearly. They were about teh sixe of my fingernail at arms length.  I did report that sighting also.<n>

1/1/01 00:01|New Plymouth (New Zealand)||Disk|4 minutes|Outside of Inglewood and New Plymouth - New Zealand me and 4 other people spotted 5 circular disc shaped objects in the sky.|1/3/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15711.html|278|ndxe200101| Outside of Inglewood and New Plymouth - New Zealand me and 4 other people spotted 5 circular disc shaped objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was headed down state highway 3 from palmerston north to new plymouth in my car. We had the radio tuned to 94 fm: the edge. We were headed into New Plymouth at the time and i knew there was enough coverage in the area to keep the radio waves going. The radio started giving a static buzz at about the time we left inglewood.This continued for about 1 minute and we decided to switch the radio off. As we approached the next corner I saw an orange light over the trees. It soon vanished. As we neared the sighting spot we slowed down to see what it may have been. Nothing unusual could be seen. We retained speed through the next few corners and something orange hovered above us. It appeared to be about 100 feet from the ground and looked to be between 30 and 50 feet long and the same in width (basically circular). There were five of us in the car at the time:Me, my brother, his girlfriend, their friend and a friend of my own. We all could see it. The object seemed to hover soundlessly as we all stepped out of the car. As we looked around we saw three other objects hovering and swaying around in the air. They looked like they were changing colour from metallic glowing orange to metallic deep purple and shades of blue. One more larger object appeared on the horizon and sped towards the other 4. Each seemed to react in a way similiar to an army unit and formed a line and dissapeared almost instantly over towards Mount Taranaki. As we left several minutes later we realized we hadn&#39;t seen any traffic for about half an hour and only saw some as we entered new plymouth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by student.

The craft was circular in design with five round lights that seemed to fade from orange to red. the lights did not seem to rotate around the craft, instead they seemed to just stay perfectly still, as if suspended in mid-air.It is my belief that this &#34;craft&#34; was for some reason attracted to the fireworks display. After about two minutes the object moved away, at first traveling quite slow,but suddenly began to travel at a speed that I could not track it by sight.<n>

1/1/01 00:00|Constitucion (Chile)||Light|15 minutes|Red, Green and  Yellow lights over the Pacific in Constitucion, CHILE.|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35322.html|281|ndxe200101| Red, Green and  Yellow lights over the Pacific in Constitucion, CHILE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my first sighting, I was travelling in my car and just out of curiousity I pulled the car onto the side road facing the ocean which there were strange lights hovering over the horizon, they were red, green, yellow and white lights moving in all different directions.  We observed these lights for over a span of 10 to 15 minutes, I happened to look up into the night sky and saw more than a couple of stars move, like when you see falling stars, except that these did perfect circular movements and just disappear afterwards.  After witnessing this we noticed that over the horizon of the pacific, quickly a kind of mist or clouds covered these lights and we could no longer see them.  After getting to our destination, as we got out of the car and as I looked up into the night sky, I saw behind the hills a kind of lightning or flash, this was on a clear starry night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previously, the day before this, it was around midday.  It was a clear blue sky day, I saw a metallic object cross the sky, it looked like it was far since it was just a small dot, it was round and metallic, the speed of this craft was quite normal and just eased it&#39;s way across.  From these sightings I was told that this area in Chile, Constitucion, there are quite alot of sightings and it&#39;s very common to see events like this.  Since then I have not gone back, every night I look up and hope to find something interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/1/01 00:00|Flagstaff|AZ|Unknown|6 hours|UFO Seen Manuevering in Impossible Ways with No Apparent Reason|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45743.html|282|ndxe200101| UFO Seen Manuevering in Impossible Ways with No Apparent Reason<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping on a mountain called Wing Mountain which is WSW of the San Francisco Peaks outside of Flagstaff, Arizona.  My friend and I watched a flying object for several hours and witnessed its presence as long as five hours after initial sighting.  The object made no sound that we could hear.  We were at the top of a small mountain with a continuous, nonchanging rise to the area on the other mountain where the object was.  In other words, we were in a bowl shape that would have channeled sound very well.  The object was in the sky and about half way from the bottom of the mountains to the top.  The bottom of the mountain where the object was is also the bottom of the mountain that we were on.  It repeatedly flew in a &#34;T&#34; shape.  It would fly straight back and forth for at least 10-15 minutes and then drop at a perfect right angle down into the bottom of the &#34;T&#34; shape.  It would then resume the back and forth movement after coming back up to the plane it was moving in horizontally.  The object had a light that could best be described as an amber light resembling a street light in color.  The intensity of the light decreased significantly as you look away from the center.  The light appeared like a round ball of evenly dissipating light.  The light stayed one intensity, but would increase approximately 10 seconds before the object descended into the bottom of its &#34;T&#34; movement.  There would occasionally be a red light that seemed to be attached to a lever that was  connected to the object in the middle.  The lever would look stowed into the vehicle and normally not be visible, as there was no red light visible.  As the object came up out of the &#34;T&#34; pattern, the lever with a red light at the end would sweep 180 degrees, from horizontal at the rear of the vehicle to horizontal at the front, and disappear.  The red light appeared to swing down from out of the craft, swing in a half circle and disappear up into the front.  The angle at which the object descended in its &#34;T&#34; movement pattern was a right angle, not an arcing angle like a helicopter or balloon would follow.  Also, the amber light was bright enough to see over the forest on the mountain.  We could barely see shadows in the trees(I have 20-20 vision) moving as the object moved above the woods.  It resembled what one would see from 2 miles if a military flare to expose enemies was released, but a dark amber in color, just bright enough to see the tree shadows moving if you look slighty to one side of area being lighted up.  The light was not bright enough to easily see in the woods by looking straight at them even though our eyes were adjusted to a very dark sky.  The object never left the one spot where it was first seen.  The &#34;T&#34; shape that it moved in appeared to be approximately 100 yards or less in length across the top, and about the same distance down the vertical leg of the &#34;T&#34; shape.  It appeared to be maybe 200 yards above the forest on one end of the horizontal, and about 150 yards above towards the front.  I fell asleep and did not see the object depart unfortunately.  The &#34;T&#34; shape would be perpendicular to the mountain, meaning, as you look straight to the top of the mountain, that the object approached and then moved away, as opposed to moving back and forth relative to the top of the mountain.  I am an electrical engineer and am quite certain by the angles at which this object moved that it could not be hovering by manipulating air.  Also, I know of no aircraft that can silently move at impossibly right angles for over five hours without refueling.  Plus, this mountain is all a National Wilderness Area with no military activity that I have ever heard about.  The nearest military base is the Navajo arms depot about 20 miles away, west of Flagstaff.  I believe that everything approaches infinite mass when approaching the speed of light and that living beings cannot live long enough to travel the distances necessary at the available speeds to reach other planets.  Therefore, I am truly perplexed by this event.  I really hope this information helps us learn more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
