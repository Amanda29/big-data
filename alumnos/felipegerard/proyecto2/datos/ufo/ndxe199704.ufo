At first they thought it was a light tower but then it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of Wednesday, April 30, 1997 two co-workers were travelling back to Marlboro from a class.  They were travelling down Lyman St. in Westboro.  They had passed a hospital on the left that leads into a large cornfield.  Mary looked over first and noticed the strange object.  It looked just like a light tower with a vertical galvinized metal pole in the center and bright strobe-type lights on either side.  Mary was more curious than scared and she asked ((Name deleted)) what she thought it was.  ((Deleted)) dismissed it as a light tower but ((Name2 deleted)) insisted that it moved.  She slowed the car down and it was indeed moving.  ((Deleted)) started to get nervous and told ((Deleted)) to keep going.  It started to get closer to the car so they sped off.  When they got to the next intersection they looked ahead of them and the object was now across the street infront of them.  ((deleted)) was suppose to make a right to go home but decided to take a left and head towards the police station.  Once inside ((Deleted)) ex!plained to the dispatcher what they had just witnessed.  The dispatcher called out to a couple of cars in the area.  They hadn&#39;t reported seeing anything.  The police thought they had seen a cellular phone tower that had just gone up recently.  Mary tried to explain that &#39;towers don&#39;t move.&#39;  While they were at the police station, there was a man waiting to fill out a police report.  He overheard what my friends had to say and he thought it was strange.  He had been working late around the Lyman St. area and when he walked out to his car it was completely engulfed in flames.  He was the last one in his office and he said this happened around the same time of the sighting.  Could the two events be related?  An officer escorted both my friends out to where the new cellular phone tower was put up.  Both((Names deleted)) confirmed that it wasn&#39;t what they had seen.  The next day, ((Name deleted))drove back down Lyman St. to see if there was anything that might explain what she had seen but th!ere was nothing.  ((Name deleted)) and I drove by on Friday afternoon (5/2) and she said the same thing.  Since this day we have tried to find a picture or anything similiar to what they had seen.  I have only seen pictures of the classic saucer so far.Both ((Names deleted)) are the most sane and reliable people I know.  They are both professional business women.  ((Deleted)) is a true sceptic and has become somewhat obsessed with finding an answer to this.  She has asked me to do a search on U.F.O.&#39;s and that&#39;s how I&#39;ve gotten to your page.  I hope someone there might have some answers.Thanks,((Name deleted))<n>

I wish I had reported it though and always wondered if anyone else had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened after the kids and I were leaving a 4-H meeting in Twelve Mile.  I was traveling South on the country road out of the small town.  About a mile out of town I saw several bright white lights in a row (approx. 12-16) hovering over the tree tops that were along the edge of a field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the minivan and asked the kids &#34;What IS that?&#34;   We all sat and looked at it, trying to make out what the string of lights were connected to.  The lights were all even to each other and didn&#39;t bounce, flash, flicker, drop or rise in the air.  Judging from the height and width of the tree line and field, this object was at least as long as a football field, if not bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my van off and opened my window all the way.  There was no audible sound coming from it.  I knew it couldn&#39;t have been any type of known aircraft because it was much too large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched these lights it seemed that the object they were on must have been a disk shape because the lights all began moving slowly and steadily off to the right.  As they moved off to the right, each light to the far right would disappear one by one.  It was as if the object was disk shaped and was only lighted on one side and as it turned the lights disappeared out of our view, blocked by the solid object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen a video taped sighting of something that looked very similar to what I saw.  I think I&#39;ve seen the video tape on Unsolved Mysteries and a documentary on the Discovery Channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really want to know what this is.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it and my kids remember it vividly too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to attempt to determine the precise date.

The Hale Bopp comet was still very predominant in the sky and as we were making out way over the Sierra Mountains on our way home to the San Francisco Bay Area we were keeping an active eye on the comet.Suddnely on out drive my friend exclaimed &#34;When did Hale Bopp turn bright green?&#34;. I coulf see Hale Bopp in my drivers side mirror and it clearly was not green and told her so. She then pointed ahead of us and asked &#34;Well then what is that?&#34;. I looke in the direction she was pointing ans sure enought there was a bright flourescent green gaseous glowing mass in the southern sky. We kept watching it as we drove and it seemed to get brighter at its core. When we were able to we pulled off to the side of the highway. There were two other cars pulled over as well watching the green mass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the car and joined the small group of 7 other observers. The green mass had formed into a gian white brilliant ball of light. It remained as a single ball for about a minute and then suddenly two smaller balls emerged from it. One on either side of the larger ball. The two balls returned into the large one and then four balls came out, this time two on either side then they too retracted. Next three on either side came out and then went in. This pattern repeated until there were 8 balls on either side of the large ball. Then it started the pattern again but in reverse going backwards from 8 to 1. Once it completed that it started all over again. When the eight balls were on either side of the larger ball (for a total of 17 balls of light) it spread across the entire visible horizon. It repeated this pattern for about (or what seemed like) 25 minutes. My friend made a comment about how it was amazing to see but getting boring with all the little balls going in and out. At this point all the balls retracted and the large white ball shot off to the north west at what had to be several thousand miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She noticed some lights in the sky, which she said were in the shape of a kite.  When she told me to look, I  saw what looked to be a large triangle in the western sky.  As the lights moved toward us and toward Houston, I realized there were around 10 to 13 individual amber colored lights flying in a perfect &#34;V&#34; formation.  They were going extremely fast, and seemed to be at a very high altitude.   They passed to the south of us, and as they neared Houston,  started shifting positions.  Once over the downtown area, we started losing sight because of the lights of the city, but the lights appeared to stop.  As soon as this happened, we bolted for the video camera. On our return, we could no longer see them.  The  time from sighting in the west until they were over downtown was around 30 seconds or so.  I did some rough estimates of speed based on where I thought the!y were at first (Sealy??).  No jet flies at ~10,000 mph.I am an electrical engineer from ((Name deleted)) University by education (War Eagle!), and I work at ((Name deleted)) as a programmer.  My wife is a  student at University of Houston.  This was the first truly bizarre thing either of us has witnessed.<n>

We were on vacation in Pheonix and decided to drive out with her. What I saw was not ships, but what I would describe as.... Electrical entities?? Various shapes and colours of very fast moving lights??? They seem to reply to {J} as she talked to them, moving off at speeds and distances that were unbeleivable. Now here we are miles from anywhere, no tricks, or drugs, or booze. Just a cold night on the messa, the reservation police came, saw it was {J}, looked up in the sky and drove away as quick as they could go. She asked one set of two lights to go find her friend *Bobbee* The lights took off, and came back with a very bright, larger light, that sparkled and turned purple, stuck around for a while, then when a jet came in the area, they all just took off. No sound, no clouds, I have no idea what I saw, but I saw it!??? If anything like this has ever been seen before, please write me back. If you want the directions, I&#39;ll gladly give them up. can&#39;t tell you what I saw, but I know I&#39;m going back to see this again someday.<n>

Red light moves differently and sparkle type exhaust noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early Friday Morning 4/25/97 at approximately 1:45 AM (worked late) I was traveling north on Military Trail between Atlantic and Lake Ida Road. I noticed a rather large white light, like a helicopter spot light in the north sky. Then I suddenly noticed a red  light below it. The red light looked like a tower light at first. Then I noticed that it was much wider than a single tower light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned east on Lake Ida road and was alternately watching the road and looking north (to my left) at the lights. The red light was now rectangular in shape and there was some small areas where there was maybe white light by the red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the Large white source became 4 blinking smaller white lights, like 2 lights each on the wing tips of an airplane. The white lights flew to the south above me and then I couldn&#39;t find them. The red light started moving rather rapidly to the east. Then I noticed red sparkles horizontally behind  the red light. The sparkles were like fireworks sparkles. The sparkles became a streak and the red light continued moving east very fast and became very small. The sparkles disappeared. The red light became indistinguishable from a star or ordinary airplane light and kept moving east until I couldn&#39;t spot it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this happened 4/25/97 I documented it and emailed to family.  I just found your web site June 29, 2012 when I saw another strange set of objects and reported them and then report this 1997 incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I hope the writer of that report can read my sighting below, from my personal UFO Journal and know he or she is not alone in seeing this type of shape changing object.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gil Rodriguez  1997 - 16. Spring - April or May. I lived at my present address of 640 East 79th St. between Glenwood &amp; Farrigut Roads. While finishing up a long walk, one morning about 11:30 am, I had the urge to look behind me (a soft (mechanical sounding) voice said &#34;LOOK UP&#34;) and I saw a large dark (very dark gray to black) doughnut shaped object moving in the sky over my left shoulder. It was over to the North West, a few blocks up around Utica and Foster Avenues when first sighted. I could see the sky through the center of this object. It looked to be 2000 to 5000 feet above the area. After a few seconds it moved over with a fast jump or dart like movement and was almost directly over Glenwood Road where I was walking as it changed shape several times from a doughnut to a cigar shape with the front 1/5 of its length bent back, then it became a straight cigar or cylinder shape, then a chevron shape. It made a jump or move down quickly over the street (maybe 500 feet up) and looked at least as wide as the street (Glenwood Road) I was walking on (it had now changed into a cigar/cylinder shape). After changing again into a chevron, it changed into a figure eight. The exact shapes it changed into, the sequence, I have drawn on paper from that day with a letter I eventually sent to Sightings and Encounters. (I never heard from either show). I somehow had the impression that this thing was alive or that it was some kind of creature, especially when it was cigar shaped with the front 1/5 section bent back. During this time there were about 5 people on the street within the next two to three blocks who were looking at it and pointing. One guy yelled out &#34;what the hell is that&#34; when it was shaped like a figure eight. I was thinking at this time that if I ran home, I could get my video camera and get some video of it. The object stayed ahead of me as I ran. I ran the remaining six or seven blocks home and went inside calling my wife, mother-in-law and daughter frantically to come outside and see this UFO. I went back outside! and was joined by my daughter, my wife and mother-in-law (there voices can be heard on the tape). I taped for about 54 seconds where you see it changing shape three times before it moved into the clouds. You can see it change into a chevron, a ball or disk and finally a dark/black cigar/cylinder shape before moving into the clouds (my daughter is heard saying &#34; it’s going into the clouds&#34;). Today, 1/03/03 I remembered that my first thought was that it was a long string of large black balloons that might have flown off from a parade or a street fair, but the shapes it made especially when it came down over the block (Glenwood Avenue) I was walking on (doughnut, cylinder, chevron and figure eight) made it look like one solid object, with no segments.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Went to investigate and then saw a large object in the eastern sky.  He called his mother who also went to investigate.  The first and what would also be the largest of the craft was the firstlight seen.  It was the brightest light we had ever seen in the sky except sun and moon.  The craft was triangular in shape with lights on the corners.  When it was right overhead, a small triangular structure could be seen on the underside.  It hovered for a while and then was approached by another smaller craft.The large one began to turn north west and the smaller craft followed.  The craft abruptly turned and went due north.  Then after they were overthe horizon, more of the smaller sized craft began to be seen from the south moving north.They appeared one at a time in approx. two minute intervals.  It took them less than two minutes to go from horizon to horizon.  We had never seen any craft move that quickly.  Many of them maneuvered in distint manners:forward-reverse, forward-reverse; hover; very quick zigzag; 45+ degree banks in a matter of seconds:  almost as if a display.  Light pattern:  one light on one wing would flashand then the other two would follow.  Colors of the lights were white in front, blue and redon the sides and smaller amber to red on the inside of the triangle, making a perfect equilateral triangle inside the craft perimeter.Sound:  At first like a plane, but then a high pitched hum could be heard particularly when the craft was right over us.  A while afterwards,almost like blowing over the top of a tube.More than 20-35 of these were seen over the course of approximately 45 minutes, traveling from thesouth, some going northwest, some northeast, and some traveling directly overhead to the north.<n>

My two friends and I were hanging out on the roof of my college apartment.  Two of us were lying down staring up at the sky. I saw this rather bright object in the sky between a break in the clouds.  It was blue in color and aparently stationary.  I thought it was a star. It then slowly disappeared as if it had &#34;winked&#34;.  My friend was evidently looking at the same object.  It then &#34;winked&#34; back, and we could see the light again.  It &#34;winked&#34; off, and then on again. Then it seemed to shoot off in a southwesterly direction.  I have no idea what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My summary description basically states all of what I had observed.  Being that I perceived the object to be simply a blue light high in the sky may seem a bit obscure as far as descriptions are concerned, but that is simply what it appeared to be.  Because I was in the middle of town where street lights abound, I do not beleive that either my friend or I could have resolved the object any more so due to the interference of the extraneous lights.  Pertaining to the observers, I would consider both of us to be at least highly open-minded individuals.  I, myself, have always had taken interest in supernatural/paranormal phenomena, although I cannot remember experiencing close encounters in my past.<n>

It was about 7:30PM and heavily overcast with a ceiling of about 1000 feet with a strange orange color to the clouds, which I assume came from the Low Pressure Sodium lighting around the city. I happened to glance up at about a 45 degree angle and noticed a very strange shaped object just sitting there, stationary in the sky just below the cloud ceiling.  It was two equilateral triangles, connected at the tips in the shape of an hour glass.  Your choices of descriptions of the object above didn&#39;t include hourglass shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always been interested in the subject of UFO&#39;s but hadn&#39;t seen one previously and so was immediately intrigued.  I watched it for about 10 minutes and noticed that it appeared to be two FLAT equiliateral triangles made of transparent glass which seemed to either reflect the clouds around it or project the clouds behind it, through the solid-appearing object.  I ran inside and got the phone to call the city desk at the local newspaper to report it and find out if anyone else had seen it.  They said that yes, others had seen it, about 8 calls had already come in.  The guy said someone surmised that it was some kind of reflection from a petrochemical flair at the ship channel.  True, the color of the object, a strange orangish color that was very similar to the surrounding clouds, was very similar to the color of the bright orange flairs I&#39;ve seen at petrochemical plants.  However, clouds are constantly moving and changing shape and this object was not only stationary, but fixed in its shape with very sharp and straight edges so their explanation did not even come close to holding water!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I also saw no doors or openings and no beings. just the craft. it started moving slowly across the field slightly left and away from me the cows continued grazing as nothing was there then it swiftly moved out and streight up at a tremendious amount of speed and was out of sight in a couple seconds it was a clear day and no buildings or anything could have generated the thing I saw I had been at work and had not taken any medicines of anykind and had not drink amy alcohol as far as I knew I was the only person who saw it I wrote it down when I got home and tried to report this to the army airforce and many others with out any one writing me back.these new craft are glass like and if you didn’t see the distortions you would not be able to see them ifter a lot of thought its my conclusion that this is more than likely why reports have been so low they have gotten smart and have new tecnology I later went to school and became an L.P.N. and  now I am disabled due to a bad back but this was a real craft and if you will look at the alien in the movie preditor you can get an idea about how the craft was doing i also saw no lights or landing gearthe craft was like a mirror<n>

Too big to be a satellite, and not blinking or moving fast enough to be a plane or helicopter. (It would have been too low to be a plane without some sound.)  No sound accompanying this event.  Clear night.  Full moon.  Light as large as Venus might appear at its brightest, but &#34;stop-light&#34; red.  No other object that color in sky.  Only faint stars in that direction.  Appeared to be stationary, but with continued viewing seemed to very slowly move upward and between two distant stars, about 5-10 more degrees.  Then as I watched, it was just gone.

From the rear of the craft there were 4 lights closely together, they were tiny compared to the one on the side, and they wren&#39;t as bright.  The light on the side when it went out would reappear half way across the sky  so it was moving at a very incredible speed much faster than a plane.<n>

It was the middle of the night one something awoke me- a strange feeling-I didn&#39;t like it. I looked at the clock. 2:03 am. The clock was on a dresser next to the window. I saw a light outside, but assumed it was an aircraft. I made a double take. The light I saw was very large, larger than the moon.(In appearance) Its colours constantly shifted, changing hues every second. Surrounding it were dozens of smaller lights. Through the window I saw it had a strange, grotesque shape- the large light was the center of the craft, and along with the other lights were a few that were smaller than the big one, but bigger than the small ones, that lined the outline of the craft. The craft iself seemed tear-drop shaped, yet sprouting from random parts of the craft were long, tentacle-like protrusions, and they seemed to be comming dangerously close to the ground. The pointed end of the craft was a single, stiff spine. Having keen vision, even in the dark, I squinted to see if I could refer just what was on the ship. I saw mininscule humanoids in the craft, but before I could decifer more, a flash of light broke the calm, settle night, and it&#39;s the last thing I remember. I came back to in my bed, nearly an hour later, but did not recall falling asleep. A week later, however, strange markings began appearing on me. They looked like needle marks- only much bigger, and much redder. My IQ nearly doubled, perplexing my doctor over the few weeks it happened. Things strange still happen to me, and although I move around alot, I have constant UFO sightings. I&#39;m still obseesed in UFOs, aliens, area 51, and the like. In my quest for answers, I stumbled upon an odd book that revealed some secrets to me. I may be, as the book says, a &#34;Star Child,&#34; one of very few people that are either descendents of aliens, or are looked after by the like, with occasional &#34;check-ups.&#34; That is all I real! ly have to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Noneof the witnesses talked witheachother so no information wasexchanged.  Tom and Mary calledthe local paper, the DailyRepublic and a small articlewas written.No other witnesses have beenfound yet, however, CharlieGoodyear whom wrote the articlefor D.R. stated that he hadtalked to a Capt. Robert Kirbyat Travis. In his article hestates, &#34;Officials at TravisAir Force Base did get onephone call around 10:30 p.m.Saturday from an unidentifiedwoman reporting a mysteriouslight in the sky.  But airtraffic controllers and basepersonnel noticed nothingunusual, Capt. Robert Kirbysaid.&#34;  When I interviewed Tomhe stated, &#34;They couldn&#39;t havemissed it if they were evenlooking out the window!  Theywould have needed sunglasses!&#34;Charlie Goodyear checked withlocal police and sheriff&#39;sdept. and found there were noreportings of the anamoly. Ichecked with the local firemarshall whom is in charge of,and lives in, the range landswhere the incident occured.  Hestated he was not aware of theoccurance or anyone reportingit, but would call me if heheard anything.According to the witness&#39;sdescriptions, this light didnot move across the sky and didnot seem to originate from aphysical object, but simplyexisted as its own source withno density. No noise could beheard and it did not travel ormove from its active location.It would however, shift andtransform from being round(size of dime), then enlargingto round (silver dollar), thenwould stretch out &#34;like gum&#34; inlength (dollar bill), thenseparating into two. Then itwould come back together like around dime and would then fadeout to size of a pinpoint, likea TV tuner turned off. Then itwould come back repeating theprocess. Witnesses stated thisprocess repeated about 6 times.One time upon separation, thetwo lights  moved diagonally toeach other, like a &#34;chevron&#34;with 2 strips, shimmering likea reflection on water.Eventually when fadeing itnever came back. While cloudswere scattered through the skysthe area where the lights wereshowing contained none. Tomstated he frequents through thearea quite often and is awareof regular air traffic due tothe AFB, however during thislight show no air traffic wasnoticed what so ever.The witnesses were interviewedtogether by phone.  Tom is 52,and is a grocer&#39;s clerk.  Maryis 50 and is a purchaser for anintercom company.  Both areinterested in spiritual/psychictype information, but do notkeep up with latest gossip orhappenings in that regard.Mary stated she did not read orwatch the news reports, andthat as she did not even knowabout the comet, until sheasked Tom one night what shewas seeing in the sky. Bothhave had a light interest inUFO&#39;s but again do not keep upwith latest gossip etc...Together through the interview,they seemed to mutually agreeupon their story, as theyshared enthusiasm andexcitement about it.  Neitherwould speculate as to what itwas they saw, except that theyboth &#39;felt&#39; it was not aterrestial source orphenomenon. Both did not feelfrightened by the expierienceand talked about it as apositive expierience. Therewere no physical effectsreported.  Witnesses reportedaprox. 5 vehicles passed onHighway 12 during theirstationary 5 miniute viewing.They found it strange that thevehicles passed as withoutnotice of the event. As ifobservation was limited only tothose who were there initially.The area in which this occuredis a rural area, consisting ofplains type terrain, coveringover 2000 sq miles.  Populationwithin the sighting area issparse, probably 1 ranch forevery 2 sq miles. Communitiesclose enough to have possiblywitnessed the light show wereBirdslanding, Rio Vista, Dixon,and possibly eastern Fairfieldand Suisun.  All aresurrounding the proximitywithin 15 miles.  Birdslandingis the closest within 5 miles.Attempts were made to locateaddtional witnesses with nosuccess. Contact was madeeither in person or by leavinga note, with ranches in theimmediate vicinity of thesighting location.Birdslanding, a rural communityof ranches, is directly acrossHighway 12,  may containwitnesses.  Many events of thisnature, in the past, have beenreported in the Birdslandingarea.  I made contact with thepostmaster for this area andgave her cards with a requestfor contact if she heardanything.  She readily agreed.I went out to view the site andcheck for any natural sourceswhich may explain this event. Idid so on 4/21 at 23:00 to gainperspective with a similarnight environment. It wasobserved that radio towersexisted aprox. 15 miles NE ofthe sighting area. Thesetransmission towers are highand thin.  2 of them had lightswhich were greenish and wouldflash on and off.  Both towerswere aprox. 3 miles apart andwould alternatly do this in aregular sequence.  Whileconsidering this as a possiblesource it was eliminated whilereinacting their viewpoint.The towers were to far off inan easterly direction and theirproximity to the horizon couldnever have contributed to thesize and altitude of the event.Additionaly the descriptionwhich was given did not matchthe constant sequence in whichthese towers flashed.Daytime observation of the areawas also made. No otherpotential sources were noted.Witnesses will provide markerdrawings in a followupinterview in two weeks.  Thisalong with any further datagathered will be forwarded atthat time.<n>

It was too unusual a shape to be a plane or a helicopter and the lights were so brilliant that I stood observing it for 4 to 5 minutes.As it moved over the mountains, it seemed to explode into an enormous sphere of red, green and white individual lights. It stopped moving and seemed to hover above the horizon for 3 to 4 minutes.  Then in seconds, it seemed to twinkle out, first from the bottom of the sphere, finally to the top of the sphere.

She said that it was definitly above the water, because she saw its entire reflection on the water.  She also stated that she watched it for a very short period of time (approximately 30 seconds) and that it simply disappeared as it travelled toward the Caddo Drive area of the lake. She also said that she thought that it mighthave come up from behind us because it appeared to come from that direction, and that she had gotten a &#34;cold chill&#34;before she saw the object.

I saw some lights in the sky and he thought they were lights on signal peak. I pointed out that they were very huge and yellow colored. They almost looked like the flares that the military shoot off for their night drills.They showed no movement, there was no smoke trailing from them, and the ground did not appear to be lit up from them. WE kept watch up until we got in to town. Sometimes we could see them from his house on the edge of town. Other times they would be gone. Occasionally one light would fade away or the object turned. Unsure if all lights were on one object or were actually three objects. We were watching them before they were on the news. The lights mostly just seemed to hover. Did not observe them leaving the area, so unsure as to the capability of speed or manuvers. Have seen many objects in the past make very fast sharp turns that known aircraft are not supposed to make. This pa!rticular sighting, the object  seemed to be either in a wedge formation or triangular shaped.From five miles out of town the lights appeared larger than than the street lights we could see in town.Once in town they appeared to be as big as a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My co-worker and I both work for the Dept. of ((Name deleted)).<n>

The light seemed to hopscotch on and off. The lights also all went off and reappeared about 10 miles east of the original sighting. York County Controll was notified and the local police did respond (with much ridicule). This year I saw a show about the Lights over Phoenix about the same time and these were the same lights as I saw, Im certain<n>

I would periodically look out my window for no reason in particular.  At one point looking out the window I saw a bright white sphere definately in our atmosphere.  This white sphere was motionless and far larger than any star.  Not shocked at this point I told my friend to take a look. He acknowledged it.  A moment later the object began to move slowly for ten seconds then rapidly southwest-soon out of sight.  We kept looking in the sky after that and a few moments later it all happend again.  Seemingly the same craft. And upon recognizing it, it did exactly what I previously described.  But this time, possible coincidence, a jet flew toward the S.W. as did the UFO.  We talked to each other for a moment and looked back at the sky.  We saw what I would decribe as a &#34;simon says&#34; game in the sky(blue yellow red green lights) This was certainly a craft and much larger than the spheres.  I started opening my door for a good look, as I did my friend screamed &#34;Oh my god!&#34;and pointed at door.  My door slammed shut on me and there were two Schnauzers(dogs) growling scratching on the door.as if preventing me to leave(it worked!)  I noticed three more of the SAME dogs over to the left.  Two sitting still, one running back and forth histarically in front of the &#34;sitters&#34;. the sitting dogs were looking at our car! There were NO owners around we did not see the dogs before the crafts, and I&#39;ve never seen so many dogs of same breed together unattended in my life! I believe I have had a &#34;screen memory&#34; as described in Whitley Striebers book Communion. Needless to say we started the car and got out of that park right away. The park was next to a highway and residentials, so it would be unbelievable if I had no second witness, but I did. I swear I saw all that I have written here.  All of this experience I will never forget, espescially the &#34;dogs&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two objects, possibly the same craft were bright white spheres.  The third was circular with four lights.  each light took approx. a quarter of the bottom of craft.  the lights were 1 red, 1green, 1blue, 1yellow.  I also saw five dogs that looked exatly the same. The first two spheres were motionless, then after being witnessed for a moment they took off until out of sight.  The &#34;simon says&#34; game did the same.  Two dogs pounded on my car door, two sat quietly in the distance, one ran back and forth like doing windsprints for football warmups. Three crafts observed, one jet observed, five dogs observed Two object bright white, one red,yellow,blue,green- jet color unknown-dogs grey and white my backround is a 19 year old male raised since three years old in Lincoln NE.

A large, silent, matte silver object appeared in our view approx. 200ft. in sky.  Hovered stationary and then moved very quickly away. It made a triangular pattern over the Ohio River and then went out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I described the object as egg shaped but in reality it was more like a large, blunt-tipped diamond shape.  We both agree on the events as they occurered, but my co-worker refuses to discuss the incident.  I remember us talking that day in amazement that no one was pulled off the road gaping at the object as it was quite large and mesmerizing. The object was matte silver, almost like pewter.  There was a glint from the sun but we could not see any features on the object.  It moved away so quickly that I did not notice it was moving, only &#34;getting harder to see&#34;.  We both agree that we had never seen anything like this before and that there was no easy explanation for it.  Another thing we thought strange was the time of day - around 1:00 pm, on a beautiful sunny day.  We are both social workers who work with troubled youth.  One last detail, I experienced no fear when viewing the object but weeks afterward became very fearful and &#34;paranoid&#34; about ufo&#39;s, aliens, etc.  (This is definitely NOT a typical baseline ideation for me!)Partially, this effect is still present which is why I don&#39;t think I can provide any contact information.<n>

They are not intended for others to see or judge me by. Please forgive me for writing down these observations.  I am a hard working man focused on making a living for my wife and family.  I do not make things up.  The observations I am writing about actually happened to me.  I was never going to write about them, but then today I decided to make a few quick notes about my experiences.  I have two college degrees in science and have worked in the medical field for over 30 years..<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 yrs ago, I lived with my wife in an upstairs apartment. I was the only one home that day. It was a spring day at about 10 AM.  I went to the bathroom and as I was leaving the bathroom, a bright orange object shot by me faster than my eyes could follow it.  It was about the size of a dime (0.25” diam), it came from my left(east to west) (bathroom window sill on left is about 5’ above floor and window was open) and went to my right at about shoulder height (decending at an angle of 10 deg toward the floor).  When I looked to the right to follow the object, it was gone in less than a split second and all I could see was the closed bathroom door. Needless to say, I was startled; the object came within 1 ft of me.  My eyes only gazed at the closed door for a second and since there was nothing to see, my eyes returned to the center (normal position).  Then, to my surprise, the orange ball streaked back in the opposite direction (to my left going west to east) toward the bathroom window.  Again it went so fast that my eyes couldn’t follow it.  I looked to my left and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident shook me up.  I have to admit that I was frightened and shaking for a few minutes. I immediately went to the bathroom window and looked down and up.  There was no one down below, all the surrounding buildings were only one story, (so no one from another building could be playing a prank on me with a laser pointer), and there were no airplanes or helicopters in the sky above. I left the bathroom and looked around the apartment and noticed that all the the windows had the drapes closed.  I immediately ran outside the building and looked around.  No one was there.  I wanted to knock on doors and ask neighbors if they saw anything, but I stopped myself.  I would have made a fool out of myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I calmed myself down,  I had a busy day of work ahead of me.  I tried to convince myself that I was just seeing things that weren’t really there (an optical illusion or a malfunction of my optic nerve, or brain).  But, the fact that the object came back and went the other way made me think it was real.  Still, to this very day I refuse to speculate on what it could have been.  The only thing I know for sure,is it did occur, and I try not to think about it.  I am only writing this down for my own notes about life.  About how things happen to people that can’t be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had this same bazaar experience a few weeks later, while I was walking out of my bedroom  in the hall between the bathroom, bedrooms and living room.  The orange ball flashed by me at about shoulder height. I can’t remember the exact direction it came from, but I do remember it was a different direction than the event in the bathroom.  I don’t remember if it went in front of me and then came back the other way as it did in the bathroom.  It occurred at about the same time (around 10:00 AM).  The hall was dimly lit as all the drapes were closed.  I was the only one home.  I was startled but not as scared as the previous time.  I looked around inside and outside the apartment as and found no one or nothing out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I even went to get my eyes checked after these experiences.  The doctor told me that a detached retina would be a blinding flash of white light over my entire visual field.  So this anomaly was not caused by a detached retina.  I don’t fantasize or make up stories to entertain myself so this was not the result of that.  In fact, I wish I had NOT experienced these events. Nevertheless, it did open my mind to the possibility that there are things going on around us that we may not be totally aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing like this ever happened to me before or since then.  It has been more than ten years since I observed this anomaly.  I was too busy to write down what happened at that time and I really shouldn’t be taking the time to write about it now.  I didn’t want to scare my wife, so I didn’t tell her what happened until a month later.  I just wanted to know if she had encountered anything like this.  She told me she had not seen or heard anything unusual.  At first she thought I was joking, but when she realized I was serious, she became frightened.  I calmed her down by telling her since nothing bad had happened to us, there was nothing to worry about.  This experience, changed the way I look at the real world.  It made me ask myself many questions: •	What if the orange ball that flashed past me would have me hit me?  Would it have damaged my body?  What if it had already hit me on another occasion and I didn’t know it? •	Why did I see it?  (I do not believe I was chosen to see it, or there was a message to me in seeing it, I think it was just a random event) Why did it flash by and then come back the way it came?  Why did I experience this anomaly twice?  It is pointless to speculate on the causes of this anomaly, so I try to put it out of my mind, but something tells me I should record these events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	Have other people encountered anything like this? •	What other things are going on that people observe, but dismiss them as illusions, or say to themselves, “What I just saw couldn’t have happened, so I must be seeing things.” Or people might think to themselves, “ It didn’t really happen, so I should just forget about it.  I better not tell anybody else about it, because they will think I am weird or crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My shift would start at ten pm and I would get off at six am. I like to finish off my shift by having some morning coffee with some of the employees of the cannery. After having my cup of coffee with the employees on this April morning I got on my security golf cart to finish my round. As I was driving out of the main packing shed I saw what at first appeared to be a helicopter shining a bright light over a company truck shop which was located about half a mile away from the plant. Many people were walking towards the plant because the morning shift began at six am, but only a few stood there looking at the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of the people that stood there looking at the light I singled out a supervisor. I got of my security golf cart and walked up to him and asked what he thought the “helicopter” was looking for (as for me, I knew this was no helicopter, even though the plant was located near highway 99 and we saw our share of high-speed chases, but this time, the light was not here in our sky as we know it, this light was coming from really high up in the sky)? The supervisor answered it was a space shuttle and it was going to land in the Mojave Desert. I answered by saying the light was very slightly moving towards the north east, and Mojave is to the south east. At this point he stayed quit and just watched the light. I then radioed my partner and asked him to take a look at the “helicopter” shining the light on the truck shop (when using the radio we needed to maintain serious due to management listening in on our radio conversations). My partner replied stating, “What the helicopter wanted?” I replied it was just the police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the light had moved from the truck shop and was now hovering over a peach orchard. The life span of this light was about fifteen minutes and then it just shut off. The source of the light went off but we could still see a beam coming down, and then it just began to fad away, kind of like fog. The best way I can describe this light is like a huge “Mag-Lit”. It was really bright and very intense white light that was more like a beam. We could see the source that is how we could determine that it wasn’t here, not even close to earth. There was no sound coming from the source, nor change in color, just very slight drifting movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents worked at a wine making company in the town of Livingston. Both of my parents worked in the vineyards. They too started their shift at six a.m. And they too saw what I saw, except they saw the source of the light. They along with about ten crew members witnessed the incident. They told me the source changed colors. It changed from dark blue to purple, to orange, to red. They could see the light beaming down but couldn’t see the movement that we saw at the cannery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a long time Art-Bell listener and never did I hear a caller call in on this incident. I checked the evening news casts and the local newspapers in the surrounding areas, and there was nothing covering the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At that time we were starring at the sky when I noticed a diamond shaped set of lights headed northwest from our position. At first i didnt think it was a ufo until it veerd northward. My girlfriend is`nt the kind to believe in ufo`s, but she came to believe in what she saw that night. About 5 or 10 minutes later we saw it again, this time headed southeast, faster than the speed we witnessed before. About that time my girlfriend`s stepmother showed up and asked her to stay awhile longer to see the sighting we witnessed. After 10 minutes, it never occured again. The object (from our veiw) had 7 lights , one at the point and three on each side. I could not determine the size of what i call a wingspan, but if was to stand next to it, i am sure it was very large by comparison. My girlfriend eventually had to leave for work, but i still stayed to see the event again till late that nite(3a.m.) which did not happen.<n>

Between 02:15 AM - 02:30 AM I was driving my crappy, navy blue &#39;91 hyundai excel on Interstate 287 North between the town of Edison and Piscataway with my friend who would also be a witness.  This part of the interstate is elevated to the point of being a small bridge and so provided us with a good view.  My approximations of distances between the ground up is based on the elevated point from which I and my friend stood. The cloud cover at this time of night was very dense and extremely low, moving at 25 to 30 mph.  The lowest clouds were only 200 to 300 yards above.  It was a very rare sight to see this type of cloud cover here in New Jersey as it is usually only seen in the more southern areas of the United States.  I commented on such nebulous formations to my friend as he too looked up into the sky.  Soon after, I noticed a large light patiently appear from out between the clouds about a 1/4 of a mile away.  I started analyzing it&#39;s most awkward arrival with extreme precision.  My thoughts and analyzations were as follows: There&#39;s a light the size of a street lamp light up in the clouds... It&#39;s a Fire Ball!!! No...it&#39;s moving too slow, it would of hit by now. The light that it&#39;s emitting is equal to that of a street lamp. Why is it floating above the lowest clouds and under the highest ones? To this I would point and yell to my friend of the unexplainable sight.  We were both frantic. But not as frantic as when the second light appeared from out of the clouds.  I pulled over immediately for us to get a better observation.  It was at this point that we could both see more than just light.  It was an actual physical object.  Very Dark Gray, slightly darker than the clouds.  Once the third light  finally exposed itself we were able to fully identify the shape of the floating object.  It was a perfect triangle.  The lights were located at the ends of each angle, but the angles were not pointed. The were rounded off. My friend and I were sobbing, crying in sheer terror, but we were more overwhelmed with happiness for we knew we were taking part in witnessing the unbelievable. Once we were both able to make full visual contact of the object we became very serious in order to obtain more visual information.  I will now become more descriptively technical so that there is no misunderstanding as to where I was positioned according to the &#34;object&#39;s&#34; location and my own. Going North on 287 we pulled over to witness the clouds come in from the North West and move South East.  The object also moved in this direction.  It moved in a straight linear axis from left to right where we were standing.  But while it was on this axis it rotated 360 degrees clockwise, patiently, without a sound.  All of a sudden the object in its immense proportions snaps into a perfect 90 degree turn and would begin to rotate instantly into a Counter Clockwise rotation North East from us.  In essence, the object&#39;s movements were perfectly geometric.  And so it was with this turn that it would make it&#39;s decent into the thickness of the low cloud cover. We could not tell of the object&#39;s full dimensions, for we witnessed it from below.  If it was the bottom of the craft that we may have been looking at then we do know for a fact that it appeared flat.  Nothing protruded from it in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, but was in April 1997.  We spoke with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  PD))<n>

An aircraft of some sort appeared suddenly, sped across the sky at an unbelievable rate of speed, and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister was the first to notice the object as she was scanning the sky to see if she could catch a glimpse of the Hale-Bop comet, when she grabbed my arm and told me to look.  I glanced up at the sky towards the east and saw what I thought to be a small airplane taking off from the local Sarnia Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was probably only about 300 or so feet off the ground, well below the scattered clouds.  It flew slow at first, and I noticed a very bright white light, which looked like it was coming from the side of the craft due to it&#39;s direction.  The light flickered very quickly a few times, went out and then came back on.  It was flying quite slow at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden it accellerated, darted across the sky towards the west and Michigan untill we couldn&#39;t see it any more.  It looked to have four light type things, one at the front, back, and the side facing us.  The light at the side was a very bright white light, that looked like it was sort of pointed downward!  It was very loud and sounded like a gigantic jet engine roaring extremely loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights on the front and on the back were much dimmer, and looked to be green.  Judging by the lights on it, it looked to me like it was sort of round or had very short wings.  What I mean is that all the lights looked as though they were exactly the same distance apart giving it a square or circular looking shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew further away from us there looked to be a cluster of about 20 small white lights giving off an enormous glare.  It looked like it was about the same size as a fighter plane would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once whatever it was sped up it moved across the sky faster than anything I&#39;ve seen and within about 15 seconds was too far away for us to see.  Neither my sister nor I have ever seen what we thought to be an alien craft or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Particularly, I am a very logical and scientific person who needs to see something to really believe it.  I recently had an argument with a friend who was trying to convince me that there are such things as bearded ladies.  My arguement to her was that I would never be able to truly believe something like that unless I saw it with my own eyes in person, because how can you really know?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My point is that if I wouldn&#39;t have seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed it.  I am usually very sceptical of UFO sightings and stuff on tv because the stories always have to many holes, and of course I had never seen one.  I have a 156 I.Q. and have always been thought of as very clear minded and mature far beyond my years.<n>
4/8/97 20:00|Las Vegas|NV|Rectangle|15 sec|large, erratic, black object, movement reminiscent of paper falling, almost invisible edge on.|9/26/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02567.html|64|ndxe199704| Summary : large, erratic, black object, movement reminiscent of paper falling, almost invisible edge on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hmmmm- perhaps you can help clear up an incident that has been nagging at me.  I was attending the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas starting 4/5/97- I believe it was Tuesday the 8th, about 8pm, I looked out the window of the Flamingo Hilton and saw what looked to like a dark piece of paper caught in an updraft. It shifted erratically in a descending pattern and at times almost disappeared from view when it was &#34;on edge&#34;. As the object moved lower and it became framed by the backdrop of mountains I came to the conclusion that it was much farther away than I had initially thought and well outside of the city.  I tried to reassess the scale of the object, but found it difficult. At a guess I would say the object was 15 or more miles from the city and looked like a windblown piece of construction paper at 100 feet. The scale of horizontal and vertical shifts in trajectory also took on the appearance of a much greater distance and considerable implied ! speed. The object dissappeared from view perhaps 10-15 seconds after initial siting. Perhaps 2 or 3 minutes later 2 sets of dual vapor trails emmerged along the horizon and as they reached the point where the object appeared to have descended the planes (these were obviously planes and what looked to be military planes) forked out in opposite directions. I mentioned it to a couple of colleagues in the airport the next day on the return to Seattle, a woman in line overheard me and suggested that it could have been a Stealth aircraft. Could be- my impression was that if it was &#34;a plane &#34; it was only a piece of it- perhaps a wing. I am not convinced that I saw a &#34;flying saucer&#34;. But by any definition it was an unidentified flying/airborn object that evoked a military response. Do you have any other reports of objects seen or military maneuvers in that locality at that time?<n>

Solar flares had been in the news starting April 7 and it was soon thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Exactly overhead I noticed an aberation moving across the sky.  A solar flare I thought.  But after watching it I noticed the well defined shape and that it had a couple of distinct characteristics. It was shaped like a long boomerang, but wasn&#39;t quite as angled, and it spanned a substantial section of the sky.  It looked matte black or dark gray. The entire inside edge was very sharp and the center section (perhaps 5-10% of the entire thing) seemed very hazy whereas the rest of the object was well defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved from south to north to the west of Sonoma as if following the I-5 Corridor  ((sic.  See below.  PD))  It continued north moving very fast, it was about 4 seconds until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore as it began to merge with the just-after-dusk sky. It was very high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to get my sister and she came out and we both looked. Within seconds we saw two planes together coming from the north. When they got to about halfway between where I first and last saw the object, one of the planes split off sharply and headed west. The other plane continued south. The planes appeared to be at the same height as the object and like most planes that high up, they just appeared as spots of light. In contrast the object had spanned an entire section of the sky which is why I thought initially it was a visual aberation from solar flares. (That could have something to do with an aura, but I didn&#39;t specifically see one.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and figured the size by triangulation. I think it came out to somewhere between a mile or 2 wide. Somehow the size, height and speed had combined to make it feel very heavy and deliberate, like it was doing surveillance. It made me feel as if I had seen it, but it had also seen me. As if I&#39;d inadvertantly and unintentially had a conscious exchange, like when I catch someone&#39;s eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t jacuzzi at night for months afterward so I wouldn&#39;t be available for another encounter.

It was the brightest and most white light I’d ever seen (and still have ever seen to this day, some 12 years later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes I realized it was still there, directly in front of me, maybe 20 miles ahead.  It was very low on the horizon and now I started to wonder what it might be.  I discarded aircraft because there are no headlights this bright, and even if they were, they’d have to be flying directly southbound over I-35, which I doubt they’d do.  I thought it might be a commercial spotlight that somehow had been pushed downward, aiming straight at me, but I couldn’t see any beam projecting from the source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling around 70mph and getting closer to it by the minute.  After about 10 minutes I realized that the light was not stationary.  It was slowly moving westward, to my left.  I was really mesmerized by this thing now, and couldn’t for the life of me figure out what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got much closer, I pulled the car over, turned off the engine and got out.  The craft was triangular in shape, and maybe the width of two to three 737 planes wing-to-wing.  What first struck me was that it was completely silent.  If the light hadn’t attracted my attention, you never would have known it was there.  It was slowly moving, almost drifting, south-westerly, maybe 500 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing that struck me is that now, from underneath, I could no longer see the white light, but instead saw 3 different colored lights, one on each top of the triangle.  One was red, one was green and the other yellow, all solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood in awe, a patrol car pulled off the road onto the shoulder coming southbound.  The officer got out and stood looking up at the craft, just as I was doing.  I jumped back into the car and drove right thru the grass, crossing the median and onto the southbound side.  While this was completely against the law, the officer and I didn’t even discuss it.  We just stood there staring at the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, as it was moving away from us, we could no longer see the 3 colored lights on the tips of the triangle.  All you could see from the back was a much larger, round red light in the center of the craft that was slowly pulsating.  I couldn’t make out how tall the craft was, just the approximate width.  The slowly pulsating red light was almost hypnotic, but our attention was broken by the arrival of a 2nd patrol car, this one the State Police.  He too got out and watched the craft moving away.  I asked them if they’d already checked with Austin-Bergstrom airport, and they had, reporting now commercial traffic anywhere near here or anything like what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more minutes of the two officers discussing their confusion and fascination, I jumped in my car and headed back down I-35 from where I’d just come.  I chased the craft for a few more minutes, driving about 70mph again, as it was now getting further and further off to my right (westerly).  I finally pulled off the highway and tried going down a side road to head more westerly, but by then it had disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t see anything about it in the papers, despite looking thru the Austin American Statesman for days afterwards.  I wish I’d gotten the names of the officers who witnessed this with me, but I didn’t.  I was too taken by what I was seeing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

At about 2pm, looking south out over the harbor at the south shore of milwaukee on a clear, sunny afternoon on 4/7/97, I noticed what looked like either an extremely relective object or the other alternative would be to describe it as a large ball of sparks descend from the sky, move along the tree line north to the south shore harbor where it descened further, skimmed across the water a short distance and then either descended into the water or simply burned out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was trying to figure out what I had seen, I noticed another object which looked the same, perform almost the exact same manuvuer.

No sound, no animal reaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1997 040X 1400 D Fairhope, AL, US FINAL REPORT The following was obtained by telephone interview with the witness on April 21, 1997. The sighting took place on or about April 5, 1997 in Fairhope, Alabama (Baldwin County) at 2:00 pm (central time). The witness reported this sighting to the Fairhope Courier and to Clompton Jones of MUFON. The details reported to those sources varies from those reported to this writer. This investigator cannot account for those variances. The witness stated he was walking his dog on the streets of Fairhope on a Saturday afternoon, although the witness, when pressed, could not remember the exact date. He believes April 5 to be the approximate date. The witness reported the weather as &#34;sunny and clear,&#34; with a breeze. The witness stated he was walking west toward Mobile Bay. As he was about to cross the street, the witness observed the object west of his position (in front of the witness), at an elevation of approximately 30 . The object was reported to be &#34;the length of the Fairhope pier&#34; from the witness, and was drifting very slowly to the north. After viewing the object for 30 seconds to one minute, the object continued to move north and disappeared behind foliage. No sound was reported. There was no reaction from his dog. The object was described as &#34;generally tire-shaped,&#34; round, light greyish-beige in color, with a row of 8 to 10 square black windows with a blue frame around them. The apparent size of the object was reported to be the same as an object one inch long held at arm&#39;s length. No other external details, appendages, etc. were reported. This case was initially investigated by Ross VonVolkenburg (MUFON). Duncan Crow obtained a telephone interview with the witness and submitted this report.<n>

I don&#39;t recall the exact date, but Hale-Bopp was pretty bright, the weather wasn&#39;t too cool and it was mostly overcast and windy (westerly) that day and clear that night (around Columbus, GA). Anyway, I left work in Midtown Atlanta and as I approached my truck I looked up at the sky, hoping it would clear by night and noticed in a clear area first 3 objects that were stationary in a triangle formation and then a 4th object that was nearby them and to the south of the three. I saw these objects as I was facing the west and they were to the NE of me, pretty high up. They where all alike, silver spheres and intially were stationary. They looked like many of the objects in home movies objects seen in Mexico. I framed them against a tall building to see if they were moving and they were not. The wind was moving the clouds at a pretty good rate so I didn&#39;t think they were ballons. They seemed above the clouds. Then, one by one, they slowly moved to the south. As they started moving and with all the cloud cover, I lost them pretty quickly. I wished I had a pair of binoculars and the next week I put a pair in the truck. The next week, looking for the objects as I was heading to the parking lot, I saw a similar object that with the naked eye looked like a silver sphere. It was lower and moving faster then the first objects that had seemed to almost drift. Through the binoculars it looked like it had a small red tail. The only thing I could think of is that it was a helicopter. But the original group seemed too high for helicopters unless they have pressurized cabins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

With me was my mothe|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38544.html|76|ndxe199704| I was driving down a stretch of highway, just outside of regina. I was about an hour or so from reaching moosejaw. With me was my mother, and two sisters. In the distance ahead, I could see what looked to be a fog or smoke. I asked my mother if she could see it as well, and she to saw it. I thought that It may be smoke from a brush fire. As the car entered the smoke, or fog, I noticed that there was no smell to it at all. I found that to be very strange. If It was smoke, you would have smelled it. All of sudden on the the left hand side of the road, in the ditch area, appeared what looked to a spinning fireball. The center of the ball was a darkish orange, the outer part of it was like a lighter orange, almost yellow. All of us seen it, and were very shocked by it&#39;s quick appearance. I was not to sure what to think about it. But my thoughts of wonder, soon turned to fear, when I noticed the ball was about two feet above the brush in the ditch. So including the depth of the ditch, this ball was hovering about six feet off the ground. There was no fire, just a hovering bright ball, letting off a myst of some sort. It wasn&#39;t a hard decision, to step on the gas, and get away from that area as quickly as possible. If that wasn&#39;t strange enough, what happened afterwards was beyond crazy. We had cleared the haze, or myst, what ever it was. In the distance behind me, I could see in my rear view mirror, two head lights. I remember thinking to myself, did they see what we just saw? The next thing I knew, the headlights were right at the back of the car. I thought again to myself, this guy is movin. So i moved as far to the right as I possibly could, to let him pass. Along side of my car, came a black semi trailer. No markings, with blacked out windows. This truck pulled in front of the car, and reduced it&#39;s speed so quickly, I had to slam on my breaks. I though maybe he had experianced some problems or something. So I went to pass him. he swerved right into the lane I was going to make the pass in, almost hitting the front of my car. When I reduced my speed and went back into the right hand lane, the truck did the exact same thing. Out of no where, from the top of the trailer, two lights appeared, they looked like what may be dock lights, that a semi driver may use to back into a bay. They were bright, and hurt the eyes. Then from the top and sides of the trailer, a unknown substance was being released towards the car. I remember not being able to see, and almost bringing the car to a complete stop. The substance cleared, and to my surprise, the trailer was right in front of me, with no more bright lights. I remember switching lanes, and speeding as fast as I could past the truck. I looked in the mirror, and saw the headlights behind me. When I took a second glance back. They were gone. We soon after pulled into the truck stop in Moosejaw. I remember getting out of the car, and waiting for the semi to come up the highway, it never did show. As I said at the start, we were an hour or so out of Moosejaw when this happened. When I looked at my watch in the truck stop, nearly four hours had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We went to sleep &lt;we all slept on a pallet in my room&gt; and I woke up around 12am because there was a bright light in my room, but I guess I fell back to sleep because I don&#39;t remember getting up to investigate....the next thing I remember is waking up and everything was pitch black...so naturally I went to sit up to figure out why...but there was this pressure on my chest keeping me from sitting up. When I put my hand out in front of me to see what it was....it scared me to death...The covers had been wrapped tightly around me including my head and I was completely UNDER my bed. I started screaming and crying of course and everyone woke up and my mom and my friends had to get me out...  explain that.  You couldn&#39;t get under my bed just by rolling underneathe it.  An average size human head won&#39;t even fit in between the floor and the bed...PLUS, if someone had jokingly put me there, I am a light sleeper usually, I think I would&#39;ve felt that.???? So, Anyway a few days later we had another spend the night party at one of the girl&#39;s houses and we had stayed up late...well I went to bed before any of them.  I probably hadn&#39;t been asleep a whole hour when they came running in their screamin &#34;Their after you!  They followed you here!&#34;  &lt;we were convinced that the previous incident was in some way connected with extraterrestrials.&gt;  I got up and went into the kitchen &lt;the live in a rural part of the county&gt;  and I saw lights flashing beyond the treeline.  It wasn&#39;t lights like the ones that blink on an airplane or helicopter.  They were much bigger and there were many of them.  I can&#39;t say exactly how many, more than one, less than 10.  They kept pulsing red and white. and at some points they seemed to come closer like they knew we were watching.  I know what I saw was not an airplane.  I couldn&#39;t make out the shape because the light was so bright, but if I had to guess I would say sphere based on the shape of the light.  They hovered and moved around the treeline for about 5 minutes and then flew up and dissappeared.  Both of the girl&#39;s begged me to go home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of them are very honest people and were very confused about the incident.  I don&#39;t think any of us still understand...I haven&#39;t seen anything since then nor have I had any weird things happen, I just wondered if maybe anything was reported about this as well?  There have been many UFO sightings along the Natchez Trace which runs directly beside the town I live in...my mother and my stepfather have witnessed strange objects hovering along the Trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were aprox 50 miles away travelling extremely fast thru a 90 degree arc in aprox 10 sec. One turned sharply right then sharply left back to its  original course. The other followed seemingly to the millimetre. Finally at about s/w they turned right &amp; disapeared into the distance. I rang the Victorian UFO Society who had received reports of UFO&#39;s in the areas we viewed 40 to 50 miles away. My son also witnessed them. Too fast &amp; cornered too sharp to be anything we Know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just prior to closing shop I had been informing the boys about comet Hale Bopp which should be visible at the end of the month; this conversation natuarally induced me to look at the sky once exiting the factory. The first thing which I believe caught the corner of my eye from the N/W was the speed of the two objects then the colour. I stared at them trying to define what they were. My curiosity turned to astonishment when one object turned hard right. ( I then yelled to my son &#34; check out the pink lights&#34; which he sighted directly without assistance) the object then banked hard left to its original course. To further my astonishment was the second object which followed the first through its flight path seemingly to the millimeter as if they were playing follow the leader. The objects continued on their course until they were aprox s/w where they turned right and rapidly disapeared into the distance.1/ Due to comprehending(as best my mind can) distance to the nearest star 4.2 LY which may support planets  I have never really believed in UFO&#39;s. Now not so sure.2/I am an amatuer astronomer &amp; therefore familiar with the night sky; I know the differance between stars,planets,satelites,lights &amp; reflections,planes, balloons, distance etc. These objects were definately none of the above.3/I would estimate these objects to be aprox 50 miles away.4/Today I received notification of one sighting in Werribee &amp; 2 sightings in Melton verifying our sighting and placing the objects at the same time and flight path.5/They travelled thru an arc of about 90 degrees in about 10 secs aprox 50 miles away.Too fast for anything known to me.6/They were at aprox 40 deg altitude.7/ They cornered to sharply for anything known to me. Very direct 45deg right/45 deg left- no arc.8/Referring to a map with the information available it is possibble they did a Zig-Zag turn to avoid flying directly over Melton or another small town in that proximity.9/It was possible to see they were solid egg shaped objects emitting a pinkish glow.10/They were to far away for sound if they making any.11/Both I (age 40) &amp; my son (age 20) believe what we saw to be controlled flight, flying solid objects without obvious propulsion  outside the limitations of anything we know.<n>

Object was about the size of a Large fighter jet or small executive jet such as a learjet. The craft was of a shiny polished mettalic appearance it was travelling at a much higher than normal speed for a landing aircraft (est 400-500mph.) Altitude appeared to be about 800 to 1000 feet.coming from due north, . the craft overflew the north south runway of the airport then made a sharp left turn and went out of sight heading east towards Savannah Ga.Ther was no engine noise, no visible exhaust, no propellers. Seen from the side the craft appeared to have short stubby wings or none at all. the fuselage was more rounded or domed than normal aircraft, although It did not appear to have the classic saucer shape. I Have worked at Gulfstream aerospace and have seen a wide variety of aircraft landing and taking off at Savannah Intenational, and have never seen an aircraft of this type before.<n>

The game just had gone off at 11:00p Central time and I was laying down. At 11:05p my dad came into my room and said, &#34;Ryan, get up! You have to see this!&#34; I went running outside thinking I would finally get to see a tornado because it was storming that night and the wind was really high. But as I stepped onto the porch everything was really calm. I said, &#34;What is it?&#34; He said, &#34;Look!&#34;. I looked to my right which was SSE. There was a clump of trees about 40 or 50 feet tall and through the branches I could see two lights. The lights appeared to be relatively close and about the size of dimes. As I kept on watching these two lights came directly over the trees heading NNE...right at me. As it came across my field of view it was moving really slowly. I realized that it wasn&#39;t making any kind of sound at all. From the corner of the deck the object was in front of us maybe as far away as the highway(about 100 yards) and maybe only 75-100 feet in the air. REALLY low and REALLY close not to be making any noise. The object appeared to be short and fat. It continued on its current heading until it reached what I figured to be almost to the interstate(I-40). There it stopped. Stayed motionless for at least 5 seconds, then darted to the west, stopped for another second or two. Then disappeared. The whole time we could see the lights. Even as it traveled away from us. Dad called the Sherriff&#39;s Dept. and asked if anyone else had reported seeing anything like that. The person told him that a guy in New Middleton had called just before we did and told the same story. New Middleton is right off the interstate about 6 miles from where we live.<n>

It inspired me to undertake an independent video documentary project about UFOs...

I also later learned that 4/1/97 was the perehelion of the Hale-Bopp Comet!<n>

I am Native American and we were having a drum and dance social event.  I was singing with the other singers when one of the drummers pointed to the northwest and said “Oh my god! Look at that!”  I turned and looked it was night time out when I turned and looked I thought we would be crushed in a few seconds by the enormous ship we saw.  It seemed to be landing.  It was so enormous I can only say that it looked like a large metropolis landing.   It made no sound but had a strange energy that you could “sense or feel”.  It had millions of little lights all over it and in many colors.  It was like a city because it was not a uniform shape.  It had many appendages and parts to it.  It was so big it seemed to nearly block out that part of the sky.  I was standing there and just complete shock hit me.  That is all I remember.  When we “came to” or became conscious again I felt dazed and like the memory of it was fading so quickly that I had to meditate quickly to hold it in my mind.  Everyone else seemed to just go back to what they were doing and when I tried to get them to talk about it or even come with me to go search for it, they seemed like zombies.  At the time I was pregnant, I don’t know if that was a factor in how I might have been treated if we were abducted or if our minds were manipulated at all.  I was a peer counselor at the time at the schools student drop in center “The Healing Circle”.  I ran A.A. meetings and held traditional “Talking Circles” for the Native students who needed support emotionally and we had our own licensed Psychologist on staff as well.  He was standing right next to me and witnessed this too. I believe we lost some time too. He was the only one who wanted to go running after this thing.  I eventually convinced some friends who were not there to witness it to take me to look for it.  We rode around in the car for a bout two hours.  We couldn’t find anything and it should have been right on top of us if! it was going to really land anyway.  While we were driving around we did see military jets circling the area for quite awhile.  I believe people called the radio stations and 911 too.  I can’t confirm that though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest thing was that I did forget the incident for about 5 years I could not remember it.  One day I was working with some youth, I am now a social worker, we were driving toward Minneapolis’s downtown and we could see the skyline.  We were talking about strange things like Bigfoot and UFO’s when suddenly the memory came flooding back instantly.  I was overwhelmed and that same shocked feeling came over me. I still don’t remember what happened though between the times I saw it landing and then the next second “poof!” it was just gone, completely vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported this before.  I found this website and thought it was time to tell the story.  I have looked online for a picture of a UFO that would be similar to what I saw but I haven’t.  I am Native American and my tribe believes in Aliens completely.  I do too, especially now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Saw something with red lights along the side and a white light in front rise from trees a half mile away.  Rose slowly, then moved horizontally out over the water for about ten minutes at a slow pace.  When it came over land, it moved extremely fast, then slowed down again over water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept up this circular pattern the whole time.  It was visible for over an hour. Made a jet engine whine, but very faint. There was a gravel road built up out of the water (the way they do down there) and the ship seemed to cross it a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad drove us down to look.  We found an Air Force car and a uniformed man who refused to acknowledge the thing we were pointing at.  He said there were just &#39;some boys out here drinking beer&#39;, and he wouldn&#39;t let us go any farther.  The craft was clearly visible, but he wouldn&#39;t even look over his shoulder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove back to camp, and my boyfriend took a walkie-talkie with him and walked back down the road to see if he could get closer on foot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft crossed over the road above him when I was talking to him on the radio.  The radio cut out, and he came running back in a panic.  The radio worked again as soon as the craft moved on. Eventually, the craft dropped down, out of sight, like a balloon landing.  It was no balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we asked the campground manager the next day, he shrugged it off. &#34;We see a lot of things around here. Nobody pays any attention anymore.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I IMMEDIATELY REALIZED THAT THE &#34;LIGHT&#34; WAS MOVING MUCH FASTER THAN THE ONCOMING VEHICLEAND ASSUMED THAT IT WAS A LARGE AIRPLANE MAKING AN EMERGENCY LANDING. THE SUN HAD JUST SET AND I COULD NOT SEE THE BODY OF THE &#34;CRAFT&#34;, IF THERE WAS ONE. I AWAKENED MY PASSENGER AND, TO AVOID GETTING IN THE PATH OF THIS, BRAKED AND RAN OFF THE ROAD AS FAR AS I COULD GO. THE ONCOMING VEHICLE DID THE SAME. THE &#34;LIGHT&#34; PASSED OVERHEAD WITHOUT A SOUND AND PROBABLY NOT MORE THAN FIFTY FEET. WE HEARD NOTHING AT ALL AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE LIGHT. WHY WE DID NOT SPEAK TO THE OTHER DRIVER I DO NOT RECALL, BUT RETURNED TO THE ROAD AFTER WE CAUGHT OUR BREATH AND STARTED THE JEEP, WHICH I ASSUMED DIED FOR LACK OF PUSHING THE CLUTCH IN UPON STOPPING. I WOULD DESCRIBE THE LIGHT AS BEING ABOUT FOUR TO NINE FEET IN DIAMETER, BRIGHT BLUE, AND TRAVELING IN EXESS OF ONE HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR LESS THAN FIFTY FEET OFF OF THE ROAD AND FOLLOWING THE HIGHWAY. I DO NOT RECALL IF I CLOSED MY EYES BRACING FOR AN IMPACT BUT, DID LOOK TO SEE IT BEHIND US IMMEDIATELY AND SAW NO LIGHTS FROM THE REAR.<n>

We were in a chevy truck driving with the windows down.  As we were leaving the school, my friend that was sitting to my right noticed a some lights at just above the tree tops across the street approx. fifty yards.  He then asked &#34;When did they build a water tower there?&#34; My friend that was driving respond quickly that, &#34;that is not a water tower!&#34; At that moment this unidentified object took off to the north of where we were about 150 yards above the ground.  We drove down the McNeil road, driving east trying to catch up with the object.  It flew northest and then flew north along I-35, the turned north west. It was then that we lost sight of it.  The lights were in a triangle shape. All lights on the object were white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Witness may describe the object that was reported to NUFORC over Round Rock and Flower Mound, TX, in May (??) 1997.  PD))<n>
4/1/97 04:00|Houston|TX|Other|1-2 minutes|Large Bus sized cloud - emanating several beautiful colors from center but not making it past outer edge of the cloud 2 minute sighting|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31954.html|92|ndxe199704| Large Bus sized cloud - emanating several beautiful colors from center but not making it past outer edge of the cloud 2 minute sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting was a night of a perfectly clear night, except one small cloud (size of a city bus). This cloud was about as high as a high rise, floating about 20 M.P.H. or so. Lights of several colors (beautiful reds, greens, blues and others) were emanating from center but not leaving the outer edge of the cloud. After viewing it for over a minute (over my left shoulder), I took my eyes off of it to execute a freeway change (I was traveling North on Loop 610 on West side of Houston, fixing to exit and travel South on Hwy 59) 30 sec. or so I resumed to observe it. The cloud was nowhere to be seen! I was riding a motorcycle at the time and had 360 degree view of my surroundings. I later saw an interview with the actor &#34;Sinbad&#34;. He stated that when he was a boy, he saw the same thing over a neighbors house hovering...Him being 35 yrs old or more at the time and me seeing mine within the last year(at the time) I figure this model hasn&#39;t changed for approx. 30 years! Thinking back, it may have been ours, a balloon with a projection of a cloud made around it (explaining the lights I saw). But it was a brightly moonlit night (I could tell that it was only cloud in area). How did it leave area so fast, there was no sign of it? Did we have that technology 30 years previous and the public still has been yet to have been enlightened? Please send me any information of this type of craft...mine and Sinbad&#39;s are the only two that I know of. It is driving me crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/1/97 01:00|Foster|VA|Cigar|2 minutes|From Halle-Bopp's distance, a huge ship sped into the atmosphere, slowed silently and closely overhead, and zoomed back into space.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71204.html|93|ndxe199704| From Halle-Bopp&#39;s distance, a huge ship sped into the atmosphere, slowed silently and closely overhead, and zoomed back into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1:00 a.m. on April 1, 1997, I decided to go out my back door in Mathews, Virginia to observe the comet, Hale-Bopp. As I was watching to the north sky, I saw something come from what appeared to be from the comet (or behind it). At first, I laughed at thinking a plane was offering me an illusion it was coming from space. As seconds rolled past, I noticed it appeared to drop into the atmosphere and was coming closer and fast. In addition, the vessel had no blinking lights-just solid ones. I remember thinking no plane could travel that fast, for it had flown from the comet to a distant plane distance in less than one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spacecraft quickly dropped to just above the vast forest behind the house, quickly slowing down and coming my way. As it approached, it looked like a plane with solid lights, maybe two lights. I had time to think it through that this slow ship just sped in from space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise, the spaceship dropped to just above the trees and passed in a straight line over my head.  It passed so slow that I watched the nose go over my head. It was not very wide, and it was almost silent.  All I could hear was a low roar.  The trees did not move from the wind. The body kept getting wider.  I was looking straight up at the dark colored spaceship. It could not have been more than 200 feet in the air.  I kept telling myself to be calm.  I was exhilarated with curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wing I viewed as the right wing spanned across the house and yard.  The left wing spanned over the neighbor’s yard.   As the wings passed over, I noted the wings were a smooth part of the ship and pointed slightly forward.  As the spaceship revealed its back, I saw a large and brightly lit rectangular window with rounded edges.  All I could see was a wall of something at the back. I kept thinking it was a computer wall or something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, what appeared to be faster than when it sped in, the spaceship left.  After the ship passed, it made a sudden jump into the sky, curving NNE and then NE and the East and shot over the Chesapeake Bay into space.  In less than five seconds, I saw the ship jump out of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately drew pictures and started researching.  I wanted to report the sighting, but I stopped talking about it, because when I did, I faced ridicule or ignorance.  I never reported it until now. Was this ship observing the comet, and did this ship take a side excursion to Earth because we were so close?  How could a ship travel so fast, quietly slowing to the speed of a slow car quietly, and speed back into space?<n>
4/1/97 00:00|Gardena|CA|Other|still|Many small lights in sky all the time,unsure what.Fire flylike,some dark  some white,move fast.Not everyone can see them.Dont understan|9/12/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09463.html|94|ndxe199704| Many small lights in sky all the time,unsure what.Fire flylike,some dark  some white,move fast.Not everyone can see them.Dont understand why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been seeing small lights in the night sky sense the summer of 1997.This is going to sound crazy but they almost seem like they play hide &amp; seek with me,popping out from behind a tree or pole &amp; jumping back behind again. Like they know I&#39;m looking at them. I have tried to show people but most can&#39;t see &amp; laugh.Two others have been able to see them. Sometimes there are hundreds of them &amp; other times 1 or 2. I don&#39;t know how far away they are.I have seen them following the power lines in my back yard, and also off in the distence &amp; they always look the same, like a tiny dot of light. A lot of times I see them off to the west where  bright lights are lighting the sky. They shoot up &amp; down quickly, and seem to hang around the lights till dawn. They sometimes look like they are following a plain that is flying past following behind it. They hang in the clouds when clouds are in the sky, and when there are no clouds they seem to form a type of cloud around them to hide in. I don&#39;t know what it is I have been seeing. I can&#39;t fig. it out. I hope you don&#34;t think I&#39;m crazy or making this up. I just want to know what it is that I have been seeing for the past two years. If you have heard of anything like this please let me know what it might be.<n>
