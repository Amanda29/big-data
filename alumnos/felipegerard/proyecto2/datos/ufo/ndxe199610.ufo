Erratic.|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01638.html|1|ndxe199610| An on-duty security officer at a major hospital went outdoors to patrol the parking lot from 0200 to 0300 hrs..  At about 0215 hrs., he estimates, he saw a peculiar blue light, which he estimated to be about 100 yards from his location.  It was visible between two trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He jumped out of his truck, ran into the parking lot, and he got a better look at the object.  It was a blue light, moving very slowly, approximately 100 feet above the ground.  It was moving from his left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was out at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved in front of a cloud, so it was silhouetted against the light colored cloud, at which point the observer could see its shape.  It was distinctly square in shape.  The observer described the object as looking like a &#34;coffee table (round?) with a smaller rectangular box on top--like a shirt box.&#34;  Box was about 1/3 the size (diameter?) of the round part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then moved away from him, the observer estimating that it may have moved approximately 1/4 mile in one second.  It then hovered for a short period of time, then it streaked toward the observer, coming within 100 feet of his position, this time, and still about 100 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then moved to the left, then the right, moving &#34;like a bug in the wind--erratically.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew over the tope of the hospital and disappeared from the observer&#39;s sight.<n>

The other entry has it dated 10/30/1996 however I was a young kid Trick-Or-Treating at the time and I&#39;m nearly positive it was the night of Halloween 1996.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a large group of family were walking down the street trick-or-treating we spotted 3 stationary lights in the sky. The lights were seen through cloud cover so no actual object was seen, and I can&#39;t be sure if the lights belonged to one object or multiple objects. The 3 lights were flashing in sequence, however I can&#39;t remember in which direction. The other report states it was right to left, but I honestly can&#39;t remember that detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we heard on the news that many others had seen the lights and there was no explanation for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That night there were a lot of stars out in the sky with no clouds or anything.  I&#39;ve been looking up the sky a lot and all of the sudden I see this big bright white light shining and then and make in incredible loud noise and zoomed westward from where I was.  It had all bunch of colors when the white light zoomed off in the sky, just like a rainbow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked and could not believe how I saw something that cool in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that night I asked my mom and step-dad if they saw the white light zooming in the sky.  They said they only heard a loud screeching and so did my friends.  My friends said that they think it was a bunch of kids lighting up fireworks, but how could fireworks just zoom in the middle of the sky with a bunch of colors?<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was one of the best nights I&#39;ve ever had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I could tell from human awareness that there was life there. I watched and suddly the circle of light move like no way I have seen a plane or any aircraft move before. It was gone behind the clouds, whoever or what ever it was try to hide it self from the people on the ground.

Big; solid.|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01601.html|5|ndxe199610| Young girl and male friend were sitting in a car facing south, when they saw two lights in the sky.  There were two solid, white lights, one on each side of the object, and a flashing red light in the middle.  They had the impression that the light was approaching their position slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object drew closer to them, it appeared to move slightly to the viewers&#39; left, then to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The viewers felt that the object, at its closest, was perhaps 200 yards &#34;in the air.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The young woman rolled down her car window to see if she could hear anything, and detected a high-pitched squeal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was diamond shaped, and it appeared to have some kind of light in back.  Also, they could perceive visually that the object was not just &#34;beams&#34; (?) because it appeared to have a solid mass to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft passed directly over their car, and it was heading to the northeast.  When they looked behind themselves approximately 5-10 seconds after it passed overhead, they could no longer see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to the observers to be as big as a clenched fist at arm&#39;s length!<n> <n><n> <n><n> She saw a UFO before, probably in 1990.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gave the caller our address.

No surpr|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01985.html|6|ndxe199610| SUMMARY:  orange triangle metallic looking object sighted from window<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on couch and saw a plane? coming in the distance. No surprise since I can see many planes coming and going on the horizon from the Pittsburgh airport on clear nights. We have a good view of open skies on the hill and have watched little meteorite showers in years past. This orange light was coming west it came so close and descended heading north.  I thought it was a plane crashing to the groud a few miles from my home.  It changed angles as it turned and it appeared as a metallic bottom with a glowing orange haze.  At each point there was a bright colored light. As I ran out the front door to witness the crash I saw it quickly change direction and ascend toward the east.  It disappeared from sight at a high rate of speed.  I think it was some weird new stealth like plane or a UFO. I was alone when it happened. I&#39;m married and have a career and I don&#39;t want to be known as a nut. As I was searching the web to see if anyone else witnessed my siting I discovered y!our site.  Everyone I know was indoors at that time and I really don&#39;t want to ask my neighbors for obvious reasons. I&#39;ve done alot of soul searching on whether I should report this in any way and so here I am. If there&#39;s someone else out there I want them to know that I saw it too.  I know how I feel.  If it crashed I would have drove off to see it but since it didn&#39;t- I probably will never know what it really was that I saw. It happened all so fast.<n>
10/30/96 18:50|Rose Hill / Wichita|KS|Light|20 Minutes|I saw 3 bright, parallel red lightst 30 degrees above the horizon, lighting up one at a time from right to left. They covered a large p|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03456.html|7|ndxe199610| I saw 3 bright, parallel red lightst 30 degrees above the horizon, lighting up one at a time from right to left. They covered a large portion of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second entry I have made to your sight.  I have been unable to find my previous entry listed and, being concerned that it somehow got lost, am transmitting a second.  This event occured October 30th, 1996.  I sighted the phenomenon alone ( I don&#39;t count my 2 year old son as a witness) but talked with 3 other people in the area who saw similar occurences.  The event was also broadcast on the local TV news and Wichita Eagle newspaper so you should be able to corroborate it.  According to the news, the majority of the sightings occured in Winfield Kansas which is about 20 miles south. At approximately 6:20 P.M. I was driving east on 47th street south, out of Wichita Kansas, about 3 miles west of Rose Hill road with my son.  I noticed three parallel bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They covered a sizable portion of the night sky and if they were attached to the same craft, it would have been huge.  They lit up, one at a time, from right to left five to six times which took about 30 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling, red lights just to the right of the furthest southern (right) light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued to monitor that section of the sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 4 1/2 miles east of Rose Hill on 180th street.  I got out of my car and started to go to the other side to get my son out.  As I did so I noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a line of multi-colored lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approximately 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About two seconds later I observed more birght white, clustered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then dim down.  After another 5-10 seconds the wihite lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done previously.  I waited 15-20 seconds and then ran in the house to find another witness.  By the time we came back outside, the lights were gone and did not return.  I did however, see several airplane lights circling the area for atleast 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes I went back inside the house.  I called the Rose Hill police who said they had no other reports.  Shortly afterwards I heard about Winfield residents reporting strange lights on the nightly news. I called the Winfield police to report my sighting.  The dispatcher said that she had indeed received several similar reports that evening but did not take my report and did not seem concerned.  I attempted to call McConnell Air Force base, which is only 3-4 miles from my original sighting, but was unable to contact anyone. At the time of the sighting I was 35 years old.  I am divorced with a 3 year old son.  I have a college degree and am employed as a financial analyst with a large aircraft manufacturing company.<n>

The road headed us toward it and we at first thought it was a hot air balloon, they often leave the downtown point. It was from a distance flat on the bottom sloping to a near point on top. Closer the color was brown and driving nearly beneath it, it was a lighter brown, circular, seamless with three half round equally spaced protursions on the bottom. The rim was lower than the protrusions they could not be seen from any distance. It was stationary about 300 feet above the HJ Heinz food plant. We made a turn at the next light to cross the 32nd Street bridge I turned to look it was gone. He and I saw it but our discription to others were different. His opinion gave it a higher rounder top than mine.I had the best view of the bottom out my window. There were many people on the road the traffic so heavy we could not stop. That evening I listened for a report on TV, there were none.<n>

I sat up, and a dog came running wild eyed from behind me with his hackles up, and I saw a craft that was triangular slowly flying over the trees across the bayou. It made no sound and the trees did not move or make any noise, either. The craft was about 60 feet long and was kind of dented in on the bottom like an upside tea cup plate. As it drifted over the treeline, it came to an abrupt stop, tipped upwars and began to lower itself into the trees. I know of no known aircraft or helocopter that can do this withoutmoving the leaves and branches on the trees around it. After coming out of the mild shock I was in, I jumpedin the car and drove up Spring Bayou Road as fast as I could. I passed the dog about a mile from where we originally where and he was&#39;nt slowing down either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Year of incident was corrected to 1996, at request of witness. 25SE99.))<n>
10/26/96 02:00|Newport Beach|CA|Changing|2.5 minutes|Object defies physics in Newport Beach, CA.|3/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108024.html|12|ndxe199610| Object defies physics in Newport Beach, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main reason that I&#39;m submitting this UFO sighting report so many years after the incident occurred is that I&#39;m just very curious if there was anybody else that was an eyewitness to what I saw that night, and if so, I would love to hear their descriptions, and compare their perspectives with mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following occurred in Newport Beach, California, on a Saturday night/Sunday morning at approximately 2 AM on October 26, 1996:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out for a jog, and I was running southward down the beach at  approximately 2 AM between 68th and 56th Streets.  Out of the corner of my left eye I saw several green fireballs falling, which I turned to look at.  They were falling on the north side of Pacific Coast Highway (approximately near what I later learned had been a military airstrip in Costa Mesa that had been used  back in the forties).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The green fireballs were only falling approximately 30 to 50 feet in the air.  I thought it was odd, but I didn&#39;t pay a whole lot of attention to it, because I was thinking that they could be fireworks or something, and so I kept running.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I had just seen the green fireballs, my eyes were alert and able to move quickly to what I saw next, which occurred approximately 30 seconds after I saw the green fireballs.  Out of my upper left peripheral vision, I saw a streak come nearly straight downward like a shooting star, which left a trail in the atmosphere, like the tail of a comet.  At the same instant, I heard it make a slight &#34;pfft&#34; sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trail wasn&#39;t straight above me, but it was above me, forward, and to my left.  I looked at this trail in the atmosphere in wonderment, and as I was looking, I saw that at the bottom of the trail (where the the head of the comet would be), there was an object, which wasn&#39;t going anywhere, but was shaking.  It seemed unstable, and then it started gliding erratically forward and downwards left and right, looking shaky, with motions that looked very much like the motions of a butterfly.  It then stabilized into a smoother glide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the object had an orange glow, which I realized must&#39;ve been caused by friction from the atmosphere, because it obviously entered the atmosphere from outer space at a very high rate of speed, maybe 20,000 to 50,000 miles per hour, and then abruptly came to a dead stop approximately 700 to 1000 feet above me. (a mind blowing maneuver!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time that the object was at the bottom of the &#34;comet-like tail,&#34; it was shaking in mid air, so it was hard to see what it&#39;s shape was.  It seemed like it could&#39;ve been a hat shaped UFO, possibly black and silver colored, but as it started gliding it seemed as though it was a different shape.  It seemed like it was more of a Batplane shape or a glider wing; black, but with tinges of an orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft made no sound, though I do have a vague recollection that there may have been a faint sound which could be comparable to the sound of a sailboat&#39;s sails being blown by the wind, or the kind of sound that a hang glider might make while flying.  I would attribute the sound to atmospheric friction against the craft, which would mean I must&#39;ve been fairly close to it in order to hear that, considering the sound of the surf was coming from 50 to 70 feet to the right of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Estimating how high the craft was and its size is difficult because it was nighttime, and the thing seemed to be changing its shape.  If it was approximately 700 to 1000 feet above me, then I would estimate it to be maybe 30 to 40 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next description of maneuvers  coincided with the objects gradual shape shifting some more, and becoming circular, or oval shaped, with a milky white color, almost as though there was a cloudy white film forming around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a very high rate of speed, as it was becoming encapsulated in some kind of milky white plasma, it started doing big S shape maneuvers which defied any physics I&#39;d ever experienced.  It whipped around to the right as though it was a tetherball attached to a pole, and then it whipped around to the left in the same way.  The size of these big S shape maneuvers would cover an area the size of 10 to 15 football fields.  It would intermittently stop, but not completely, and it was at these stopping points that its motion had a profound effect on me.  I could sense what its propulsion was based on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The profound &#34;big picture&#34;realization I had was that the object&#39;s strange movement, no longer seemed strange when viewed within the context of experiencing gravity and the inertia of myself and the Earth moving together through the cosmos.  To illustrate what I mean, picture yourself in a race car in a race at the Indy 500, and there&#39;s another race car in front of yo! u weaving and darting quickly left and right.  In context with you experiencing the speed of your vehicle and seeing the payment moving very very quickly underneath your race car, the motion of that race car in front of you would seem normal.  But the motion of the race car in front of you wouldn&#39;t seem normal if you and the race car that you were in were just sitting still while the payment underneath you was also completely still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When experiencing the UFO object&#39;s motion with in the context of Newtonian physics, where in, the earth and I were seemingly standing still, the motions of the UFO looked odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But in the context of experiencing the inertia of myself and the Earth moving together through the cosmos, the UFO&#39;s motions didn&#39;t look odd.  This is more in the realm of quantum physics perhaps, because it&#39;s not just the relationship of the UFO&#39;s movements with myself in context with the Earths gravity that makes up the equation, but additionally, it&#39;s also the inertia of the earth and the inertia and gravitational properties of the s! olar sys tem, and the inertia of the galaxy etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO caused me to feel myself traveling at the speed of the earth and even possibly sense the speed of the solar system through the galaxy.  Seeing this UFO helped me to understand that the UFO was using principles of celestial mechanics to propel itself.  Here&#39;s another illustration in the form of a riddle/question which I will sometimes ask people in order to get them to start to ponder and grasp the concepts that I was able to realize as a result of having this experience:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Question:  How does a UFO accelerate from 0 miles an hour to 50,000 miles an hour, all in a split second?  Answer:  It puts on the brakes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The S patterns gradually moved away from me Southward and then subsided and turned into a weaving flight like that of of an agile aircraft.  It headed southward toward Laguna Beach and morphed into what looked more like a projection then a physical object, like the projection of a spotlight on a cloud, or a film being projected onto a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it as it gradually moved further and further away, moving in the direction of Laguna Beach, until it was finally out of site.<n>

At first, he thought they were the type of colored spheres mounted on telephone lines to make the lines visible to pilots.  His impression was that the objects were perhaps 1 or 2 miles from him, and perhaps 1/4 mile above ground level, and maybe 200 yards from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (He saw a commercial jet in the distance, apparently leaving Baltimore airport or Andrews AFB, so he had something to compare with the objects he was observing.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the objects was that of pencil lead, perhaps with a bit of copper-colored tinge to them.  They were generally round, but they were slightly out of round at the equator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just moved  out of sight rapidly, in approximately one second!

Drove right up to it and under it.  Got out of van and discussed what we were seeing.  Huge diamond shape with brightest strobing white lights I had ever seen, very low to ground, hovering over neighborhood, no sound.  Clearly saw underneath writing or something all under.  Airplane came and ufo streaked off .  Estimated to be 150ftx150ft. , this may be vast underestimation.  No reports.  No radar.  It was huge.  We had plenty of time to examine it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a believer and have had one other encounter of disconnected balls of lights examining the car I was in with 3 other people.  My mother on the other hand is a devout disbeliever.  My sanity is intact because she was with me.  The object appeared to be charcoal gray, square or diamond shaped with blinding white strobe lights at the points.  No other colors were observed.  There was a distinct writing or something underneath in circles that covered the bottom.  When we first saw it it was traveling east to west seemingly down a busy street.  It got off the street and turned north and just stopped as if to let us look at it.  It just hovered over a populated neighborhood not doing anything.  It seemed to be about 50 ft. above the houses, very low.  It was huge.  We discussed wondering how such a thing could fly.  From the direction of the airport (east) we saw a very fast flying airplane coming our way.  The thing took off at a high rate of speed north and we gave chase along with the airplane.  We kept it in sight for another 6 miles and then lost it.  I called the airport to ask if anything had been reported and they said no.  I have searched everywhere and cannot find a picture of this thing and wonder if anyone else has seen this particular one.  It took so long to report because I didn&#39;t know where and got my computer for Christmas.<n>

Small|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03133.html|17|ndxe199610| While driving observed 3 parallel bright red lights lighting in turn from left to right. These covered sizable area of night sky. Smaller red lights came out of one end of lights then disappeared. Soon after I witnessed white, clustered, oscillating lights and a separate set of multi-colored lights that formed a line parallel to the horizon. This line sank out of view, but the white, oscillating lights continued to sparkle and dissipate once every 5-10 seconds for approximately 30 seconds.  I continued monitoring sky but saw nothing else.  There were numerous reports of strange lights in the sky that night, from Winfield to Wichita.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 6:20 P.M. on October 30th, 1996 , I was driving east on 47th St. South out of Wichita Kansas.  When I got to about 2 miles west of Rose Hill Rd. I noticed 3 bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They were lighting up, one at a time from right to left.  They formed a parallel line to the horizon and covered a sizable section of the night sky.  They lit up from right to left 5 to 6 times which took about 25 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling red lights just to the right of the furthest southern light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued monitoring that section of sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 5 miles straight east of Rose Hill.  I got out of my car and then noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a multi-colored line of lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approxiamelty 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About 2 seconds later I observed more bright white, clusterered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then die down.  After another 5-10 seconds the white lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done the first time.  I waited 15-20 seconds then ran into my house to find another witness.  When we returned, we monitored the sky for 10-15 minutes but saw no more lights.  We did, however. see approximately 5-10 airplane lights flying in the area that I had seen the lights.  I did not see these lights during the occurance. I called the Rose Hill police but they said they had no other reports of lights in the sky.  The local nightly news ran a story about strange lights being reported by residents of Winfield Kansas that night, so I called the Winfield police.  They said that there had been numerous reports of lights but that they had no explanation.  There was also a small article about the incident in the Wichita Eagle newspaper the following day.<n>

We had driven nearly the full 21 mile drive from Kokomo heading south on US 31 to just north of hwy. 28 (appox. 800 yards north). Just across hwy. 28, behind the &#34;Flamingo&#34; motel to the west (about 800 ft. west),and in an open field, an unidentified sphere shaped craft hovered stationary, about 50 foot above the ground. It appeared about the size of a DC-8 or KC-135 jet in size. The craft was britely lit with small orange/yellow lights enveloping its ball shape. It appeared to be searching the ground below it with several intense motorised search beacons that were scanning the ground from its undercarraige.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained illuminated for about 15 seconds and then went &#34;lights out&#34;. We saw a small red light depart the same area and pass in front of us (across US 31 and southeast bound), at instant mach +++ speed. Several other motorists ahead of us saw it as well as they applied their brakes as we did, to take in the sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother-inlaw and I decided to turn off on a side road after we turned east on hwy.28, to see if we could see more activity. We turned off our headlights and pulled over on the side road. What we saw when we got out of the truck, was no less amazing. There were 2 huge vapor trails, or what looked more like rocket exhaust plumes, that arced across the sky (about 3 miles in length) from the ground where we first saw the craft hovering. Over the next few minutes we also observed what appeared to be several unlit stealth type flying aircraft, very high up in the thin cirrus clouds. Those craft soon departed, and we got in the truck and went home. I woke my wife when we got there, to show her the rocket/vapor trails and she saw them as well. There was a low pitched hum from the sky above, but not very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not crazy, we saw what we saw. It was a clear/starry evening, and the craft was solid clearly visable. I&#39;m not saying they were aliens, expermental aircraft, maybe???? Who knows....... A shame we didn&#39;t have a camera, we could have gotten some VERY detailed photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It took a long time to reach crest of mtn. swinging around peak and coming down gulley of mtn. skimming trees. I got gun and went outside. The craft coming down only had light inside like a cockpit.

It&#39;s horribly written so I&#39;ll rewrite it here to tell more of the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not hunting season like Nuforc added, and I could find a more accurate date if I found court dates of a custody hearing, because it happened a week or two before that date around 1996. (link to my case at bottom)  -----------------------<n> <n><n> <n><n> My story;  I lived in a travel camper about 100 feet from my parents house on their property which adjoined my grandparents property at the bottom of a mountain, Virginia, in Roanoke. There was a field 8 acres in size between my parent&#39;s and grandparent&#39;s homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, it was getting late around 11 p.m., I started hearing some dogs bark (we had no dog, it must have been neighbors in a distance) and went to look out of the tiny window in the back side of the camper and across the field. I saw a light in the woods about 200 feet down from my grandparent&#39;s home (on my grandparent&#39;s property). It was going around a tree and stayed in the same place the whole time. The family sometimes let a hunter racoon/squirrel hunt? so I wondered if it could be him. After watching several minutes, the light went out. I went back and looked a few minutes later and it was back on, but soon went out again. I left, came back, and each time the light would be on and go off when I looked and kept doing this in sinc with me watching or not like it was playing a game. Then suddenly a red light shot up out of the woods and over the ridge (like a flare?) Then nothing. I left the window again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a little disturbing, so after a few minutes I had to go look again. There was a HUGE triangular craft headed from the direction where the flare was toward the field. It was going VERY slowly and low. It was totally dark, no interior lights, and no normal exterior lights except one long red light that went completely from front to back of the craft. It&#39;s flying altitude stayed below that of the mountain peak. It took a long time to go from over the field, to the peak and when it reached the peak, it went beside it and behind it. Then it seemed (later realized a much smaller craft) to circle behind the peak and come back around the other side of it and it started coming back down the mountain in the direction of my house. This scared me so I grabbed a handgun I kept for protection, and went outside to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no exterior lights on this craft coming toward me, and there was a light inside lit up like a cockpit. It was barely skimming the tree tops as it made it&#39;s way down the mountainside. When it got about 200 ft. from my home, it stopped and turned it&#39;s interior light off. I could see this one was about the size of a helicopter. It then traveled over to my backyard and hovered just a few feet directly over a light pole. It shone a big spotlight down in the yard, which I was standing just on the outside of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I panicked and ran as fast as I could to my parents house next door. When I looked back, I saw no signs of it still being there. I went inside and woke my parents up, telling them what had just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suspicious facts; There is no way a human could see me in this tiny window from such a far distance, without having binoculars, telescope and intentionally keeping a lookout for people watching. These crafts made NO noise. I did not have any missing time (in case anyone wondered about possible abduction, no it didn&#39;t happen). But, I am left feeling very angry and violated that whoever, whatever, this was did trespass on private property, on the ground in the woods, as well as flying under the allowed altitude according to government regulations. Military, alien? I don&#39;t know. I do know this technology is either secret military, or alien in nature. I have searched since then to compare and identify it, and I have not been able to identify it still. The closest thing I&#39;ve seen is from a UFO story on t.v. of some people in Australia who had an encounter with a huge triangular craft with a long red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Roanoke airport the following week and asked them if anything strange showed up on their radar the previous week. They just laughed at me and then told me no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s my Nuforc report;  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16107.html  10/15/96 23:00 Roanoke VA Triangle 1 hour I saw a triangular craft with only red light from front to back on it. Craft stopped over my back yard and shone light down. 2/18/01 ------------------ Note to Nuforc;  There is nothing in those woods. Just plain trees! It doesn&#39;t matter if you contact me or not, even though I checked at bottom of form. It&#39;s just that if anyone wants to go onto the land and check for radiation, or whatever, or if anyone wants to meet me and go to the area this happened at, I can arrange that. I do not want to say publicly it was at the bottom of Bent Mountain, because I do not want to be identified publicly and some locals might know it&#39;s me with that much information put in there. I don&#39;t care to investigate for my own purposes, but only if you think you might gain some helpful knowledge or if Nuforc could benefit in some way by doing so. I also hope you don&#39;t give our information out to the government, as that worries me the government might hurt or harrass people if they are doing secret operations and people are telling about it. Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We unexpected it and were shocked as it was no more than 75 feet in the air just higher than the electric lines. In our amazement we stayed focused making sure what each other saw was in fact something of not normal. It was white and had curved almost boomerang shaped wings going to a cone or small blimp like center no bigger than a van with continuous lighting all around the craft. After it stayed beside us for about 20 to 25 seconds is shot to the sky in a rediculous speed in an instant it was gone. I never believed in ufo&#39;s and laughed at people for believing. This sighting scared me and in fact this is the first time I have mentioned it since then.

It was strange because it made no noise at all.  It was moving a low speed and as it came over me I saw that had a large white circular light in the center and 3 smaller red lights that made a triangle out side the white light.  The color of the space craft was a black color.  I took my eyes off the ship to see if anyone esle saw it but when I turned around it was gone.<n>

There was no noise at all.  How can something that size stay in the air when it&#39;s going so slow?  I was going about 25 mph on those winding roads and it was going slower than me.

In fact, I don&#39;t care if anyone even reads this....I just felt like I needed to put the experience outside myself. I was hiking with my best friend ((name deleted)) in the woods of Cazadero, CA all day.....making our own trails and fasting for the weekend. We slept in a cabin that one of his friends had built. It was Autumn. This is what I remember after six years or so: I awoke up with a jolt in the middle of the night....very early in the morning.....probably about two or three AM.....and I was sitting upright in my bed totally paralized....I could move my head back and forth and up and down, but nothing else worked. I could not make a sound even though I tried to yell to my friend ((name deleted)) who was sleeping on the floor about seven feet away. He did not move or wake up during this event. I was seemingly in shock and could see with my eyes. I saw a being standing in front of me holding what looked like an electric thermometer with &#34;his&#34; right hand very close to the left side of my head. I believe it was this device that rendered in such a state. The being was slim and had the most beautiful skin....you have never seen such a pattern of grayish/green/tan. There was no hair on its head or body. It did not have the huge eyes that are depicted in the movies. It was not malevolent and tolerated my questions only briefly....these beings are very assertive if you communicate with them. You cannot speak with them....I cannot explain how I communicated with it. I know it had no intention of harm......it was curious about me....and there was only one of them as far as I could see. When I began to panic.....it released its &#34;hold&#34; on me and then I regained my consciousness as we normally experience it. It scared the crap out of me...but now I wish it woul! d happen again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

Witnessed by 3.|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33875.html|27|ndxe199610| Silent  Close Range White Light seen on Highway 280 south of Highway 92. Witnessed by 3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this first happened years ago - I told my mother, and we together made an online report to a UFO newsgroup. I was interviewed shortly thereafter by three people in the group, but do not recall if it was MUFON or other - so I&#39;m posting this again, in hopes that someone knows something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a Freshman in college driving South on I280 at 12:45am, after visiting my girlfriend in Pacifica. There were few other cars on the highway, but I had been next to roughly 3 vehicles since entering the highway. The night was very clear, no fog, I do not remember seeing the moon or recall if there was a lot of moonlight. It was a &#34;warm&#34; evening, for I had the sunroof open on my VW Jetta. I had just gone under the Highway 92 overcrossing and was between (2) Vista Points headed towards the &#34;Edgewood Rd&#34; Exit. I recall squinting my eyes for a bright light was shining through my back window. I reached up flipped the mirror to night mode and assumed nothing. The light passed under the over crossing and continued to bare down on my car and the two next to me. I slowed down and moved over to the slow lane, for I thought it was a police officer with his spot light on. We came around a slow curve to the right and the light had closed to within a 1/8th of a mile of traffic. At that point I realized that it was just too high above the road to be a car, but perhaps a tall truck. I couldn&#39;t make out any shape to it, just an intense white light. It continued to close distance and by this point I could tell that it was not connected to the ground for its movement was &#34;smooth&#34; and &#34;frictionless&#34;. The light didn&#39;t jiggle like that of a car when it goes over bumps. I recall looking at the driver in the car to the left of me and getting a quizical look back from him, I motioned with my shoulders an &#34;I Don&#39;t know&#34; expression... When the light was a couple hundred yards behind us, it was clear it was at approximately 50&#39; off the ground, but I couldn&#39;t not make out any sound over my car and the wind noise from the open sunroof. Once again I made an assumption and figured it was a police helicopter with a spot light, or perhaps a small Cesna. My mom and uncle are private pilots and I have a lot of experience around small aircraft. The white light certainly could have been a landing gear light, but I did not see any blinkin! g colored lights to depict a plane. The light then sped up and passed directly over the my car, and the two other vehicles near me. SILENTLY. I could make out a slight dull figure contained within the orb of light, but cannot faithfully say what shape it was. After passing us the light continued off in front of us for roughly another mile, when it made a HARD angular ascent at roughly a 65 degree angle and sped out of site. Shocked, myself and the guy in the car next to me pulled over to the side of the freeway and talked about the &#34;thing.&#34; Neither of us could explain, or hypothesize what it was. Creeped out by the dark and lack of other cars on the road we left the scene. I exited at Edgewood Rd, and headed to my house on Crestview Dr in San Carlos. I told my Mom about what I saw and retrieved my police scanner. We sat outside on the back deck watching the western sky for hours, too wired to sleep. We heard little on the scanner of reference, but did hear a call for a CHP officer to investigate a bright light seen at a Vista Point, which are supposed to be closed at dusk. I hope this report helps or provides a link to someone else&#39;s experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They showed us around the ship,and the greys told us that they were coming.  In our dream the outside was round with blue and gold lights. The inside had gold lights, and we both remember seeing two examination tables on our right side.  The next morning which was a Monday the 14. A lady had called into a radio station that we were listening to which was 98.5 KTK fm, and she said that there was a ufo spotted in Gainesville, Florida.  She said the ship had blue and gold lights on the outside of the ship.  It was the same one that we dreamed about.<n>

Of course our drawings were virtually the same: a large, V shaped craft, with 2 or 3 lights running down each vane of the &#34;V&#34; and a light at the apex or nose of the &#34;V.&#34;   It was black in color and the lights were a dull yellow or white.  Very freaky, almost disturbing to see something that big, so low, so fast.  The fact that is was so low (let alone silent) tells me that this was no black ops or Skunkworks test-bed. No military plane would ever fly this low over a very heavily populated area!<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, we never reported it, as we figured no one would ever believe us.

My mother(a complete non-believer) and I were traveling east on a major street in town when we saw just ahead, a little beyond the next intersection what looked like several helicopters flying very low, coming toward us.  We discussed the flying machines and decided the white lights which were strobing were much too bright for helicopters.  Just then, two blocks past the intersection, we were right under it.  I turned on the side street and we got out of the car.  The diamond or square shaped as we decided object was just hovering in the sky with no noise.  With every observation I made I asked mother if she agreed and she did.  This thing was huge approximately 600 feet in all directions.  We were underneath and could see the apparent color charcoal. We estimated it was no more than 100 feet above the ground and the lights were at the corners. We could also see individual squares marked off on the underneath side with carvings or writings of some kind we could not identify.  Some time later I saw a celtic cross and thought the artwork was the same or very similar.  We just stood under it discussing it, mesmerized.  Mainly we talked about its size.  A few minutes into it we saw and heard a jet coming down the same main street toward us.  At almost the same time we spotted the jet, the big craft took off in a northwesterly direction being chased by the jet.  I don&#39;t know why but we still stood there watching until they were almost out of sight unable to move.  Finally we jumped in the car and gave chase but never saw either again.<n>

Being downtown among all the streetlights, only the brightest stars are visible.  I was reclining on a lounge chair when I noticed a light flash above the roof of the complex.  It seems odd that it flashed just once and was gone.  I stared at that spot for a few moments and then it flashed again, about 5 degrees from the original spot.  This continued and I started counting between flashes.  Each interval was a full 15 seconds! This contined all the way across the sky and by the time it reached the opposite roof of the courtyard, everyone was looking up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside the complex and watched it until it disappeared behind a building next door.

I remember the date because it was the morning of my birthday, and I was coming home from a poker game. Since I had to drive, I had had no alcoholic beverages, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t of believed it. And I had noted the time of the event. As I was walking around the back of my home, I caught an object out of the corner of my eye. It was triangular and the entire craft was illuminated, about as brite as a yard lamp. When I noticed it, it was about 45* above the southern horizon. I would guesstimate 20,000-25,000 feet. it traveled north to the end of my field of view at approx 10* above the northern horizon. The entire event took less than 3 seconds. The craft would of been vissible to travelers along I-70, 13hwy, 20hwy, 24hwy and route 10, in the counties of Lafayette and Ray in Missouri. My home is approx 46 miles East of Kansas City, 6 miles north of I-70, and 12 miles south of the Missouri River, and 20 miles east of Marshal Missouri. Whiteman AFB (home of the B-2) is approx 28 miles SSE. My background is as a L.P.N. for the dept of mental health.

It was identifiable by shape only.  The color was completely beige.  No windows, doors, or lights were seen.  It lifted straight up, off the ground, like it was on a trampoline, but then hovered for those few seconds, then again completely silent, dropped back down.  It disappeared from view.  The observers were myself and my husband:  1) computer specialist and 2) Registered Nurse.  There was one other vehicle behind us.  A white Chevy pick up truck, which did not stop. Our photos of the object were mysteriously blank.  Our watches stopped at some point during the viewing (around 1530).<n>

A friend and I were walking on the beach in an eastward direction.  He spotted a light coming from the northwest over the Great South Bay.  It was a moonless night.  He kept and eye on it as we strolled along, his hobby was identifying airplanes by their landing lights or sound of an engine.  As the object got closer it was easier to see.  It was low and slowly coming in our direction. It looked flat at first then came closer still so that we could see slightly under it. From beneath it we noticed a blue flashing light striking the water.  It ticked when it flashed.  It was going about 5 miles per hour and as it got to shore, over the forested reserve between the Pines and Water Island the blue light stopped.  We couldn&#39;t hear an engine...nothing.  It was moving towards us and I panicked running up a small dune and dune fensing to one of the homes where I saw a man watching tv.  I looked down at Ken and he wasn&#39;t following or responding so I went back down and yelled to follow.  He grabbed my wrist and pushed me into the dune as the craft moved overhead.  We huddled together in shock...at least I was.  It had a 90 degree, cone-shaped nose, a swept back wing and deep body.  I estimate it was 400 ft wide by 200 deep (nose to tail).  At that time I lived in a a 20-story building on Sutton Place, in Manhattan, so I used that scale to quess the dimensions and hieght of it.  It was approx. 20 stories overhead.  The back end was arced slightly into the body.  It was dark grey or black.  The color was hard to see, however the shape is burned in my mind since the starry sky defined it so clearly.  It continued to move and when it got to the southern (beach) shore of Fire Island it stopped.  No sound, no engine noise, no vibrations, moving at 5 MPH... it just stopped in mid air over the beach.  By this time we could see the rear of it and Ken said, &#34;Look at the pattern of lights.&#34;  There was a small red light in the middle rea! r and two white lights at eithther end.  They blinked red, red, rt. white, red, lft white then the white light moved across to the other white light across the rear.  Then we saw an amber light, like the ones on the helicopters that patrolled the east river sometimes.  I said, &#34;Thank God it must be the National Guard.&#34;  It got closer, but we heard no sound.  It was a round, glowing, amber light, the color of a glowing flame.  It was about 12 in diameter, I think.  The nose of the ship was still pointing southwest.  Suddenly the amber light collapsed.  It disappeared.  Then the large craft, on it&#39;s axis, pivoted pointing its&#39; nose due south.  It moved forward until it was over the ocean and the blue flashed started up agin.  We sat there watching it move towards the horizon flashing the blue light every 40 feet or so as if it was mapping or searching for something.  We walked back to our hosts house.  On the way I kept asking Ken what he had seen.  I wasn&#39;t sure if it had happened so I asked him if he had seen anything on the beach.  I was unhappy to hear that he had seen somthing.  I asked him to describe what he saw and to my dismay he did.  We went back to the house and told our friends. Of course, I was in shock and couldn&#39;t sleep that night.  I wanted to know what I&#39;d seen.  Ken slept all right.  When he got up I asked him how he got any sleep at all and he said that he&#39;d seen one before as a child on his parents woodlands in Ohio.  That wasn&#39;t what I wanted to hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I was Chief Operations Office for a large furniture company in Manhattan.  My friend was studying to be a personal trainer.  I&#39;ve always wanted to report the incident.  I&#39;ve told some close friends about it. I spent the next three months reading UFO literature.  I needed to define what I&#39;d seen.  My life chnaged.  NYC was no longer the center of the Universe.  Everything seem so insignificant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, ever so much, for the opportunity to share my experience.<n>

My friend noticed something way, way up in the sky as if it were a star.  The sky was clear blue with just a few fluffy-like clouds scattered.  When I squinted to look at what he was looking at, I noticed a dark, greyish-metallic looking object which looked about the size that a star would look like at night.  The object was stationary, it did not move.  As I focused on the object, all of the sudden it took off toward the south at a high speed and went out of my sight.  This object went from stationary to high speed movement in no time at all.  I yelled at my friend so he could see that it had taken off, and he claimed it hadn&#39;t because he was still focused on the object.  I lay back down next to him on the track and began focusing on yet another object of the same description.  It was just there in the sky not moving.  Aparently, this second object was the one he noticed first, and when I looked, my eyes caught sight of the one that was next to it and took off.  As we stared at the object, something incredible and inexplicable happend.  The object began to wobble as we focused more on the object, we could see it was a triangular-boomerang shape.  My friend who has better vision than I said it had a orange-like glow to it as well.  As the object wobbled, amazingly, another object just like it came forth from it as if it had divided itself into two.  I know it sounds crazy or made up, but I will swear under oath and take a lie detector test or whatever is necessary, that this is what we both saw.  Now, there were two objects side by side.  The object that came out of the other one moved east slightly, so now they were aligned side by side.  I cannot recall which of the two began wobbling now, I want to say it was the original one that spit the new one out because I recall the third object being directly above the original or &#34;mother&#34; object. In any case the! object began wobbling again and yet another one seemed to appear from the other. Now there were three, one above the original one and the other still aligned alongside the original one.  At once, all three formed a triangle and stood there for a few minutes in triangular formation.  After a few minutes, the top one moved slowly along side the others so that they were now on the same level side by side.  The two in front now began to move together slowly eastward and the original or &#34;mother one&#34; stood still.  As we watched, the original one began to move as well, the two moving ahead together, in the same eastward direction.  Then they all picked up speed and disappeared East. This incident has haunted me and my friend all these years.  I was tempted many times to report this to someone, but did not know where or who.  I have seen other unexplained objects in the sky, but this was the most remarkable.  If anyone else has seen something like this I would love to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spotted two men on the street below looking upwards and pointing.  We all thought they were looking up at one of the windows in the apartment building across the street.  My buddy yelled down to them &#34;what are you looking at you perverts&#34;.  They looked up and shouted back &#34;wholly shit....do you see it too?&#34;.   They were both almost hysterical. One of the men had a small eye piece he was looking through.  He tossed it up to us so we could see for ourselves.  There was a boomerang shaped craft way up in the sky.  It remained motionless as white puffy clouds were passing underneath. You could barely see it without the eyepiece. Then one of the guys said &#34;look, there&#39;s more&#34;.  Sure enough we could see 2 then 3....I counted 4 total.  All the same shape hovering close to one another.  They all seemed to have the same segmented color scheme. A dark band followed by a light color band followed by another dark band.  Kind of like a bumble bee.  We all went out onto the street and continued watching the craft. No one had a camera so we began stopping people on the street and pointing out the objects to them. I guess this was an attempt to prove to ourselves we weren&#39;t crazy or seeing things.   After a while of watching &amp; telling people, it was weird, there was nothing else we could do.  Eventually we went back up stairs and I continued looking back up in the sky to see if they were still hovering. I looked up the last time and they were gone.  We never saw them zoom off...they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this site while surfing the new google video search engine.

The objects swung around, changing position with one another, then the top object vanished.|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01892.html|46|ndxe199610| SUMMARY:  Two large lights were seen high in the sky. The objects swung around, changing position with one another, then the top object vanished.  The other remained visible as we traveled forabout 20 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving, and my friend ((name delted)) was a passenger.  We were on Route 8, on our way from Naugatuck, CT to Norwalk, CT.  About 1/3 of the way to Norwalk, in Derby, I spotted two large, bright lights in the sky, and pointed them out to ((name deleted)).  The lights were larger than a visible planet would appear; the closest description I can give as to size was that they were similar in size to street lights viewed from a car, only they were clearly very high in the sky, so the actual size of the objects had to be enormous.  We watched the objects, which were hovering in place, the one on the left a little higher than the one on the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the objects moved, rotating around one another (top to bottom) to switch places with one another.  Then, the one which had moved to the top winked out, just vanished.  There was a faint trail leading upward where that one had been, but it disappeared quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove another few exits to Shelton, CT, where we got off of the highway onto Bridgeport Avenue.  We stopped at a car dealership which had a clear view of that part of the sky (I&#39;d say, south, maybe south east part of the sky--I&#39;d have to look at a map to be more specific--we were driving generally south at the time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the Jeep and stood in the lot, watching the remaining light.  It kept its position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, we got back into the Jeep, and I continued to drive to Norwalk.  We watched the light all the way to Norwalk; it remained the in the same part of the sky the entire way (probably for a total of 20 miles or so), so it had to be pretty high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I dropped ((name deleted)) off at her home, I had one more look at the object by a running track near her house, then I headed home (driving north, so I could no longer see it in front of me).  I couldn&#39;t see the part of the sky where it was when I got home, so I just went inside. The lights were pale yellow or white-ish in color.  I thought they seemed round, but ((name deleted)) said at the time (and has maintained) that they seemed triangular to her.  They were definitely not airplanes (we saw plenty of planes in the sky that night--no comparison).  They also didn&#39;t behave like planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 29 years old, female, married, a webmaster/graphic designer by profession.  I&#39;ve never seen any unusual phenomena in the sky before, and have always been skeptical about the whole UFO thing.  While these lights may not be alien in nature, I certainly can&#39;t explain them (if you figure out what they were, please let me know!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know ((name deleted)) age (mid to late 40s perhaps).   She is currently attending college full time to get her masters in painting, and I believe a certificate to teach (or something of that nature).<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I can give you any further specifics, please contact me.<n>
10/3/96 20:05|Crestone|CO|Light|30 seconds|Four balls of light travelling in sky, also see possible related New Mexico report for 10/3/96.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48796.html|47|ndxe199610| Four balls of light travelling in sky, also see possible related New Mexico report for 10/3/96.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this event that I witnessed nine years ago after reading a seemingly related report from the same date for New Mexico. Shortly after this event, I provided an in person report to a well-known ufo author. On this (Oct. 3, 1996 evening people across the west saw what was reported through many news sources as a meteor. I didn&#39;t believe what I saw to be such an object, although it occurred at the same time as the meteor. Deductive reasoning concludes that I either a) witnessed the meteor event and have somehow interpreted it as something else b) witnessed something that was totally unrelated to the meteor event yet uncannily coincidental in the timing of it c) experts were wrong in that the reported meteor event was something else and that is what I saw. There are probably other explanations but those are the three logical ones I can think of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While car camping at a friend&#39;s property just outside of Crestone, Colorado, I saw four balls of light traveling in a southwest to northeast direction approximately 10-15 degrees above the horizon at about 8:15 pm, I was looking southeast. The balls of light were equally spaced, had no sound, no streaking, no change of speed or direction of travel. To me at first it appeared to be an airplane, but then I realized there was no sound associated with it and for the speed it was traveling and the distance away it appeared to be and altitude, there would have been. After about 30 seconds, these lights disappeared behind the crest of the Sangre de Cristo range which was about five miles from where I was. I listened to radio accounts that evening of people throughout the west who witnessed what was reported as a meteor at roughly the same time. They reported seeing color in the meteor, what I saw was white. Whether these objects were just behind the ridge or outside the earth&#39;s atmosphere I couldn&#39;t say, although I felt as though they were just behind the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At least 7 vehicles stopped on I-25 to look at an object estimated to be &#34;as long as a football field.  One teenager is reported to us to have been so upset by the event, that he was taken to a hospital emergency room for treatment.  A senior engineer at JPL in Pasadena, CA, was witness to this event, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was reported by the press to be a &#34;meteorite.&#34;  We believe this to be a severely flawed conclusion.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thought it was a plane coming FROM the SE (moving NNW), it moved at a very regular plane-like speed.  Felt it might have been a military or civilian plane coming to a smooth CRASH.  But it was apparent it was a BIG plane and going too fast to make such a maneuveur without hitting I-25.  There is only a small airport in SFE and it was not headed there. Pulled over on I-25, fearing it was going to cross our path.  It was HUGE, rectangular, like a LADDER on it&#39;s side: two parallel rows of white lights connected by &#34;rungs&#34; of white lights. It then stopped and SHOT perpendicular to itself at an AMAZING SPEED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a day of shopping, I was returning from Albuquerque to Santa Fe driving my vehicle at the time, a Toyota 4-Runner (with a moonroof, which I NEVER had to look through for any of these events), on I-25 north when at approximately 8p.m., we were approaching Cerrillos Rd. exit in Santa Fe.  It was already very dark outside.  The person I was with suddenly said, &#34;WOW, look at that star&#34;. From the windshield, I saw a &#34;falling star&#34; shoot high in the sky falling in a SOUTHERNLY direction. I&#39;ve seen MANY shooting stars and continued driving. A moment later, my passenger asked, &#34;Is there an airport around here?&#34;  I said SFE Airport which we had already sort of passed. A few seconds later, the passenger said, &#34;Is that a plane?  Look at that plane...&#34;  I ignored this for a moment because I was watching traffic (which was moderately heavy for 8 p.m.) and I wasn&#39;t going to look at everything flying in the sky (seeing airplanes in the clear NM sky is a usual event).  But again, the person said, &#34;WOW..look at that plane...is that an airplane?&#34;  I looked to my right past the passenger and out that window.  I was completely amazed. I said, &#34;If that&#39;s a plane, it&#39;s a 747!!&#34;.  Coming from the SE, from the Manzano/Ortiz/Sandia mountains (they layer atop each other from that perspective) at about a 30 degree (?) trajectory angle from the ground  (it was NEVER above the mountain range) was an incoming &#34;craft&#34; looking very plane-like, regulated, controlled, smooth.  It was &#34;landing&#34; at this very regular pace which looked like a perfect landing BUT there is no airport and it was coming in WAY too fast. It was coming right toward I-25. (Note: I-25 is a N/S interstate but as the road passes through Santa Fe, it &#34;hooks&#34; and at certain points one is moving more in an E/W direction). At no time did it occur to either of us that it was a meteor. This was NOT the shooting star we&#39;d seen a moment earlier.  It was a unit, again looking like a plane coming in for a too-fast landing. It would have been a great landing if it had another 2000 ft to go (which it did not).  Personally, I thought we were seeing a military craft BUT the TWA 800 accident had recently occurred and I thought, &#34;Who&#39;s really ever expecting a plane crash?&#34; (Alb. Internat&#39;l Airport is about 55 miles south and I thought, it could be crashing to/from there).  I looked to the traffic travelling SOUTH (opposing traffic). We were approaching the St. Francis Dr. exit/entrance now (divided by a wide grassy median)and cars were STOPPING in the opposing direction -- the direction looking toward this oncoming &#34;craft&#34;. That&#39;s when I got this strange chill and pictured us getting slammed by this &#34;crashing&#34; plane.  Out of FEAR rather than voyeurism, I pulled off onto the shoulder, fully expecting this &#34;plane&#34; to cross I-25 or crash into it.  Several cars behind me also pulled off at this same moment.  As we sat there looking out the passenger side window, it came in CLOSE and was maybe a quarter mile (?) from the highway and looked to be just above treetops/houses!  It was ENORMOUS!  It was a very geometric object consisting of white lights laid out in a rectangular format looking like a LADDER laid upon one side.  Two long rows (one above the other) of white lights connected by &#34;rungs&#34; of white lights at regular intervals.  I was not aware of any other color light. The lights just sort of existed -- did NOT radiate or illuminate anything above/below/around themselves. If one stuck out their arm, this &#34;craft&#34; seemed the visual length of a twirling baton.  But it was a quarter mile off the road! There was utter SILENCE. It made absolutely no noise at any point during this entire sighting.  Then as we watched it in amazement, it just STOPPED and &#34;hovered&#34; for a MICRO-second and then SHOT 90 degrees, perpendicular to itself off to the EAST.  It was STARTLING. We were expecting it to crash but it instead did this!   And although I HATE to use the term, it SHOT at &#34;warp-speed&#34;.  I have NEVER seen ANYTHING move so FAST,so silently or so strangely in all my life. We were speechless. We sat there for a moment and I looked at the dashboard clock.  It read exactly 8:05 p.m. Shaken, we resumed driving, having to wait for other cars that had pulled over to re-enter the lanes before us.  We could NOT believe it.  We wondered where it could have possible gone -- it did NOT seem to have crossed I-25 at all but had SHOT into/over? the short foothills of the Sangre De Cristos. We had another 15 miles to drive to my home and could NOT figure out WHERE such a thing COULD have even gone (other than INTO a foothill).  It was a VERY disturbing experience.  Not really thrilling or exhilirating. It was frightening.  As we got in at 8:25, I immediately called my sister in Chicago.  Then we watched the 10 pm local news and it was the lead story on all the stations. But they were &#34;wondering&#34; what it was &#34;What was in the sky tonight...was it a meteor...some say it WASN&#39;T!&#34; So,  I called one of the stations simply to tell them what we&#39;d experienced and got the &#34;Oh, interesting...&#34; routine. It was all over the papers over the following days -- some people describing what we&#39;d seen; others saying it was a falling star. I wondered how one man in our neighborhoof saw this meteorite &#34;event&#34; which ALL global observatories had failed to detect!! Then in the days that followed, a physicist at Sandia Nat&#39;l Labs was quoted in the papers as saying that what a person had described as it&#39;s movements (not my account but the same), it could not have been a meteorite but was perhaps a retrievable satellite or other &#34;craft&#34;.  NO agency/observatory ANYWHERE tracked a meteor that evening.  So I called this physicist who is an &#34;expert&#34; in meteorite behavior.  We spoke for 30 minutes. He said NO meteorites were seen and wished he&#39;d seen what we saw. We discussed how meteorites behave, how they break up and are like fire lights, etc...most, of course, disintegate before ever entering the atmosphere. They DO NOT stop, hover or switch directions! I asked, &#34;Why would no one be concerned even if it were &#39;only&#39; a satellite -- what happened to the warnings ala SKYLAB in the 70&#39;s...what if it had been a MISSILE???&#34; In this part of the globe, with GREAT celestial visibility and a large military presence, it oddly seemed NOT to intrique any officials! In Los Angeles, CA, it was seen an HOUR later (even accounting for Daylight Savings)!!  UCLA offered a reward to anyone who could find a piece of it...because they felt it was NOT a meteorite. A month later (?), the  Sandia Lab physicist I had spoken with was quoted in the papers as saying it was a ricocheting metorite traveling at 186,000mph. For a guy who never saw or recorded it, he had a THEORY! (How it would take so long to get to L.A. is unexplained, of course).  It was said that the meteroite landed in Moriarity, NM!!  This is 50 miles SOUTH of Santa Fe (the &#34;craft moved NORTH, THEN last I saw, ENE.  No fragments were ever found in Moriarity. But then a physicist at Los Alamos Nat&#39;l Labs immediately refuted the Sandia physicist&#39;s sudden theory saying that for 40 years, he was an expert in ricocheting meteorites and would NOT have missed one -- they come along every 10,000+ years and are IMPOSSIBLE to miss because they are so powerful and LARGE. They enter earth&#39;s atmosphere and then &#34;ricochet&#34; back into space to again immediately re-enter the atmosphere because they are powerhouse meteors!! The person who was with me during this sighting does NOT wish to be identified at this time but would likely answer questions off-the-record.<n>

I was sitting outside my house in The Woodlands, talking to my boyfriend. It was a nice warm, cloudless night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two orangish amber colored fireballs appeared on the east side of the sky, moving west at a relatively slow pace.  These objects seemed to be VERY close-by but I have no way to say how close. They made no noise.  They were at least as big as a half-dollar if you hold it at arm&#39;s length. They had an erratic, shaking look to them as they moved directly south of us.  They then stopped and stayed hovering in the air.  Their shakiness stopped and they were completely frozen. One was slightly lower in the sky than the other.  It was very hard to discern what they were. They had a multifaceted look to them, much like reflectors from a bicycle wheel or something. They seemed very flat it was hard to make out any actual 3D form to them.  Then, after sitting there about 5 seconds, they suddenly shifted very quickly in the sky so that the lower one was now higher and the once-higher one was now lower. It is very difficult to explain in a narrative.  They froze again, shifted back to their ori! ginal positions.  They hung for another few seconds and then suddenly accelerated into the stars almost too fast for the eyes to follow.  Almost like how a shooting star is almost too fast to see, so these were gone in an instant. I can say with certainty that they went UP.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a masters degree in psychology, I have taken astronomy in college. I have lived near air force and other military bases. I have a very rational mind and I have no idea what I saw that night. I know that this is quite the claim to make but I swear that it happened<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I said to neighbor, here comes a helicopter. All I could see was just a round sphere. As I continued watching and waiting for sound I realized there was no sound, rotors or anything else; just a perfectly round ball. It passed overhead at about 120 degrees angle from the horizon. There was no sound, no protrusions of any kind. No lights or any kind of visible means of propulsion or power. Had I not been looking at the horizon just when I did and seen it coming, I would never have known it passed overhead. I would estimate it&#39;s speed as 200/300 miles per hour at about 1000 feet altitude. It was about 50/60 feet in diameter, and air force blue grey in color. The only thing I could see by way of markings was what appeared to be welding beads like where sections of plating were welded together.

I looked at the sky because the clouds were so menacing and saw a stationary spherical object staying motionless about 1000 feet up in the sky as if were on a tether, but it was much too windy for that. The object reminded me of an old World War II floating mine--a metal ball with &#34;sticks&#34; protruding out from it. It was defenitely metallic, and was so shocking to see that I pulled off the freeway and watched it for about 10 minutes trying to figure out what it was.  It eventually moved away and up into the clouds fairly slowly until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.
