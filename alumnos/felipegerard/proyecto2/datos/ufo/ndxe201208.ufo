After about 4-5mins this object then began moving away from us towards the course it came from.<n>

The occupant I was with record|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92947.html|2|ndxe201208| I was driving East on Miami Ave, Amsterdam NY around 11:30 when I saw a large bright object in the sky.  The occupant I was with recorded a video of the object, but the clarity of it is poor, only showing a white object.  However, it was glowing bright red, but would dim slowly to orange, then return back to red.  It did this repeatedly throughout the experience.  Its movement was quite slow, and there was a lack of sound accompanied by the object.  It was traveling in an Easterly direction.  Elevation was roughly 1,000 to 1,500 feet in the air.  I lost visual when the lights dimmed completely out roughly 3 to 4 miles to our West.  The skies were clear with stars visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/31/12 23:20|Provincetown|MA|Triangle|1 minute|Illuminated triangle makes strange movements in the sky|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92547.html|3|ndxe201208| Illuminated triangle makes strange movements in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were returning home from dinner when I noticed there was a strange green illuminated object in the sky, travelling too slow to be a meteor and too erratically and quickly to be a plane.  I called my girlfriends attention and we watched as it traveled indecisively throughout the sky.  It was a triangle, I&#39;d say about 5,000 ft. up there but this is a pure guess, and lacked wings or any distinct characteristics of a plane or helicopter.  It had no flashing lights but illuminated greens and blues for a while before it changed and included reds. It danced around the sky, with no direction, going fast at some points and slow with others.  The strangest of the movement was when it changed direction; there seemed to be no lag time for it to swhich- it was one fluid motion that went against the laws of physics.  We watched for about a minute before it disappeared behind buildings. Whether it landed on the ground or into the sky I do not know, but it was o! ver water while we witnessed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We reached the entrance of the development and turned to go home.  I noticed in the sky three orange glowing globes moving single file in fairly a straight line.  They were floating silently and steadily across the sky.  I asked my husband what he thought they were.  He said they were military planes, but then said they weren’t moving fast enough to be military planes.  We turned to see where they came from and saw a fourth one.  We tried to keep all of them in sight as they moved from northeast to southwest and turned more toward the west.  The first seemed to go up higher and suddenly disappeared.  My husband asked where it went.  At first we thought it went behind a cloud, but the clouds were very thin, so thin that you could see a star through them.  One by one the rest of the globes vanished in the same fashion.  We sighted the globes and they vanished all ! in probably about a minute or two. We really could not determine how high they were, but they were travelling in a specific direction and quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live by an Airport and know flight patterns and this was not on any flight pattern we&#39;ve ever seen before.  I tried to get out my camera but before I could the orange light disappeared and it&#39;s been 35 minutes and still have seen any commercial flights in the sky!<n>

Or something else?<n> <n><n> <n><n> WOW !  Amazing, thought it was a meteor but not positive.  It had NO TAIL,  It appeared out of no where,  and tonight was also a blue moon.  It appeared into thin air as a basketball size ball of fire, it slowly traveled about 1 mile north into washington fields area.  Very strange, after slowly moving (flames and all) it just disappeared.  It didnt break apart or disintegrate; it just disappeared.<n>
8/31/12 21:03|Spring Hill|TN|Cigar|10 seconds|Object captured in photos|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92411.html|8|ndxe201208| Object captured in photos<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 31st was the night of the so called Blue Moon. I have recently purchased a new camera and was on my deck taking pictures of the blue moon.  I was experimenting with different settings and using a remote control.  I must have taken 500 plus pictures that night. Around 2300 I decided to call it a night and come inside.  It was starting to get cloudy and they were calling for rain. I got out my laptop and started taking a look at some of the pictures.  I was deleting the ones that were blurry or too dark or too small. I ran across a sequence of pictures that had the moon with an object that was producing a contrail. I thought I got a picture of an airplane or something.  I did not recall seeing a plane in the sky that night and the Nashville airport was landing planes from the north.  The object I captured in the photos appeared to be traveling west to east although it is hard to say. The moon was in the south eastern sky that night.  I know the report states a! period of 10 seconds. That is because I did not see it but that is the time stamps on the pictures.  In most of the pictures you can see the contrail and when you enlarge the object it is a long cigar shape object.  I have had several friends look at it and no one seems to know what it might be.<n>

I went outside to investigate and immediately saw 3 large red lights in the sky in a triangle shape or possibly a V formation. The lights were far apart but moving in sync.  I considered if they were airplanes, but no blinking lights. The lights were, in fact, very different from airplane lights. First of all, they were much larger and they had a yellow light around the red light that made them appear rather “cartoon-ish” to me. I was shocked at how obvious these lights were and thought that anyone outside at the time couldn’t miss them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after I started watching the lights, one of them ventured off in another direction away from the others and disappeared.  I stood in my yard and continued to watch the other 2.  After about 3 minutes or so, another of the lights faded away leaving just the leading light. The whole episode lasted about 5 minutes.<n>

The clouds started to roll in so I couldn&#39;t see so well, but kept taking pictures anyway just to see what my camera could pick up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at the pictures there was a triangular object near the moon that stayed there for a few minutes of pictures.  It looked like it had perfectly spaced lights around the edges, although it was a little hazy because of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lightened the pictures up and saw the triangle very clearly in every picture I took of the moon.<n>

It looked 3D almost. By the time we went back, it was gon<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I were driving near our house in Durham tonight at about 8:40 pm.  We had noticed a weird light in the sky - except it was strange.  Have you ever seen one of those balloons that are on a stick?  It looked like that - but 3D which had made it even more strange.  There were about 6-10 bright oval - like lights on it, but more underneath, if you looked at a kitchen bowl and you see the bottom edge like they were lined up in a row.  It was not moving, it was hovering, and it also looked as if it was IN Durham..not far in the sky.  By the time we turned around to see it (we were driving so we pulled over) it had been hovering in a field off of a main road. It had disappeared in those 1 minute / 2 minutes from turning around.<n>

Start of night shift.  Sun had just set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my first rounds from a vantage point of 100&#39; I observed a formation of blinking lights in the direction of Salem (not far from the nuclear plant) primarily white with intermittent flashes of red and blue.  I continued observing, at first thinking it was a helicopter, however after some time I ruled out that as a possibility when the movement and character of the flashes became bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights would jolt horizontally from one position to the next with an astounding speed.  All the while the lights would gain and loose intensity.  The flash pattern also changed frequently and had no regularity that is often associated with normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next sequence of events are what I feel sets this sighting into the category of a UFO.  The lights faded out completely and re-appeared a good deal of distance away instantaneously.  The intensity of the lights grew almost 10 fold.  The lights then split into two separate formations going from a bright white to incandescent red/orange gradually increasing and decreasing in intensity at about .5 cycles per second .  The two formations traveled away from each other horizontally to a point then began moving in the same direction.  After a short time they reformed into the original formation I had observed and continued behaving in the same erratic fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

She called to me and said, &#34;Mom, what is that?  Come here!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out back and looked up.  In between the tall fir trees, there was a glowing orange rectangular object moving through the sky heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started heading out over our house, so we both ran through the house to the front yard.  It had now changed direction and was heading east.  I told my daughter to go get her brother, and just as they came out of the house, the object just evaporated.   There were only a few clouds;  it was clear where it had been.   Also, the moon was unusually large and was in the same direction that the object was travelling.<n>

Object turns white sometimes at top and bends left and right, gets shorter and longer at times.  But always stays upright  Looks like a &amp;quot;Coin slot&amp;quot; in the sky.  Watched it for over 30mins and it moved east about 1000 yards. There was no plane putting it so it wasnt an air sign.<n>

I was walking back home from my jog when I looked up because I noticed an object that looked strange. I figured it was an airplane but I didn&#39;t hear a noise Ans I ignored it, at around 9:10 am.   I got on the phone with my brother and was looking outside at 9:24 am and noticed the same object out side in the sky but seemed smaller because it was moving away slowly.  I couldn&#39;t see it in much detail anymore so I decide to use my husbands camera with the long lens to view it, unfortunately the battery was dead but I was able to view it a little better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very far away and with the camera I saw an upright cilindrical almost like an upright cigar floating in the sky.  It was grey I could see a reddish tint in the middle, as if it was hot or about to light up. It made no sound and was living slowly. It was visible to the naked eye for about 30 min, at least from when I first noticed it. It never landed only dissapeared in the sky as it moved farther away.<n>

Once as a kid I thought maybe I taken a picture of one, but the picture was in fact a bead of water on my camera lens. I say that because I have also seen the fireballs that were previously talked about on the 18, same characteristics and everything.  Where I live, to be vague, is about an hour and a half from where the other group saw the same UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heading from the West towards the East, the first fireball came from the corner of my eye and looked as if it were a plane on fire, I freaked out thinking a plane was going down but there was no sound. I questioned what I saw.  Like the other group I thought chinese fire lamp, but this was to high for the brightness, then the second appeared.  Same direction the second ball of light came, the thought of a plane still was going, maybe a plane in half but again no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got online and researched &#39;red light over wisconsin&#39;. I found this site and to my findings I feel that the two of us saw the same thing.  Whether its extraterrestrial, I don&#39;t know, but take this entry as a validation that I too saw the same thing within 90 miles of the last viewing, heading back from the direction they (on 08/18/12) saw it going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

So I went outside and looked for a clear angle.  As I was positioning the camera a red dot flashed on the LCD screen.  Not knowing what it was, I checked the camera to be sure I had it set correctly.  I then noticed that the red dot was in the sky, much smaller than the moon.  It flashed again, and I took a picture.  I then moved over slightly to take a second picture.  I then noticed another object (blue/green) below the red.  After taking the two photos I returned indoors.  When I loaded the photos in my computer I noticed the other was green, smaller and positioned below the red dot.  So I enlarged them.  I do not know what to think about all of this other than it is strange.  They looked like dots until I enlarged them.  The enlargements look like vapors or fog.  See photos attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object is about 30 degrees above the horizon. It appears stationary, but is rapidly flashing lights, the colors include blue, red, green, and gold.  I am using binoculars, but I cannot get a good view of what it can be, appears to be just a multicolored flashing object. The colors are flashing one after the other but they do not seem to be in any order, or in any particular repitition, but the flashes vary in duration.  I have seen these before, but never this bright or close. These are definately not FAA lights, I am very familiar with those.<n>

These two lights were due south of the highway’s bend.  I then saw that there were 6 more of these lights, all making a constellation-like formation, including these two in the middle (Total of 8 lights).  The lights were reddish-orange, with their inner light source, being a type of energy that seemed fluid-like within (molten might fit as a better description).  They were moving west at approximately 40mph to 45mph.  The lights were approximately 300 or so feet from the ground and looked fairly close.  While I was observing them, they did not drop nor travel any higher than their constant altitude.  They appeared to be between the 202 and Germann Rd. area.   I took the off ramp at Alma School Rd. and headed south to Germann Rd. where I then headed west for two miles, to see where they had gone.  All the lights were gone, except for one.  The light that was l! eft was now much higher and heading towards the Sierra Estrella Mountains, where it got slowly dim and disappeared over the course of about one minute.  I viewed this dimming from a parking lot off of Price Rd. and near W. Willis Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also add that I had noticed a bright white blinking light (at a rate of once a second for the duration of ~10 seconds or so) that was miles away to the North.  I saw this earlier, when all the lights were still visible.  This white light seemed like an aircraft flashing its lights in the direction of these unknown lights.  This white blinking light seemed to be around the Sky Harbor eastern side flight path, moving west.  This would have been about 10 to 12 miles north of my highway position near the bend.  I have to assume there is a pilot that saw these and was signaling for some reason.  This aircraft did not change its course south.  I believe that aircraft was landing, but for some odd reason was flashing its lights in this direction.  I did not see any other planes flashing their lights in this manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an Electronics Engineer and an avid skywatcher.  I have also been known to chase storms on occassion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Right away, I ran outside on the porch. The light&#39;s hovered for about 15 seconds then faded away. There was about 10 lights, and they were in the shape of an oval. I stayed out on the porch and a few minutes later 8 red lights right next to each other hovered across the whole sky. It was so crazy that I ran back inside and woke up my son. We waited on the porch for some time. A bit later, the flashing green lights appeared again; this time they were hovering across the sky (15 seconds). They were the same shape and everything. Towards the end the stopped flashing and turned orange. We waited for another 20 minutes and nothing happened. I put my son to bed and found this website. As I writing this report the green lights appeared again! They were the same as before. They hovered for over a minute this time. At the end, they all disappeared excep! t one which out of nowhere fell out of the sky unimaginably fast. It looked like it hit the ocean (we were right next to the ocean).  I don&#39;t really believe in UFO&#39;s , but after what just happened I don&#39;t know what to think. I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/30/12 21:30|Blythe/Desert Center (between)|CA|Fireball|Approx. 5 min.|Fireball and Circular lights appearing and disapearing over Chuckwalla Mountains Wilderness Area, CA|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92499.html|30|ndxe201208| Fireball and Circular lights appearing and disapearing over Chuckwalla Mountains Wilderness Area, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of 30 August 2012 at approximately 2130, my family and myself were driving west on Interstate 10.  We were just past Blythe, CA and I noticed several lights in the sky south of the Interstate.  The lights were very bright and at first I thought they were some type of flares because of the way they were illuminating. It looked as if a plane was dropping them but as I was looking at that set of lights I noticed a second set to the west of the first set that was in an inverted circular shape.  I would say there were about six or seven of them.  I didn’t notice if they were rotating or not as I was still driving and I only caught a glimpse of them, but they appeared to be still.  I don’t believe a plane could have dropped flares to make that kind of formation.  The first set of lights was very bright and white and orange in color.  The circular set of lights was a bright white and lasted about five to ten seconds and then disappeared. The other set ! of lights that looked as if they were flares appeared multiple times.  These were the first lights that I noticed because of the way they appeared but they didn’t really light up the sky and its surroundings like a flare would.  Don’t get me wrong, they were very bright and noticeable but I don’t believe they acted as if a flare would.  My wife grabbed the camera as quick as she could after I noticed the lights and she was able to start recording the lights.  I pulled over as soon as I could and she handed me the camera since I had a better view.  The spot that I pulled over was about two miles east of Copa Ditch which is just past exit 201.  We later pulled off there after the lights disappeared to see if we could see anything else, but we didn’t see the lights again from that point. After doing some research of the area using Google Maps today, I would put the lights between Interstate 10 and Brawley, CA just over the Chuckwalla Mountains Wilderness Area.   I talked to th! e California Highway Patrol Dispatch in Indio, CA today and th! ey didn’ t know of any reports in that area that night.  I also called the Dispatch Office in El Centro, CA and they also didn’t have any reports.  They were a little short with me though as if they weren’t going to tell me even if they did have reports.  The video that we took shows how the lights formed and then disappear but what was unique was the way they seemed to go in a downward circular motion as if it was following the ridge of a craft.  I didn’t notice any navigational lights as aircraft would usually have at all in the sky until several miles down the road which I could clearly make out as a plane.  After the lights disappeared and as we were heading to Exit 201 we noticed a Police car pulled over on the eastbound side of the Interstate with its lights on.  It had another car in front of it and it looked like an unmarked Police car.  The Officer appeared to be looking at the lights as well.  After we pulled off at Exit 201 and didn’t see anything more, we then continued d! riving west on Interstate 10.  As we came up to a sign with the name “Tex Wash” just like Copa Ditch I noticed three white lights in the sky between the ridges of the mountain.  I saw the three lights and then two of them disappeared leaving one light.  They looked to be in a triangular formation at first.  Just as quick as they appeared they disappeared.  I would say they lasted about three to five seconds.  While driving home from California on Sunday the 2nd of September I noticed several towers in the area these three lights were so I am not certain that they were extraterrestrial in nature or not.  I know this whole account seems a little odd but I have over twelve years in the service and I have never seen anything like this before.  This was a very strange sighting.  I kept referring to flares in the video but that was the only thing that I could compare it to.  I do not believe they were flares, though.  I hope someone else has a similar story or sighting, I know th! ere were a lot of people driving on that road at the same time! I was t hat night that must have seen this as well.  It was very noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued to watch it for another 20 seconds before it was out of site in the north east sky.

I observed it go from the northern horizon to the southern horizon in about 30 seconds.  Even though the object could be noticed only by the three triangle-corner edge lights, It had an awesome,intimidating presence.It was moving too fast to go get a camera so I just watched the smooth-floating object as it faded into the night sky.<n>

This is a metropolitan desert community.  The vicinity is a commercial/light industrial area with farm fields on the outskirts.  The Imperial County Municipal Airport is immediately to the N/W of the intersection.  The weather was clear and there were light streaks of clouds in the sky highlighted by the moonlight.  There was a bright full moon and bright stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When approximately 1/2 mile from the intersection, I observed just east of me, a dull amber glowing, cigar shaped object in the sky with a zig zag or snake-like pattern of multiple colored individual lights adjacent to the amber object.  The amber portion was much larger than the multiple colored lights.  The multiple colored lights seemed disconnected to the amber object and were all evenly spaced from one another.  The entire group appeared to be at least 500 feet from end to end, again, it did not appear to be solid, but instead, segmented.  The individual lights adjacent to the amber cigar shaped object were yellow, green, red, and blue, respectively. There might have been other colors of lights, but I do not recall. All of the multi-colored lights were rectangular and solid.  There was no display of any sort of blinking night-time aviation flight lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was estimated to be at an altitude of at least 3,000 feet, although it was hard to discern because it was night time.  It appeared to be stationary.  After about 10 seconds, it suddenly disappeared and you could see slight cloud streaks and stars in the background where it had been.  It was not like a solid object that merely blacked out but was still there, in which case it would block out any objects behind it.  Instead, it was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one second later, another object, or possibly the same one, just suddenly appeared from nowhere, about 3 miles further north, probably in the vicinity of SR-86 and Keystone Road., and about 1/4 east of that intersection.  This time, it appeared to be in the form of a giant Ferris wheel in the sky:  the same individual multi-colored lights were in a wheel shape that was vertically turned on its axes and at about a 45 degree angle.  I could not discern whether the center was solid as that portion of it was too dull.  The entire object was surrounded by a very soft white aura or haze.  This too was completely stationary, not moving or rotating.  The entire object was much larger than the previous one that first appeared to the south.  It too was at least 500 feet in diameter.  This stayed in view for at least 15 seconds, and then faded away to a very bright, small amber glowing cigar shaped object that remained stationary.  After about 10 seconds, it suddenly disappeared.!   I remained in the vicinity for at least 15 minutes to see if it, or they might reappear, but there was no further activity.  I am very familiar with the area and the activity in and around the airport.  This certainly had nothing to do with airport activity or any sort of night time crop dusting activities.<n>

I saw what looked to be a string of lights in the sky, about 9 of the and not in a straight row but almost looked like Christmas lights in a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at Mound Rd. I went south bound but wanted to see more of were these lights were coming from so I turned on 18 mile west bound to see if I could fallow them. I saw them and decided to pull over a take a photo with my phone. They were changing there formation and started to fade one light at a time, the last light in the row stayed the brights for a longer time and I just left in my car knowing that was strange.<n>

Area for the last month.  I personally have seen the object 3 times (twice this week).  The object changes colors (green, red and white) and it flies at different altitudes. I uploaded an iPhone video to YouTube  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV8vb0VKXb0<n>

I watched as it descended at a rapid speed directly in front of me and thought oh my god what is that.  My next thought was whatever it is it&#39;s going to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my cell and snapped a picture and called my husband to tell him to go outside.  At this time I was coming to the stoplight where I noticed several cars pulled over watching it.  As I turned through the light I turned my head to see it again and it was gone.<n>

I realized it was not a single sidelight, but a solid mass of light.  Then the object made a sharp turn to the north and then immediately turned vertically. It had the shape of a &amp;quot;bird&amp;quot; or upside down cross, as there was no tail.  However, it was twilight and glowed a bright fluorescent green with orange around the entire edge.  Suddenly, it was gone. Logic left me as I realized it was NOT an airplane nor bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to Shawnee Heights Road, scanning the sky outside of my windows, trying to rationalize what I had just seen. I then continued to the roundabout at Croco Rd. and looped around until heading eastbound. I pulled over near the transformers, just east of the roundabout. Now I noticed a jet, with flashing wing lights and landing light, circling the aforementioned location of the object. This plane circled 3 times before moving off in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued into Topeka, where I heard and saw a plane flying over, towards the West. I am not sure if this was the same jet, or another.<n>

When I looked it looked very strange to me.  I went and grabbed my binoculars and to my amazement I saw a literal saucer shaped UFO.  I am 16 years old and this looked like something of a movie. It had a single pulsating red light on top. a green light on one side and red light on other side. Similar to airplane but not an airplane. I am an airplane enthusiast and know exactly what a plane or helicopter looks like. It was not a blimp either. It seemed low to the ground maybe no more than 2,000 feet in the air. It was hovering in certain area. It would go farther away and appear to be a tiny spec of a star. Then it would come back a little closer and I could see the lights on it. When it was closer I could use my high powered binoculars to see the very distinct shape of a saucer. I could not believe my eyes. It was hove! ring and slowly moving in what seemed to be a particular patter. Farther away then coming back and slowly going left and right. After watching it for about 1 hour. I when inside my house to the downstairs and talked to my mom and old her what I saw. I actually drew a picture of exactly what I saw. After about 15 minutes I came back up on my roof to see if it was still there. And when i went out I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes, it had somehow moved from what seemed to be over 50-100 miles away to less that 10-20 miles away. It moved from the eastern sky to northern  sky and still remained very low to the ground. I could really see it with the binoculars and called one of my brothers friend who was in my backyard to come on the roof and see it. He saw it and didn&#39;t know what it was. From the point when I first came back onto the roof and saw how far it moved, it was slowly moving the the West and disappeared from my eyesight possibly over the ocean. I can;t believe anybody else di! d not report it. It was so real and distinct and I knew that I! was loo king at something from out of this world. Please believe me. I called news stations and they wanted video proof. I did not have a camera and my cell phone camera would have not picked it up. This was real and it was over the entire Los Angeles area. After it went what seemed to be over the ocean I could not see it anymore. That was the end of it.<n>

And continued to walk away for his daily morning break walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was now after nine minutes observed Moving southwest towards Toronto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just faded out before my eyes due to distance I came back inside work Found out our Company Server went down at the same time as the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being very excited to see my second UFO daylight sighting today for 2012 Along with many pictures which I took with the adjoining building used in the picture as a marker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought how much photographic evidence I’ll have of this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s the real shocker to this story : During lunch break I looked on the computer and was shocked that only one picture was captured to what I had witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other images to be found of the other 16 still shots taken- very strange .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was bright enough of a light to pick –up in the photos  I had hoped to have some good pictures taken of this light object witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I just wonder why ?  This goes on later that day to another daylight sighting much closer  At about 2:00pm I was on the other side of the building where our parking lot is located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside and look up and about Noticing instantly a strange brilliant white colored flickering square shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then yelled for a coworker to come out and see this thing As the coworker reach me outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also could see it due to being so low and close The witness said O- that’s a kite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I explained to him that it moved over our parking lot heading to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a kite ! As he watched on with me for another minute He then concluded  it’s not a kite He was now not so sure to confirm what it could be ?  It’s altitude was quite low at maybe five- hundred feet above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted about two minutes to when I first witnessed it ! Unfortunately I did not have my camera on me As I just remained watching it’s movements and shape being almost square like flickering Maybe some type of probe ?  I’m now at a point of what’s next if I continue to look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The timing to looking for unknowns have been certainly uncanny *  You will found the bright white UFO if you zoom top left on the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again really odd in witnessing all these UFO sightings day and night * Very busy in our skies showing a sign of a presence  THANKS ONCE AGAIN FOR YOU INTEREST AS I FEEL THIS ‘ MUST ‘ BE SHARED.<n>

8/29/12 00:31|Columbus|OH|Fireball|1 minute|Orange Glowing Orb or Fireball seen over Columbus OH, (North OSU Campus)|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92265.html|60|ndxe201208| Orange Glowing Orb or Fireball seen over Columbus OH, (North OSU Campus)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observation: Myself and a close friend were walking South in an alley between 18th and 17th Street, OSU Campus.  We saw two objects in the sky to the South-East of our location.  The objects appeared to be orange lights.  They were travelling away from us (S.E.) at approx. 1000 feet above ground, and approx. 100-150 mph.  The 2 objects travelled in the same direction, in a straight line formation.  The second trailed the other by 100-200 feet.  At this point they were quite far off, such that we did not get a detailed look at them.  The objects left our field of vision in the distance to the South-East of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 10-15 seconds later we observed what appeared to be the same orange objects, however this time the objects were to the North-East of us, travelling South-East.  They were much closer this time, passing our longitude at a few hundred feet to the North of our location.  At this point we observed the objects in greater detail.  Both objects were travelling in the same trajectory as previously observed, with the same approx. altitude and velocity, travelling the same approx. distance apart.  Their speed, altitude, and trajectory remained constant.  The orange objects, now at a much closer distance to our position, appeared to be comprised of two sections, upper and lower.  The upper section of the object appeared to be spherical in shape, with a light emitting a ‘glowing’ effect, rather than a ‘shining’ effect.  The lower section was a shining orange light, and appeared to be swaying back and forth in relation to the upper part.  These observed qualities led us to thi! nk that these were balloons, with a glowing globe, and an under-basket emitting a orange flame which illuminated the upper globe portion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However a few questions remain unanswered.  One, the objects appeared to be about the size of a small 4-person propeller plane.  The orange globe appeared to be too similar in size to the orange light underneath for it to be the parachute of a balloon.  Two, the objects travelled at a velocity much faster than a typical balloon.  Three, how did the two objects move so quickly from the SE of us to the NE of us in a matter of seconds, or were there in fact 4 glowing objects in the sky?  About the Observers: I am a 22 year old Music Instructor, recently graduated from Under-grad. My friend is 23 years old, on break from school, working as a restaurant server.  We are house-mates and close friends. We both observed the same objects, agreeing on the physical characteristics, and details of the event, to the best of our knowledge.  Neither of us were able to identify these objects, although our closest guess was some sort of balloon.  We were intrigued by them and looked online with the intent to find some explanation of what they were.  In our search we stumbled upon this reporting site and decided to write a report.  We found that our observations match those of many of the other entries depicting a &amp;quot;red/orange fireball or Orb&amp;quot;.  The above three paragraphs contain my personal account of the events which took place, recorded to the best of my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend recorded a short video-clip of the objects using his iPhone.  But he went to bed, so I am unable to upload that at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Didn&#39;t think much of it... at first. Every 20-25 minutes I would again hear this sound, traveling from SSE to NNW. After the third time, I went outside onto my deck to try to catch a glimpse of the aircraft I heard at regular intervals. The sky is clear, near full moon, not a cloud in the sky. Beautiful night for star gazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the SSE, I first noticed two very bright white lights... much brighter than even medivac&#39;s lights would be. As this craft got closer, I heard that familiar sound of what I thought was an airplane. As the craft flew over me, I realized this was triangular in shape with three white lights and one bright red, flashing light in the center, under-side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed this craft visually as it continued N then NW...followed along the horizon until it was out of sight due to a ridge of trees and houses. Approximately 20 minutes passed when I again caught this craft in the SW sky. From that point, it was almost exactly 5 minutes before it was once again approaching me from the SSE, continuing along the same path as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I am writing of this siting of something, it has again just completed another lap in/around the area. I&#39;ve searched all sources of media for any way to explain this bazaar siting... nothing...  No other witnesses to what I&#39;ve seen except for my dog!<n>

At first i thought they might be planes or mabey even hellocopters, but they move back and forth and all kinds of ways that are impossable for them to do. The past couple of nights there have been at least nine.  Some of them will get closer to the earth then get farther, they will move slowly then suddenly move faster changing speed.  They will apear to be going backwords then suddenly forwords, witch i am alost 100% sure &#34;human&#34; crafts can&#39;t do.  A couple of times i seen what apeared to be a shooting star.

At the center of the object was a mid-section, measured about 1/10 of the total length.  The mid-section (perpendicular to the length) as the diameter of the mid-section was smaller by about 5%. The color was pristine, more pristine than polished stainless steel. The color was as close to looking like sterling silver crossed with mercury and appealing to the eye as I did not have to squint as I watched. It was a clear evening, blue sky with the moon in the background and the sun behind me. The level of the object was slightly parallel to the horizon with the forward slightly elevated. No sound, no wings, no propulsion system, no rudder, no lights and no exhaust fumes.  There was no reflection from the sun rays. Altitude was probably a consistant 200 feet above ground during flight. Distance from observer was probably less than one mile. Traveled at a constant speed about 60 knots with no vibration or erratic flight path.  Observed a Sou! thwest flight path.  Observer is ex-military, experienced in robotics, sub-sea robotics, employed manager in a corporate environment<n>

At 3:30am I saw (out of the kitchen window) what appeared to be a star, but bigger than the North star and 3 times as bright.  I watched it for 10-15 minutes as it stayed stationary in line with the tip of a tree. I put my baby to bed but he awoke again 10 minutes later and we went back in the kitchen. The &#39;star&#39; was now moving very slowly. Over the next 10 minutes it moved diagonally upwards and right until it stopped again for about 5 minutes before continuing in the same direction and out of my view.<n>

They appeared kind of slowly, like when you light a candle and the flame is faint at first then becomes stronger.  While observing this (with much excitement), noticed that two of the orange balls began to move.  They started doing sort of a figure eight around each other, clearly an impossibility for today&#39;s aircraft.  They did this for several seconds ( i would say the whole incident was about 10-15 seconds) and then all 7 objects vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The sky was pretty clear, No clouds and no regular air traffic. I observed these three stationary white lights that were spread Out like an isoceles triangle. One was very faint to the naked eye, but i could clearly see it was blinking,  Slowly at times and rapid at times. The second white light was closer and I could make out a red and a blue light on either side of the central blinking white light. The third light was the closest to me, roughly 2 or 3 miles. This light was also blinking what looked like morse code along with the other two lights. This spacecraft, or whatever it was, was definitely a saucer like shape. I could make out the white light that came out of the craft was in a horizontal line that ran around the ship. It also seamed to have multi- colored lights that spun around the craft or center of the white light. All three of these ships sit stationary for a couple hours, this happened three nights in a row.  The first two nights they were in the same place in the sky, the third night they had moved.  But all three nights they seemed to be in a perfect triangle formation.<n>

At first I thought it was a close bright star but it seemed to be a little too bright and big in the sky. The object stood stationary for about a minute and a half, then it turned bright green and zoomed off to the east faster than my head can turn.  By the time I turned my head to follow it the light went away. I don’t know if it turned off or if it disappeared. I never believed in UFO’s or anything like that.  But now I am starting to wonder.  I couldn’t see any kind of shape or anything because the light was so bright.  I am not saying this is a UFO for sure because I don’t know, but I don’t know of any kind of aircraft that can stay in one place, that is that bright, and that can move that fast without any noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above.

Initially, I thought it was an airplane on fire because it was so low and assumed it was crashing.  The main color was orange, but it seemed as if there was a smaller green light at the front of the object.  Similarly, there was a darkness to the mass that made me believe it was plane with its engines on fire.  Since there was no noise, I assumed the engines had stalled out. There was not a long tail on the object like there usually is in a shooting star.  It moved horizontally and then took a sharp left.  Its path then became obscured by the trees to the right side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the phone at the time of the sighting, and I&#39;m not a person who swears much, but I swore. A lot.  The person I was talking to is a police officer in another Maine municipality.  He checked all the teletypes for plane crashes.  There were none. I also checked the papers for the next few days for meteor sightings, etc.  Again, I couldn&#39;t find any reports.<n>

I looked up and saw a amber coloured light moving in a south by south east direction (I was facing due east).  I have a lot of Hooks Airport and IAH Airport traffic over my home.  This “craft” did not have landing lights, strobe, red beacon, right and left lights.  There was no body other than the amber light emitted.  The craft made no sound (as I got off the phone to watch it before it went behind my home).  I would say the light was about a 45 degree angle up, flying in a straghtline...but a little up and down as it moved along.   I have seen amber lights like these before in the area on a previous sighting about three years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former professional truck driver and current small business owner.

He was in El Cajon/San Diego and I was in Indio.  This is 163 miles apart.  He mentioned seeing a satellite crossing the bottom of the big dipper, so I stepped outside to take a look. This bright light was very high up-far above any possible planes (which we could see underneath). It was maintaining a course, so it seemed like it could be a satellite but it was moving very quickly and then it zig zagged a bit. The trajectory was from the Northwest to the Southeast.  As it lowered to the southeastern horizon, I noticed a bright light shoot upward from the UFO, it zig zagged again and then faded.<n>

I was about 2 miles southeast of the intersection of Interstate freeways 5 and 8.  This sighting started out with a solid yellow-orange light coming towards me from the north towards the south.  I was looking north.  There were no collision lights like a normal plane or jet would have.  Many jets and planes are seen down here as this area is along the landing path for the San Diego airport.  Jets that are flying south will head south along the 5 freeway and then turn east over the 8 freeway in preparation of landing at the San Diego airport.  I am very familiar with seeing these jets and planes.  And these aircraft have collision lights, and in this sighting, there were no collision lights on this yellow-orange light.  Anyway, this yellow-orange light was moving slowing towards me.  It was almost as large as the front light seen on an approaching jet, which is larger tha! n a star in the sky.  After viewing this Yellow-orange light for about 30 seconds, it slowing turned off.  Nothing.  I kept watching the area where the light had disappeared and about 2 minutes later, but much higher in the sky, the light, or a light, powered back on and quickly flew west to east.  This time, the light was mostly white, but looked a duller color than the stars.  It was not moving slowly, but faster than a jet would move at that higher elevation.  I lost track of it after about 30 seconds as it was too far away.  Then about 15 to 20 minutes later, maybe about 8:45pm, I saw a white light power-up directly north of me again; but this time lower than the first 2 lights described above.  This last time the light was as low as the jets coming in for their landing descent.  The light was not directly in the jets path, but somewhat more north.  It was slowing moving south to north and slow.  I did not see this last light very long, maybe 15 seconds and then it slow! ly turned off or powered down.  I say powered down, because th! at&#39;s the impression I got when I saw it turn off.  Again, no collision lights.  It was just gone.  I don&#39;t know if this was 1 craft or 2 or 3 separate crafts.  I did not hear any noise.  I should have heard something, at least for the last light since it was closer, but I did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After about 30 seconds I see 25-40 white circles appear in the sky.  We continued talking and watching these objects for about 45 minutes.  They were white moving slowly, almost hovering at times no sound.  It appeared that they were rotating because they were white, then they would all appear metallic and then black and then they would all at the same time disappear and reappear shortly after either in the same spot or all in different location all at together.   After about a 1/2 hour I got smart and had my youngest run in and get my oldest daughter and her boyfriend and their phone and Ipod.  They ran down the street and tryed to take pictures and video but all that showed up were a couple of black dots.  Not anything like we actually saw.<n>

So I was having a dream and was nearing the end of the dream, when suddenly an Unidentified Flying Object was visible in the sky. There was only a split-second before I and my companions who were travelling with me were all surrounded by a beam of some sort, of which I do not know, and the ground began to tremble, as if an earthquake had just begun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, we all began to float upward. The light emitting from the beam was blinding; I wasn&#39;t able to see anything outside the beam. As we neared the Unidentified Flying Object, I began convulsing without control, which I believe was a seizure, and was so strong it woke me up. The seizure also carried into when I woke up(about for a second) and I do not have any medical conditions related to seizures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything beyond this point is purely speculation, and is an opinion, and entirely non-fact based.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok. I believe my dream from point of &#39;abduction&#39;(Abducton - An act of being taken from a point without your consent or free will)to point of seizure was real, due to the vividness of the dream, I almost also could not tell when I crossed a reality threshold of having the seizure and being in my bed. It was like I was just suddenly there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never believed in extra-terrestrial existence, but I do now. I was completely skeptical and made aliens look completely impossible in the eyes of my friends, but it happened just an hour or two ago, and forgive my franticness, but I&#39;m afraid I will forget or something. I do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it could have been a device which would invert the gravitational pull of a living being from the Earth&#39;s gravitational pull to a gravitational push. In essence, a functioning tractor beam to only pick up living beings. The power needed to pull off such an extraordinary feat would require, in my belief, the equivilancy of a 100-Megaton Nuclear Bomb(Using our conventional technology).I&#39;ve been skeptical of aliens all my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if it was &#39;aliens&#39;. It could have been a government test or something. I have no idea. But this was easily the most radical thing I&#39;ve witnessed in my entire life. If you&#39;ve read this all the way through. Thank you for reading my story, because I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d live to tell it.<n>

This drew me and my wife outside, where we saw another similar set of flickering lights only this set was moving in a manner consistent with an aircraft, but lower and the lights where not as they should be on a commercial aircraft. Switching attention to this one I watched it fly from north to southwest and as it passed overhead slightly to the east the glow of its lights allowed me to see a main body of the object which was a light color maybe white or light grey? And sort of foot ball or eggish shaped without any wings that I could observe. The fact that I could see a fucilage clearly but coul! d not here the object is what made me consider this an unidentified object, as I am very familiar  with aircraft, and the sounds associated with them. The object continued out of sight towards the south and slightly west. Meanwhile the original lights that drew me out continued a slow and inconstant trec towards the east, moving slowly at times and not at all at times, I watched it for about 12 minutes before going in to see if others had seen anything and mentioned anything on the Internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a high layer of clouds over the ocean.  We were playing cards and noticed two lights out over the ocean, they moved at a medium speed, not slow and not fast.  They first moved up and then horizontally and back, one then moved down.  Three others appeared and moved up.  Then they moved out of sight into the clouds.  There was no sign of a ship or boat on the ocean, no lights on the water…<n> <n><n> <n><n> After going to bed I woke around 3am and got up to get a drink of water.  I looked out and noticed one light in the sky in the same manner as the original five.<n>

There were three of them in total. What struck me was I know what a beacon light on an aircraft looks like, and what I saw was not like any beacon light I have ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects seemed very distant, and high up. They displayed a multicolored strobe effect producing a white flash (most frequent), a blue flash (displayed this color maybe three times), and a red flash (only one of the three objects flashed red).  On none of the objects was the flash timed. There was no beat so to speak. The lights flashed without rhythm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me is that they appeared very far up and far away yet their flash was powerful.  One by one the objects disappeared except the last two seemed to stay stationary at one point, then too proceeded across the sky quickly.  They all moved across the sky and due to the great distance, I imagine were traveling very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the objects moved across the sky they would disappear and reappear, being visible  by their flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred over the sky&#39;s of Everett and Mulkeleteo Washington.  Possibly even farther North, I am not confident in judging where the objects appeared exactly.<n>

The first one was like a very bright plane with no blinking light, the light itself was very white-white, and it was moving almost like a plane, south over downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as Y jokingly said, &#34;Maybe it&#39;s a UFO.&#34;  It proceeded to slow down and slightly change direction (either west, or up... not sure), and over the course of 3 or 4 seconds, the round white light dimmed to orange, then, slowly to red, then it faded out; not behind clouds or anything, it was crystal clear out. And I know that nothing that big and bright could go out of sight relatively instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later, as we were still in the pool tripping out, she said &#39;look, another one!&#39; I totally didnt believe her at first, but sure enough, there was an already dim one changing direction and fading out. It was just above the mountain behind Downtown Palm Springs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am so pumped we got to see them.<n>

They all were flying at the same speed quite close to eachother &amp; made no noise at all!!  They were very much synchronized &amp; pretty close, close enough for me to catch a picture on my cell phone.  There hard to describe but they didn&#39;t really look like an object or it was to dark to tell what they were.  The best description I could use is floating fireballs.  After about 5-7 minutes they disappeared into the sky!  It was the bizarre &amp; amazing thing I have ever seen!!!!!<n>

About 3 weeks prior to this sighting we were driving home from work and we saw this redish orange light moving across the sky at night. Ot was moving faster than a plane didn&#39;t have the flashing lights like a plane does either. These things are just unexplainable.<n>

We saw a large round orb of light moving from a Northwest direction towards the East. I ran inside to get the camera and we witnessed the large round ball of light move steadily towards the south, stop for a few moments and slowly float behind trees until it lowered and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Had I went around to the back of our home we may have seen more, but I didn&#39;t.  Two nights later, on August 29 around 9pm I went outside to feed our cat. I saw in the South two more of the orbs, one small one that floated up and a larger one that moved toward the East.  It slowly floated down in the same area the orb did two nights before.  Again, I didn&#39;t go behind the house to see where it went, but I was a bit excited/scared so I didn&#39;t really want to go back there!

Observed 5 metallic dark silver tear drop objects with red glowing interior as it passed above large radio broadcast antenna and below our wing.  Tried to make out if it was another aircraft, determined it was not as there were no wings or rotors.  If it was suspended or supported from the ground and could not see that.  The objects were very close to the plane 100-200 feet and closer to the plane than the radio broadcast antenna.  Do not know what I saw.  A white light appeared at the end of one of the objects.  Plane flew over them and they were gone out of sight from my window.  They were moving at and angle slightly away from the plane while the radio antenna stayed in a constant left to right position, so I determined the object was not attached to the ground and moving away from the plane meant they were flying, basically our flight path did ! not “make” the objects move as the ground objects moved.  They were in the air and in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will email a image that I have mocked up of what I saw, as my camera was turned off for landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked here if she was from park city and she said she was.  I then asked if she had ever seen anything like that and I pointed to the lights.  She stood looking in amazement and said she had not.  Next one shot across the sky and then went back with the other ones and they disappeared not really in the distance but in thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Couldn&#39;t have been more than 500 feet above.  I still couldn&#39;t make out a real shape because it was so bright.  I watched it float silently away towards the horizon before it finally clicked in our heads to get my huge zoom camera out... I ran across some lawns barefoot to get a picture.  Had I actually realized in my confusion, I would have had my camera out right when I saw it- and could have seen in detail everything about the craft.  The pictures don&#39;t do it justice, and aren&#39;t as bright as what I saw in person.<n>

I was driving southbound on interstate 87.  It was a sunny late afternoon, with not a cloud in the sky. I looked up at the sky and saw the moon was out early.  To the right side of the moon, about an inch away from it, (estimated distance using an intelligent guess) far off in the distance was an extremely shiny, cigar-shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was much too far away to get a clear look at any distinguishing features.  But the object was intensely reflective as if it was made of polished steel.  There did not appear to be any light eminating from the object, and there was no sign of a trail in the sky as if it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that the object was moving at a rapid rate of speed, considering the distance from me.  Then it moved up, across, and back down. I tried to keep an eye on it, but it disappeared from sight.  I continued to scan the cloudless sky as I made my way down the highway, but I could no longer see the object anywhere.<n>

It&#39;s hard to explain, but no aircraft here would make those noises.  We are in a suburban neighborhood, planes cannot come that close to our houses.  This is not the first time there has been something over our house/backyard.  A month ago I was awoken at the same exact time because of a bright flash that flooded through our window &amp; covered our backyard. It lasted only seconds before disappearing. I&#39;m scared.<n>

What we seen were flashing lights above the tree tops.  They were very bright and lasted for about a half hour.  I couldn&#39;t tell how many lights there were but an area of about 30 square yards was lit up.  It was just a flickering. While I was calling my dad I looked and there was nothing.  I shouldn&#39;t have taken my eyes off it. It really has no logical reason of what this could be.  There was no smoke so it couldn&#39;t have been a fire or fireworks.  It was not lightning because it was just in that one spot.  It almost seems that it landed in the woods.  If anybody reads this and seen something similar to what I did please post it.  I never believed in these types of things either until I saw this.  There is a lot of things that we don&#39;t know about such as ufos.<n>

It was a burnt orange color. The left side was more of a straight edge while towards the right was slimmer.  It sat there, very unnatural for about 1 minute.  As I ran inside to get someone who was sleeping and came out (about 1 minute had passed), it was fading south east into the distance.  In almost the same second, about an inch under (from my point of view, probably tons of miles in reality) a tiny light appeared and quickly became larger, and larger.  Again, it was a burnt orange color but was a completely different shape. I am not sure if it was the same object.  It was growing very quickly.  I would describe it like the shape of a bowl (eye level with one).  It was the size of a large moon at close range. It slowly within about 30 seconds lowered behind the trees out of sight. But extremely slow. I am 100% postive, as the other witness, it was nothing natural or anything that can be explained.  If it was I would not have found this website and told this story!<n>

Movement was amoeba-like but it remained in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d gone for a weekend with some of my girlfriends and I&#39;d fallen asleep on the couch for awhile.  All but one of my friends had gone to bed.  She called me out onto the porch to look at the night sky.  It had been a rainy day and cloudy night.  It was a dark but still somehow luminescent night of clouds.  In the far distance was a slit of fiery glow from the power plant on the other side of Lake Anna.  As I looked toward a dark corner of the sky, I noticed a dark wavering before a sea of luminescent clouds.  I felt as though I was seeing it track the movement of my friend so I thought it was her shadow.  But, I knew it was impossible for that to happen given the lack of light from the correct angle to cast it where it floated.  As that understanding was making its way into my conscious understanding,  I saw that my friend stood still but the dark wavering kept going.  It was an enormous black sheet, filmy, slipping around at its borders the way an amoeba does.  When we understood we were seeing something very strange that neither of us had ever seen before, we went in the house and locked the doors.  That scared us.  We have tried various internet searches and have yet to find anything remotely like it.<n>

We were attending the Mint Green Music Festival (an Electronic/Psychedelic music festival) which was held on the grounds.  The four of us were back at the campsite at the edge of the grounds (next to a forested area) while most of our companions and most of the festival goers were at the stage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my three friends noticed a fire-y orange burning light glowing in the sky behind the tree line, and pointed it out.  I suggested it was one of those &amp;quot;Chinese lanterns&amp;quot; that you see people set off at weddings and such.  However, the small fireball slowly moved from behind the tree line into plain view, and then stopped moving in mid-air and started alternatively shrinking and expanding in a slow steady rhythm.  It seemed to me to be hovering in place about 80 feet in the air, maybe 500 feet away from us.  This shrinking/expanding pulsing happened for about 15 seconds as the four of us described what we were seeing to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I suggested we watch it in silence.  A moment later, the fireball shrunk, and then disappeared rapidly.  It seemed to have zoomed off at an incredible speed through the sky away from us and the festival.  It happened so fast that it was hard to tell.  As the UFO zoomed away, a white beam of light that resembled a shooting star came across the sky in the same area at a different angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least two of us saw the beam of light.  Most of us agreed that the fireball UFO was a pulsing sphere, however one of us said she saw a floating fire-y box.  We are unsure if the white beam of light was a shooting star or not, it was cloudy most of the night so we were surprised to see it.<n>

Relatively low.  Flying at about the same height as most planes that fly over.  Absolutely no engine sounds heard.  As it flew over the house it disappeared all of a sudden.  No tail or smoke trails typical of meteors or aircraft.  Flying far to slow to be any type of aircraft.  Only a single, bright orange light.  No blinking or pulsating.  Very strange.  Never seen anything like it in my entire life.<n>

I looked up as it was going across the sky and then it either went straight into outer space or shot across the direction it was going in because the light just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same bright white light appeared on 8/28/12 but it was hovering in a south east direction. My husband says it hovered in one place and then it zigzagged as if it was flying down to land. He couldn’t see it once it disappeared past the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the past week (8/25-8/29/12), we have been seeing bright white with a blue haze, or sometimes they are reddish orange balls of light on my neighbors’ property {which is all wooded} as we are standing outside usually around 10:30 at night. It lasts for few seconds and then disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband has noticed these balls of light because our dogs start barking during the late hours as if there is a stranger outside. So he gets up to investigate.<n>

They looked to be circular shaped and brightly glowing red, just hanging in the sky and not moving.  They were assembled in a staggered formation.  They hung in the sky for over 5 minutes.   My son and I were stunned.  As we were looking at them, a police officer pulled up and stopped to look as well.  We watched in amazement wondering what in the world could fill the sky with red lights like that.  After watching them about 5 minutes hang in the sky, one by one they each dropped down in the sky as if to land in a northwesterly direction, all moving in the same direction and then out of sight.   It was the strangest  thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They moved a little bit, but appeared to be .  Most were just individual points of lights. However, one had four lights arranged in a diamond pattern.  The appeared to be located 10-15 miles north of Ann Arbor, Mi., about 10=15 miles from us. About eight of us watched the lights for 10-12 minutes before they disappeared. Some thought they were lights suspended from hot-air balloons. Several days later, I checked with local police, he said they did not receive calls about the lights. I spoke with someone else who observed them. She thought they were chinese laterns.<n>

Ascutney, VT.  The arc of travel was more straight than round.  The front appeared to glow bright white.  The tail (a blunt end) seemed to glow orange.  There was no tail “stream” (the glow traveled with the object).  The object was viewed for about three seconds (the span covered approximately a mile).  The object seemed larger and longer than a falling star or comet and the image retained its shape and glow.   In the sky it appeared to be half an inch to an inch—or larger than an average plane (maybe a little less than a quarter inch “thick,” from top to bottom). Object was very bright, quick, and traveled more straight than curving, seemingly faster than the average jet.  The object appeared to be heading almost due north.<n>

It was very odd looking.  It was shades of orange, darker, medium and lighter.<n>

Second sighting in two weeks<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second sighting my husband and I have seen this month. (Refer to similar sighting reported on the night of the meteor showers a couple of weeks ago, which occurred at approximately the same time at night.) This sighting differed somewhat, however, in location and the description of the objects and activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight (8/25) my husband was outside watching the stars. The sky is very clear and cool, with no cloud coverage.  Half-moon clearly visible. My husband came into the house and told me to come outside immediately. Here is what he/I saw: He witnessed a very large orb making no noise. He thought originally that it was a star but it gradually increased in size and became so bright that he had to shield his eyes. It appeared to be stationary and only became larger and brighter. The entire encounter occurred over the course of approximately one minute and the object began to dim until it totally disappeared. Its location was in the northern part of the sky close to the constellation of the Little Dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He continued to watch and about five minutes later, another object appeared out of nowhere, smaller in size but still quite bright and circular in shape. This object appeared in the northwest and did not make any noise. He came to the door and called for me. I went outside onto the back porch and I also so this object. It was headed southeast, very bright and larger than a plane. I heard no noise either. We watched it flying at what seemed to be a high rate of speed for about a minute and a half. I ran inside to get my cell phone in an attempt to capture the event but when I got back outside about 30 seconds later, it was gone. My husband said that it went from the bright white light we had both seen, to a dull red, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both witnessed an airplane in the northwest a few minutes later, with obvious blinking and engine noise. So whatever he and I saw earlier was not a plane mistaken for something else, I don’t believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He remained outside for another fifteen minutes or so and did not see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We could not determine the shape, but only the bright lights which were blinking quickly and changing colors.  As it moved further west, we lost site of it, however, it continued to move westward.<n>

Ten minutes to cross sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9pm (21:00) on I believe it was Saturday night, August 25th, 2012 I witnessed anywhere from 7 to 12 what appeared to be fireballs (but traveling at about the normal speed a helicopter would be going and at about the same height , about 1000 feet max., but with no sound at all) coming from the Southeast going in a straight line Northwest, and taking about 10 minutes to cross the sky. These objects were traveling in pairs, except maybe 1 or two. It was unusual because they were just orange, like fire, with no sound whatsoever. The sky was 90% clear, I could see the moon. The objects disappeared one at a time into a cloud cover in the Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I heard about others seeing these objects also on the Coast to Coast AM Radio show with George Noory as the host on Mondays show (08/27/2012) and mention of the website ufocenter.com to report my sightings I realized maybe what I had seen was not a group of helicopters at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/25/12 21:00|Winston-Salem|NC|Light|10 minutes|UFO sighting in Winston-Salem NC 8/25/12  at 21:00 (9pm eastern time)|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92127.html|156|ndxe201208| ufo sighting in Winston-Salem NC 8/25/12  at 21:00 (9pm eastern time)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to Winston-Salem in North Carolina today with my sister. Friday, August the 25th in 2012. We went about doing a number of things and had a nice time seeing the area. The last place we went to was Kranky&#39;s coffee (correct spelling).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was between 9-9:15 pm, as we were walking back to my sister&#39;s car, I looked up at the moon. I am always looking at the sky, especially the night sky, as you never know what you will see. WHAT DID I SEE INDEED!!!  Lo and behold, next to the clear moon there were some clouds, BUT what made this view MIND BLOWING was the 8-10 lights that were flying around in an apparent dog fighting pattern, these lights were the size of planes in the night sky, I would call them orbs as they were round and had no shape as the eye could see. In fact, a plane was flying by into view for a frame of reference as this was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were dipping and weaving like fish in a fish bowl, all of them, like they were playing. After a while it was apparent that this was more of a game than anything else, as some would stop moving and others would be weaving around each other like an airplane dog fighting pattern/fish weaving around each other. On top of that, they would move, stop, then move at a quick speed, which is impossible for modern craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They also move, stop, then go perfectly in reverse, which is impossible as well! These couldn&#39;t be helicopters, as they were too high up, and moving and speeds too sharp and swift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this was a beautiful sight to behold, and it wasn&#39;t far into this moment that I realized that I was seeing something that was very rare, and something that couldn&#39;t be easily explained away. My sister was the first witness with me, then she went into the car and sat down, as she was chilly and had seen enough, and frankly was probably spooked by it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I was looking for people showing up to the coffee place to say &amp;quot;hey, LOOK AT THAT&amp;quot; to, and after about a minute of me watching in amazement, a group of 2 girls and one guy walked up. They saw me looking up, and began to look towards the direction of the moon as well. I said something along the lines of &amp;quot;what is that?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;that&#39;s pretty crazy huh?&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally as they realized what they were seeing, they stood near me and were watching in shock as well. They were like &amp;quot;what is THAT&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&#39;s ufos&amp;quot;, and they were laughing in a nervous way of when you see something that is incredible and shouldn&#39;t be happening in waking life, it must be something strange indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The guy said something along the lines of &amp;quot;it&#39;s bats and there&#39;s light from the moon reflecting off of them&amp;quot;, but I quickly countered, saying that they were too big to be seen from such a great height, and the movements they were making, coming to a standstill then moving in reverse, is impossible for them to do. TO which he replied &amp;quot;I know&amp;quot;, more or less saying &amp;quot;my reasoning is maxed out and I don&#39;t know how to explain what I&#39;m seeing to rationalize this to myself and these women I&#39;m with&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I joked saying &amp;quot;it must be swamp gas&amp;quot;, to which they laughed. I of course was referencing the explanations given by government officials when trying to explain away such events. They usually will try to explain such events as &amp;quot;natural occurrences&amp;quot;, which usually to most of the time doesn&#39;t work sufficiently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this continued for about 10 minutes total, about 3 minutes with my sister and I, then about 7 or so minutes with the 3 strangers and myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took one photo and it had a flash, so it didn&#39;t come out well, though it does look like some kind of light ball is present. In hindsight I should of turned off the flash, take a bunch of photos, then worked with them to see if I could improve visibility, but alas I did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saving grace is that this occurred with me and 4 different people! then as those people were walking away after the lights started to leave and there were less and less, I noticed other people at the coffee shop looking, just following what we were doing, so at least 1, maybe 2 other people saw this separate of me, which is great and makes this occurrence that much more than a chance of my &amp;quot;imagination&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing something like this, as I said to my sister, puts us on a short list, as it&#39;s not every day you see a real, genuine UFO sighting. Once in the moment of such an event, it is chilling, exciting and just plain awe-inspiring, as you realize you are seeing something that is beyond the scope of day to day existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being north carolina, there is always the chance this was military testing, such as of the aurora space craft, which is supposed to be able to take off from earth and go all the way to the moon, though the physics these things displayed had a fluidity of fish in water, and a grace of fish underwater, which is best way to explain them, like fish at play, doing something of a delicate game or ballet in it&#39;s precision, with no moment of fear of &amp;quot;collision&amp;quot;, it was truly stunning and if it&#39;s the only time I have such an experience, it will have made all the research I&#39;ve done up till now worthwhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first it looked to be going straight up, and I thought it was a red firework. It straightened its path and flew directly over our heads, appearing to descend at one point and then ascend as it went out of sight in the west.  Consistent speed, no noise whatsoever.  The absence of sound was striking because it appeared to be traveling at such a low altitude, had it been an airplane we surely would have heard something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light wasn&#39;t solid or blinking, but almost flickered.  As it went directly over our heads we both said it looked as if it was on fire.  This led to speculation of a hot air balloon but it was traveling way too quickly.<n>

A line but not a straight line in front and above us on the northeast extension on the turnpike.  Odd light that at first guess was radio tower lights or helicopter lights or stars clustering the big dipper.  But none applied. I am a pilot and I know what aircraft lights look like.  Didn&#39;t have( or anyone else of a matter of fact) a lick of alcohol. It was me  my wife dad and mother inlaw riding together.  Anyway it was just strange to me. We were heading for NJ and the lights just passed overhead.  There was construction and only the left lane was open.  Boy I really wante Qld to pull over!!  There are no pictures sorry could not pull over<n>

It was sort of dark outside and there were a few clouds out this night. So while walking past the library they just closed I told my guy lets go back real fast. We went back towards the library parking lot looking northbound and up in the sky was about 6-8 bright orange fireball looking objects forming into a cicle. So we were under a tree and decided to go into the parking lot to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we seen next left us speechless. A few of the objects started to disappear while they were forming into a line that was like waving like a snake. At this moment I counted 4 objects just sitting there waving in the air. Then suddenly one more disappears and theres 3 left. These 3, still in a line formation, started to form a triangle that was rotating counterclockwise. The entire time we were watching these lights they were blinking from dull to bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to try and go north to see if it was just someone floating somethng in the air. We cut through the parking lot and next to it was an alley but at the beginning of the alley theres a huge house with big trees there. While were walking the object starts to proceed northbound but at a slow rate of speed and then we lose sight behind the tree. I continue down the alley a couple steps as my guy stops and I see the bright light but this time theres only 1 and its starting to gain a little speed as I was following it. Then i just decided to stop and go back home. I had my phone with me but couldn&#39;t take a video because I was to shocked at what was happening in the sky for those 10 or 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was standing in my driveway talking to my neighbor’s son when I observed the orange ball coming from the south.  All I could see at first was the orange ball, which appeared to be in flames.  The height and speed appeared to be the same as a plane heading to either Midway or O’Hare airports.  There was absolutely no engine sounds at all, which would be audible if it were a plane going over head at that height.  I had my binoculars because I had just watched the ISS go over my home from west to east about ten minutes prior to spotting the fireball.  I watched the ball continue north and suddenly the fire seemed to go out and I saw a dark figure in the sky where the flames went out.  I could see this flameless dark figure for about 15-20 seconds and then I could no longer see it.  My neighbor’s son took! a photo of the object with his telephone.  I would estimate that the object was visible for 3-4 minutes total.I am a 61 year old retired police officer &amp; my neighbor’s son is around 40 and works for a park district near Denver, CO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like an orange glow or fire at the base of its circular shape.  My wife and I discussed whether or not it was a hot air balloon but it was faster than what we thought a balloon would travel.  It certainly appeared lower than a satellite or shooting star and slower.<n>

It was a white ball of light falling towards the ground in front of us.  It left a red trail behind it.  I would describe it as a fireball.  Landing in trees about a mile in front of us.  If we had any doubts about seeing this before, we didn&#39;t the second time.  It was seen at night two different times.  The second time we observed this was when we were taking a walk a few days later in our neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you explain this to me?  What it could possibly be?  Or if anyone else has seen this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought is was a holicoptet and it seemed to get brighter. It was there about 10 minutes, a holicoptet would not stay in place for so long. I went inside the house to get my camera and I could see it was changing colors. I then went inside to get my stepdaughter and her boyfriend (30 minutes later). I got the binoculars and it looked like a rectangle object with lights that changed from green to blue, red, orange and purple. After 45 minutes it seed to get higher into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in the bed of a buddy&amp;quot;s truck unloading things for our camp when my friend and I both saw sort of light at the corner of our eyes. We looked through the dense trees to an area we had just driven through minutes previous. There below the tree line was an enormous triangle less than 100 yards away. My third friend was in his truck blasting music super loud. After my second friend and I noticed this giant object, we began yelling at our friend to turn off the music. Once he did we could hear a low kinda humming noise coming from the craft. We watched as it slowly disappeared  into the forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I was standing i could see the actual sides of the object. It resembled a ball rack used with a pool table. The sides were rounded with great big white lights at each corner. This thing was so close and so low only two lights were visible, as we were observing from a side view not bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing about this was it physically couldn&#39;t have been where we saw it. I mean it just appeared out of nowhere, and would have plowed over hundreds of trees and made a whole lot of noise doing so. This thing seamed to float right through them. It moved steady and slow<n>

After turning out the light, I went to the sliding back door next to my kitchen, and observed the “star”.  Turns out it wasn’t a star after all since it was moving. It was by far the brightest object in the sky, and was heading in the northeastern direction. I watched it for about 20 seconds, and then it just faded away.  I would say it was an orb shape, and was reddish-orange in color. It was not the ISS or a satellite or a shooting star. I have actually seen a number of these in the past few years now.<n>

I had called home letting my fiancé know that I was a few minutes away. He decided to take the dog out so she could go pee.  He was outside with the dog when I pulled up. He ran over to the car and pulled the passenger door open yelled for me to get out and look at this. I hurried out of the car and looked up at the sky where he told me and this is what I saw: 3 orange glowing lights in the shape of a triangle moving slowly and smoothly going north.  Also we saw on other light moving much faster a little further away.  We heard no noise and it was clearly not a plane or a helicopter. We were able to see this for approximately 40-60 seconds and then they suddenly disappeared. They didn&#39;t go over the horizon or anything it was like they just vanished. We were shocked and didn&#39;t know what the hell we just saw.  After a minute or 2 we went into the house for maybe a minute and ha! d to go back out and look again. We walked outside and looked up again and saw about 10 to 15 more single orange glowing lights moving in the same direction and the triangle shape we had seen just minutes earlier. For a few minutes we thought that we were being attacked. We watched the second one for another 45-60 seconds and they disappeared in the same spot the first lights disappeared.<n>

It got brighter after it stopped as well. The object had only traveled about a mile. It was about 2500-5000 feet in altitude and could have been up to 100 Feet in Diameter. We were on the beach with the Moon half full and to our South. The Moon was 15 degrees below the object if you directed a line counter clockwise to the objects horizon in the East. Me and three others were star gazing for the North Star and of course found the Big Dipper to the east over the Pacific Ocean, I could follow the Milky Way faintly, the cloud cover was from all directions and enclosed most of the skies horizons, faintly. As we all looked for what we found familiar and pointing them out to each other still looking for Ursa Minor, Saturn to the Wes! t because its large and bright over the Pacific Ocean, Above it and to the North was Ursa Major, I spotted Pegasus in the North. As I scanned for Orions&#39; Belt, which was not found (I figured to the South West but between the moon and clouds I gave up to look clockwise around the sky) And that was when I saw the Object enter the frame I was looking in (North Easterly). I asked the rest to look and pointed. We stood in awe for the maybe one minute or so it was visible. Like I said it stopped after it appeared, grew bright and faded out without movement but seemed to grow long ways, I thought it would pop out a few or make a formation but it didn&#39;t. This is my first Sighting of any significance. I am Male 32 and a Machinist with two degrees, Manufacturing and Technical Engineering. The other two are acquaintances, Female stay at home mother of 3 and a father of 3 children unknown occupation. My Friend is female 27 Server Administrator for a Medical Office. The mother and fathe! r were her friends whom invited us to camp at the Beach in Mak! ah Bay, South West of Neah Bay on the Pacific Ocean. An interesting fact is on Bohokus Peak Just North of the sighting is a Radar Station. I looked after I could get a signal in town, I was curious to find it was not an Observatory or Light House like I had thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be somewhat transparent and illuminated white lights.  After seeing the object we tried to figure out what it was.  I thought it might be a blimp.  We pulled over to investigate further. It appeared to hover very slowly across the horizon.  Upon inspecting this object it couldn&#39;t have been a blimp. It was almost as if it were in a haze of white light, it did not appear to be solid or opaque like a blimp would be.  It eventually ended up hovering just above the high rise buildings in Boston as though it were further beyond the actual city towards the North Shore.  There is an airport around that area as well.  We tried to drive into the city to see it better but once in town the buildings obstructed our view. We observed it for about ten minutes.<n>

I was sitting with my back to the house, facing my friend, when I noticed to my left (peripheral vision) a bright light in the sky - I said to my friend &amp;quot;Is that a planet?&amp;quot; since it was so bright but when I looked directly at it I realized it was much bigger than a bright planet.  It was orange, slightly more orange than an orange street light.  My friend&#39;s first thought was that it might be a helicopter, because she sees helicopters coming from the direction of Mission hospital (which was the direction of this object), so we listened for a helicopter sound, but didn&#39;t hear anything. Both of us thought it was too close to not hear some kind of sound if it were a helicopter or an airplane.  I stepped outside of the screen porch to get a better view of it without the screen in the way.  The object was getting slowly bigger, so it seemed to be moving towards us.  Then suddenly, it got slightly brighter ! and almost seemed to be turning at a sharp angle and then suddenly it shrank to a pinpoint and disappeared.  I kept looking at the same place in the sky and saw a very very faint light that was moving in the same direction of the sharp angle that the object had turned.  Then that faint light faded away. We are guessing the light came from the direction of south Asheville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend saw a similar object during daylight hours five days later - I will ask her to file a separate report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

In the distance directly across from me a reddish light appeared i thought it was a campfire but it looked to red and immediate, not like a growing fire.the light moved in and around the trees changing shape and then began to rise through the trees.  I was alone and very surprised to see it now above the tree line and hovering while it pulsed. it had become a ball like light orange in color now. It began to move across the lake at a fairly slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up moved to the end of the dock as this light was moving in my direction to the right  west to north east.  No other markings, or lights were visible and the strangest part was that it was completly silent, no noise at all it flew to my right and just disapeared .  I typed in orange ball over pawtuckaway lake and saw that some folks were on there boat on  7/13/2012 and saw the same thing. I just happen to see it! in the woods too. They saw it rise over trees.

We were at a April Wine concert, at the Corn Fest in Lacasse Park. Midway through the show I noticed the object hovering above the tree line E of the edge of the park.  It was going N towards the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair.  It did not seem to be flying straight but more like floating.  Then it disappeared behind the tree line and it made no noise at all.  There was at least 500 at the concert and probably 2000 at the Corn Fest so I am sure I am not the only one who seen it.  Being it was the same exact looking object i seen in Port Elgin ON and Belle River ON the month before, I knew right away what I was seeing...  It feels to me like they want to expose themselves a little bit at a time to large groups in order to prep us for full disclosure.<n>

Then another light appeared forming a diamond pattern and then a fifth light about 100 feet behind the fourth light.  There was no sound being emitted as the lights flew directly over head. We could not make out any object creating the lights.  The night was clear and starry with very few, if any, clouds and winds were light.  The whole event took about three minutes before disappearing from sight because of trees and homes.  I tried to capture one of the lights using the movie mode on my cell phone but all that shows is a small orange light making no sound.<n>

I saw a glowing orb in the sky from the corner of my eye, that at first glance, thought was a shooting star. When I turned and looked I noticed it was moving way too slow to be a shooting star, yet too fast to be a plane. The object, to the naked eye looked like an orb. I ran and got my neighbor to get his video camera out. Upon zooming in on the object you can clearly see a disk like object. It moved in a straight line across the sky, then disappeared. Then about 30 minutes later I saw the same object take off out into the sky in the same place that I had originally saw it appear. I live near an airport and I have seen many aircraft in the night sky, this was definitely not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were moving very slowly like planes in the far distance.  But then the middle one moved out to the right and slightly forward to form a perfect triangle then back in line again quickly.  No normal plane could move at the precision and speed that it did.   The middle light traveled through the sky not just turning Off and On like it was one plane but like they were 3 different objects. It did it again, moved back into the line up and then the first red square light went out and then the next and the last one hovered for a few seconds and then disappeared too.  They did not move very far forward while this all went on.

8/24/12 10:15|Syracuse|NY|Cigar|3 minutes|Two different craft, broad daylight, shape and flight characterists inconsistent with any known aircraft|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92111.html|198|ndxe201208| Two different craft, broad daylight, shape and flight characterists inconsistent with any known aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> resending, as my paragraph breaks got lost, making it one nasty block of text...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brief:  While taking a cigarette break at my place of work, outside the building (side facing the parking lot, opposite from James Street), I spotted two different distinct airborne craft less than a minute apart, which exhibited shape and flight characteristics not consistent with any known manmade aircraft or bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (having had an unequivocal daylight UFO sighting in my youth, I will often specifically watch the skies, and spot birds and aircraft while I’m outside on smoke breaks during my workday.  In 13 years working in this location, this is the first time I’ve seen something here in daylight that I could not identify, and thus qualifies as a legitimate UFO sighting)   Sighting detail:  I was looking up at the sky to the Northeast with the sun at my back, and spotted a black object of indeterminate size at a high altitude, at approximately 55 degrees above the horizon.  At that distance, it was difficult to make out any detail, though it appeared to be elongated.  By comparison, it appeared to be the approximate scale of a hyphen on a printed page held at arms length, ever so slightly thicker in the middle.  No lights of any kind were observable on the craft, and it did not change shape as would a bird flapping it’s wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed it because it was moving erratically, zig-zagging back and forth, and up and down.   It would dart to the left, stop in mid air, wiggle up and down, dart back the other way, stop, and wiggle up and down.   It did not move in perfectly straight lines, and its movement was jerky and appeared uncoordinated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I observed the erratic flight, I first said to myself, “wow, I’m actually seeing this!”   Judging it’s travel distance back and forth when it was darting is difficult without knowing it’s approximate size or distance, but if it were the size of a sparrow, it would have been darting back and forth, from my left to right and back, covering a distance of at least 100 feet per second when it moved, with no noticeable acceleration or deceleration.  It would be moving, then stationary, then moving again at high speed.  I observed it darting erratically as described for approximately 25 seconds.  Then it began to move smoothly at a high rate of speed toward the southeast, and became too distant to observe after approximately 15 seconds.  I continued to observe the area of sky where it disappeared for a further minute or so, and saw it come back into view again momentarily, before vanishing again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I returned to looking at the patch of sky where it had first appeared, and within about 30 seconds, there appeared a bright white cigar or disc shaped object, following the trajectory of the first object.  This object may have been larger or closer to me, as it was much easier for me to see that it was an elongated shape.  It had a much clearer “cigar” or disc shape, bulging in the middle, and tapered/rounded at the edges.  It was moving at a constant high rate of speed toward the southwest, and left no contrail.  It moved across the sky considerably faster than the jetliners frequently visible form this location, following exactly the flight path of the first object, and also receded too far to be visible after approximately 25 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before it disappeared from view to the Southwest (over Downtown Syracuse), a co-worker came out of the building and asked what I was looking at, and I pointed it out, but at that point it was too faint for him to observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first sighted the second object, I could see that it did not have wings or a tail, and approximately every five seconds, what appeared to be a large bright white light on the top center of the “cigar shape” would appear, fade up to very bright, (brighter than the object itself) then fade out again over the course of about three seconds.  It did not blink, it faded in and out.  This repeated at regular intervals until it was out of sight in the southwest sky.  The object did not change course, and moved at a uniform very high rate of speed, faster than any plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the moment the second object faded from view, a twin engine jetliner (appeared to be a Boeng Triple-7) was passing in an easterly path through the middle of the area where I’d observed the other objects, at approximately 8,000 feet.  It’s wings, engines, horizontal stabilizer, and twin contrail were clearly discernable.  It appeared approximately 3 times larger at that distance than the other two objects I had observed.  I do not believe that either object was closer to me than the jetliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that altitude, the jetliner was traversing the sky at approximately one forth the rate of the two objects I had just observed, meaning that if they had been at a similar altitude and distance, their speed of travel would have been, at minimum  four times the minimum stall speed of such an aircraft, or approximately 800 Knots / 920 miles per hour / 1480 kilometers per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither object made any sound that I noticed, nor was the jetliner loud enough for me to hear it above the noise of the city from that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I do not carry a phone with a camera, and was unable to obtain images of the sighting.  However, I&#39;m am going to take photographs of the location, and draw on the photos to clearly indicate what I witnessed.  I will also include an aerial photo map indicating observer position, and approximate flightpath of objects observed.  I will forward those as soon as available.)

I have never needed glasses or contacts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my 20’s, I was in the National Guard, assigned to a helicopter maintenance battalion, and I am well familiar with the flight characteristics and capabilities of both military and civilian aircraft, having observed countless planes / helicopters in flight.  I have spent a considerable amount of time around military and civilian airfields, and aboard both rotor-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  I can tell the difference between a Sikorsky and a Bell helicopter in flight at a distance of several miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My older brother was a private pilot, and owned two single-engine fixed-wing aircraft, with which he gave me informal flight instruction, and I have flown both of those aircraft numerous times, also having performed unassisted takeoffs, and landings under the supervision of a licensed pilot.  I have also been a passenger on numerous commercial aircraft.  Given my experience with aviation, I consider myself to be a better observer of aircraft than the average layperson, and also reasonably accurate at determining the size, altitude, and distance of objects I observe in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness sobriety:  Prior to this sighting, I had not had any alcohol for over 36 hours, and I do not indulge in any other intoxicants.   This morning I had a cup of coffee and a couple of cigarettes.<n>
8/24/12 07:30|Northport|NY|Fireball|10 minutes|Large white orb of light hovering/slowly drifting across the sky|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92149.html|199|ndxe201208| Large white orb of light hovering/slowly drifting across the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the object while in the car and told the driver to pull over.  I watched with 3 other people as it hovered nearby.  It appeared to be a couple hundred feet away in the horizontal direction, and appeared to have an altitude of only a couple hundred feet.  Assuming these distances were accurate, the visible light was probably around 1 to 4 feet wide.  It&#39;s possible that the object was much higher and larger, but that was not my original impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be simple a ball of light.  It flickered slightly, much like a fire would.  Its color was almost white, perhaps slightly yellowed, much like the color of a fluorescent light bulb.  It sometimes appeared as though there was the dark outline of an object only slightly larger than the &#34;orb&#34; of light, but this could have been a trick of the eye.  It appeared to hover motionless, but after 10 minutes or so, it drifted across the sky until it was over a mile away.  I&#39;m not sure whether or not the object was at first still and then started moving, or was moving the whole time.  Its movement was entirely linear and extremely slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an electrical engineering student and am therefore someone familiar with science, aircraft, and the like.  I am positive that this is unlike any object I had ever seen;  it was clearly not an airplane or a helicopter or similar.  It is possible, however, that it was some sort of extremely reflective weather balloon or something similar, reflecting light off of the moon, which was directly behind us as we viewed the object.  This would surprise me, though, as it was about as bright as the moon and appeared to be creating it&#39;s own light.<n>

It was almost straight up in the early morning sky (2:30 AM) a bit to the South sky, I saw a fast moving line four lights (about equal to the stars that were out) traveling from West to the East, from one side of the sky to the other ending in their disappearing behind the tree line.  They were spaced far apart but clearly together.  The line was side by side not in a follow the leader row, the line was perfectly straight, each light was constant, not blinking and without color of any kind, the speed was difficult to tell now knowing the distance but it was very fast and took about 4 seconds to go all across the sky.  There was sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have seen such an event, I feel lucky to have seen it, but at a loss to identify it as something earthly.  I am 62 years old, and have observed many different type planes, having been raised near Castle Air Force Base and near both commercial and military air bases.  I would love to learn if there has been any similar sightings!  This report is not a hoax.<n>

I had just punched out, and I remember the time to be exact.  From where I work to where my car is parked is a three minute walk.  As I was walking I noticed something above me in the sky, traveling at what seemed to be about 30 miles an hour.  My first thought was a shooting star, but this seemed to be about 50ft above me.  It was maybe 15-20ft across.  I was intrigued trying to figure out what it was.  It was like a glowing white ball of fire.  The best I can describe it would be similar to a Christmas tree light when all other lights in the room are off.  It seemed to travel in a straight path with a little erratic movement at times.  I watched it for a few minutes, and it disappeared about a quarter mile away.  Gone. That fast.  I got in my car and tried to figure where it might have gone, but there was nothing.  It very well may have been a meteorite.  I just remember being intrigued, and scared as hell at the same time.   I keep telling myself it was nothing.  I hope I&#39;m right.<n>

As my curiosity grew, I opened the window and listened but there wasn&#39;t any noise whatsoever.  The light was visible for about 45 seconds to a minute and appeared to be gradually rising before disappearing into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume a nighttime sighting, and have changed the time above, accordingly.

It was a very clear night and this area has almost no light pollution at night. Its on the middle of nowhere.  We were standing on the rock dam at the end of the lake.  We were looking up at how good the stars were showing up when i noticed something very bright and changing colors.  It also was pretty much hovering at what i guess was maybe two thousand feet.  There is mountains in the area but it was well above those .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a good 25 minutes.  The entire time it never got any closer our further  away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visually it appeared many miles away.  The odd thing was it did spirals then hover then zip to the right then stop.  From the distance away we were i think the speed of its movements to be of a very strange nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been around all sorts of planes all my life a my dad was air force.  I&#39;ve seen all sorts of planes pull crazy maneuvers.  This thing would just zip in a straight line and stop instantly.  finally i was positive i had just seen my first UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trying to rule out things i would line up the lights which morphed from bright white to blue and red to trees.  This confirmed it really was moving like i thought it was.  During the time we were watching it we saw several planes fly over with lights flashing and it was  obvious those were planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside got the kids and brought them out.they saw it and after a few minutes went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day i looked for anything it could have been.  Nothing but open sky where it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i have no explanation for what i saw.  Maybe some new technology who knows.  It was cool nonetheless.<n>

On this particular Thursday night, I noticed this small orangish yellow orb appear out of no where, which quickly caught my interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought this ‘thing’ was a plane, until I noticed a commercial aircraft at a higher altitude and quickly realized that this orb didn’t have any of the normal red and blue/white flashing lights.  So again, I studied this orb thinking that it may have been a helicopter with their spot light on, but for how low this orb was, it made not a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor came out, when I pointed out to her, just to make sure that I wasn’t seeing things, or that at the angle I was at, I may have missed something.  Sure enough, she seen it as well, and confirmed that it was neither an airplane nor a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she continued to talk to me, I did not once take my eyes off this ‘thing’.  It was moving South to North, not extremely fast, but at a good speed.  The next thing I know, it just disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it may have just been blocked from my view, due to other houses and trees around me, but even after walking to a spot where there was nothing to block my view, I couldn’t find it anywhere.  Even my neighbor could not spot it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed out later hoping that it might come back, or that another one would come, in hopes to catch it in a picture or video, but the rest of the night went on uneventful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a satellite, but it was very large and very bright. Next thought was that it was a plane, it seemed to be *flying* at a height that a plane would. There was no noise, however. It flew in a direct path over my house, directly over my head, there was no other lights, there seemed to be no visible shape.  It was just a big gold glowing ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it headed slightly east off into the sky, it stopped glowing, it went from this glowing ball of light to a lightly dimmed star, that was still moving, till I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I don&#39;t know if it just disappeared or because it was so dim that it blended in with the other dim stars around it that I just couldn&#39;t see it anymore. 10 mins later I went into the backyard and there was an actual US air craft with lots of flashing red and blue ! lights flying fairly low in the area &amp; then I stood out there about a half hour later and there were two more US air crafts much higher in the sky in the same area about 5 mins a part from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought it was a small plane or helicopter but it became obvious this was a spherical object which made no sound.  An airplane bisected it&#39;s path at a higher altitude and the difference was obvious.  The plane had blinking lights and made noise and I could make out the plane&#39;s shape.  Even though the UFO was at a lower altitude I couldn&#39;t make out the same detail as I could with the plane.  It was a round flickering orange object moving at approximately the same speed of a plane and made no noise.  I&#39;ve never seen anything in the sky that prompted me to take a picture before.  It&#39;s speed rules out a weather balloon or Chinese lantern.  And it&#39;s trajectory rules out a meteor/comet, etc because it flew straight and didn&#39;t change altitude as best as I could tell and was steady in its speed. I&#39;m curious if anyone else saw it.  A friend came by and I point! ed it out to him and all he said was &amp;quot;what the fuck?&amp;quot;.  By the time he saw it, it was much further away yet it still appeared odd enough to him to elicit his response even though the detail in which I saw it was no longer visible to him.<n>

They appeared to be about mile up into the sky and maintained altitude while moving north.  A couple of the lights in the middle of the formation appeared to occasionally zig-zag from side to side in a very abnormal fashion.  Everything seemed quiet - no aircraft noise. I managed to get one iPhone photo.  After about 4 minutes, they vanished as they were still moving northbound.  About two minutes after that, a commercial airline flew by, heading southwest (I think).<n>

We were both sitting on the open plaza at Boston City Hall Plaza this night.  This light array resembled nothing we had ever seen before, as we are closely familiar with military, commercial, and private aircraft, as well as blimps, dirigibles, hot air balloons, and ultralight craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this light array got closer, we noticed that there were NO red &amp; green (port &amp; starboard) lights, NO wing lights, nor were there any type of landing (approach) lights seen anywhere on this craft.  Also very noticeable was the fact that there was absolutely NO sound whatsoever associated with this craft. Less than 5-10 minutes before we noticed this light array, there was an airplane on its approach to Boston&#39;s Logan Airport, and this light array did NOT resemble any other known craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the approximate speed of this craft to be between 25-35MPH, which gave me sufficient time to get a detailed look at it, and later to sketch out the details that I saw. Sketch to follow in a separate mailing, as I have no current access to a scanner to electronically email it out to NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this light array passed directly overhead, we both noticed that it was definitely triangular in shape, the outer body being a very black color, with an inner structure a light black or dark gray color. There were 3 white lights on each corner (rimmed in a gold/yellowish color), with a very large bright white light in the direct center of this craft, also rimmed in the same gold/yellowish color, and at the stern of this craft were 2 red lights, near the rear points of this triangle shape, equidistant apart from one another. This craft did NOT cast any shadow or reflected light to the ground, had NO sound even as it passed overhead, and continued directly south until it disappeared behind some tall buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than 5 minutes later, a twin-engine airplane passed overhead, going from east to west, and this craft we witnessed was nothing like the plane we saw moments later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being military veterans, we both discussed what exactly we witnessed that evening, ruling out all known aircraft very familiar to us, and have no answers to this unique UAP/UFO sighting. But we know exactly what we DID see that night, and this triangular craft is something not of our current military, as we do not have this type of current technology at this time.<n>

It was about 9:30 when we went out and we enjoyed the cigarette and layed out to a nice view of the night sky.  After about ten min.  I noticed, a VERY bright, what appeared to be a star overhead and commented that the star must be a planet or something.  I was so impressed by this apparent star, that I decided to take a picture with my cellphone.  For some reason the phones touchscreen wouldn&#39;t react.  At that point my two friends, jumped up and commented that it started to move!  The light now seemd to be an object, which emitted two lesser lights of amber and yellow. Silently went in the southeast direction out of view.  Tbe three of us, were in amazement.  This was the first sighting for two of us, and the third person commented that this wasn&#39;t his first sighting.<n>

This is also close to Mcchord AFB.  I saw a large craft that appeared to be oval in shape.  There were very bright white lights spaced intermittently around the edges.  I saw it from a side view as it slowly moved south. Tbe craft was much lower than the normal planes that frequent the area. I heard no sound.  There were no flashing or strobe lights.  While it moved south a normal plane came from the west heading east. It was at cruising altitude, much higher than the unknown craft.  The plane also had it&#39;s strobe lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued south at a low altitude until it was out of sight. It moved quite slowly.

And there was this bright light that caught the corner of my eye that was close to the moon, and it started off looking like a comet.  Then it began to curve downward and it was still going pretty fast, then it started to slow down and as it was still going down it started to change shape to look like a star. I thought this object was going to take the place of a star because of the slow pace it was going, but it was still moving and started going down in a slight zig zag motion.  Then it changed direction again and started to go off into the distance.  And I know it wasn&#39;t a plane because what plane needs its lights on while the sun is still up? It would appear black or gray, not a glowing white orb that was at an altitude that seemed too high for a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first it seemed to be drifting with the wind current, but it kept performing little circular, round-about motions and twirling both down and up.  I was about to dismiss it as just what I had initially thought it was, when it turned into the wind and rose in altitude, starting performing circling aerobatics and headed towards a particularly large bank of clouds extremely high in the sky.  Right as it started heading higher I ran inside to get my camera, but when I had returned just a few seconds later it was already out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/22/12 11:00|Morristown|TN|Rectangle|5 minutes|5th UFO Sighting around my 50th Birthday.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92055.html|240|ndxe201208| 5th UFO Sighting around my 50th Birthday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5th UFO Sighting by 50th Birthday Wednesday Morning, August 22nd, 2012, I was lying in bed listening to a Prophecy Radio Show and looking out my bedroom window when I saw something very shiny going across the sky. I got up and took a close look from the window surface to see that it was metallic, shiny, like stainless steel, or polished silver. It was rectangular in shape and was moving in a westward direction over the city of Morristown, Tennessee. The unknown flying object was moving slowly towards the nearby city and I ran down stairs to the backyard deck where there is a more wide open view of the sky. As I was rushing to the deck area, I informed my Mother who was cooking lunch to come outside to see this UFO going across the sky. She followed me outside on the open deck and we both saw the object moving slowly across the light blue sky. It did not have any contrail smoke exhaust whatsoever. It did not have any airplane wings, tail rudder, etc. It did not make any engineer noise whatsoever. I watched it! fly across the city of Morristown, at an altitude that made its size about 2” in length with your outstretched arm. I watched it until it disappeared into the distant blue sky. I have no idea what it was and have reported it as a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To date, this is the 5th UFO I have seen in my lifetime. The others were all different types of “flying objects” such as, the 4th UFO was a similar to the 5th, as rectangular flying object, only its appearance was more like stacked layers of stainless steel that shined intensively in the clear blue sky in July 2012. The 3rd was a circular orb seen at the same location as the 4th UFO, but this object was seen a few years ago and its appearance was similar to a balloon, but somehow seemed more rigid than a balloon, as it was moving horizontally with no wind blowing on that day. I was in Bean Station, TN on the 3rd and 4th Sightings, but both were moving in the same direction of Morristown, TN. The 2nd UFO was seen also in Morristown at my Brothers property, a few years ago, and it had the classical shape of the silvery cigar-shaped, rectangular objects with a strobbing/flashing light at the center. It was moving in southward direction toward White Pine/New Port, TN. This sight! ing was the most bizarre one of all, as I was tilling my brothers garden with a machine and had the sudden, strange desire to look up and when I stopped the machine and looked up, I saw this cigar-shaped craft about 4” in length with the an outstretched arm. It was very silvery metallic and the strobbing lights were intense. I watched it, until it seemed to go into a hole in the sky and disappear from view. I have never had such a strange feeling come over me, as I did that particular day. Finally, the 1st UFO was seen at my Mothers former house in Harrogate, TN and I saw it in the skies above her backyard moving through the clouds. It was brass color in appearance and very shiny, as it went in and out of the clouds. This UFO was the most impressive of all 5 that I have seen in my lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, a few days after my 50th Birthday on August 15th, 2012, I saw something strange in the sky, the likes of which I have never seen before, in all my 50 years on this earth. The regular light blue sky and cotton-like clouds were divided in half and covered over by a another darker blue sky layer, like a sheet of plastic that you could see through it and watch the clouds moving across the sky, from behind it. This strange phenomenon appeared to split the sky in half on a diagonal straight edge, with the light blue regular sky &amp; clouds on the left and the aqua Blue sky on the right. I watched the (2) skies for about 2 or 3 minutes and the strange aqua blue half did not move at all, while the clouds kept moving out from behind it. Then I thought about getting someone else to come see it or to get a camera, but as I turned around to put up some garden tools back into the basement, and then turned back around to look at the divided two skies, the aqua Blue portion had almost v! irtually disappeared in less than a few minutes. All that was left to even know it had ever been there at all, was a very faint outline of the diagonal edge where both skies were split up, or divided apart. I watched a few more seconds, maybe a half minute, or so, and it had completely disappeared that quickly! I’ve never seen anything like that before or since! Some friends of mine in Greeneville, TN, told me they saw some strange colors in the sky at about that same time. I am still researching the data to see if other people in east tennessee have seen this remarkable, rare, phenomenon...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was shining on the opposite side than where the sun would have been reflecting on it.  I actually passed up my turn because I was watching it.  I tried to take a picture, but the craft turned at what appeared to be roughly a 90 degree angle and all but disappeared.  The moment it changed direction I could just barely see a dark spot and then it was gone.  My oldest son saw this as well, but he doesn&#39;t want to believe.  Yes, I understand it could have been a plane, but it was the brightness of it that caught my eye.  There was also a helicopter flying in the same area as the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This morning I went outside to check the weather and drink a cup of coffee at about 5:15am before getting ready for work. I was looking up in the starry sky and noticed two very bright “tracking” objects with a star or planet type appearance. These objects appeared much bigger and brighter than the other stars in the sky though.  I then noticed the disc shaped object.  It was hovering in the night sky a large distance away (maybe 3-5 miles). The 3 objects were in a triangular formation, but were many miles apart. The “tracking” objects were hovering parallel to interstate I70 (maybe .5 miles north of the interstate) about half way in between the Mt Comfort and Greenfield exits. The “main” object appeared to be north of the other 2 objects in the direction of the Mt Comfort Airport.  The disc shaped object was lighting up with what appeared to be tracer lights going around the middle of the saucer from left to ! right and then back right to left.  The lights were green and red (going from green to yellowish orange to red in color as they moved).  It hovered for about 5 minutes.  I then saw a flash, almost like a blue light beam shot out for a split second. I kept watching it and I saw at least one more quick beam.  Then I noticed the object tilt. It tilted to an upright position and the lights then ran north to south.  I know it sounds crazy, but I almost swore I could see something in the beam going towards the object.  It hovered like this for another 5 minutes or so. I then had to go to work, so I stopped watching the main UFO and watched the 2 “tracking” objects hover nearby until I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect planets in the E sky.

It was a clear, cloudless night, and there were several stars visible.  I do live close to an airport, and it&#39;s not odd to see planes flying at night.  However, the lights of an airplane move at a slow, steady pace. These two lights seemed to be at the same altitude of a plane-very high up- but they were not the white color of a plane, they had a reddish hue.  They also seemed to be moving erratically together, almost like the frantic movement of an insect bashing itself against a window.  They were moving far too quickly for any plane, and too erratically as well.  I watched them hover for a bit, and then, they just disappeared. Very strange.  They&#39;ve been visible several times during the month of August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The time before that many red lights with 4 lights in each section (4-5 sections). Each one in a verticle formation appeared from nowhere across a mountain range in Gifford Pinchot National Forest. This thing was very large and spanned a huge section of the mountain.

And  the two lights traveling in the eastern paterrn toward the mass seemed to disappear like they were  flying into it And then my husband exclaimed , &amp;quot; the lights are flashing around it now!&amp;quot; as I yelled out  &amp;quot; what the stuff are we seeing!&amp;quot; &amp;quot; what the stuff is that!&amp;quot; as the words were coming out of my mouth The lights seemed to shut off in a patern one by one all around it several times and it seemed to float slowly south to southeastern direction it seemed like it started off slow than suddenly it was gone like it was never there I&#39;m really freaked out I have always believed in things like this but to actually see it has r! eally frightened me I&#39;m still moling it over (note) the size h! ad to ha ve been at least the size of a city block,.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

I went out my front door and there it was right in front of me hovering above the trees. It was a triangle shape with three red flashing lights at the points.  When I saw it was wasn&#39;t moving at all, but my friend said he watched it move in all directions before calling me. We know we weren&#39;t the only ones who saw it because everyone on the road was traveling really slow and watching it as well. I watched it for a few more seconds before it slowly moved behind the trees. I could still see the red lights from behind the branches for a while until it finally disappeared. It was a very cloudy night, so there were no stars and hardly even a moon to light up the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We kept seeing flashing lights on the horizon between Yahk and Cranbrook in British Columbia, bright white like sheet/heat lightning but it was a cool, clear, cloudless night.  Definitely not lightning and lots more flashes in a row than you&#39;d expect from lightning.  Also sometimes emanated from down low as though coming from down near the ground, which had a thin layer of fog across it in the low-lying areas.  Made us think of swamp/marsh gas or &#34;will o&#39; the wisp&#34;  in folklore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could only assume it was the Northern Lights but it was solid white and sometimes coming from down low instead of on the distant horizon which was freaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to the lodge where we stayed in Cranbrook the first night we asked the manager about it and whether it could be the Northern Lights.  She looked absolutely perplexed and said no, you can&#39;t generally see the Northern Lights from here, she&#39;s lived there 10 years and never seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We asked if it could be swamp gas (ha!) and she looked at us like we were crazy and changed the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never got to the bottom of it.

I thought nothing of it at first, assuming it was just a radio tower or a windmill.  However it then occurred to me that there are no structures such as radio towers or windmills on Thompson Hill.  Additionally, I then noticed that there was not just one blinking light but rather an entire line of lights.  Some of these lights were blinking like you would see on the bottom of an airplane however some were regular lights.  This line of lights had to be at least one block long.  The lights appeared to be hovering above the hill but moving at a moderate speed heading east. I rolled down my car window to listen for any sounds but I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now my jaw was on the floor. I was trying to describe what I was seeing to my girlfriend who I was on the phone with at the time of this sighting but I was too awestruck to even put it in words.  I continued to drive east along 20th street to follow these lights but they disappeared behind the hill.  However as the lights were disappearing behind the hill I thought I noticed a triangular shape in the middle of this long line but I cannot be sure.  By the time I got to a nearby vantage point where I could see the entire city, the lights were nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been trying to decide if there is any chance this could have been an airplane or helicopter but I don’t see how it could have been.  There was no sound, the object was way larger than any commercial airplane or helicopter and the object appeared to be hovering, not flying like an airplane would.<n>

Located in Smileyburg ks his girlfriend was in the car when the sighting occured.  It started as a large white light off in the distance as we drove closer to it it suddenly became darker with more lights around it. We immediatly knew it wasn&#39;t a plane it was far to low to the ground and not making a sound.  It would change directions and height on a whim.  At one point it appered.like a ball the next  as a real airplane came near it mimicked the flashing lights of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When entering andover city limits the ufo flew right over the vehicle.  Since we had been watching it for miles the sun roof.was open for a better view.  While flying over the vehicle it appered as a triangle large and black with three lights on the tips and six in the center.  The lights on the tips were red, green, and yelow but kept changing points on the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon entering Andover city limits it flew over some phone lines and was gone.<n>

The glowing edges of the orb were more green than the center.  It traveled in a low horizontal trajectory.  It looked as if it was traveling in a trajectory as high above the ground as the height of six story building.  It was difficult to tell how large it was but looked fairly close.  If I outstretched my arm and made a little circle with my thumb and forefinger it could have fit in that small circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live close to a golf course and it looked like it was traveling over the golf course, but from my vantage point on the ground it could have been higher and farther away.  It appeared out of no where and disappeared within a second.  It traveled from north to south and I was viewing it from the west looking eastward toward the mountains.  It was really beautiful and was not frightening.  It made absolutely no sound and there was no tail like when you see a meteor.  We all said, “Whoa, what was that?”  My husband and I are in our fifties.  He is a professional and I am a homemaker.  Our friend is in his late thirties and a professional.  I have never seen any phenomena of this sort in all of my life or anything that would mimic or even come close to it.  It could not have been any type of laser light, fireworks, meteor, or aircraft to my knowledge.  It was astounding.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects were moving parallel to one another over the western basin of Lake Erie.  No audible sound was heard, and no contrails were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this is a common east-west flight path, and it was dusk, I first thought that it may be man-made aircraft, reflecting sunlight.  They were too low to be military craft, and no north/south flight paths, either civilian or military are used in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately 30 seconds the two objects made an abrupt 90-degree turn to the right.  Now the objects were moving west, with one of the objects now following the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again they left no audible or visible traces of their movements, and quickly disappeared over the treeline.<n>

As it appeared out of nowhere I realized it wasn&#39;t a meteor either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to have a liquid quality to it, like a fire work.

Four were disk shaped, one was like a rectangular box that seemed a little transparent and one was a long line that continued to increase in size.  I had been speaking with my brother who lives in Brighton, on the cell phone.  Upon sighting this, I pulled over and told him to look to the west.  He also saw the long bright orange colored line and had his son get this telescope.  Due to trees in his areas, he could not spot the other objects.  All of a sudden, all six objects simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were several other people also gazing into the sky and as we watched some would disappeer and several more would follow the same flight pattern.  In all I counted 37.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Objects heading south to north in the western sky.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92032.html|262|ndxe201208| 36 orange lights seen over Green Bay by seven in parking lot.  Objects heading south to north in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After exiting vehicle at East side Menard’s Home Improvement Store, I witnessed three objects moving from the southwest toward the north, in the western sky.  One object was in the lead, followed by two in tight, stacked formation.  The objects where orange; maybe orange-red.  They were not moving exceptionally fast, but faster than a balloon.  Then more began to appear, moving in a similar direction; some faster than others, thus negating the possibility of a wind-blown object.  Within 20 seconds I witnessed a fourth and fifth object enter the sky and stopped in the middle of the drive lane to watch.  At this moment, an employee stopped to watch with me.  By the time I entered the store, we had counted 11.  I was in the store for only about 5 minutes.  When I went outside, the same employee reported to me that he had counted 29.  By that time, people started to gather and discuss what the objects could be.  One bystander pointed out a plane that looked noth! ing like the objects we were witnessing.  The space station was also located in the night sky.  By the time the event was over, we had counted at least 36 objects (there may have been more before I identified the first object.)  I believe there were 7 of us in total that saw the event.  I called a local television station who admitted to having received multiple calls reporting the incident.  I was unable to take photos as my smartphone battery had died 3 hours earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/21/12 20:40|Green Bay|WI|Formation|10 minutes|Observed 1 large unidentified craft and a series of 8 - 10 bright orange balls travelling evenly and slowly across the sky|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92047.html|263|ndxe201208| Observed 1 large unidentified craft and a series of 8 - 10 bright orange balls travelling evenly and slowly across the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 20:40 my wife and I observed what appeared to be a large craft directly overhead traveling slowly east-northeast.  It was at the height of low flying commercial aircraft and looked somewhat like a refueling tanker hooked to another similarly sized craft. There was one red steady light in the center of the craft.  The perimeter was outlined in a silvery color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time we observed this craft there were 3 bright orange ball shaped lights in a line, spaced about 5 to 10 degrees apart traveling in the same path. As the original craft disappeared to the east the orange balls traveled slowly along the same course before gradually fading and ultimately disappearing as they reached about 80 degrees above the horizon.  A series of these orange balls appeared to rise from near the west-southwest horizon and travel along the same path before gradually dimming and disappearing at about 80 degrees above the horizon.  We saw 8 to 10 of these balls over about 10 minutes.  We waited about another 10 minutes before going inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/21/12 20:35|Green Bay|WI|Triangle|10 minutes|30+ lights traveled low and silent over the city and a silent triangle shape with no belly strobe flew directly overhead.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92065.html|264|ndxe201208| 30+ lights traveled low and silent over the city and a silent triangle shape with no belly strobe flew directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in the Bellevue Wisconsin Home Depot parking lot putting our purchases into the truck when we saw 5 lights in the west flying in kind of a v or check mark formation.  My husband is a pilot and so of course interested in planes, we thought the formation was probably some kind of military planes or helicopters and we stopped to watch it.  We quickly noticed that there was no noise, if these were military jets or helicopters we would be able to hear them a good distance away, but there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to watch, the lights did not change in size though they did move from the west and then turned to the north.  Behind these initial 5 came more and more, single file low over the city and then they would turn north and continue until they were out of our site.  These lights were not perfectly spaced, but they came one after another and we could see them coming from some distance away.  It was not like these were just coming up over a building into sight; we could see them far in the distance come closer in a straight line, then turn north and eventually out of sight.  We did not keep an exact count, and as some would go out of sight we could see more coming, but we saw at a minimum 30, more likely 40 of these yellowish round non blinking lights move across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, mostly dark with the west horizon still reddish from the sun set, but stars were visible in the sky.  As we were standing there watching the lights, we noticed a light in the sky moving toward us from NW to SE.  As we looked at it we could tell that it was triangle shaped, but it was not airplane shaped.  We could not see stars behind it, it blocked the sky in a full triangle shape.  My husband being a pilot immediately noticed that while it did have blinking lights at the three triangle points, there was no belly strobe.  We could see the blinking belly strobe on other airliners high in the sky but not on this. Whatever was flying over us was large, completely silent and flying very slow and low.  My husband estimates that the aircraft was flying approximately 3000 feet off the ground, well less than 5000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our background:  We are both in our 40’s, employed full time in white collar jobs, we have two children ages 10 and 12, we were completely sober, not a drop to drink that night. My father is a very active private pilot, and while my husband does not have a current license he graduated from the North America Institute of Aviation in Las Cruces, NM in May 1991 with his Commercial Pilot license and CFI rating.  We are both familiar with aircraft and whatever we saw that night, we cannot explain.   This was the most bizarre experience we have ever had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights stopped, we got in the truck to drive home and I immediately called my dad (8:49pm CST) to see if he knew of any kind of aviation event going on in the area that might explain what we saw, but he did not.  When we got home I called the news stations (WBAY 920-438-3264 at 9:06pm)  (WFRV 800-236-5550 9:11pm) (WLUK 920-490-1407 9:28pm) and while no one knew what we saw, we were not the only ones who called.  The news stations said they had received multiple calls and it seems they were all from the same Bellevue/East Green Bay area we were in.  I called the Green Bay non emergency police number (920-391-7450 9:13pm).  While talking to the woman who answered my call, she said she needed to put me on hold for 911, I thought she was transferring me to 911 so I hung up.  A few minutes later (9:18pm) my phone rang, and it was the police calling me back, she explained that she had to put me on hold so she could take a 911 call.  She completed taking my information and! said they would get in contact with the airport and investigate.  I asked if it was possible to get any follow-up as I would love to have an explanation for what we saw, but she said she transferred the information to her supervisor and she would not know the outcome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far we have seen nothing in the news regarding what we saw, but we would love an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/21/12 20:30|North Bend|WA|Egg|2.5 hours|Red/White Flashing Craft scene multiple nights in the skies over North Bend, Wa|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92084.html|265|ndxe201208| Red/White Flashing Craft scene multiple nights in the skies over North Bend, Wa<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is what I witnessed over the past month or so and specifically August 21, 2012 over the skies of North Bend, Wa: The last week of July I was out and noticed a star that seemed out of place. Upon further inspection and double checking my skyview and google sky to make sure I was not mistaken I noticed it growing brighter and flashing bright white and red light. The following night I went out to see if it was in the same place as I still wanted to rule out anything explainable. It was not. As I turned around to walk back to the house I saw what appeared to be the same thing now over the mountain near me. After watching it hover and then slowly descend behind the mountain I knew it really was a UFO. The following night I went out to look at the mountain at the same time, it was not there of course. This cemented my conviction that it had been the same or similiar type UFO both nights. I tried to capture it with my phone and camera but they were not powerful enough in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next two weeks I found this thing hovering in the sky but in different places nearly every night, just as if it was watching us. Often moving but the movement was so slow you would have to be watching it for a while to notice it. It seemed to be trying to appear as a star, and it would drift just as the sky appears to throughout the night. However, to a person that knows the stars and the night sky it&#39;s movement is not as it should be if it really was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week ago I decided I just had to try to get one of these on film so I went out and purchased a new Nikon camera with a telephoto lense. Happily I finally  did a couple nights ago on August 21st as they came up right at dusk. During the past week there appears to be the main craft which is brighter and/or closer to earth along with two like it that seem either smaller or more distant. I did post a youtube video of the the pics I got. They aren&#39;t the best but I am going to try to get more. Hopefully I find others who are seeing this craft in the Washington skies as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s the link to the video:                                                                         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32yFcjMAqc&amp;feature=plcp<n>

I then came out and my wife asked if I saw what was in the sky it had moved but not much. I thought at first we were maybe looking at a helicopter as it was hovering low in the atmosphere. We kept watching and it was changing colour, red, and blue but mainly was going brighter to lower light. It looked like it was having issues as it was moving erratically but was slowly going higher in the sky, we were amazed and called some friends and they saw it from there home and came over to our place where we watched with binoculars it was amazing! When it was closer it looked like it was triangle but looked more like a saucer with the glasses, we watched this for over 1.5 hours as it was getting further away into space and had done a few circles. When it was closer it looked like another object or light went near to it the sky was clear and we watched th! is object fly deeper into the atmosphere and away from earth. My wife and I will never forget this event and know it was a special moment that we will share with others for the rest of our time!<n>

Fanny stebbins refuge, Tonight. Me and one other person are in our 30&#39;s. Fished a small pond and headed back on train tracks going to springfield .. I looked into sky and notice a bright white moving east to west, and I commented &amp;quot;Huh, whats that ?&amp;quot; My buddy looks up and goes oh it&#39;s a plane. I exclaim, &amp;quot;yeah but its not blinking and its white, pure white. No colors, no pulsation, nothing.. just white and round&amp;quot;   We both agree this is odd, we watch it move east to west , then it navigates at about the distance a passenger jet would be at. We watch it expected it to continue on. Keep in mind, no direct path, just like an object deciding it movemnet. Not a coment , or metorite. I have seen hundreds of these , as I am a sky buff. They don&#39;t just glow pure white, and stay constant. They don&#39;t.  It doesn&#39;t. So we watch as it seems to turn away and up, then in about 2 seconds, leaves twoards space, then disappears. Before it does , there is a small glow as it leaves, like some sort of burner. and then its just gone.  I can say surley, for me a total non beleiver , this has made me believe.<n>

It started to land in the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We driving in the countryside were a lot of fields and farms were when we saw this once again strange circular/oval bright light it was immense.  We couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing once again there was no explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The difference was this time it was not that high in the sky nor was it hovering it was progressing lower and lower towards the ground.  It had suddenly disappeared into the woods near the fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had no idea what to think so we rushed how spooked and searched up UFO sightings near our area to find many reports and videos of the same strange thing we had seen close to where we had seen it.<n>

At about 11:30 we saw a very strange big bright oval light hovering in the sky. It looked too bright and big to be any ordinary plane or helicopter.  We captured a photo of it and video and in the photo if you zoom in you can distinctively see it is a large oval and is a orange and yellow light.  At the time there was no sound of a air plane or helicopter and it was too close to be a star.  It hovered with two small dots in the sky for about ten minutes and then it started to move away and suddenly disappeared. My friend and I discussed it for quite a long time trying to figure it out debating what we had just witnessed.  There was ultimately no explanation for what we had seen.  It just sat there in the sky hovering for ten minutes and it was the most bright unusual thing I had ever seen.  It almost looked like the sun but obviously smaller.  We showed what we ca! ptured to multiple people and they all agreed that was no plane nor helicopter.<n>

While looking up there was a glow to my right and turned to see if it was a meteor breaking up, but the glow continued and pulsated, while maintaining direction. There were Three Globes in a triangular formation, with a pulsating orange glow, (similar to those photographed in the Grand Chute, WI report).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area has a lot of aircraft activity, over the years, military, private, and passenger craft training.

These objects were spread out by about 20mins each &amp; all took the same northerly direction which then changed to NW and ultimately went west across the sky pulling away from me.  At their closest point &amp; watching throu binoculars they seemed almost jelly fish like in that the only visible light source was ahead of the rest of the object.  I think the fact that bothered me is that neither of them made a sound.  There were many other planes in the sky &amp; I could hear every one of them which were close enough.<n>
8/20/12 21:30|Peru|IL|Triangle|1 minute|(/\) - Large V shape object with 5 amber lights just above the tree-line moving silently at 10-20 MPH|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92407.html|278|ndxe201208| (/\) - Large V shape object with 5 amber lights just above the tree-line moving silently at 10-20 MPH<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 20th 2012 approximately 9:30 pm I went to shut the front door.  Before doing so I stood there to enjoy a cool breeze, and the sound of crickets.  Facing north in the doorway, I noticed to the left of me 5 large amber lights that just came from the south side my house. The lights formed a wide V - (/\), or in the shape of a boomerang, and silently moved in a northerly direction.  The speed was approximately 10-20 MPH and the height was just above the tree-line.  The sky was clear, and some of the lights on the side closes to me flickered a few times.  All of the lights moved in unison, and I could not make out a clear solid object. Once it reached the street, the left side moved over the light.  What I was able to see on that side was definition, but with no solidity.   It was strange; I could only see edges and not a solid mass.  So in other words, the side lite by the street light was like an object with no sides and the other side was black. I was! scared, and excited at the same time. I tried to call my girlfriend, but while I was fumbling with the phone in the dark and looking for my shoes to run to the road I dropped it.  Once I did get outside, and ran to the end of my walk, I saw two of my neighbors who hadn’t been out earlier.  I asked them both if either one of them saw something in the sky.  They both replied “no,” they too had just come out with their dogs.  I reported it to MUFON right away while my memory was clear. I was so baffled by what I saw I couldn&#39;t sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since its properties were somewhat invisible other than the lights.  One theory worth reckoning is it could have been manufactured with a shell made with something like Goldbeaters Skin.  Goldbeater’s skin is made from cow innards.  The quality is one of transparency and strength. I think they used it back in the early 1900’s airships like the German zeppelins.  Maybe that would explain the cow mutilations?  Whatever it was, it was also sighted the next day hovering over the municipal airport at 1pm and later that night by a woman and her son. Their sighting was at approximately 7:30 pm.  She said the object was hovering over the school and looked somewhat transparent and had five to six lights.  I have not been able to get them to fill out a report on MUFON.  This whole deal is a little unnerving and I need to make some sense out of what I saw.  I called the airport, and the police. No one reported seeing anything.  I am hoping it did not see me.  I don’t think I want it to! come back. Since I have no control over this situation it is a little frightening.<n>

Could not be a cloud because it was completely luminous. The sun was blocked out by a few clouds on the horizon.No visible exhaust trails. Oval shaped. Color was white. I do not know when it exactly appeared, but from my observation the sighting lasted about two minutes. It moved so slowly it was hard to tell it was moving, and at one point it just faded into the sky.  I saw it for a minute and brought three others to its attention.  All three and I are young and related.  I have interest in UFOs already, the second witness has a little less, the third has some minor interest, and fourth hardly at all. Could possibly  be some odd reflection of the sun, I doubt it was our imagination.<n>

8/20/12 09:15|El Dorado|KS|Circle|17 minutes|One light, magnitude six or so traveling at a high rate of speed and stopping, turning, hovering, and looping E to W then NW to SW.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92058.html|286|ndxe201208| One light, magnitude six or so traveling at a high rate of speed and stopping, turning, hovering, and looping E to W then NW to SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello this night I was at the El Dorado Lake, Bolder Bluff area. I was sitting in a chair that sort of leans back and has a foot rest, watching the stars,(I&#39;m a bit of an amature astronomer). I know my stars, and my planes very well. I know what planes are at what air force bases in the area and what there capable of doing. I love physics and military info. I don&#39;t believe in aliens, at least not ones near our solar system. I&#39;m sure, as most scientist are, that life exists somewhere in the Galaxy. It&#39;s ridiculas not to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light I thought was a star of about a magnitude six and was white in color and did not blink or flash like most planes do. It was in the eastern sky, and then it moved west it and very fast. Which is why I really noticed it. I thought it was a satellite until it stopped on a dime, and then changed directions, looping north then back on the same east to west heading. Only to stop again, and do a circle, stop and hover for a few seconds and after that it was back on the same heading. This repeated several times. It lasted so long my neck hurt the next day,(I had gotten up to turn off my lanturn), when I tried to retrive my binoculars I lost it of course! It was very intriguing and i kept an eye out for it. Then I caught it in the northwestern sky headed southeast doing the same type of movements. The light finally disapeared in the southwestern sky. The duration was from 9:15 to 9:32. The light was traveling at about the speed of a satillite or faster but was brighter than most. It had to be some type of craft, it could not have been a star, satillite, or any aircraft I know of obviously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this, and I believe it to be a secret military craft. That is up for interpretation. I have been vidulant at looking for this light since that night,(9/20/2012) to no avail though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four planes during that time period that I noticed. All of which were headed on a east west heading, probably to and from Wichita, KS. Two headed east and two west. I&#39;d love to see the radar reports from that night if at all possible. Someone had to see this light, either on radar or visually. It was perfectly clear sky, and pretty much has been every night since. If anyone had seen this also please report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not believe the speed at which the light was traveling or how it could just stop and loop or do perfect right angle corners. This was no illusion, I&#39;m not insane, actually I have a very high IQ. And it makes my a little angry the way people look at me when I tell them about it. So if your reading this and you believe me, thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There are five of us here.  I am using a keyboard that is hard to type on.  We found your site after searching after what we saw last night.  We are one retired PhD scientist, two retired NY media persons, and two currently working media and not for profit people  We are staying at a summer house at Lake Ariel PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night at 11 PM two of us saw a large red to red orange ellipse move across the sky, slowly with no sound.  It looked like a the tail light of a car and was about 30 times larger than stars or the strobe and other light on airplanes seen in same area/time.  Two of us roused the other three from the house.  By the time they came this orb was fading after moving in a south to east direction farther and farther away.  BUT then, we suddenly saw a formation of five exactly the same orbs coming from the same direction and moving in the same trajectory as the first one.  All five of us watched these five move slowly across the sky, which is a l! arge expanse over the small lake in front of this summer house.  One of us ran inside to find the telescope that this house has.  Eventually by 11:15 or so these five had also moved south to east, fading out as they moved that direction.  Then after about 5 more minutes another, single orb came over, following exactly the same trajectory as the other six.  We all thought all this was extremely strange.  We fiddled with the telescope but could not get a fix before this last orb followed all its predecessors off to the east.  As soon as we got up today we started googling.  We saw a lot of reports including your request.  You can reach us here or me at kurtjohnsonisd@yahoo.com.  We also want to note that the other odd thing last night, though it may have no connection, was that someone in the country neighborhood was shooting off firecrackers in large amount nearby… bang bang bang etc. not a usual thing in these quiet woods, although they were not shooting off any fireworks i! n the sky.  We could just hear all the bangs… or maybe it was ! someone shooting at the orbs.. But we think it was firecrackers…… So two anomalous things last night.  Glad we found all your reports; made us feel we were not imagining what we all saw.  It was pretty memorable.   Also a regular airplane with regular white strobe, red and green light seemed to chase the last orb.  We also filed this report because of the number of similar recent reports once we checked.<n>
8/19/12 23:00|Huber Heights|OH|Sphere|10 minutes|UFO over huber heights, ohio|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92364.html|290|ndxe201208| UFO over huber heights, ohio<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 11pm I was sitting outside talking to my neighbor. It was a quiet night no noise at all aside from our conversation.  She interrupted me and asked what was that in the sky I glanced over and said it was probably a helicopter.  After about thirty seconds I hushed her and realized there was absolutely no noise at all.  I then paid further attention to the object in the sky. It came from the north over the apartment buildings.  It was glowing orange traveling like a plane would except it was spinning.  As it was directly over us it stopped and hovered and then the spinning was more like a gyroscope. It spun on all axis and then abruptly stopped.  It sat there for a few minutes.  I tried to take a video of it but it wouldn’t show up on the video.  I switched over to camera and then out of like 20 pictures was able to get it to show up on only one.  About that time it started to spin up again and then moved southwards it didn’t move fast but it was steady.  A very controlled movement, as if it was being controlled.  When it  got a little further away it got extremely brighter than in a blink of an eye it was gone.  I have a photo but I don’t know how to upload it or even if I can.<n>
8/19/12 22:20|Milwaukee|WI|Fireball|10 minutes|Silent group of 12-15 glowing orange orbs of light appear one at a time over horizon and flying in a spread out cluster NW to SWW|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91991.html|291|ndxe201208| Silent group of 12-15 glowing orange orbs of light appear one at a time over horizon and flying in a spread out cluster NW to SWW<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting at a bus stop across from a Domino&#39;s waiting 15 minutes for my Pizza playing Angry Birds on my cell phone. I put the cell away and was just about to cross back over the street to pick up my Pizza when out from behind a cloud to my right I suddenly saw a bright orange burst of light that was so bright it could not be ignored. One orange burning/glowing ball light in the night sky is one thing, but suddenly I saw another, and yet another trailing behind it. I could not believe what I was seeing and before I knew it on the horizon I was seeing them pop up to the North &amp; just West and follow a similar path NW to SW almost as if in a non-linear string formation.  During this time I called my girlfriend who was at our house 6 blocks away and yelled at her to go outside and look up while I frantically tried to snap photographs on my cellphone to no avail due to the overbearing light from street lamps. When I first saw them I thought it could be a meteor, but after the first two and then seeing how fluidly they were moving, with small adjustments in elevation I knew they couldn&#39;t be as it wasn&#39;t burning up or crashing or dissapating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought could be a helicopter, but they were SO bright and 100% SILENT &amp; did not move like helicopters. There were planes in the sky as well during and after the sighting (Milwaukee County Airport traffic) but these lights neither came from the Airport nor headed toward the airport and were way too bright and obvious to be planes or anything else that uses the Airport Terminals. I stayed on the phone with my girlfriend until I had walked the 6 blocks home and by the time I had gotten there all the remaining UFOs were gone, however she had seen them as well, albeit not as many - she ended up seeing 5-7 &amp; even noted that one seemed to turn it&#39;s light off and she got sight of the actual shape of the object as seen on the face of a cloud, which was round / spherical - as she put it &amp;quot;a! lmost 2 spheres in one&amp;quot;. I only lost sight of the remaini! ng 3 &amp;qu ot;fireball&amp;quot; orbs that I could still see from my perspective once I got about 2 blocks from home and they seemed to have changed direction and were all now traveling more decidedly west than Southwest, however still had a slightly southern trajectory as well. When the sighting was said and done I had seen a &amp;quot;fleet&amp;quot; of these lights - about 12-15 very strong &amp; bright glowing orange orbs moving across the Milwaukee night sky over Milwaukee&#39;s East Side near the University of Milwaukee Wisconsin. I lost sight of the remaining objects the same way I lost sight of the first 8 or 9... as they flew south past my point of view, they headed hard west &amp; disappeared into cloud cover at this point. You could see them climbing up into the clouds quickly once they reached them and fading out of view in less than a minute. These objects were completely silent, very bright, seemingly moving as a large group / unit but with their own variances &amp; at least 5-10 orb lengths between! each object. I felt calm, dumbfounded and not really frantic quite frankly but rather at ease. I remember that my only concern was that my girlfriend who was only a few blocks away get outside and confirm what I was seeing from that perspective as well (looking south as I was seeing them come from the north), so I was ecstatic when she answered and when I heard her reaction over the phone when she looked up. I had a feeling in my chest, slightly emotional and my eyes were wired open as well as a feeling of calm. UFO Sighting looked very similar to some of the photos taken in this article http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1190481/Mysterious-orange-UFOs-swoop-Britains-skies.html<n>

I noticed a brighter blue light light than any other star, showed my friend and said this looks weird like I&#39;ve never seen something that bright here in chicago. While watching it while driving we saw that it was moving at us but that it was not blinking and was far but did pass over us, like I said we were traviling fast.  I then took two photos and watched confused as it went into the distance.  When it did finally pass we noticed two lights or engins, seems kind of yellow but blue and definitely blended together cuz of distance.  It made progress threw the clear night sky but not that fast. Object traveled from north west and was going east at about ten pm.<n>

St. Helens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I camped along the bank of the Muddy River near Lava Canyon in the Mt. St. Helens national volcanic area.  To the southwest of our campsite I saw at about 70 degrees above the horizon what initially appeared to be a meteor, but without the tail, traveling straight down towards the horizon.  The object then slowed and brightened to a pure white and seemed to enlarge in size to a perfect circular shape although I suspect it could have been spherical.  It then continued to travel towards the horizon in a straight line. After about 15 seconds it dimmed in brightness and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later there was another bright white circular/spherical object that was traveling from north to south just above the horizon to the east.  It moved up and down in a way I have never seen any aircraft or helicopter move before.  It got to a point to the east of us, dimmed and shot up and out of sight. Neither object made any noise, and the light they emitted did not flicker.  I work in the aviation industry and have seen many different types of aircraft.  These objects were definitely NOT aircraft, helicopters, satellites, meteors, or any other object I have ever seen before. I have spent a lot of time outdoors and watching the sky. This was the first UFO sighting I have ever had.<n>

I stared at it for a minute or so, then decided to run inside and grab my husband so he could explain this to me. We live in a neighborhood and have a couple large street pole lights in our neighborhood. We estimated the distance of the flying aircraft to be between 600-1,000 ft above us, and probably an equal distance from us, based on the light poles as a measuring device. This object looked like it was egg/tear dropped shaped it appeared to be about twice as large as the light box on the pole at approx 1,000 feet above us. I don&#39;t know how to do the math at a distance like that and be able to provide a rough idea of the size of the aircraft, but that&#39;s what it resembled from ground level. It also looked like it was on fire, strange as that sounds, it was a very bright golden/fire color; not a brilliant ! white color. It had several colored lights coming from it. My husband primarily saw red and orange. I saw the full color spectrum in several vertical lines coming from the whole air craft in every direction, in addition to the lights moving horizontally around the aircraft. The primary colors seemed to be Red &amp; Orange. As we watched, it just hovered and moved in circles above us; there was no consistent pattern…it just slowly moved. I have no idea how to guess a speed, but my eyes were able to track it very easily. The lights were very bright and it was a little harder to make out the overall shape of the aircraft at first. There was no noise of an engine or helicopter blades…nothing but silence. We stared at it and watched it move around in a small area of the sky for about 7-10 minutes before it started to drift further South East of us. As it left, heading South East of Battle Ground, it started to climb in altitude and increase its speed.  We saw the whole aircraft “bli! nk” a few times at us (maybe 3 or 4) and then it went really f! ast and all the lights disappeared.  We kept looking up at the sky to try and see if it would reappear again, but it was gone. Before it left, my husband ran into the garage and grabbed a pair of binoculars to try and get a better understanding of this thing; he was unable to bring the binoculars into focus.  We have been discussing this experience since last night and both of us are at a loss for words; especially my husband who retired out of the Air Force recently with 22 years of service. He said he has no idea what that was, he has never seen anything like it. I don’t know if this matters or not, but there was this overall feeling of calmness…I guess I would have expected to be fearful of the unknown, but we were amazingly intrigued by it. When it left, it was almost as though it was saying good-bye with the blinking thing it did. I don’t know though, the experience was strange and I’m not aware of any aircraft that flies that low with no noise. I’m curious if anyone knows what! this is or has also seen something like it? I tried calling the Federal Aviation Administration, but no one answered the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At one point a white triangle of individual white lights appeared around the fireball briefly.  It was completely still, then suddenly it ascended upwards until we couldn&#39;t see it any longer.  We continued to watch, when suddenly from the north another fireball like the first appeared, and stopped in the same place as the first.  It didn&#39;t stay long, and ascended upwards.   At one point I briefly saw another white triangle of lights appear, but disappear just as quickly.  It quickly disappeared.  The orange ball looked like it was made of fire.  It didn&#39;t change shape.  It seemed like it was fairly low.  It was partly cloudy that night, and I could see stars.  When they ascended, it looked like they were in the same path in relation to a particular star in the sky. By the time the second one ascended it had to pass through a thin cloud that had appeared. So it was lower than the cloud. Actually it seemed pretty low.! It seemed like it was right there, but I am not a trained observer.  Lower than a small plane would be. This is my observation and thoughts.  Oh, there was no sound. Thank you<n>

Threw on my shoes and went into the driveway just to see another orange light passing over again, went out to road and followed it as it went south toward the golf coarse and it disappeared.

8/19/12 21:02|Walworth|NY|Sphere|90 seconds|4 orange glowing objects seen at night moving east to west.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91979.html|302|ndxe201208| 4 orange glowing objects seen at night moving east to west<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Sunday, August 19 at about 9:02 Eastern Time I saw what I initially thought was a landing light of a small aircraft in the south eastern sky.  I was in front of my house which faces east as I observed it. As it got closer to where I was, I thought it may have an engine on fire as it had an orange glow and much larger in size than a landing light.  It was circular in shape but not constant in that it oscillated. I estimated it’s altitude to be between 2 and 5 thousand feet, now passing directly south, I realized that there was no sound associated with the object. Nor did it have typical aircraft navigation lights. It was then that I went back into the house to retrieve a camera to video the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home is in a flight path of the Rochester Airport in Monroe Country which is about 18 miles away to the west so I am familiar with planes which routinely pass nearly overhead as they approach runway 10/28 from the east.  Depending on weather, they are between 2600 and 6500 feet elevation traveling at about 180 knots.  While they usually pass just to the north, they sometimes will pass to the south of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object’s entire flight took it east to west in a fairly straight path at a constant velocity of perhaps 100 knots.  It disappeared over trees in my back yard facing west.  When I say overhead, it traveled through constellations Aquila and Ophiuchus at what I estimate to be about 55 to 65 degrees of elevation over the southern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after a second similar object appeared from over the south side of the house, since now I was on a western facing deck and the house obstructed my view to the east.  It appeared to follow the same trajectory at about the same velocity as the first object.  I was able to get about 11 seconds of video of that object until it too disappeared behind trees to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, at about 10:15, two more similar objects were spotted on the eastern side of the house, but this time slightly north and again moving east to west.  I called my neighbor out of his house to observe and again, I took a video.  While doing that, the first object flickered out followed shortly after  by the second while still in the northeastern sky.  This time they appeared to be lighted balloons.  My neighbor is a New York State Trooper and we both concluded that they must have been balloons with flares, or something similar.  What is odd is that prevailing winds are out of the west, and these objects traveled to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sphere/fireball had a glow around it that was white. It did not make any sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point both of my neighbor&#39;s kids as well as my wife and other child were called out to observe this.  My neighbor started to video record it with his cell phone. The quality is not bad considering it was a phone.  We watched it continue north then it changed appearance and became a black orb in the sky, as if it were able to turn its lighting source off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we observed it sharply turn to the west and we continued watching until it was out of our sight due to trees and roof lines.  About two to three minutes passed from the time it was first observed by my son and the time all of us lost it in our view as a black round orb. Moments after we! lost sight I noticed a commercial jet passing overhead traveling east.  This is a typical international route so the plane was at cruising altitude and you could hear the engines, which it very normal and occurs about twice an hour at our location.  Clearly this fireball/orb was not a commercial aircraft as it was at least ten times brighter, traveling much faster than a typical aircraft and much higher in altitude without any sound.<n>

I was at the intersection of Sherman Way and Lindley in Reseda.  I was looking NorthEast towards St. Catherine of Siena church.  I was looking towards the church steeple, directly above the cross that sits on the top of the roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very large, very bright fuzzy orange ball appeared on top of the cross.  It appeared to be about 50 feet NorthEast of the cross.  Just as suddenly as it appeared, it disappear.  It almost seem to collapse into itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s interesting to note that I felt what I can only describe as warmth emanating from this object.  I felt it, even as I was at about 200 feet from it.<n>

I started to take video of it and it was very hard to get excellent video shot on it although I tried to stop the shaking, It was far and I kept on losing sight on it,  There was no noise, There were no Chemical Trails no smoke nothing!!  It happened quickly, it was not rising it was traveling straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fort Dix is about an hour away south west and there is Lakehurst, there is also a Trans-Atlantic cargo plane that flies in from the ocean and heads west around 2:00 pm daily, Also the Banner planes fly over the area which you see when you are at the beach in their single engine prop jobs,  But without any mistake this was not a Aircraft or Blimp, Balloons, it was absolutely something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have placed it on YOUTUBE under &#34;UFO Jersey Shore 8-18-2012&#34;<n>

We observed the object for several minutes as we approached closer then passed it. Object had a V or Chevron shape approx. 40 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered at about 1000-1500 feet – similar to traffic helicopter altitude.  A plane landing or taking off from a regional airport was passing at the same time a couple thousand feet above the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The behavior was the oddest thing, it seemed as if it was tumbling in place while it hovered, which is how we could tell what shape it was from our approaching angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We exited the freeway to see if we could get a better look, but could only see it between gaps in buildings. 5 min later we got back on the freeway it had moved north approximately 1-3 miles and was now NW of us again.  We observed for another 1-2 min as we passed it yet again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our first impression is that it could be a large balloon, as it seemed like it was tethered, but that didn’t make sense since we had moved locations on the freeway and there was no visible tether as we got closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the impression that it looked like the letter V and thought it looked a lot like a House Industries Neutraface Bold “V”. It was 3D and had solid mass to it.  The sun really flared off of the sharp angles and surfaces, almost like a mirror; which is why it caught my attention in the first place. Based on its altitude it must have been the size of our minivan, maybe bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always look up at movement in the sky ever since I was a kid. I have watched many types of aircraft fly over day and night. After looking at thousands of aircraft in my lifetime, this does not fit any of the shapes and/or flight behaviors of anything I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly enough another report on NUFORC caught my attention, same description, 60 miles away, 5 hours earlier but spotted at a higher altitude. &amp;lt;a<n> <n><n> <n><n> href=&amp;quot;http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91961.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;S91961&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;<n>

This is about 1/3 of a mile west of the Oceana Naval Air Station.  It was a rainy, drizzly day but had stopped at the time.I turned northbound on Lynnhaven Parkway when I saw an unknown object in the sky.  It was indistinct in shape, as it had what appeared to be antenna or spikes extending laterally fore and aft and to some degree on the bottom. It was about the size of a nickel held at arms length.  My impression was that it was about the size of a desk several hundred feet off the ground. It was dark in color and made no noise any louder than the traffic. I drove slowly and watched it travel west by southwest in a straight line at about 10-15 mph. There were no markings or lights. It started to get behind my position and traffic compelled me to drive on. It was perfectly steady and did not appear to be a balloon of any kind. I thought it may have ! been an airborne surveillance device, but it certainly wasn&#39;t anything like the stuff you see on TV. There was no obvious means of propulsion.  Just a brief, weird thing.<n>

Silvery reflective object  flying at altitude suddenly stops and hovers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside my home in Corona CA to have a cigarette and I looked up into the sky.  It was clear with no clouds.  A silver grey object was moving across the sky reflecting the suns as it traveled.  It appeared small so I assumed it was either a jet or helicopter, and appeared to be at a high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We get a fair amount of commercial and military air traffic so at first I didn&#39;t think much of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that kept my interest was its odd shape, which was somewhat boomerang shaped and the total lack of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it slowed down smoothly and rapidly and stopped in one place and hovered.  I observed it for a few minutes trying to determine what the heck it was.  I pointed it out to my sister who was also outside.  I knew right away this was out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside my house to get my camera, and by the time I returned, it was gone.  I was gone for at best 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I scanned the sky and there wasn&#39;t a sign of it.  If it had been a helicopter or jet, it would still have been in visual range.  This is the damnedest thing I have ever witnessed.  I know aircraft, and what is and is not possible, and I have no explanation for what could do this.<n>

I already reported on one that I saw on August 10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this occasion, I went outside to lock my car and the object caught my eye.   It was moving from east northeast to west southwest.   It was not falling like a shooting star, but moving horizontally.  Unlike the first sighting, this one had no trailing “cone” shape behind it, but otherwise it was identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It produced no trail, like a shooting star or comet.   It moved in a straight line fairly quickly, like the speed you would of a plane flying across the sky.   But I have seen planes flying across the night sky with their navigation lights flashing at regular intervals.  This was definitely not a plane.  The object was basically round and orange in color, but it shimmered or flashed but not regularly – the effect was more like it was an irregular shaped object spinning around fairly quickly.   Maybe it would be akin to wrapping aluminum foil around a rock, hang from a string, spin it around, and shine a bright orange light on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, it tracked across the sky and then it gradually diminished in intensity and eventually faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole episode lasted about  10-15 seconds from the time I first spotted it.<n>

I was the first to notice a firey orange light floating high above in the sky.  I looked up and said, &#34;Hey everyone, look at that1&#34;   One person asked, &#34;What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not know nor do I still know what it was.  My first instant thought was could it be a bag on fire, because it was floating but it&#39;s floating was a steady course from north to south.  My female neighbor was worried it would land on her roof and catch fire.  However, after a second of looking at it it was clearly not something on fire because there was no flame, spark, or smoke and it made no noise or sound whatsoever.  It was clearly a neon-orange orb-like object.  The same exact color as fire, but in the shape of a sphere.  I was so amazed at it that it did not occur to me to take any photos of this one.

Moments later (within a minute or two), a second glowing orange orb appeared traveling in the same direction exactly like the first one. This time, I grabbed my Canon digital camera, which I had on hand and I zoomed in and managed to take two photographs of the orange orbs. This second orb also became dimer the further it traveled away and vanished into the distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen or witnessed anything like this ever before in my life.  These two orange orb-like objects were too big or close to be stars in space and were too symmetrical in shape and neon-orange in color to resemble a shooting star.  The had no tail or streak to indicate being a comet or meteor and although they were minutes apart from each other they both floated/flew in the same North-to-South course direction.  They traveled as a steady pace. They appeared as though they were floating in motion, thus discounting the possibility that they were comets, meteors, or shooting stars. I saw nothing to indicate that it could have been a hot air balloon.  These were fire-like neon-orange orb-like objects, emitting no sound or noise as they traveled across the night sky over were my neighbors and I live in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, right on the outskirts of Appleton, Wisconsin.  The objects were seen between 9:30PM until 9:50PM (central time), when the last/second one finally vanis! hed.<n>

We were sitting on an island campsite looking north at the night sky. It was a very dark and clear night, not a cloud in the sky, perfect for looking at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was panning north, looking for shooting stars and satellites, something unusual caught my eye.  The first thing I noticed was this intense bright white light moving very erratically across the sky.  As I began to focus on the object and follow it’s movements, I noticed it was moving extremely fast, covering a wide distance and then stopping.  When the object would stop, a bright blue light shot out beneath it, which would last just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object would take off it a different direction moving at incredible speeds and then stop again...then the blue light would shoot back down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued for about ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up to this point I had not said a word to DD about what I had seen. I then called out to DD and said...”Are you seeing what I am seeing?”....DD replied, “YES!”<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we took out our binoculars and focused on the object.  It was a distance off...probably 2-3 miles away...hard to estimate exactly...but close enough that through the binoculars we could make out the shape.  It was shaped like a large bell or wedding cake.  Through the binoculars I could see pulsating lights across the middle of the object.  The lights were pulsating from left to right.  The color pattern was Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue.  The pattern was constant, continued at the same time internals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then decided to grab a flash light that had a red laser pointer attached to it and shine it towards the object. While I was doing that, out of nowhere a second object appeared just off my left should moving East to West a few hundred feet above the tree tops.  It was the same intense bright white light.  It was close enough to get a good look at it’s shape...it was like a sideways tear drop.  It looked very smooth but the details of the outside were masked by the intense white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved at a slow pace right in front of us, it made absolutely no sound. It kept it’s course for a bit longer just passing the northwest shore of Larch Lake and then all of a sudden took off at an incredible pace into the atmosphere.  Just before we lost view, it had changed from the bright white to bright red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object we had witnessed then took off in the same direction at the same pace...both out of sight and gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is in my opinion that what we witnessed two different types of UFOs.  I have no photographic evidence to support this eyewitness testimony.  It was a brilliant experience and will never forget what I witnessed that evening. I hope this isn&#39;t the last time!<n>

They were traveling in a formation and keeping an equal distance between each light as they traveled at the same rate of speed.  It was obvious they were not airplanes nor helicopters and there was no noise coming from them.  We kept them in our view as we traveled home which was approximately a mile and a half north of where we first noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived home which was north of 23 Mile Rd. and just west of Romeo Plank Rd., we continued to see 4 of them in a square formation in the opening of the street (which went from south to north).  My husband and I both went into our home to get the binoculars and a camera.  I came out of the house first and the square formation ! was gone.  I scoped out the sky to see if they were north of our home or had taken a turn east or west and they were no where to be seen.  I then spotted one coming north in the distance.  I ran back into the house to get my husband and by time he came out with the binoculars, the last one was also gone, vanished like the others.<n>

Each came to the same point, then moved into position upward, left or right, until they were in triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we pulled off into a parking lot to watch, where several other people were taking pictures and videos.  The triangle formation rotated northward  and began to slowly ascend as several more balls moved toward the formation, disappearing as it reached its center.  After 10 – 15 orbs were  “absorbed,” and no others appeared over the horizon, we decided to move further north to an area with less ground light to better observe the phenomenon.  Upon securing a new position, we were unable to observe the orbs again.  I am almost fifty, am familiar with experimental aircraft, and have never seen anything move in the sky in this manner, so steady, unblinking, and fa! st, way too high to be anything hovering like that.  I took some pictures, but they don&#39;t give the phenomenon justice.<n>

Just this formation.  And a brighter blinking orange light in the west sky. It looked like a perfect framed picture against the dark navy sky.  Almost artificial.  I could not stop looking at the formation.  Then it hit me.  This is not normal.  I started getting nauseous and afraid.  I passed thru a treed area... then in cleared area could still see this.  I picked up my son but when I looked they were gone.  The sky was full of a million stars.  I then knew this was different.

Report subsequently posted online.   Also, participant in 2009 UFO Hunters segment.  Have been utilizing NUFORC for several years as reference in attempt to identify local areas of repeat sightings.)  Interested in the 06/06/12 Milford sightings posted to NUFORC, and being very familiar with the area, I decided to proactively scout that shoreline area, judging from numerous NUFORC entries that frequent sightings of the “orange orbs” were currently taking place in that vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 16, or 23, at 9:15PM I arrived near Gulf Beach, Milford, not expecting much.  Almost immediately I observed a low flying aerial light of unusual color which was traveling from the west to the east, approximate altitude 700 feet, no sound.   This light passed over  the water, between the shore and Charles Island, which is about a mile south,  therefore it could not have been more than half a mile away.   Within a minute of my noticing it, the light veered south , along the eastern edge of Charles Island, and headed towards Long Island.  Within less than a minute I lost sight of it as it departed, maintaining the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considering this sighting to be a mere coincidence, or simply a case of my own lack of proper observation (which I have learned from much hard experience to be cautious about), I shrugged  it off.  Much too coincidental to be possible.  Also, I must mention that this light had originally appeared moving from the direction of the local Stratford/Sikorsky airport, which is situated only a few miles west of this beach area, near the Sound.  On the other hand, I should mention that after several years of “plane spotting” around LI Sound, I have never seen aircraft lights of that particular color – my initial reaction was piqued curiosity.  The light was a very warm yellow, with a reddish fringe around its circumference.  It was steady, and there were no other blinking or strobing or steady identifying or anti-collision lights near it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a matter of a couple of minutes another identical light appeared,  following the exact same flight-path as the first, executing the  exact same manuver to the south,  fading from view in the exact same way.   This time I was much more diligent , using a small 10x25 monoscope to try and make out any fuselage.   None seen, no sound heard.  Still, this combined event did not overly impress me.   Nonetheless, over  time, and further review of more recent NUFORC reports, I decided to follow up on that evening’s event.   Over the past two months, equipped with  8x40 binoculars, every opportunity I could get resulted in nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, on Saturday, August 18,  I stationed myself at Gulf Beach, Milford.  From 8:30PM to about 10PM, nothing.  Preparing to leave, I noticed a bright reddish light approaching over the treeline from the north.  The noise of waves, marsh frogs, some traffic, and some teenagers made listening difficult but I heard no sound from what I at first assumed was a shuttle helicopter.  At something like 750 ft altitude (uncertain because no way to judge the size), this light moved silently overhead until it simply faded away.   The appearance of the light was something like a lens, a red rimmed lens through which a very bright yellowish light was being projected, though not in a beam but rather in a way that scintillated, giving the oval object a somewhat firey appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Impressed, I decided to wait, operating under  the assumption that these things appeared in tandem or in some sort of sequence.   And, as if on schedule, another identical light emerged from the north, following what seemed to be the exact same flight path.  This time there was enough quiet that, even with my ears cupped, I could not hear any sound from the object whatsoever.  On approach, this light seemed to waver very slightly, as if it might suddenly change direction.   However, it continued to silently and steadily pass overhead, moving south while ascending somewhat until, as it passed above, almost on cue as I expected , the light simply expired within the Summer Triangle.  Ordinarily, even when aircraft bank, or their lights are no longer visible as they were while approaching, one can still see some aspect of it as it departs.  In this case, as diligently as I looked for it I could not see any trace of the UFO.<n>

Around 9:15 pm. Driving west on Interchange and Zimmerly Road. Looked to the north and saw a shape of a look like big dipper but very condensed. Bright orange round lights 7 formed the dipper shape with 6 orange lights in a straight row east to west centerd perfectly below the dipper shape. It was almost like a perfect framed picture.  I could not stop looking at it.The sky was a deep navy blue no other stars in the sky except to the west a larger bright blinking fast orange ball. I continued driving west and looked north to view this beautiful site. I tried to call my husband but no answer to look at this. Drove on Lancaster Rd north and could still see the orange lights.   I realized this was not normal and  became nauseous and frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned onto West 38th Street going west. I could still see the lights. I pulled into a  treed driveway to pick up my son. I wanted him to take a picture. When I backed out and returned to 38th Street  driving east. The lights were gone. The sky was filled with millions of white stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I just left his house and began to drive down the road about 60 yards and noticed a light off to my left.  I started to slow down and roll down my window.  The light was vibrating between colors, red, green, yellow, white.  Was about the size of a basketball id say and only about as high off the ground as the tallest tree in the area.  The light wasnt moving and seemed to be frozen in postion accept for the changing of colors very slowy and almost wavy like.  The location of the light was very irrelevant because we had just had a storm blow through and we had lost power in the whole area.  Therefore no houselights, no streetlights, no object needing power was able to function.  This light stayed in position for 4 to 5 mins.  Then as I began to film it from my car, it started to move parralel to the ground at a slow speed away from me without changing direction or elevation.  See! med to be in perfect sinc, no flaws or strange noises at all.  Just after it started to move the intensity of the light began to decrease and dim, in till eventually completely disappearing.  Just after this I received a phone call and some friends of mine had also seen it.  In fact two of us caught it on video from different locations.  This is not the first sighting of this light.  It also appears in groups of 3 and even 7-8 in numbers, and all seem to be in symmetrical order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They all stopped around the same area in the sky and kind of float there for a second then move real fast in different directions for a few minutes and then in a blink of the eye took off faster than anything I have ever seen.  I mean they were gone in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all went at different intervals and made no noise.  I called my wife and she ran down and got to see the last 4 of them right before they left.  They were very high in the sky and you could tell they were huge.  Like I said I have never seen anything move like these things did and they looked just like orange balls of light in! the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone else had to have seen this it went on for quite a while and was very visible to see.

Four of us were downstairs on the patio when we started to notice two huge lights from what we thought was an airplane. We commented on how big the headlights were when all of a sudden we saw this thing slow down and then it started to speed up and then it slowed down again to a STOP!   At one time we all said an airplane can’t do that. I also notice there was small red lights going up off this vessel that was visible in the sky.  I asked my friend if he had binoculars and to get them.  By this time this vessel made a right hand turn and started moving away and vanished. The lights were so big and bright you could not see the shape of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched other airplanes that night fly over in certain fly patterns which this vessel seem to be in as well, before it made an about turn to the right and vanish.  All the airplanes we saw had the red light at the wing and we could see them flying for a long distance on this clear night.  This vessel was not following the same pattern the rest of the planes did and was not visible in a matter of a second.  This aircraft had no sound to it at all, it was just there. This craft also flew lower than the other planes that were in the same fly pattern.  What it was, I don’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday morning I was talking to a girl from Italy on Facebook.  As we chatted, she tells me her Mother, Father and her also witness a UFO that same night at 9 pm. Could it be the same one?  I was fascinated and stunned at the same time. If it is the same aircraft or vessel, it had to travel awful fast to be here where we saw it.  She said her father works with airplanes all the time and he said that he knows that could be not a plane or helicopter for that matter.<n>

We live approximately 1/2 mile from the ocean so it was impossible to tell if they were close to shore or farther out to sea.  Some moved horizontally while others moved diagonally upwards.  I was easily able to observe all of the spheres with my binoculars as they were moving slowly with no herky jerky movements.  In each case they simply vanished in the sky.  There were no clouds or fog to obstruct my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was a mathematician/physicist at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in Pasadena, CA., so I grew up with a great telescope looking up at the sky.<n>

It travelled at a steady, continued, even pace for at least 5 minutes before leaving field of view.  It appeared to be larger than a &#34;distant star,&#34; and also more bright than any other stars in this clear sky, and also larger than any aircraft lights that were viewed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes after this sighting, it appeared again following the same path and was  identical in flight movement and intensity of brightness.<n>

The were moving faster than an airplane, but not nearly as fast as a shooting star. All of a sudden the one on the left made an immediate 90 degree turn and within the blink of an eye went due west and was out of site - the object on the right remained stationary. I then went and rang our home doorbell repeatedly and told my wife to look and she was in disbelieve - it was literally right above the tree line.  Then all of a sudden another pair of these objects appeared in the distance and started to get closer to the first object that remained - then all of a sudden the first object disappeared instantenously.  When the next two objects got to the approximate position of the first they remained constant and then over about 5-10 seconds disappeared. As this was g! oing on, I quickly went over and got our neighbors and told them to look and more importantly confirm what we saw so it could be noticed by someone outside our home.  After it was all said and done, there were ~14 of these objects that came to the same position, always in groups of two, and then vanished into mid-air. There was absolutely zero noise with these objects and they were extremely bright with a reddish/orangish coloring.  Given we live extremely close to Dulles International Airport and have planes from all over the world both military and commercial flying over and around our development, I/we can attest these objects were definitely nothing that were man made given the shear speed, no sound, and brightness. In fact, a plane flew over about 10 minutes after these objects disappeared and you could easily make out the strobes and the sound at 30K+ feet.  This event has definitely made us pause and wonder what will happen next...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was approximately ½ hour before dark, the end of dusk, with my back to the water I looked up in the sky to see an odd occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Knowing Boeing field was directly east of my location I was used to seeing airplanes fly overhead.  I am very aware what they look like in the sky, the sounds they make and which colors their lights put off and how much light each light may glow.  I was very confused to see bright orange orbs in the sky (school bus orange) about as high as a small aircraft would fly above the ground.  I immediately thought it was in fact an airplane however there was no sound and the lights were not the lights on the wing because they were too bright and too far away from each other, as well as too large (the size of large blimps).  I also was alarmed because if they were two different aircrafts then they were flying too close.  I was very confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 3 at first in the shape of an upside down V with the left point extended farther than the two other trailing points.  Then they slowed down and waited for the fourth point to join them that created a diamond shape in the sky and turned sharply and slowly as if not afraid to be seen and headed east toward Boeing field, then over the mountains.  We were able to watch them for a very long time; we visually lost them at dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I originally thought they could have been Chinese lanterns, after the small airplane idea did not make sense, but there is NO WAY the lanterns could have burned this bright and been this large.  I have lit the lanterns before here in Washington and in Hawaii so I know what they look like close and far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note: the radio station 92.9FM that I normally listen too in clarity would not come through that night on the radio I was listening on all night and had listened to 92.9 on it previously.  I have never called or documented any UFO sightings before this and I would like to know what could have made this happen in the sky, I am just curious.  I am one of several people that were very confused by this experience and can’t wait to hear what it really was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You,   J.<n>

The stretch of road I was using goes a North-South direction with a few slight curves in it  (Note:  This is by a small somewhat dried out river bend). I was doing a warm-up jog facing south for about 1/4 mile then turned back to run to my car where I parked it.  I had stretched a bit and then turned south again to start some lunges. I noticed also that it was a very pleasant and nice day out. Late afternoon turning into evening, not a cloud in the sky, beautiful blue sky.  After that realization, I noticed something white in the sky flying on a East-West route completely silent.  That&#39;s what really got my attention on it and I stopped in my tracks and watched it fly by.  From where I was standing, I would guesstimate it to be maybe only 400 ft above me and 500 ft in front of me.  My first thought after gazing on it! and adjusting my eyesight was that it was a drone of some sort.  It looked like it might of had wings but it just seemed blurry...not my sight, but the object itself.  It wasn&#39;t moving very fast at all...maybe 15 mph. I don&#39;t know why there would be a drone flying above the rural countryside of Kansas with the nearest house being close to 5 miles away from my position, so I tried to rule out that it was a drone.  I watched it and even waved at it slightly and eventually it disappeared like it went behind an invisible curtain or something. The thing that struck me as odd was that it was a completely still as it flew by. I don&#39;t recall any wind blowing, hearing any bugs in the grass, or any cows mooing in the distance. I didn&#39;t sense it to be anything malevolent, I was calm when watching it fly by. Couldn&#39;t tell if there were any lights on it because it was still daylight.<n>

My children were playing with a bouquet of balloons and a large (probably 15&#34; x 4&#34;) cylindrical helium filled balloon broke free and rapidly began to ascend.  People see a lot of orbs and spheres and this is one that we can effectively rule as &#34;identified.&#34;.  I wanted to file a report out of respect for the purity and importance of the research that you do.  I think it&#39;s very possible that you might receive some sightings because of the balloon&#39;s startling altitude which I&#39;m guessing was at least 1,500 feet.  The balloon traveled in a pure westerly direction at 5-10mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No reports, yet, but we are grateful to the source of this report for sharing the information.

I have been shooting photographs and videos of some very strange extraterrestrial phenomena here near my home ever since my first UFO sighting in July of 2010.   I began publishing my experiences and content first on YouTube and then finally on my own website Alien Reality (www.alienreality.net).  Normally I do not submit my experiences to reporting sites like yours or Mufon. This particular sighting however was so significant to me that I simply felt compelled to not only publish it but to officially report it to the appropriate agencies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mid week last week I submitted an official report to MUFON (as I had done only one other time on another matter) and they have thus far completely ignored me.  Unreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contact me at your convenience.  This is an absolutely true and factual retelling of what happened to me and the media I shot is entirely genuine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((personal information deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This last Saturday, August 18 at about a quarter till one in the afternoon I managed to witness and record what to me is among the most amazing things I have ever had the privilege to view. I had made arrangements to go over to a friend’s house that afternoon and right prior to leaving I was doing some chores in my backyard and noticed that the clouds that day were particularly thick and many were shaped very oddly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to retrieve my camera and once outside again I began snapping photos. Suddenly, a bit behind me to the west I saw what appeared to be a flying or tumbling black object.  The moment it registered in my head that this was all sorts of unusual, the object was directly overhead. It was traveling rather quickly despite its awkward tumbling and occasional diving motions.  Soon afterwards it was to the east of me and that is when I began to snap photographs of this thing that I had just seen in the sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that this was a trash bag or some other sort of debris flying in the sky which sometimes happens on a windy day.    However, that thought quickly left as I continued photographing.  The shape and structure of this thing was not at all like a trash bag or other paper or plastic trash.  It appeared to be box-like to some extent or it seemed more rigid than a bag would be blowing in the wind.  It also tumbled as it flew past and onward and dove occasionally but not very far or for very long.  The entire time it flew it was actually escalating in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to shoot about six shots that afternoon and towards the end of my encounter I shot about 15 seconds or so of video using the MPEG setting on my still camera.  Reviewing my shots on my camera’s LCD I was excited that I had managed to capture something that was clearly unusual at a minimum and potentially monumental on the far side of that equation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had captured it seemed a low flying alien craft that was no more than 200 feet off the ground and if it wasn’t alien in origin it certainly had to be some sort of secret governmental drone device.  But as I stated earlier I was expected at a friends house in the neighboring town and I was already late so I left my things alone and went off till early evening to do something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back I put my card in the card reader and extracted the photos that I had taken earlier.  As I was able to blow up the photos I took extremely closely I was shocked at what I saw.  The photos that I had the good fortune to capture earlier that afternoon were not of any debris or trash flying in the sky.  That is clearly the case as even if a case could be made for that as the object in the photos there was barely any wind that day at all.  A slight breeze of 5 mph was what was recorded for Saturday.   That was not enough wind to carry around anything let alone catapult a large squarely shaped trash bag ever upward.  I was mistaken earlier that was for certain in describing the object as some sort of craft or ship. It was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo reveals a living creature flying in the air that resembles an amphibian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photos reveal that what I saw and photographed that day was a living being; seemingly as alive as me or you and he was clearly not from here.  The being in the sky that I photographed had an amphibian or reptile-like appearance with a very large mushroom shaped head, large eyes and a large mouth.  His head was disproportionately larger than his body which I saw clearly was comprised of a pair of legs and arms.  His back seemed to be sheathed, resembling an armadillo of sorts and as the pictures indicate he is capable of enfolding himself into himself potentially for protection or possibly navigation.  In his left hand he held what must be a wand or stick with a very bright light ball at the end.  Finally, this creature had a tail that was visible and pointed downward even when he was folded into his sheath as you can see in the later photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still in awe of this experience and count it to be among the most profound of my now 49 years.  As I write this it is my birthday and I simply couldn’t have asked the universe for a better present.  The profound nature of these photos is what astonishes me and even now I simply cant’ put my mind around it.  We are indeed no longer alone in the cosmos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is direct photographic proof that alien creatures exist and that as I have been stating all along; they are here.  I understand that there will be naysayers and those who seek to poke holes in this material and in me and to them I say “bring it on.” I will meet you at any time or any place to debate not only the veracity of my experience but also of the pristine condition of these photographs the originals of which have been safely backed up offline.  These photos are not and were not altered in any way with the exception of enlargement in order to see this low flying creature.  I will make copies of these master photos available to anyone who wishes to view them as I did initially.  They are real and as sure as I am alive and present this is the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May the truth of this information and the profundity of its ramifications resonate in your heart and all of our hearts.  May this not cause anyone to be afraid or angry or war-like in their approach.  The time for that old paradigm is past and will shortly be forever buried as we embark on a new era of understanding of ourselves and the universe around us.<n>

Clear baby blue sky saw a flying object. Initially I thought it was an airplane it was very shiny I remember because that is what captured my attention.   It was so reflective and silver that it looked like the airplane had it&#39;s lights on.  The shape was of the object unclear because of the distance  Upon watching the object maneuver it became obvious that it was not an airplane. It seemed to have the capability to move up and down not just forward.  My friend, who was driving at the time also noticed the object and asked me what is that? All of a sudden the aircraft vanished as if someone threw a sheet over it to hide it. It did not fade off into the distance as an airplane would.  This disappearance happened within a matter of 3 seconds into the clear blue sky.<n>

8/18/12 02:05|Aptos|CA|Sphere|40 minutes|12 objects observed on Monterey Ca coast|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91966.html|380|ndxe201208| 12 objects observed on Monterey Ca coast<n> <n><n> <n><n> Husbands report of sighting on 8/18/2012 at Aptos, CA near the Monterey Bay   My wife woke me about 2:15 A.M. and said to hurry out to the back deck to look at something strange in the sky.  I immediately went out on the deck and looked to the Southwest toward the Ocean.  (Later verified as 266 degrees SW)   There I saw 12 orange lights in a pattern 3 across at the top, then the next 4 was to the right, then 4 down in a straight line.  There could have been another below the tree line.  They were stationary, but while I was watching the pattern shifted a couple of times, but was still stationary.  It was very quiet and we did not hear any engine noise. They all started to slowly move away towards the NE and went behind a tall Redwood tree in my neighbor’s yard.   I then went to the door on the N end of the house and could see them moving away to NE and they disappeared about 2:40 A.M.  My wife said she had looked out about 2:05 A.M. so they were in view for about 35 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each of the objects looked to be about one half the size of the moon in the early morning sky.  I would guess the size was equivalent to 8 morning stars.  The shape was spherical.   We live on the Rio Del Mar side of Aptos about 800 yards from the Ocean and I estimate the objects were about another 800 yard over the Ocean, or approximately a mile from the house.  The elevation here is 82 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Wife’s report of sighting on 8/18/2012 at Aptos, CA near the Monterey Bay:  At approximately 2:05 A. M. on Saturday morning August 18/2012, I looked outside and saw several bright orange lights just above the tree tops out over the Ocean. They were almost due West.  When I walked outside some more rose over the tree tops. I saw 12 in all. They moved around some, but at first they were in a pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in and woke my husband and we watched for a total of about 40 minutes and they started to move away slowly and disappeared to the Northeast.<n>

They were not in any precise formation, but appeared to be all along the same plane.  They were off the 50 west side of the freeway, varying from 200 to 500 feet off the ground. They were extremely bright (yellowish light).  They were completely stationary, not bobbing in the wind, and appeared motionless.  I slowed to about 35 MPH in the fast lane, and several other vehicles were slowed to the same speed or less, and I assume they were looking at the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light passing fast overhead caught my eye as I was looking at the orbs. It was like a satellite or falling falling star.  The falling star was no where near the orbs, and appeared to be in space, but it added to the excitement of what I was seeing.  The orbs were so bright I could not make out any kind of structural properties (like being a solid craft or not).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 42, and this is ! my first ever UFO sighting.<n>

During this sighting, there was a big lighting storm to the south of these objects and I saw at least 6 &#34;shooting stars&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second appeared I then saw a third and eventually at least 6 of these objects, which they were all in perfect lines in triangle patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch these objects until they were covered by clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the sighting might have occurred on Sunday morning, August 19, 2012.

I happened to look up very slight to the west sky (estimate angle of view 20 degrees from vertical/directly overhead) and saw a number of red/orange balls of light ‘floating’ at unknown altitude in the direction of the wind (NNW), but more quickly than the light breeze.  Initially, there were some half dozen or more in my line of sight.  At least one suddenly disappeared, as if a switch was thrown.  I did not see any flashing of lights; only a steady red/orange glow.  The size of the balls were similar to if one were to hold their hand straight out from their face holding a dime against the sky.  They all appeared to be the same size, suggesting also same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking to the NNW sky, I saw many of these same objects approaching and flowing in steady procession, most of which were in line, however several were to either side of the main line.  The procession continued for several minutes.  Their speed appeared constant, with a velocity that would cause one to traverse the entire sky, horizon to horizon, in perhaps one minute.  Again, they were all of similar size and color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke my wife, and she witnessed three of the objects in full view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first procession/grouping that I witnessed numbered approximately 50 or more.   The time span of this was about 5 to 8 minutes, and my wife caught the very last of these.  A few minutes later I returned outside to take another view of the sky and saw several more before they all disappeared, and I saw no more of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While outside with my wife, I witnessed a bright flash of white light in the north sky.  By bright, I mean it was a quick, intense flash, as if a light bulb suddenly burned out and ‘flashed.’ I happened to be looking right at that particular area of sky at that moment, as that is where the procession of red/orange objects originated from.  There was no evidence of any planes in that area of the sky.  After the flash of light (which I can only liken to a camera flash), there was no more activity I saw in that area of the sky. It was the only flash I saw.  I am at a loss to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were completely silent.  I could not (nor could my wife) hear anything at all that resembled propeller or jet aircraft noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a 3 watt LED flashlight with me when I was viewing the objects, prior to awakening my wife.  At one point prior to my wife arriving outside, I saw a ‘shadow’ floating overhead, and I immediately put my flashlight upon it.  This flashlight is bright, but it is a small hand held light with perhaps only a 150 meter effective range.  I was able to place the light directly upon the shadow and illuminate the underside of it.  It appeared to be a flat, disk shaped object, but oddly the trailing edge seemed to have more of a heart shaped appearance (e.g. a stencil heart that a child might draw with a pencil).   This object was very low, given my light’s ability to cast light upon it.  It vanished a mere two seconds after I put light upon it.  I did not see where it went; it simply vanished from view.  At the time, it had passed directly over me, and was moving quickly toward the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in the traffic pattern/approach to an airport, to the west of my home.  Air traffic never comes over from north to south, and I am quite aware of what airplanes in the night sky look and sound like from the ground.  These were not planes.  I have never before seen anything like this.  Nor has my wife.<n>

I crossed the insercetion at Westheimer , and my attention was drawn to the lights , of an incoming aircraft.  The plane&#39;s flight path was from the West of Motrose heading roughly Southeast on a Glide Path, for Hobby Airport Houston , Texas, as it&#39;s most likely destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the inbound aircaft, which I estimate was at an altitude of around 4 or 5 thousand feet, I noticed 2 more objects flying , in parallel formation to eachother , in a direction of South to North , just West of Montrose.  They were at an estimated altitude of 10 to 15 thousand feet.  The night was partly cloudy and the stars were very visible in the background.  The objects were much larger than any star or planetary obect in the background, but far smaller than a full moon. I fairly certain on my estimations of distance and altitude.  The size noted, was maybe 1/20th the diameter of a normal full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One aircraft, the most easterly of the 2 , was slightly in the lead. The objects were not moving at an exceptional rate of speed.  They were steady in flight characteristics, on a straight and level flight path. Both were uniform in color, though , the color observed , was a dull reddish orange glow, pointing perpendicular to the ground. The colors and round shape of the orange glow, reminded me of the shape and color of after-burners on a jet, but not as intense. There was a dull outer ring of orange next ring was darker and center of object again a dull orange. It is possible , these were a type of vertical lift for the propulsion system of the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I observed the objects maintain a consistent and steady flight path, the trailing object began to slow fade to black.  This did not take more than a few second.  The leading object followed in this fade to black procedure.  At that point neither object could be observed in the sky.  At no point did I ever note any lighting consistent with Civilian or Military Aircraft.  I do note that the area the objects began to fade in was clear of clouds, stars were visible, and was maybe a mile or 2 away , as the bird flies.  The entire episode did not last more than a couple of minutes .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he struck us as being quite level-headed and objective in his description of his sighting.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD))<n>

Entity moved from NW to SE for about a minute, then made a right-angle turn to the south. Travel path was &#39;jagged&#39; rather than straight. Because our spot was surrounded by tall trees, viewing time was limited.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I said its got to be the iss so we looked up on iss tracking and iss was going from NW to SE this one was going From SW to NE any thoughts on this ???  the only difference since the last report is that it&#39;s an hour earlier but exactly the same path as before. very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It blows my mind that there aren&#39;t more people from Pendleton on here cause this is a constant occurance, the big ones are HUGE! My daughter was home in July from the Army and saw them and freaked she thought it was an alien invasion because there were so many, but after 3 am they just go away. I called the FAA in Nashville which is the location that is in charge of Indiana flight paths, they said nothing but normal commercial flights are in the sky, well, these are NOT commercial flights!  They apparently do not show up on radar, but, he said they had a large number of calls from Indiana lately.  It is either Drones being silly or I am insane and it is a true UFO.  If you live in the Pendleton area please watch at night and post on here so we can compare info.

Slowly Vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 35Yr. Old Male, Father, Husband.  Outside smoking a cig on my front porch.  Just started doing this 2 months ago when we got news were pregnant again (our 2nd).  I&#39;ve been using this time to stare at the stars and honestly bask in what I see as God&#39;s beautiful creation.  I&#39;m a life long Christian that doesn&#39;t rule out UFO&#39;s/Aliens b/c I find comfort in knowing mankind truly doesn&#39;t have all the knowledge of our Lords magnitude.  No drugs, No boose, just cigs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed multiple (3) airplanes flying overhead that night as per the norm during the first cig, and saying thank you Jesus as I looked from star to star giving Him the glory.  Sets my soul at ease anywho.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> While doing this for one set of stars (3*) above my neighbors house (NE) for a couple of minutes or 1/2 cigarette. Spending about 1 minute thank the Lord for each one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the 3rd star and did the same.  Just a few seconds later I then noticed it, the &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; (round) start to slowly move north.  Separating itself from the other 2 apparently out of nowhere, meaning it was fixed in the sky while looking at the other two.  It was equal to size, color, and intensity as the other two stars that stayed put.  After about 2 minutes of it slowly moving I noticed it began to become darker, as if the power was cut in half to the light (absolutely no flashing, no color other than white, no flickering).  Then the last minute it maintained the same speed and simply disappeared.  No clouds in the sky.  No ridge line to block view.  The thought to be star for 3 minutes before movement simply disappeared 3 total minutes later. It wasn&#39;t a shooting star.  I have seen plenty of those in my lifetime, nor a airplane.  They are starkly different of course to my description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This makes just the second time in my life I&#39;ve ever had such an experience.  I was 7 years old when something similar to this happened to me before but it was during the day.  Although I did see the &amp;quot;cigar shaped&amp;quot; slow flying object reported here locally about 2 weeks ago as well I was told it was a chinese satellite re-entering the orbit by a classmate and wrote it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist that&#39;s scared of stuff I don&#39;t understand.  Just wanted to share this with someone other than my wife.  Take care guys-gals and God Bless.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I punched a clock at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before entering my car, at exactly 22:00, my attention was diverted upward to the sky,to watch a three fast moving large orange, round balls of light, with one out in the front lead and two more following, pretty close and side by side, less than ¼ mile behind the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then observed the first one’s light becoming smaller, as it moved a great distance, very quickly, in a straight level flight pattern, becoming dimmer and smaller and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to maintain a constant speed but grew smaller and smaller and then I was unable to see any light at all. The light dimmed smaller than the surrounding stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two that were following, did the same thing. They were bright and big, then dimmer and then not observable any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the first group of three was disappearing, another group of three came in, one out in front, with two more trailing and did exactly the same sequence of events. They were just flying straight and appeared larger than an airplane and such a different color and a bright ball similar to a sodium street light, kind of an orange.  There was a little twinkling and at one time, I thought I could see like a red strobe, perhaps is the best way to describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my astonishment, this groups of orange balls, totaled to about 9 groups, or about 23-27 objects, going from the North, over Cleveland Road, to the South, and disappeared, as if it reached out of sight very, very fast, as it got smaller and dimmer and then invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another gentleman, who pulled into the same parking lot, and was observing them, he got out of his car, opened his trunk, and then drove off without conversing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the sighting to the South Bend Police Department at 24:00, and they said that no one else reported seeing them, that I was the first.  I do not understand that no one else saw what I have seen, as God is my witness.<n>

It traveled down at an angle from south to north at a fairly slow, steady pace.  After a few moments it became less bright and changed to an orange color.  It then changed it path and began traveling horizontal at a much slower pace and became dimmer.  It slowed to a stop and stayed in place for a few moments and then disaperared.<n>
8/17/12 21:34|Aliso Viejo|CA|Fireball|30 seconds|Fireball approaching earth, changing direction and disappearing into the clouds.|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91909.html|396|ndxe201208| Fireball approaching earth, changing direction and disappearing into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of our children in the neighborhood came running up to my neighbor saying, “Oh my God daddy that thing is going to crash”.  Both myself and the neighbor heard the other children yelling as well.  I looked up and saw a plane and pointed it out to the boy.  He said “not that” and then he pointed in another direction, “THAT”.  When we looked in the other direction (Our location - 33 degrees 34’ 1’’ N, 117 degrees 44’2’’ W Looking 264 degrees West – approximately 10-15 thousand feet) there was a fire ball that was approaching earth moving what I would say to be about 200 – 300 mph.…difficult to tell.  It was not coming straight down it was going from right to left glowing yellow and white.  It was getting closer and not further away.  If a Cartesian coordinating system was held up to the sky it would going from 2,3 towards 0.  See below:  Figure 1   (1)	(&#34;Cartesian coordinate system,&#34; 16 August 2012 at 18:35, p. 1)  The intensity of the fireball grew and then seemed to calm down followed by another rise in intensity.  I asked my neighbor if he was seeing the same thing I was and he said, “ya, what is that?” he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that the fire ball seemed to slow down.  An air craft was approaching the same area that the fire ball appeared to be in but because of depth perception issues it may have simply been flying underneath it.  The air craft was coming from the south moving towards 359 degrees N at a slow speed.   After the fireball stopped, it went back into the clouds going up the “y” axis (see figure [2])   Figure 2   After this it disappeared into the cloud cover.  This was captured on my I-phone, but the quality is poor when we played it back on a big screen TV.  The entire episode lasted about 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time was similar in nature about 5 minutes after but lasted only about 15 seconds with more witnesses as previously mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8195; References Cartesian coordinate system.

About 2130 hrs, I decided to take my dog for his nightly walk, and , as we were returning back to the house, I noticed a formation of approximately 7 or 8 blue-white lights, oval shaped, heading at a high rate of speed, in something like an octagonal formation.  My neighbors were out and witnessed the same formation, and we discussed what ehy could be.  There was absolutely no sound, the darkness from the power outage made for a clear and undistorted viewing.  As they flew in a northwesterly direction, several of the shapes changed position in a rapid, darting movement, at sharp angles, before disappearing into the distance.  I continued down the street, and encountered 2 other neighbors, who had also seen the same lights.  They also reported hearing no sound from the objects, even though they appeared to be at a low altitude, perhaps 2000-3000 ft. At  th! e end of the block , several people were outside, discussing the power outage and the work of the power company crew making repairs.  At about this time, roughly 10 minutes after observing the formation of lights, 3 more lights streaked overhead, in a single file formation, 2 close together and the &amp;quot;tail end Charlie&amp;quot; at a greater distance back, moving at an even higher rate of speed to catch up.  They were travelling at speeds much faster than military or civilian aircraft, and made no sound of any kind. As the first two travelled off in the same northwesterly direction as the earlier objects, they split off 90 degrees from each other and appeared to come to a hover, allowing the 3rd object to catch up, and then all 3 disappeared at something like warp speed. I could make out no clear shape, but they appeared more oval than round, and there were no running lights of any kind, just blue-white ovals travelling at mach type speeds.<n>

The object did not appear to be floating or falling.  The object appeared to be approximately 300 to 500 feet above our heads.  It was basically round in shape but did appear to slightly change form.  It was an amber colored object that appeared to have subtle changes in its hues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it traveled north for approximately two minutes it changed direction and then traveled up and directly away from us.  I could tell it was moving away and not standing still as it slowly got smaller until it disappeared.  It appeared that the object never changed speeds nor did it appear to be affected by any wind or air currents.  None of us heard any noise emitting from the object.<n>

When it had travelled over our house we saw  an airplane flying towards it, the object then seemed to lose brightness and turn almost yellow while getting smaller and flickering a few ties then disappeared.    I could see a small orange light a few times just for a second then nothing.<n>

Its movement, or path, was unusual, in that it appeared to move forward (towards us) and then veered sideways, was rather erratic, not completely smooth in its track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, its speed wasn&#39;t that of any object with which we were familiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continue to move like that, now in a southerly direction, and moved away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it until it was out of our sight, hidden by trees and the mere fact that the distance between us and the object became too great.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have pictures on our phones.<n>

Object appeared as a small orange light and seemed to be on fire as it flickered in intensity.  No other lights were seen on the object.  A Southwest Airlines 737, on the downwind leg for Runway 23 at Providence was trailing the object at less than 1 mile and at the same altitude.  I estimated the speed of the object to be around 160-190 knots.  I was able to judge the speed because the Southwest jet was keeping pace with it and then start to overtake it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was observed for about 30 seconds before suddenly disappearing.

My son and I were listening to an Irish/Celtic band called Comas at the Main Stage (they have 5).  My son hits me, points left and says &amp;quot;Look at that.&amp;quot;  I am confused as to exactly what direction I am looking (definitely south, probably west - leaning to east). Just over the tree line was an orange/red orb. Definitely much bigger than a star – probably at least a hundred times bigger than a star.  Imagine a watch battery, cut into quarters and that was the size in our view. It hovers, then it moves parallel to the left. Then it arcs up and to the right.  It hovers.  Then it arcs down and to the right. Then it zooms directly left to its original spot that we saw it. Then it shoots diagonally to the right.  It continues this unusual pattern for the next 5 minutes.  Then another orange/red orb appears below and to the left of the fir! st one.  It moves to the right and then both of them disappear below the tree line not to show up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In order to validate this, I tapped the shoulder of the guy next to me on the hill and asked him and his date to look up. They definitely saw it move, but declined to acknowledge anything and responded by whispering something in each other’s ear. Probably something about this nutcase next to them! The two appeared again within 5 minutes and then disappeared. My son and I couldn’t imagine that anybody else could not have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS this happened during an electrical storm. Heavy rain pursued.<n>

I looked up, above our apartment complex, and directly overhead I saw an extremely bright red light.  It was not an airplane (my husband is an airplane buff) because there was no defined shaped or night lights, nor was it a meteor or comet because it had no tail, nor firework debris because it did not descend.  We stood on the sidewalk and watched this strange light travel slowly eastward.  At one point it seemed to hover and then turned to the east.  As it traveled eastward, the light dimmed and then total blackness.  No sign of it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought that would be a cool picture and took out the camera I always have with me and snapped a picture the time stamp on the photo was 11:29:29.  Nine seconds later I snapped another one as the nose of the blimp had dipped down the time stamp on this one was 11:29:38.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I opened the picture up on my computer and saw the photos there was an object in the first picture behind the blimp but the second picture only had the blimp.  The camera [a Sony DSC T-10, 7.2 mp] was set at the highest resolution 7.2 mega pixels and was at maximum zoom, I do this regularly for distant photos so they can be magnified again on the computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I realized that there was something behind the blimp I zoomed in on that portion of the image just shy of having it go mosaic and have not been able to identify what it is.  But it does look like a lot of photos I’ve seen on the internet.  If you look closely there seems to be a pinkish haze around the object.  Maybe an energy field?   It should be noted that commercial air traffic is regularly in the air space in the direction I was looking.  T F Green Airport [Warwick Rhode Island] is approximately 6 miles south from the position I snapped the photos from.  I only took the photos because the blimp was so clear and in a cloudless sky.  I saw nothing in the sky but the blimp when I took the picture.  It would be difficult to estimate the distance of the blimp from my position but I would take a stab at one to two miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I do not have any photo enhancing software to see the image through filters as often shown on the internet but maybe someone else could do this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The play began at 8:00 p.m. under a somewhat cloudy sky threatening rain later on. At about 8:15p.m.-8:30p.m., an object between two trees to my right appeared in the sky above tree level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about the size of my hand with my arm extended toward it, an equilateral triangle in shape, dome-shaped white lights formed a row around the inside dark perimeter of the triangle with a red dome light in the center. Against the grey cloudy sky the object was solid and a darker black-grey reminding me of the skin of the Stealth Plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved from the N/NW going in a S/SE direction. I lost sight of it behind two trees, but it re-appeared again about 60 seconds later. It seemed to be traveling rather slowly and flat so the visible area was the triangle with the lights below which stayed on continuously. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved beyond my vision and though I watched the sky the remainder of the play until @ 9:15 p.m., I didn’t observe any other unusual occurrence. I was amazed at the lack of response by the people around me who clearly saw the object then just continued to watch the play.  A woman next to me said she saw the object and thought it was “just a UFO.”<n>

About 30 minutes later when we had arrived home(still confused and pale faced) we both sat down in different rooms and made a drawing of what we saw.  Both pictures were quite simple and similar. We later talked about details and came to the agreement that it had no lights and little detail.  Since it was dark and we were doing freeway speeds we only saw it for about 3 seconds to watch it disappear into a valley with houses behind the blocking guard rail.<n>

I was able to take photo with my GSM but, wether or not the photo is of use remains to be seen.   I am fully coversed with the tricks that some people use to ?? prove a UFO point! but I do not want to prove anything.  Other than what I saw tonight.   Fascinating that it was it was not an aircraft, unless it was totally engulfed in flames.  Which is not what I saw!  This report is sent to you with a sincere intention.

The light was slightly brighter (about 15/20%) than the stars I was looking at and was heading west along the same line of sight.  I stopped walking to watch this light thinking is was probably a plane which may have changed direction and began heading toward me (as I live on a direct flight path to an international airport) as the light became brighter (10/15%)and slightly larger, then stopped, then turned a sort of slight bluish/white and dimmed as if to blend in with the stars I was looking at and finally the light completely faded out (all within about 7 seconds).  I stood there on my street watching this area to see if I could locate any blinking lights afterward for about a minute and saw absolutely nothing (no white/green or red bli! nking lights) that you would find on a plane had it turned it&#39;s main light off.  There are some clouds out tonight but there were none in the area of the sky I was watching.  Most commercial planes not heading to New Orleans airport will follow this flight path along I-12 toward Houston as I see them all the time; however, I&#39;ve never witnessed one of them becoming larger and brighter, stopping, dimming to a different color and then fading out altogether.  I can rule this out as a sighting of the ISS as I have witnessed this pass over my area several times and this light was nowhere near as large/bright nor was it coming from the proper direction (usually ISS passes from my NW to my SE).  Lastly, I am very familiar with the star Sirius in the sky and this light was much farther North nor is Sirius in my visibility at the hour that I witnessed this light not to mention that Sirius is also visible for hours in my area when it is out (not 7 seconds).  I have seen thousands of p! lanes flying over my area both AM &amp; PM and never had witnessed! one wit h these unusual properties.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I observed this for over four weeks now.  Some of the nights it is like we have Airforce planes over the same area patroling is what i think.  Yes, some look as if they are either satelites or planes, but its the star like orbs that move in any direction.  On two seperate nights, i have witnessed a triangle shaped ships.  It was sunset after a storm i looked up from my porch and seen a light but when i focused it was a triangle shaped objects i tried to get my phone and when back fast but was unable to get a good picture of it, it was a strange but i seen it blast away or something like in a movie. It was a erie way that it looked, it was like it had rocket boosters but i was gone in a second.  I dnt know but every night im seeing somthing and im not sure what to think.  I am only a skeptic but i&#39;ve become concerned because this is happening everynight.  Hope it! s the government and not what i think.<n>

My friend and I were the last two awake. While sipping on hot chocolate and deep in conversation I was staring off at the stars. I was looking at the big dipper and the area around it when all of the sudden a orange/gold ball of light slightly larger than the star it was next to (Dubhe) appeared in the sky.  I watched as it zagged to the right and down slightly, then back to the left and down slightly, then off to the right again before it disappeared.  It moved fairly slowly and almost seamed to be vibrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to my friend and told her what I had just witnessed. We moved our chairs from under the tree so we could get a better view of the sky.  Within a minute or two of moving our chairs we saw another ‘appear’ travel a slightly erratic path from left (roughly west) to the right (roughly northeast), again it appeared to vibrate as it moved slowly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat out watching the sky for a little! over an hour. Within that time we saw a total of 5 objects of the same description appearing from seemingly no where traveling in the same direction, vibrating through the night sky and disappearing.  There was no sound; there were all the same color and mostly the same size. We saw satellites, planes, and meteors that night. None of them looked like the strange orange balls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning my nephew came over to our camp kitchen and reported seeing the same thing. He described what he saw the same way, even the direction and reference to the ‘big dipper star’.  That evening, a mutual friend reported seeing 4 of the same objects in roughly the same sky locations at the same time in the next town over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately the next two nights of camping were under cloudy skies and we were not able to catch anything else.<n>

As we watched them, they would get really dim, almost to the point where you couldn&#39;t see them, and then they would get really bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 1 minute of watching this, they started to move rather than float in one spot.  They moved in two perfect circles around each other still getting dimming and brightening.  As they made the second circular motion, they got as bright as they had ever been and vanished in a blink of an eye into the dark sky without a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I had multiple cans to put out so I made two trips.  On the first trip out I noticed an unusually bright object in the ESE sky.   At first I thought that the object might be a planet such as Venus but it was much larger and much, much brighter than anything I had ever seen in the sky before.  It seemed to be glowing.   It was fairly low, perhaps fifteen degrees above the horizon.   I stared at it for at least fifteen seconds to see if it was moving or not, to see if it was an airplane, but it did not move at all.   I immediately thought to go get my binoculars to get a closer look but first I went back into my garage to get the next recycling can.   When I returned to the end of my driveway, so I could see around a tree that blocks th! e view from the house, the object was gone.   No signs of it were around anywhere.  I immediately went inside to alert my mom and grab a pair of binoculars.   We returned outside but there was still nothing.<n>

She was pointing upward while looking stretching to look backward in her beach chair.  At this time I quickly glanced up while noticing my sister also looking and several other movie watchers looking and pointing up.  I started observing what I assumed would be planes or helicopters, 6 in total, but because it was so dark and no outline was visible, I couldnt figure out what they were.  I then started to look at the lights, figuring there would be a flashing pattern of some kind.  There was no flashing, rather a steady stream of orange light that looked foggy for lack of better words.  This was not due to the weather as it was a clear enough night where the lights were sharp as was observed simultaneously as a smaller plane, headed north east, was very sharp like an led bulb.  It was easy! to look at that plane and see what it was and gauge an elevation and direction of flight, but these other things just kind of hung there for awhile and one by one disappeared from sight.  They seemed very close as if they were hovering only a few hundred feet above the shore line alike a coastguard helicopter, but there was no sound.  Best description I could give is saucer shaped with orange lights that spanned the circumference like was similar to a burning oil lamp.  I didn&#39;t take a picture or video for a number or reasons: other people were already doing so, I was trying to figure out what they were, I was mesmerized and didn&#39;t want to look away, figured eventually I would see it was just a plane as I didn&#39;t exspect them to vanish and not into a cloud or the horizon they just blinked away.<n>

It was very white and bright. It&#39;s direction was Northerly toward the constellation Leo and it was about 35 degrees above the horizon. The light had no aircraft lights, no blinking light such as military aircraft have when I notice their aircraft passing over where I live. The craft was proceeding fairly rapidly, taking only about two minutes to go from Orion to Leo. Then the object was much lower on the horizon and seemed to turn due East and in a few seconds  the light disappeared. I ran to my house to get my binoculars, as my telescope was behind a fence and not in the line of sight of the object, but I could not find a pair fast enough, and I did not want to miss the sighting, so I watched unaided as best I could, and saw the light, as I said, disappear in the East. Aircraft I have seen in my lifetime, flyi! ng at night, have blinking lights and do not have the luminosity that this object had, and it was a steady,bright light, not changing, except at the last seconds as it disappeared in the East, in the first, faint traces of the Suns earliest glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Tried to see them through binoculars,but not any light was picked up.  Then they were gone.  Also, when I went outside to see better there was a very eerie sound that kept repeating.  It was nothing I have ever heard before and was very creepy.  Just monotone, not quite a word, over and over.  It creeped me out<n>

This night turned out to be different. I noticed there was much activity in the sky after I had already seen three shooting stars and two flashes of light. I dozed off after a 15 hour shift at work outside on back porch.  As soon as I opened my eyes upon awaking, I was surprised to see an aircraft not to high from me that contained a total of 3 giant white lights in triangular form.  The aircraft hovered until it was right above me, stopped, then picked up speed until it zoomed away so fast as my eyes followed it in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I continued to gaze upward for maybe five minutes, suddenly this dark object flies over me about 50 to 80 feet above the trees. It was not moving super fast, maybe 80 klm an hour, so I was able to get a good look at it. It was about the size of a small school bus. It was rectangular in shape,not square,with rounded edges.The underbody was rough looking,not smooth,and it had 2 very dim lights.One on each end that looked amber like the coals in the fire.It made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no smoke trail, no wind,nothing. To be honest with you,it looked like a flying rock,and no I wasn&#39;t drinking and I don&#39;t use drugs.So believe it or don&#39;t believe it,but I know what I saw and that&#39;s good enough for me.

8/15/12 23:00|Alexandria|VA|Fireball|1 minute|11 yellowish/red/orange spheres slowly moving over Alexandria Va, multiple witnesses.|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93127.html|437|ndxe201208| 11 yellowish/red/orange spheres slowly moving over Alexandria Va, multiple witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was in Old Town Alexandria in Virginia around 11pm.  While taking a cigarette break behind my work, I noticed a light between the tall buildings. It was floating slowly through the sky and was comparable in shape and brightness to any of those glowing ufos you see on you tube, or a plane/helicopter with a bright light. I have seen strange lights in Dumfries, VA, as well, but I always attribute them to Quantico Marine base which is not far away. The lights I see always end up having a blinking light somewhere on them as well. This is what confused me about the objects I saw, it was absent of any blinking lights. The color was also odd, it seemed to have an orange hue.  It did not look like a flaming fireball, but the color reminded me of one. It had no smoke or trail behind it, but glowed constantly. The trajectory was fairly constant, slightly rising as it went between the buildings. My line of sight is down a/an alley/street that is made for ca! rs to come in and out of the parking garages. The alley/street is flanked on both sides with the rear of the tall hotels. The street starts at the back of the my building and ends at a road with large building across the street, therefore, my line of sight is limited. There was no noise. I was intrigued by the odd attributes of the object, so I started wandering in the middle of the alley away from my co-workers. I could figure out the type of aircraft it was, so I called over to one of my co-workers so he could come see it. We were looking at it and could not identify the craft. As we were watching, another light came into view. It looked and moved the same. We then witnessed about three more I believe.  It was a very interesting sight, watching the orange glowing objects slowly floating. I finished my cigarette and radioed my coworker, posted out front, to make sure he was doing ok without me. He said he was fine. I didn’t mention the lights over the walkie-talkie. I walk! ed in the back door, through the lobby, and out the front to m! y co-wor ker. You can see a bit more of the sky due to the bigger street out front. I still  could not see any of the lights in the sky out front, so I asked him if he saw anything weird while I was out back. I didn’t prompt him by adding “in the sky.” He said he saw a bunch of lights in the sky. What amazed me was that he said he witnessed at least eleven of these objects. There must have been some lower flying objects blocked by the building at the end of the street that I could not see. The other possibility is that I witnessed the end of the event, and only saw the last few. There are a few explanations that can be used for this event. The lights could be ET crafts or etra-dimensional crafts. If they are one of those two possibilities; then it seems like they were showing themselves off to us, based on the slow speed and staggered formation. Another thought is that they were Chinese floating lanterns for a funeral or something, I am not sure when it is customary to let off those ! “sky lanterns.” I looked up news on the internet for an event that would let them off. I believe it may be illegal to do sky lanterns anyway, so that may debunk that explanation. It seemed to be a bigger object farther away, rather than small lanterns closer. It could not have been a balloon and be lit up the way it was. My coworker who was out back tried to say they were meteors in the distance from a meteor shower happening starting at 1am that night. They could not be meteors going that slow and horizontal across the sky, unless I am mistaken. He will just not admit that he has no idea what it is and can’t explain it. I hope you mention this sighting next time you are on Coast to coast am. I feel like if you say something on c2c, then other people from Alexandria may come forward. I submitted this to you because the story of the gentleman seeing the fireball reminded me of the color that I saw. Thank you very much, I wish you were taking phone calls tonight. You should h! ave a longer segment sometime to take sightings on the air. Th! ank you again, and sorry for the novel, but it took more than a few words to get the thought out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was late at night and I stepped out onto my 2nd floor deck that is outside of my bedroom to have a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to my left and I saw some sort of craft flying just above the tree line..but the thing is, the craft was small I thought it might be some kind of drone or something.  It was black and  emitted a red beam.  the best way I can describe the shape is that it looked like the &#34;mother ship&#34; on the movie &#34;independence day&#34;.  And the object was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen other things before at other times, and experienced missing time before with a group of about 25 other people. ..This was a long time ago.

I was gazing at the stars.  As I looked to my left I saw and orange fireball streak across the sky from generally north to south.  It crossed in front of the big dipper, and was visible for approximately 2 seconds.  Also, it appeared to be quite low in the sky; seemingly not too far above the tree tops here in Leavenworth, WA.  This event occurred at approximately 9:44pm PDT. I am aware of some comets that have been visible. Perhaps it was a comet, but I have seen this type of orange fireball before in the Benson, AZ area.<n>

When we backed further away from the house, we saw two more.  The area where they seemed to be is NE of the Buffalo airport, but we&#39;re used to seeing aircraft all the time, and this was really unusual.  It was too late for the setting sun to have illuminated anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dots faded one at a time, while appearing to move slightly.  They weren&#39;t close enough to each other to be connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers were four sober adults in their sixties who don&#39;t believe in UFOs.<n>

Started as one and then split up into four blinking red dots that were in a vertical line.  That circled around chasing after each other for over five minutes.  They combined and flew around the night sky making circlier shapes.  They moved accross the sky and split apart again.  The flying objects made a diamond shape and headed west.  They split up into a straight line and were out of view.  This lasted for about twenty minutes.<n>

It was at a height of approximately 500 feet and it was the speed of the object that initially drew my attention, as this was faster than anything I had seen previously.  The Pennine hills form the horizon to the left, and before reaching these, the light began to descend vertically.  As soon as it began to descend it appeared to be a triangular craft as it now showed three red lights in a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found it most extraordinary that a craft would descend at that point, as there is no airport or similar facility there and it is close to buildings.  Also extraordinary was that it would descend absolutely vertically and at speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate it&#39;s height from the ground at around 500 feet did not see it land as it was obscured from my viewpoint by trees in my next door neighbour&#39;s garden when it reached approx 200 feet.<n>

The unusual thing about it was the contrail was very short and did not stay in the sky, but followed the object.  The object was too small to be visible to us, but was moving from east to west at a rapid speed and eventually disappeared.  To our eyes the contrail was only a few inches long, but was very white.  I have seen many planes with contrails pass over my home, but have never seen one like this.  There was no sound.  It also seemed that the object kept going straight up when it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Behind us there was a lady on her hotel balcony and we asked her if she saw it too and she said she did and described it the exact way that we saw it!<n>

This was NOT an airplane. It flew about the same height as an airplane for approximately 2 minutes.  The craft however flew far too slowly to, in my opinion achieve lift as we understand the properties and physics of flight.  It also made zero, absolutely zero sound.  It was very plain to see that it was silver metallic and had no wings, this further hinders achiving lift, I would suppose. I watched in awe for about 2 minutes until it went out of sight.  I immediately saw and heard later military aircraft in pursuit. I never thought I would get to see a UFO, and I finally did. It is a profound experience that I fully realize I have not yet come close to analyze and let it sink in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As a precaution, I placed an app on his cell phone that would allow me to ping his location and trace him if needed.  Just for fun, my 13 year old son and I decided to test it on the way home... just to see where he was at.  We traced him to a neighborhood about 2 miles from the house, where he was visiting friends.  We honked and waved at him as we passed him sitting in his truck.  We stopped at a stop sign in this very populated neighborhood.  While stopped, a bright green (almost lime green neon) cylinder/capsule shaped object appeared high in the sky.  This object was not moving.  It was just hovering.  After about 5 seconds... it started to move very slowly and then suddenly it flew at a phenomenal speed and suddenly disappeared.  My son looked at me and said, &#34;Dad... did you see that?&#34;  I immediately called my oldest son to see if he or any of his friends saw it.  They didn&#39;t.  I checked the news for t! he next week, and even surfed the net.  Nothing was ever mentioned about anything.  This was only 30 minutes from the largest city in Alabama.  There is no way that we were the only people to see this.  It was not a man made craft.  The only possible thing I believe it could have been (if not alien) is a projected laser in sky.  We aren&#39;t crazy and we don&#39;t stare at the sky looking for UFOs.  I had to estimate the date, but I know it was summer of 2012 and just starting to turn dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was a classic saucer shape like this    ()       Rotated 90 degrees obviously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The skies were totally cloudless and blue and a lot of commercial airline traffic passes across this area and it was at least as high maybe higher as I could not determine the size it being so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to get my camcorder,which had a flat battery and was useless, but when I returned the object had taken on a slight &#34;S&#34; shape but rotated 90 degrees so like this ~.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away briefly and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date for this although I cannot be specific was about August 2012 in the afternoon around 3pm on a warm sunny day and it was stationary  not moving the slightest that I could detect using the house roof as transit line to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a silver object in a similar area of the sky a month later but it was moving and on a saturday and it was more than likely a silver helium balloon from some local event reflecting sunlight unlike the first sighting which definitely wasnt a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Clear sky, no clouds, no vapor trails but possibly some haze that completely obscured very thin wings if any. Other visual and audible clue such as estimated altitude made me expect to see wings but there were absolutely no wings or tails visible  No other aircraft visible but sound of jet was faint but distinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling faster than the sound because of lag time behind visible craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could have been ventriloquist effect since area is corridor for jets high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling at high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appeared to be a light weight glider or dirigible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Profile was high and long but not clear how deep fuselage was hence reminded me of pictures of Predator drones but more regular cigar-shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I spotted it, it seemed to recognize I was watching and moved away from me veering slightly to south each as if bumped by wind only momentarily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moved rapidly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slightly white-aluminum color possible metallic. Hard to tell relative size because of unknown altitude, but impression was that it was large-bodied but very high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Impression was that of a jet-powered Remotely Piloted Vehicle (drone) or piloted glider or lightweight craft with very long, thin wings that were not visible because of altitude. General impression was confusing somewhat because of conflicting phenomena.

The night sky was crystal clear and littered with stars, yet the lights of the craft were distinctive. Five lights were visible at first sight, as the craft traveled North-South at a rate of speed and likeness of motion I can only compare to that of a blimp.  The distance between our vantage point and the object appeared to be very approximately 500-800 feet.  No “engine noise” was present, instead a fluxuating, “whirring”, or “humming” noise seemed to float down from it as it traveled at a very constant elevation (also unusually low for ANY aircraft, seemingly mere hundreds of feet above our treeline).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 1min after the initial sighting, it began to turn, rotate rather, as if on a central axis.  It then began to travel from West-East, at the same rate, &amp; elev.   After traveling another short distance, ( for approx. 1.5 min, )   It appeared to come to a complete stop, hovering in mid-air, as it again rotated on axis 90^.   Now heading due North, (the direction from which it had originally come), it proceeded on its way headed almost directly towards Protection Island, ( +/- 1.5 miles NW of mouth of Discovery Bay).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can distinctly remember being able to hear the wavering hum it emitted for a minute or two after it disappeared from view.<n>

I got my girlfriend out on the deck and she to witnessed it until it passed over our heads then suddenly dissappeared without a trace i have seen the ISS pass overhead before and after eliminating an aircraft because of no flashing light thought it must be the ISS. the only problem with that is that the sky is clear no clouds its warm and dry no parcipitation of any kind and no obstructions in the way ie trees or buildings or anything for that matter Its speed was constant and in a very linear plane it came out of the sky on slow decent until it got over our heads them simply vanished into thin air. very odd<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The objects would travel past my house from the north and then disappear in the south. Two members of my group noticed something falling from the craft at several points in their flight. One of the craft appeared to disintegrate after dropping something to the ground. The lights were erratic in flight and seemed to fade and then brighten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the members of my group ( a 42 y/o housepainter) was actually in a different location in town but went outside to view the orange objects when I called him.

Linear, lighter center with pulsating orange/red on each side.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92007.html|470|ndxe201208| Reddish orange, large lights moving slowly from east to west.  Linear, lighter center with pulsating orange/red on each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 9:30 pm, Tuesday, Aug. 14, 2012.  Driving west on Stateline Rd. between Hwy 45 and Deep Lake Rd.  A large, bright orange, circular light caught my attention through the trees.  It was just north of the road, and west of my vehicle.  When I passed some of the trees, I noticed that there were actually three of the lights/objects, located in a triangular formation and slowly moving west.  I started to lose the lights in the trees again and turned north onto Deep Lake Rd to get a better look, thinking they were probably just helicopters.  When I turned onto Deep Lake Rd, I pulled over onto the shoulder and realized that there was absolutely no sound coming from the objects/lights.  At that point, they changed into a linear formation and continued moving west, past Deep Lake Rd.  While I was watching, they just blinked off as if someone had turned off a light switch.  They went off at different times, not all at once.  At that moment, I noticed another ligh! t coming from east of Deep Lake Rd., following the same course as the first three lights.  It continued further west than the first three, and I turned back onto Stateline Rd./North Ave. heading west to follow it.  I lost the light at that point because I could not keep an eye on it and keep driving.  I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have a crummy still picture of two of the first group of lights on my cell phone, but it really doesn’t do them justice.  As the first three lights passed over Deep Lake Rd., I noticed that they actually seemed to have a cigar-shaped center that was bright white orange in color, and the red-orange color was pulsating from side to side.  The best description I could think of without drawing it would be a butterfly sort of shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot believe I saw something so strange, and other than this report I have not said anything to anyone.  I do not see any similar reports to mine on your website that took place at the same time/place.  The other really eerie thing about this experience is that the entire time I was watching these lights, I did not see a single other vehicle on the road.  I cannot think of a time when I have traveled this stretch of road without seeing another vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself a skeptic when it comes to UFOs.  I have always told myself that there is an earthly explanation for all these strange sightings and events.  However, I have never seen anything even remotely close to this in the sky.  I would really love for someone to tell me what the heck I saw, and I would feel a lot better if it could be explained by something simple or familiar.  I don’t object to being contacted if someone has a serious interest in investigating this, but I do not want anyone to think I am completely nuts either.  If you have any idea what I may have seen, please let me know.<n>

They formed a triangular shape. We had seen same on Christmas eve 2011 at 11pm.  We got excited at seeing it agaun and grabbed binoculars, looking through them at one it looked to have white lites around circumference, then he said &amp;quot;look, more are coming&amp;quot; and I saw 6 more comung from behind east mountains in a line, moving, then forming groups of 3 in triangular shapes then separating and moving on toward southwest. More kept coming every few seconds, steadily,. Within 20 minutes or so we saw about 20, as they glided off we lost them in the tree line. They were silent, orange, with the white lites visible on some lower ones, through the binoculars.  No wind or even breeze, no aircraft like helicopters. when all had gone we ran inside to check the news but all night no report, none sinc! e. I googled and found tond of similar, even in Moscow. It made it creepier that these lights are being seen all over, with same descriptions and same videos of what we saw.  The forming of triangular groups is why my husband doesn&#39;t believe it is Chinese lanterns.<n>

We lost them in the clouds but with out question was something.  They did not blink or flash or leave any trail.  They were very very high up almost seemed above the stars and had a bright yet foggy appearance.  White light. it all lasted maybe 30 seconds was nothing I have ever seem before and am quite honestly little freaked out about this.  To be so high up they had to be massive. Unmistakably UFOs with out a question in my mind.  There was no sound.  I am a believer now because my husband and I both saw them together . Amazing yet scary<n>
8/14/12 00:10|Frankfort|MI|Light|2-3 minutes|Bright orange lights over Crystal Lake, Michigan, briefly hovering before shooting out of sight within a fraction of a second.|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91868.html|484|ndxe201208| Bright orange lights over Crystal Lake, Michigan, briefly hovering before shooting out of sight within a fraction of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My seventeen-year old son and I were on the deck of a cabin we’re vacationing at on the south side of Crystal Lake near Frankfort, Michigan. Shortly after midnight we observed a bright orange light coming from the west, growing larger until it stopped a third of the way up the lake between two trees and hovered for about a minute. Then it slowly moved east over the horizon and shot like a bullet straight north over the horizon, disappearing into a small dot and then disappearing altogether in well under a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was impossible to guess how large it was or how high in the sky it was, though it appeared to be at about the same height a helicopter might fly. It was obviously not a star, an airplane or helicopter, or any ordinary light. It appeared to be moving deliberately, and it was completely silent, which is especially notable on a lake where sound carries very far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m combining two reports into one because the next night, 7/15/12, at approximately the same time, my son and I were out on the deck observing the stars and joking about how funny it would be if the light appeared again, when out of the west, it did.  This time it hovered long enough that by the time we absorbed what we were seeing, I had time to remember that I should go get my cell phone and take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I could, the light flew quickly back to the west out of sight within a fraction of a second, was followed within 2 or 3 seconds by a slightly smaller orange light that hovered in the same spot in the middle of the lake for a minute or so before it shot west out of sight.  All three lights that we saw were close to the same size but appeared to get larger as they advanced towards us to hover   I would say about half the size of a normal full moon at their largest, and maybe just slightly oval but mostly round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I are both in agreement about the details of what we witnessed and that whatever the light was, its movements were unlike anything we’ve ever seen before and not explained by any known aircraft, satellite, or other typical explanations for an unidentified object/light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our background  my son is a typical high school senior and a born skeptic who now believes we saw some sort of alien craft.  I have a PhD and work as a consultant.  While I’m open to both earthly and alien explanations for what we saw, I do know that whatever it is not readily explained.<n>

I’m trying everything I can to record these things flying around my house almost every freakn night.  There is no way they are just planes because these things just set in the same spots for hours sometime before slowly moveing off. Some look like really bright stars but if you watch them among other star you can see they move around a lot. I was able to catch 2 on my recorder at night fall and one of the really bright ones at night. My recorder won’t work to good at night so stars show up but the light does.  There seem to be 2 different types of flying objects.  One has 2 whits light and smaller red ones between the white ones.  The other is several small white and red lights that look to rotate in cirles like its spinning.  I star to see them at night fall and on thru the night.  A lot of times the smaller one form a triangle when they get in that form they seem to go off in another direction but come back later on and separate and go in different directions. I just need help to figure out how to record them or catch them.  It is Sunday night and I started watching them about 8:30pm til around 1:00am and I counted 22 sightings. I don’t know if it was the same ones leaveing and comeing back but I have seen up to 6 in the sky at the same time. They cross one another and come within feet of one another and just stop and set there for a few minutes then take off again.  I can’t see air planes getting that close. The one I recorder in day light looks like a mirror flying by it was so bright. At that moment there was 3 in the air but I could only get one clearly because my recorder wouldn’t zoom in any more plus they are fast to follow. I even got what looked like a jet following that one but  left the jet way behind.  I never thought That stuff like that was real but after I saw the first one I kept looking up and on a clear night I could see a lot of them. If they are planes then ! I guess every plane in the area goes over my house. What gets ! me is ho w many there is and how low they are. Plus they seem to just set in spots for along  time. Everytime I try to record or watch them they stay at the edge of the clouds and for some reason my recorder battery dies within minutes. I only recorder like 10 minutes all together and the battery was dead after being fully charged. Its never done that til now. During the day if they are close you start to record but the object doesn’t show up in the recorder but the streamer  is still there.  You know how jets leave a cloud streamer behind them. Well, these do to but that’s all you can see in the camera but you can clearly see the object with your eyes. Plus my recorder uses the tape to record and dew at night messes with the camera so it hard to do. But I did get the really bright one where all of the other smaller ones meet up at before flying off.  I need help figuring out how to catch better recordings of these so I can prove what Im saying. The few recordings I have are not enou! gh for me. If I have to I’ll buy a better recorder because these aren’t planes. I’ve watched them for almost a month. But they seem to be returning more than before or I just noticed it. I’ve watched them every night for 2 weeks. Even on cloudly nights you can see them sometimes. From 8pm til midnight is the best  I’ve seem. I put a spot light on one and about 4 can back and just circled around for about a hour before moveing away. I did notice that when they form a triangle the lights look almost orange and brighter but I’ve only seem that twice in a week. Please reply or tell me how to catch a clear view to show others.<n>

If I extended my arm and measured between thumb and forefinger they would be about one inch apart from each other moving in tandem and could not discern if it was one craft or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife out to see and by that time they had dimmed to the brightness of the other stars. We watched them go over head and to the back of us and they seemed to fade out when they reached about 70 degrees.  I did not notice any airplane noise during this event.<n>

It was like a subtle audio-earthquake in the sky it was vibrating so much! It was moving slow;mostly behind trees but I saw it stationary in a clear spot for just a few seconds.  Size about 3 X the Space station brightness and a nice glowing orange.  We’d heard it earlier and commented on how long and loud the “odd jet rumbling” was over the coastal mountains, going north, but then It Came Back and went south and that was when we saw it.Visually it slowly moved behind the trees on our property but we could see it between them many times for a minute more. We lis! tened to the rumbling for several minutes afterwards.I&#39;m late 50s and college educated and my husband is a Vietnam veteran with two purple hearts. I&#39;d seen a couple of other UFOs in my life but it was his first and he is quite astonished and thoughtful about it.<n>

I noticed a very bright orange light, which I quickly motioned too. We observed the light together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the orange light for a few seconds, then the large orange light began moving. It moved up and down quickly, bobbing rather. It moved East, and continued at a fast speed. We watched it until it crossed over the railroad by the Choctaw parking-lot, next to the power-relay-station. We quickly made our way across the road, I was able to see the back of the orange light. The bottom of the light appeared to have a reddish tan,, exactly like a gas-heater on low. We watched it until we were unable to see it, anymore.  The light from the post in the parking-lot was too bright, and made it difficult for us to see it as it flew East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Girlfriend says that there was a silver aurora around the bright orange light, something I also noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange light was considerably large, and did not emit any sounds. It couldn&#39;t have been more than two blocks away from where we were standing. I believe it was right over the power-station that you see from the Choctaw Parking-lot. It was very close, and moved in such a way that it couldn&#39;t have been any aircraft of civilian origin. I have never seen anything like it, and neither has my Girlfriend.<n>

We also viewed different stars through our telescope, but got tired of looking up, so we lay down on a tarp in the grass and just looked up at the beautiful night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of nowhere, from the east, there was golden-orange colored round orb/light (very bright - glowing like) in the east, over a hill nearby, coming towards the bay. At first, I thought it was a plane who turned on its landing light for the local airport, but it was much larger than a landing light, not the right color, and there was no sound... totally silent. It appeared to be moving quite slowly, down and forward - moving east to west. Then all of a sudden another light came from it - same color, round shape, size, and same speed - but moving north without descending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The original light/orb continued, several more lights came from it and descended at same speed, but at about 45 degree angle. Other lights (2 or 3) appeared near to these. All of them would appear to turn off for a few moments, then turn back on in a direct line of path... not a blinking affect but a distinct off, then back on. A couple of them seemed to appear out of nowhere as well on either side of the original one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was unreal... my daughter, who is 6, kept saying &amp;quot;cool, mommy&amp;quot;... and I was in awe.  I asked my daughter to run into the house and grab my cellphone so I could video it, and the housephone to call my brother who lives right down the road. While she was inside, all of them disappeared...<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1-2 minutes later I heard a rumbling at high altitude, like jet fighters.  I could hear them to the north, and when the sound passed over, I saw what looked like the red glow of two after-burners moving due south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had taken my daughter about 2 (maybe 3) minutes to return outside. I called my brother, and he came over... I described what I had seen. I wondered what I just witnessed. I have never seen anything like it before. My brother thought it may have been star-burst-flares and explained what they look like, but it was definitely not that.<n>

We live on a mountain at the end of a road. We own about 12 acres, 6 acres of an open field, the rest of the property is wooded. The fields sit in front of house. We have a few trees that sit between our house and the field. We own a few great Danes that run the property.  It was around 9:30pm when we called them in the house for the night.  One of the great Danes were acting very strange, she was looking upwards towards where the field and trees meet, and she wasn&#39;t moving, she was just standing there.  We called and called her, normally shes very eager to come in the house.  Finally she came in after a few mins of calling her.  We had family over and were all sitting around watching tv. It was about 9:45pm when we heard a very loud rumbling sound.  We all kind of looked at each other confused. I don&#39;t really know how to explain the sound, I thought it sounded like a big truck, my sister said she thought ! it was thunder. My sister and two nieces ran outside onto the front porch.  They were out there for a few seconds when one of my nieces screamed at the top of her lungs. That&#39;s when my sister and other niece saw what she was screaming about.  It was about 200-250 feet up  in the sky, about even with trees, there was bright orange glowing lights.  There was two of them,  They were kinda oval shaped, the whole thing was glowing orange except for the bottom, it was dark, like it was open.  But there was glowing light coming down from the dark spot.  They could see one very clearly, the other was half hidden by a tree.   They were just hovering there, not moving.  They were both the same size, (like if you were to put a semi truck, just the cab part, in a bubble)  They were the same height. My sister and nieces turned and yelled at us to come look.  At that exact time the lights just went out, like someone hit a switch.  I got up and ran out fast because of the way they were acting, one o! f my nieces was crying.  By the time I got onto the deck from w! here I was sitting, which was only 20 feet, we all heard the rumbling noise again but this time it was far away. After that we never heard or seen anything out of the ordinary.<n>

At first I thought they were lights atop electrical towers.  But as I drove closer, I noticed they were not attached to anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over because I wanted to observe the lights for awhile.  They were traveling slowly, almost gliding, in a west to east direction.   Each one was a brightly colored orange light; they sparkled and were quite pretty. I looked to the west and saw that others were coming into my view. This was good because as the others traveled towards the night clouds, they disappeared.  The &amp;quot;show&amp;quot; lasted about five minutes and then they had all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend who lived on my street, and as I was close to my neighborhood, she was able to see them as well.  She also told me that she had seen them a couple of months ago but never mentioned it.

Initially there was a sound that seemed like it was a jet plane flying in the distance. We then saw a white flash of light and looking up into the night sky we observed two orange spheres that were moving slowly. As we were facing them the light on the left moved towards the one on the right and they merged together into one light.  The single remaining light just disappeared. The entire event lasted for approximately 15 seconds.<n>

In the enclosed picture, I cut the relevant portions out and set them side by side in time order.  I took the shots roughly 3 seconds apart.  The dark object in the bottom right corner is my neighbors AC unit and my point of reference when referencing where I saw the first light.<n>

I photographed both East &amp; West observations while my clients changed their children&#39;s clothes.  The men from the session and myself all stared in confusion wondering what would cause a &#39;cloud&#39; to form in such a straight line... it was very bizarre and NOT natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a few photographs to document this strange observation to review after my photo shoot was over with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I was able to get the images back in the office and pull them up on the computer, it appears that it was not the &#39;pink cloud&#39; that was questionable, but the blue shape that cuts into the dusty pink sky.  It looks like a &#39;wing&#39; of some sort (from an aircraft - but much too large to be anything our military has; or told us about), it even squares off with 90* corners before it stretches back across the sky.  This &#39;UFO&#39; was so big I was not able to capture an image of it in a single photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NOTE: No manipulation or enhancements have been done to these images.)   Image # 5598 shows myself facing northeast to capture the image.  Where the blue &#39;formation&#39; squares off appears to be somewhere over Rose Mary Beach, FL (Approximately 20 minutes from where I was.)  The second image was shot facing northwest IMG_5599 - there is no way to tell where this formation ends, due to the cloud cover on the horizon line.  (However, it appears to go well into Destin, Fl.)<n>

I suddenly saw 2 very bright orange and large glowing balls come straight down slowly from above, I was very startled and grabbed my cell phone , nervously opened the camera and begin to video record the event.  The glowing balls descended slowly to a certain height and then just hovered for a matter of seconds , one of the glowing balls blinked out and was gone leaving another hovering , this is the glowing ball that I was able to capture on video as it hovered and then also blinked out and both were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thoughts were that I had possibly been witness to a mid air collision of aircraft , I began searching the TV News for news of such an event had occurred , nothing unusual was reported.  I then began to feel that what I just witnessed may have not been a naturally occurring phenomenon.  I heard about your website from listening to the Jeff Rense Show and decided to report this, I have a short , clear video capture and am happy to share it with you if it can help with your research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I to this day have no idea what I saw however half a year later I saw similar glowing balls again and there were multiple witnesses, I will make a separate report.<n>

As I stared for a few seconds, in the path of my focus was a black rectangle which was moving straight West. The object maintained a steady rotation. It never changed direction or speed as I could not take my eyes off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 20/20 vision and I eyeballed that object until it was so far West, it was no longer visible. As I composed myself to keep it together, I looked up at the sky again and WOW! Another exact duplicate black rotating rectangular object following the direct path and speed consistency as the first. As high up as the two objects were, I would estimate about a mile high, they were approximately 15-20 feet in length and thin. Solid black and awesome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only been fascinated by my lucid dreams of flying or having fun in the dreamworld prior to the two objects I witnessed. I am amazed at the thin blue lines before sleep that evolve into symmetric patterns only to be introduced to a diamond grid which is made apparent by the unseen force behind it. A presence or Some &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; is swooshing cursive-like gleaming, sparkling, glowing, shimmering communication. Hard to believe is not my concern, I simply do not understand exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also have had a black triangle become apparent in my presleep light show. I am used to the star cluster normal activity when the eyelids are closed. But just a few days ago, I was messing around with concentration and the ultra violet or purple clusters opened up in the center and formed a black triangle. THEN, a star or spark appeared in the exact center. Wow, then I see those two black rectangles in the sky?? I have NEVER messed with acid or mushrooms. Been weird forever it seems.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was directly overhead, higher than aircraft contrails, and staying totally stationary.  It was white/silver, circular, and seemed incredibly high. I have 20/10 corrected vision and have seen many aircraft growing up in a Navy family and being stationed all over the world.   It was unlike anything I have seen.  After a few minutes, it moved in a straight line, a hands width or maybe 5 degrees, then stopped. It would be difficult to estimate speed as I have no idea how high up it was, or how large it was.  It took a second or two to move and come to a stop.  It stayed in that position for a couple minutes, then moved back to its&#39; original position, where it remained for several more minutes.   We finally went inside and did not see it again.  We joked at the time it was a UFO.  After 20 or 30 minutes we realized we had seen something odd.  The only camera I had was ! my Iphone and both images the object can not be seen.<n>

It was the most amazing thing we all have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was amazing how it went across the sky.  And how fast it was gone.  It looked in the sky at first the size of a school bus.

First one spotted was heading west to east – then started to ascend  - there was no noise.   The intensity of the light increased before ascension.  The second craft was coming in eastbound on apparently the same path – followed the first – and ascended.   Once high(er) – the light grew very dim.  There was no sound.  It moved in a way that seemed to be controlled but was curious.  The speed heading west seemed to be very fast after apparently not moving real fast.  The other witness and I couldn&#39;t really describe what we saw as relating to any modern aircraft that we are aware of.<n>

Both these objects were extremely high in the sky and what looked well beyond that of typical aircraft. There were no blinking lights. There was no noise.  Both objects were exactly the same brilliance and stayed perfectly one behind the other traveling at what looked like a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not travel the speed of meteors, but rather a steady speed more like an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 46 years of age....my boy 10 years old.

While watching for the asteroids i noticed a light north/north-east up in the sky, above and to the left of where Jupiter was last night, that was yellowish, and was moving left and right, down and up, waving, and behaving erratic. I quickly realized it wasn&#39;t an asteroid and called my boyfriends attention to it.  He too said that it looked to him like it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then moved to put it in perspective with a near-by saguaro to really tell if it was moving, thinking maybe it was just our eyes playing tricks.  Sure enough it was moving to one side of the cactus, to the other. It was moving.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Then about 5 minutes later it reappeared, and this time it was higher in the sky, but in the same region.  We got in the car and drove about a mile towards it to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then started dimming, then brightening, sometimes disappearing, and returning quickly. Then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for about 10 minutes, and decided we didn&#39;t think it was coming back.  As we started to drive away, about 4-5 miles down the road, the light returned, dimming and brightening, until we turned down a street that no longer aloud us to see it.<n>
8/13/12 00:15|Norman|OK|Triangle|5 hours|Firey orange triangle-aprox. one hundred white spheres/orbs. and a triangle shaped  craft with circles on each point.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92483.html|510|ndxe201208| Firey orange triangle-aprox. one hundred white spheres/orbs. and a triangle shaped  craft with circles on each point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 11:45 on August 12th,2012 I arrived at Lake Thunderbird in Norman,OK. to watch the meteor shower.  My 2 nieces ages 20 and 18 and my 2 year old grandson were with me.  We went to Zoom Beach on Indian Point Road. We sat on a blanket at the most North point of the area.  My grandson was asleep the entire time.  All activity observed was within one half of the sky or a 180 degree area. With 0 degrees being North-80 degrees East and 180 degrees South. We were facing East but slightly North-about 70 degrees.  There was a very tall street light about 200 feet behind us-otherwise it was very dark.  Aprox. 12:15 my niece witnessed a firey orange triangle appear above the treeline across the lake at about 60 degrees.  From the map of the lake I guessed this to be about 2400 feet. We thought this might be the corner of the moon beginning to rise. As we watched it-it flickered/flamelike. It kept the triangular shape but did not have exact edges. It looked like a fire...! yellows/oranges and reddish/brownish at the boundaries.  But the upper right corner seemed to drift in and out of the triangle.   We watched the triangle and saw about 20 meteors until about 1:45. Between 1:45 and 2:00 we witnessed the triangle rise above the trees...it was a cresent moon. We saw the moon rise and all the events to follow 3 different times.  Each episode lasting 45 minutes-1 hour with aprox. 15 minutes of inactivity between each episode.  As we watched the moon, the lower 1/4 began to break away in small pieces,travel a very short distance then return to shape the moon. They appeared like blobs-no definite shape.  But they got larger and smaller as to &amp;quot;morph&amp;quot; in size. They were the same firey orange color.  The smaller pieces broke away and returned 3 to 4 times-with the pieces growing larger each time.  Then as an explosion-many many very bright white spheres were emitted from the moon.  At least 50-100 spheres traveling in all directions,within the 60-90! degree area.  The movement was unlike anything man-made or any! kind of machinery I had ever seen.  It appeared lifelike-it reminded me of a swarm of bees. It also reminded me of &amp;quot;Tinkerbell&amp;quot; while flying.  The movements were so irradic...sideways/circular/north/south/east/west/up/down/hovering. At times they were faster than anything I have seen.  At other times they moved so slow we questioned each other to verify movement.  During this activity the degree of brightness would change from very bright to very dim,  Then they would disappear and reappear.  They appeared &amp;quot;playful&amp;quot;. Next at about 70 degrees we noticed a circular area forming...like a black hole. The sky was clear,but clouds just appeared from nowhere.  We kept saying &amp;quot;cloudlike&amp;quot;-they seemed to move with purpose.  As if to be alive or drawn or pulled to this area.  The clouds formed a cover/curtain in front of the black hole. It became very bright behind the cloud cover. The spheres began darting in and out from behind the cloud cover. Then the clouds just vani! shed.  Next the spheres had more purposeful movement.  They formed a pattern as if to get in line and traveled up to a small cluster of twinkling stars. This was about 85-90 degrees. Hold your arm straight out,bend wrist downward and fan open fingers. This is what the cluster looked like. It had a long tail of stars at the most North point. Next the spheres traveled down the &amp;quot;fingerlike&amp;quot; part of the cluster. They were in a line formation and looked like a rescue team from a helicopter-traveling down a hanging rope. At the bottom they scattered very fast and very irradic in all directions and in all 180 degrees. As some traveled closer the sphere shape appeared to be triangular. They had a circle/round light on each point of the triangle. They were all a very bright white light. Next they all traveled North /0 degrees to a bright/stationary/blinking light at the treeline. This was directly over Tinker Air Force Base. Next they were launched a few at a time South/abou! t 145 degrees,to a bright/stationary/blinking light at the tre! eline. B oth the N and S stationary/blinking lights were present during all the previous activity. Reminded me of a lighthouse. Next they were launched very fast South/Southwest to 180 degrees. They were launched in various sized groups-parallel to the treeline. Then they would disappear. It reminded me of bullets being fired from a gun. During the last 10-15 minutes we saw activity leaving the cluster/swarming/traveling North/launched South/launched SW to disappear. All simultaneously-we didn&#39;t know where to look. We felt as if we were being diverted from seeing something. We witnessed the same exact /entire episode 2 more times. The only difference being in the last episode which was aprox. 4:00-5:00. After the spheres traveled to the North light we noticed a very bright light traveling on or right above the lake towards us. It was a stationary white light that was directly North and present the entire night-atleast 3,000 feet away. It traveled very fast and irradic. Sideways/circu! lar/hovering and completely silent. The brightness faded in and out/was a single light/was 2 lights-like headlights/ we saw red and green lights. As it came closer it was the triangular shape. When it was about 3-5 feet from our shore the triangle craft disappeared and we immediately heard a small boat motor and saw a small fishing boat land on the shore. We were convinced this was an intentional attempt to make us doubt the entire evening of events. 2 men exited the boat and were camping just west of us. We were to scared to question them about anything. After a few minutes we noticed a triangle craft traveling directly towards us. It was moving so slow it took quite awhile to realize it was getting larger and closer. It was a very bright white light with circles on each point of the triangle. We started to hear noise for the first time all evening. It was fish jumping...alot of fish from all different directions. At its closest we saw faint/almost invisible &amp;quot;like&amp;quo! t; triangular wings on both sides. The entire evening I had su! ch a war m/good/devine intervention type feeling. When the craft was aprox. 500-700 feet away we heard water bubbling sounds for awhile. I felt my body move backwards as it approached and I was spooked. It started to sprinkle and within 30 seconds a downpour. I picked up my grandson and we all ran to our vehicle. We watched the craft another minute or two. Then it disappeared and the downpour stopped. We watched for another hour atleast before we headed home. That is my sighting...it is what it is. The first hour I tried to rationalize everything to my niece, until I finally realized there was no other earthly expalnation. We were witnessing actual UFO activity. To end...there were absolutely no drugs or alcohol involved. My 20 year old niece witnessed it all with me. I am thankful to have a witness. My 18 year old niece watched some of the meteors than feel asleep. She did wake up at some point and watch also...maybe an hour or so. She was scared and wanted to leave. I will never un! derstand this as I stayed awake almost 2 days from adrenaline. I am 45 years old. I have been a Registered Nurse for 21 years. I have no mental illness past or present. My nieces are both high school grads and have been very good girls. We all 3 had phones on our person and I had been to a birthday party that day and had my camera in the vehicle. Not once did the thought cross our minds to take some pictures. I guess its the shock and disbelief that keep you fixated on watching and your brain from thinking rational...<n>

There appeared to be no lights and it was completely quiet.  I watched it bank a bit one direction.  Was definitely no bird.  Maybe a military drone?  One of the strangest things I&#39;ve seen and I don&#39;t get creeped out by strange things, but this one just left my heir standing on end.  The other dates I&#39;m not aware of as I thought maybe I was just seeing things like a shadow or something from a plane.  But this last siting has definitely convinced me that this is no shadow.<n>

So i focused all my attention over to those tree tops when suddenly this bright sphere of yellowish white light came soaring out from the treetop line ...and this object was quiet! no sound what so ever as it flew fairly slow paced about a block or two of a distance then it was like someone or something had turned the power down in this thing and it just slowly dimmed as it continued to soar until it was the tiniest speck and just vanished!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in complete shock while i was watching this take place in front of me i could not believe it!!  I have seen plenty of airplanes, shooting stars, meteor showers and satellites and t! his my friends was neither!!  It was almost like i had just seen this thing as it flew by zap out of this time back to where ever it came from!  I hope i was not the only person who seen it!<n>

I drove into the country to find a good spot to watch the meteor shower around 22:30.  I found a dark place to watch and called a friend to come out.  Around 23:30, we spotted a unusually bright blue light in the sky almost right above where we were watching the shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our amazement, it started to move.  It would start slow, then rapidly speed up and fly extremely fast.  It left behind a faint blue trail.  The UFO would suddenly stop moving.  It would remain stationary for up to a minute.  It would sometimes move in linear paths, but other times it would make figure eights or S-shaped movements.  It would sometimes fade out of view but then return.  These random movement patterns continued for a half-hour until we had to leave.  The UFO was circular shaped and bright blue in color.  It was the brightest object in the sky.  It was approximately about the size of the North Star, possibly a bit larger.<n>

Northbound, in between 8-9 o&#39;clock from the direction of the rising sun in the area I spotted a bright orange light with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I assumed it to be one of the bright Perseids fireballs, given the particular night.  However, it did not flicker out as expected and as it followed the normal trajectory of a meteor moving across the sky it slowed down and suddenly began to rise back into the sky.  It rose at a slightly faster pace than the one it had been falling at, and when it had traveled far enough (in between 10-11 o&#39;clock from the direction of the rising sun) it stopped midair and hovered for about a minute and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two aircraft right flew past it during that time, clearly identified as such by their blinking lights. The object itself also blinked, but not the way an airplane would - as it was entirely consumed in light its &#39;blinking&#39; was more of a flicker, like a meteor. It was also completely silent; the only sounds heard were those of the two planes that passed it. Shortly afterward it began to shrink/dim in and seemingly disappeared out of existence. I waited for about thereafter in case it returned - it did not.<n>

It&#39;s speed did not excelerate but seemed to slow at intervals. There was a kind of &amp;quot;bouncing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;small movement&amp;quot; of the craft as it moved in front of us. It could have been a rotation.  There was no sound of any kind. We watched it travel immediately infront of us, and continued east for about 4-5 minutes. Then it turned north and as it turned in that direction, the speed increased and it disappeared within a few seconds, it looked as though it went straight up and out of sight. There was nothing to distort or block our view, as our house sits on the back of Oak Island with water and marsh only.  This was not a reflection, nor was it a meteor, as was our reason for being outside ( perseid shower). This was a large craft, boomerang shaped,or cresent.Ther! e was only one craft and the color reminded me of a candle flame. Both myself and my friend are in the medical field, my friend is retired and I am a nurse.Neither of us have ever seen anything like this before, nor would we have believed what we saw except for the fact we both saw and witnessed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A red bliking light caught my attention as it was ascending upward in the sky.  At this point I called my boyfriend outside.  There is a tree in the middle of our back yard that sits in front of the door so naturally he looked upward and started laughing at me.  There was an airplane headed over our house travelig west to east.  I told him NO it was that way (in which the tree was blocking). We went down the yard past the tree and it was a large red light with smaller white lights. It was traveling north cut around at almost a 90 degree angle and headed south. It was silent and traveled faster than any other aircraft i have ever seen. It was much flying much lower than a typical aircraft would.  I was so shocked and amazed watching it that i didnt even see where the other two aircraft came from but one came from each side and joined t! he one i was watching, they were flying in a v formation and continued to go south, then at what i would approximate being about 10 miles away they hovered in the same spot and position for about 7 minutes, at which point i went inside.<n>

During the approach my wife suddenly came to the realization this was not conventional aircraft, got spooked and insisted I get my glasses as she quickly got out of the pool.  I d! ashed to the kitchen door and retrieved by glasses and ran back to the edge of the pool, propping my arms up on the wood pile that lined the property line.  My wife was now standing behind me watching as the objects now slowly cruised by together, reminiscent Japanese lanterns but at a close enough vantage point to eliminate that possibility.  They also were clearly traveling together and independent of the wind so I quickly dismissed the possibility of such a man-made object.  The glowing balls of orange light, less than a quarter mile away and at about 500 feet briefly continued away from the pool to the left and each orange ball, one by one, imploded on itself disappearing one by one till all has disappeared from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a student of the UFO phenomenon for over 25 years, spending the late 80’s and 90’s as a field investigator and assistant state director for MUFON and eventually helping establish Oregon UFO Research in 2000.  At the time of this event, the wife and I HAD JUST been discussing the subject of unidentified flying objects, and in particular I was in the middle of telling her about an incident in 1988 when I saw a low flying orange ball of light in my back yard in West Salem.  Almost immediately on the heels of telling her that story these balls of light appeared coming in over the homes along our street and heading our way and looking exactly like the object I had seen 23 years before.   I caught myself saying, &#34;You gotta be kidding me,&#34;  to my wife in light of just recalling to her the incident 23 years before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My gut feeling as I watched the orange glowing orbs or balls was that the flight was intentional, that they slowed as they passed us next to the pool and that we were being watched as we watched them, strong feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We extend our gratitude to Eric Byler, Co-Founder of Oregon UFO Research, for sharing this report with our Center.

It was dark outside, but the object was clearly visible.  It was definitely there.  The object did not have any flashing lights. It did not have any visible lights at all.  The object itself had a very slight yellowish glow to it. And it was moving at a very high velocity.  I would say that the object left a trail, but it may have just been a light trail created by the high speed of the slightly glowing craft.  It was definitely saucer shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m writing this less than 30 minutes after the event.  It is definitely still in good memory. This is not a hoax, or a joke.

The reason it caught my attention was because it wasn&#39;t very high in the sky and it was a dim orange color, almost like a dull overhead highway light.  It was pretty still so I had time to notify my family in the car and the odd nature of it&#39;s position in the sky.  It wasn&#39;t high enough to be a plane (plus it wasn&#39;t moving) nor was it low enough to be a street light.  My wife reminded us that when we left there were several hot air balloons in the area, however it was pretty dark and it was unlikely they were still floating around. As we continued to drive we were now moving in a different direction so we were watching from the side window and now the object appeared to be almost like a fireball but we knew it wasn&#39;t because if it were an actual fireball it would have been much brighter however we thought it might be possible of it was a leftover hot air balloon in terrible distress.  We took another turn now heading towatds the object and were expecting to get a better view oit the front windshield when the object appeared further away even though we knew we were moving closer to it.  At this point the object gradually moved directly up and out of sight leading all of us to conclude that this was something very different.  We don&#39;t normally believe in such happenings but this occurrence doesn&#39;t leave a whole lot of other explanations that we are aware of which lead us to the iternet when we got home.  Most surprising from our internet research was reading other descriptions of sightings that included fireball like observations further validating what we know we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I quickly turned around hoping to get another look since once the objects crossed the road they were no longer visible.   There were nine objects remaining when I turned around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued on my way marveling at what I had just seen.  I took a left on a road that runs perpendicular to the first road. About a mile up the road there is farm that spans both sides of the road, and this is where I encountered the orange/red globes again.  I pulled my car over and hopped out to get a better look, trying to figure out what I was seeing.  I watched as they headed from the Western tree line to the Eastern tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not believe what I saw next.  Between each globe was a vessel that had not been visible up until then.  The globes appeared to me to have been towing/escorting the vessels. The vessels were a reddish black and glowing along the edges, kind of like lava.  The vessels also appeared to have some sort of insignia on them. I have tried but I cannot draw the shape or the insignia well enough to do them justice.  I am not sure what became of the globes once the vessels became visible because I realized that after the first vessels appeared something large and black, separate from the vessels, was being dropped  over the trees.  The only way to describe the descending items is as black masses; there is nothing that I have encountered thus far, real or fictional, that can help me describe what the masses looked like or what they could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The globes, vessels and masses made no sounds that were audible to my ears.  I do not recall seeing any other aircraft in the sky at the time.<n>

I was outside last night 08-14-2012 (I thought) around 7:30PM. I sensed something in the sky, looked up and a few seconds later I saw a large bright fireball appear and move upwards. There was no visible craft near the fireball. The fireball left a single (short) very bright trail which then split into two separate trails and recombined back into one.  The trails were intermittent (visible then not visible). After the trail stopped, a very small craft (in relation to the trails) appeared by itself with a violet aura around it. It was there for a for a few seconds then disappeared (did not appear to move off, just disappeared). The trail began again farther up (but with no visible craft). It is difficult to judge what the size of the craft was because of the distance it was from me. There was no sound noticeable at any time. Total time of event was a little over one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this happened last night (08-14-2012). However, when I went to place the date/time stamp on the images, the date said 08-12-2012. I checked the camera and the date/time is correct. I cannot account for the time differential. I do have memories of the last few days. However, when I try to remember specifics about that time, my memories are incomplete/jumbled.  This has happened quite a few times before. Usually it’s almost impossible to reconcile such time inconsistencies unless there is some type of anomaly that occurs (in this case photos with a time/date stamp, or a receipt, a specific event or some other type of evidence that can be used as an anchor point to help account for any missing time). Photos are being emailed separately.<n>

A few minutes later the coyote’s started yelping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were sitting in the front yard commenting to each other on the birds and the coyote’s hollering so early in the day. The air was still, the breeze we had all day had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Wife said, what is that, I turned and coming from the same direction as the birds was a large metal looking sphere that had a long protruding rod about as tall as it was round sticking straight up, it had a small cone about a third of the way down on the rod. It was about 250 feet away, about 100 feet up. It looked to be about 10 to 14 foot wide. It did not make a sound. It stopped coming toward us and changed direction and started going straight north at a steady rate of speed until it continued out of sight. It never changed directions or elevation while it was moving. I did not see any lights or hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned this to my children and they made all kinds of statements, but my daughter who works with her Sister n law commented to her that we had seen something Sunday, my Daughter n law stated my son had seen a large round metal object with a long rod come over the house a couple of weeks earlier and it looked like it was landing somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She described the same thing without knowing what we saw. My daughter stated I guess you saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of sight was about a minute and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction it came from contains a large beaver pond, with the way it looked I believe it had come and submerged in the pond using the rod as a periscope or air supply. It scared the birds from the water as it emerged and probably emitted a high frequency to cause the coyote’s to yelp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing my wife stated is I was going for the binoculars to look closer at it but I couldn’t open the door, and when I did and saw the binoculars, I didn’t see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I responded with Yea I should have got my phone and took a picture, but I was mesmerized by what I saw and did not even think of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was roughly 4:00am.  She stepped outside first as i was still inside. She shorlty called me to come out quick and that she had seen something strange in the sky. I stepped out to see a slow blinking white light about a mile away in the sky.  It was moving in a U shape, coming closer and then further away.  Then it just dissappeared. It only lasted about 30 seconds.  After ten minutes of waiting it never returned.<n>

Me and a friend were sitting in my backyard listening to a cd and counting the shooting stars we saw as we did the year before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started watching the meteor shower around 11pm counting a few dozen each. Like a competition.  Then around 3:30 or 4am my friend said &amp;quot;what the...&amp;quot;. I saw him pointing to the sky. And i saw it and said &amp;quot;what the heck&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Its a huge chunk of metal&amp;quot;. It was travelling slowly, had no propeller, no wings, was greyish, and i remember saying &amp;quot;it has right angles&amp;quot;. It had no lights, but even in the dark sky it was easily visible.  This thing was totally silent, it just floated by. It was so low, it seemed only 4 or 5 telephone poles above the ground. I took out my smart phone and quickly tried to load an app called &#39;space junk&#39;, an app that tracks satellites in real time using GPS. After fumbeling with it for a couple seconds we both just watched as it passed over my house. For some reason, i thought it could have been a satellite that fell out of orbit. We talked about it in disbelief for at least an hour afterwards. It was an exciting and t! errifying experience. My friend said he wished he never saw it. Anyways ive been trying to find out anything about it since then. Like how to obtain radar data. I cant find any info. I would like to remain anonymous. We never told anyone because unless you were there, its totally unbelievable. Before that night i didnt doubt their existance, but was skeptical about claims people make because of all the hoaxes. But i will never forget that night and whenever i think about it, i get kinda scared. It was so close, and that night we described it as being at least the size of a house or apartment building. Im just trying to find answers, and i dont care what anyone says. What we saw was not lights from a distance, or some shabby camera work, it was low, so low you could almost make out seams in the metal, or whatever it was made of. Anyways, publish this if you wish, but either way im always still gonna be searching for answers, for personal validation. Like i told my friend, if! only one of us saw it, we wouldnt know if we were crazy. But ! two of u s watching the same thing, undeniable.<n>

I stopped the vehicle to observe for roughly 1 minute.  They were vertically placed (one light above the other), and were at the distance of high flying airplane.  The lights were moving in unison, so it appeared that they were apart of a single aircraft.  They were moving in different directions, left/right/up/down, and turned into one single purple light. It started descending into our direction and changed colour to a bright white light.  It then reversed into the opposite direction and changed colour back to bright purple.  It descended very quickly towards the Earth, and it looked like it got very close, until eventually it was out of sight (our view was obstructed by trees).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers were 4 girls, between the ages of 19-24yrs.<n>

After the battle, we went to sleep in a tent.  Before we fell asleep, we saw two bright spherical lights in the sky maybe up and down and up and down.  Next, we fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something woke me up, but o don&#39;t know what.I looked out the tent and saw a large Orange circular thing in the sky.  It had three circular lights on the bottom, arranged in a triangle.  The craft itself was shaped like a disk, and was extremely large.  It was probably as high as a plane, but still took up most of my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, I woke up the nearest of my friends, and asked him what he saw.  He described it perfectly. Now, I&#39;m not saying I saw an alien craft, or some military thing, but I saw an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.  I then wrote down what I saw, drew a quick sketch and went to sleep. I don&#39;t know why I waited to report it, but I did.  What I saw, again to clarify was a UFO, not something alien (at ! least not for certain).  The neighbors&#39; dog was barking like crazy during the time this happened, and when I first saw it I checked my watch and it was one AM.  Afterwards, it was nearly four AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I noticed more appear and they seemed to fly in formation. Some appeared to speed up and slow back down.  They made no noise and traveled almost due South from the North. It almost appeared as if they were being launched or taking off in rabid rates from an unknown location.  There is an airport in the town called Smoketown Airport I thought perhaps they were launching from here so I drove 3 minutes down the road to the airport and it was closed. No signs off any people or vehicles.  I have no explantion for what I saw.  The lights remained solid orange and their was no blinking warning lights like on typical aircraft.<n>

The meteors went across the sky usually in a northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all laying in the grass so we could get the best view of the sky without hurting our necks (And so that the nearby street lights would be less obstructive to our viewing of the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my friends saw it first, pointed up at a group of three blueish green lights, whether they&#39;re part of one craft or separate craft, we&#39;re not sure.  They were in perfect equilateral triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we saw the three lights, they accelerated at an impossible rate heading west, almost from horizon to horizon.  The three lights picked up speed as they went and had started to rotate before disappearing behind a large cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was fairly calm, and there wasn&#39;t much wind.   We sat there for about 3 seconds after seeing the object, confirmed that the others saw it too, and then we all ran into the house terrified.

The flash was only 2-3,maybe 4 flashes but definetly not Meteors.I witnessed these &#34;Flashes&#34; for 3 consecutive nights and roughly the same time, approx.around 11:45PM-12:15AM.  On all 3 nights the Flashing was coming from the same location in the sky (nne location in the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe these flashes as if some thing was taking Photos and what i saw would have been the flashes of a cameras flashbulb.  But these were definetly not anything like a meteoric nature.Just simple flashes in the night sky,no tails or afterglow of any kind,on 3 consecutive nights and around the same time of the night AND in the same location of the sky (N N E would be the location on all 3 nights   During this time the Meteors were very scarce at the time of the sightings and did not pick up until roughly 90 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You for taking time to look over my report and i hope to receive some sort of explanation .

I was sitting on my deck in Edwardsville, Illinois, facing North.  I saw a white light shoot across the sky from East to West.  I thought it was a shooting star, but then I noticed a white blinking light hovering in the same location where the &#34;shooting star&#34; started its projection.  I thought this blinking light must be a plane.  But the light remained in the same location for almost a minute.  Also, it blinked rather slowly and uncoordinatedly unlike a plane’s rhythmic blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden, the blinking ceased and I saw another white streak of light move quickly in the same path, from East to West.  This time the light was followed by a white vapor trail or white smoke.  The white light lasted only about a second but the white trail remained for about twenty seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat watching the same area of sky for another three minutes to see if ! anything else would happen, but all activity ceased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I no longer believe it was a shooting star since it happened twice in the same location within three minutes of each other.<n>

I saw a green fireball approximately the color and size of a traffic signal light suddenly flash and disappear. I didn&#39;t see a tail or hear any noise as the object appeared to be at least a few miles away over southbound Hwy 101 toward Morgan Hill.  I knew that night was the peak night for the Perseid meteor shower, but those were supposed to be in the northwest sky, and I saw several of those early the next morning and they didn&#39;t look like that.  A bottle rocket?  Maybe, but I doubt it.<n>

I wanted to count the meteors and report the count back to NASA on an Android phone app, so we were intently watching the sky, particularly in the northern direction. We noted several obvious airplanes which passed throughout the approximately one and a half hours we were meteor-watching and we saw approximately 25 meteors, which were quite obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2350, I noted a light in the northwestern area over the mountains, which seemed to appear from nowhere, traveling at a very high rate of speed, in comparison to the planes we had been seeing periodically.  I called it out to my husband, who saw it as well.  It was initially headed towards the west (to the left), but then it changed directions very quickly towards the east. It changed direc! tions a couple of times, and then was joined by another identical light to its right. They appeared to follow one another, both changing directions and getting closer, then further apart, from each other several times (about six or seven times). There were no flashing lights, no red strobe lights like on a commercial airliner. In comparison with the planes we saw, these lights were traveling several times faster than the planes- they traveled in straight lines, or at least appeared to do so. They were not meteors, they did not originate high in the night sky, and they did not fall downward. They did not have tails, they were definitely exhibiting lateral movement, and appeared to be under intelligent control since they seemed to “meet up” with one another and then separate. I would have to describe their movement as akin to “playing tag”, although I obviously cannot say exactly what their intentions were.  After what I would guess to be about two minutes later, both lights ! took off towards the west over the mountaintops and disappeare! d at the same time. They left the same way they appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. They did not go behind the mountain range or treeline, they simply disappeared together. There was no noise associated with them. Since we live in a rural community, everything was very quiet and we heard some of the planes (although not all). Lights were bright white, non-flashing, steady. Size and distance were difficult to determine. I could not describe the shape other than to identify them as seemingly round lights. Both my husband and I agreed that they did not exhibit the same pattern of movement, speed, or visual light pattern of any airplanes we have ever seen. And they were obviously not planets, stars, or meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband has a background in the construction trade. My background is technical, in a science-related field in a clinical hospital patient-care setting.<n>

Sometimes it was even a bit jittery and movements were not evenly spaced.  Some movements  appeared to be fast and others slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be about 25-30 degrees off of  the  horizon, slightly over a tree line.<n>

I went and got a camera and attempted to take photos of them.  They moved and scattered.  Then they would just vanish into the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then several came up as if out of Canada or the Water in pairs and all hovered just at the north end of Bellingham Bay two of them joined together and the others slowly went out in different directions.  Some would vanish faster than others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final one came far east very slowly then just faded away, like a light going out.  This lasted for nearly 30 minutes and went just past midnight.  Very obvious and more unusual than anything I have seen in the sky.<n>

I saw a triangular shaped, extremely fast moving object, gliding from north to south, directly overhead. It crossed about 2/3 of the sky in about 5 seconds, much faster than any aircraft could do. It was completely silent. It stopped dead in one spot in the southern half of the sky and stayed in place for a moment. I pointed at it and said, &amp;quot;I see you!&amp;quot; The triangle rotated in place, and then the lights faded out completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have seen this type of craft -- the only UFO sightings in my life. The other one was in a different state, but it also appeared during the Perseids meteor shower and behaved almost exactly the same, except it faded away rather than stopping in one spot first. In both cases, there was a kind of shimmery appearance surrounding the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how big the craft was, but it had to be several times larger than any sort of airplane. It was difficult to tell how high its elevation was.  If it was flying where one would expect a plane to be (30-40,000 feet), I would have to guess that it was massive, maybe 300 feet across?  If it was higher than that, I have no idea how big it could have been.<n>

My background is 16 years in the USAF aircraft crew chief-flight chief in aircraft maintenance and I come from a family of bonified aviation &amp;quot;NUTS&amp;quot;.  So I am familiar with most anything man has thrown into the atmosphere or space.  This light was 1 mile away, 500&#39; up and traveling at about 200mph very constant speed (emphasis on very), traveling west to east, no noise. It was the characteristics of the light itself that really caught my attention.  It was like a very pure white small star had silently flown by. And the light itself was very bright pure white intense but easy to look at but no rays of light comming from it like you would have from a landing light.  Additionally there were no anti-collision, strobe, formation or position lights and no sign of a vehicle.  I am sure it was probly just an aircraft with a light ! am not familiar with...<n>

I was staring up at a star formation that looks like a W.   At that time the two objects that were elongated diamond shaped, flew in front of the stars that I was looking at.  They were black, the same color as the night sky, the only reason that I could see the outline of the crafts was the light from the city was reflecting on the outer edges of each craft.  There was no sound when they passed, nor was there any sound barrier noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes then followed them, looking up at about a 45 degree angle and told my wife to quickly look the direction that they were flying.   They were in formation, side by side.  From our backyard they flew from the north, (from the direction of San Francisco towards the south, Monterey, ca.).  It only took 4-5 seconds for them to pass at high speed.  We don’t know what we saw? UfO? Or Black Ops?   Did anyone else see these objects? There is an International airport near us and planes fly in and out all the time, these were not planes.<n>

I filmed the event with my iphone 4 and my wife filmed with her flip video.  The UFO’s were flying in a linear motion.  When they reached a point they each disappeared individually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was truly an amazing event to witness and has changed my beliefs about the existence of UFO’s.  I am a pilot with more than 4000 flight hours and have never seen anything like this before.  Also, I have posted the video on my You Tube account.<n>

Saturday 11 August 2012 Between 22:25 and 23:10 We were at we were up at Boundary Butte which is Township 24 N by. Range 17 East.  This is a big viewing area because you’re up at 3,000 feet.  We were looking west up the Icicle drainage right at Mtn. Cashmere and then a light came on we both saw it.  Time on deck was 10:25 and like 30 seconds.   We kind of knew we were going to see something we just didn’t know what?   Along this road there were many other groups of people up there to view the Perseides comet show   I don’t know if any of them saw it but it was like you could not miss it.  I hope the other groups up there will add to my story or share their own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok when we both confirmed that we were both seeing what we were seeing.  We were both looking west by south west a little.  The light moved to the east right out in front of the Butte up a maybe two thousand feet away or so??  It flew to the end of the Butte or maybe a little further and made a U turn to the north came around to the West again and headed over to Icicle ridge and flew over the ridge top out of view.  Let’s get this straight there were no sounds of airplane or helicopter or identification markers for Port and starboard not sounds at all.  Just one light and with binoculars I could not see a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we were looking south about 11:02 ish, towards Mt. Stuart.  All of a sudden there was a light on in a black area of the sky so we both saw it.  Then it the light got a little brighter and switched or morphed  into a plane and headed east towards Wenatchee kid of in the flight pattern our commercial planes fly in the fly over sound was added in by them and it was more faint we feel.  We watched till flew out of sight which was like 2 or 3 min.  The lights and blinkers after I watched and thought about it the rate, at which the blinkers were flashing at, seemed faster and the light itself was sharper of a blink.    If that makes sense??   Sorry no pictures nothing really to take a picture of to black out..<n>

We were traveling southeast on Houghton Lake Drive (it runs right next to the lake) approx. at 10:05 p.m. and it was pretty dark outside. We were on the road for about 3minutes,then suddenly I saw coming from the west...over the trees from the lake in the night sky 3 brilliantly bright orange lights shaped into a triangle, and one single (same bright color light) following it. It was so close to us... and so bright I could barely make out deep blackened outline on the triangle shaped lights, and I could make out a triangle, and it looked huge. I said to my boyfriend “what is that&amp;quot;!! The lights were moving very slow, slower than any helicopter or plane we both ever seen. ( and we live near a small airport, hear planes all the time)We stopped in the middle of the road for just a few moments to shut the headlights off, then I said let’s just go follow it, because that was not safe to stop a! nd turn our lights off, as it is a busy road at times. We followed and watched it until we got to m-18,( runs north &amp; south) that took us at least a minute to get there, then we pulled over in a family restaurant parking lot, (it is closed that time of night and quiet) on the west side of m-18 to keep watching, this time we shut off our lights and the vehicle and got out. We heard absolutely no sound from these lights, that were still moving so very slow, then as we watched (for about 2 minutes) it go into the clouds, totally out of our view, then to our surprise,  2 more lights came from over the lake, (we were east side of the lake) they were following each other, they also looked very huge and the same kind of lights but they were both single, to both of us it looked like the first one slowed down so the other could catch up, right before they disappeared into the clouds heading same direction as the first, (moving southeast he says,I said just east) After they were gone ! i looked at the clock in the car it said 10:20. So we watched ! this app rox.10 minutes. By the way... meteors don’t move like these did. We are an older couple in our 50‘s and never seen anything like this.<n>
8/11/12 22:01|Union|MI|Teardrop|20 minutes?|Multiple craft forward red-orange light, slowly flying low east-southeast across Union MI, disappeared as they passed over. silent.|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91710.html|564|ndxe201208| multiple craft forward red-orange light, slowly flying low east-southeast across Union MI, disappeared as they passed over. silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On august Saturday August 11th about 10:01 pm my wife and I were traveling from a local pizza place to our home in Union MI. My wife 45year olf, and myself 51 year old have lived in Union MI with our children for 20+ years. as we traveled west on US 12 my wife said look at those, what are those airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to the west, north west in the sky just above the trees and saw a formation of what appeared to be 4 small aircraft with steady orange reddish lights moving in a sort of diamond formation just a couple of hundred feet I would estimate above he ground. The craft were traveling east-south east across the sky, and crossed US 12 near Trout road. I pulled off onto Baldwin Prairie Rd. and watched as the lead craft seemed to fade away as it passed over.  Then one by one the craft would appear to separate and disappear. We turned around and proceeded north on Baldwin prairie rd to get away from trees and get a better look at the west sky. We went about ½ mile and turned back around south again when she said she saw another one, we went back to Baldwin Prairie Rd. and US 12 and pulled over and I got out and got my cell phone and attempted to record one of the craft that she saw then coming again east-southeast across US 12 about at vera drive, above the John Deere dealer.  Th! e recording is not very good as the cell phone makes it appear as if the craft are very far away when in reality I would say they appeared to be maybe 500 feet away at most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then proceeded west on US 12 to where we could get a better look at the west-northwest sky and saw another coming above the trees, I recorded it as best as I could. The craft appeared to only have one red-orange or yellow-orange flame like, incandescent appearing light facing forward as when the craft passed nearly directly over us it would fade then gradually you could not see it any more as if the body of the craft was blocking the light facing forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although there was really no visible portion of the craft to really tell how large it was just primarily the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other peculiar thing we realized is that they seemed to be totally silent. Although at 200 to 500 feet above us an ultra light would be quiet, when there were periods of no vehicle traffic we should have been able to hear some sort of engine noise. They were to the best of my ability silent, and probably moving about 25 to maybe 35 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gave the camera to my wife who had turned off my vehicle, and got a spot light out of my vehicle. The light is a streamlight lightbox, LED spot light, used by firefighters, relatively bright. As another light began to move into view. She did her best to video this last craft and as it passed over us I decided to try and hit it with the light to see if I could get a glimpse of any portion of the craft itself. This was unsuccessful as the beam just seemed to fall short of anything related to the craft. I did blink the light several times to see if there would be any change in behavior and there was none. The only difference is after the light from the craft disappeared as all the others did it seemed like you could get a very faint reflection of light from the spot light. I don&#39;t know it may have just been the desire to see something straining against the dark as the craft disappeared, and trying to make some sense of the situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We figure we saw 12 in all flying basically all the same direction east-southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the weather as soon as we arrived home 10:16 pm and found the temp 63 deg. F., Humidity 83%, visibility 10miles. Wind WNW at 8mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have put the approximate path on the linked below Google Map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Links to the videos are here, the quality is from a cellphone so I hope you don&#39;t expect to much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=217523935539399827446.0004c7090a1cbc0cfaaa5  http://youtu.be/QPZXOURAiYA  http://youtu.be/9nGB8ExGIo0  http://youtu.be/eFOqLTjCZnM  http://youtu.be/ZbiLVOMpHHM  After trying to figure out what it might be we concluded it could possibly be some sort of remote drone type of craft?  They did not appear to be hot air balloons as there was no sign of the balloon from what might have appeared to be the flame producing the light, and as I stated as they moved overhead and began to then move away instead of towards they would disappear as the light appeared to only be in the front facing. They looked a little like a tear drop shape lithe or a cone shape toward the craft as the passed directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With all the talk of military surveillance testing and drones, etc... makes me wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called and reported it immediately to our dispatch center and asked that they call me tomorrow and let me know if anyone else reported seeing the craft.<n>

They were very closely spaced together and glowing in a golden-yellow light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects looked almost like birds flapping their wings, but none of us had ever seen glowing birds at night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We agreed that they were between 150-200 feet above us.<n>
8/11/12 22:00|Saugatuck|MI|Light|2 hours on and off|Orange lights moving very quickly over Lake Michigan during meteor shower.|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91779.html|566|ndxe201208| Orange lights moving very quickly over Lake Michigan during meteor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was photographing the meteor shower from the Lake Michigan shore line just north of Sagutuck with my boyfriend. After a some time staring at the sky we noticed an orange orb moving very quickly and in patterns I&#39;ve never seen military craft move in. I say it this way because I worked on a aircraft carrier for a time and I assumed it was just military operations of some sort in a secluded location(the middle of lake Michigan south west of where I was at).  But after watching it dissapear over the horizon  and then reappear all the while getting brighter and larger made me shiver with a feeling of fear.  Up until then I thought I was watching the tail end of some rocket propelled something but when it appeared to move closer to me and get brighter I couldn&#39;t explain it.  It moved so quickly left to right and up and down on the horizon as if it was testing it&#39;s craft or just having fun.  I decided to photograph it three times, the first two times I set it up an! d focused only to have the damn thing dissapear.  The third time I just moved the camera and shot. I didn&#39;t zoom in and my shots are 30 secomd exposures but I have orange streaks moving under a patch of clouds far off on the horizon.  This experience was strangely frightening and entertaining.  No human could have been in those orbs and survived the movements. If its drones why make them bright orange and fly them around a dark wide open area at night?  I know statistically there has to be other life forms out in space but do they really come here.<n>

As the 6 formation lights do their own thing and begin to disappear I pull over.  Keeping my attention on the bright light I started to record and a second bright light followed the path of the first and came out of nowhere.  They both faded and disappeared in their transit.  They looked orange to me and I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw it.<n>

Directly overhead seen a bright light that was too high to be a airplane.  It at first was not moving, so thought it to be just a star that came out of cloud cover.  Then it started to move very slowly and then eventually disappear.  Like I said it was too high to be a airplane.  It also was too bright to be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed them out in exclamation to the others, and we stopped in a driveway.  There was a woman in the driveway who was walking her dog.  She informed us that the lights had been present for almost five minutes. She theorized that they could have been some sort of parachuting rockets or fireworks over lake Tapps or farther, as the lights were southwest of us.  The lights appeared to be moving upward and away and then dimming one by one.  We turned south onto 264th and then west on 416th St. Strangely enough, we seemed to be actually approaching the formation of lights. I remarked with excitement that we were within a few miles of them.  As we approached their location, however, they seemed to disappear one by one.  By the time we reached the intersection of SE 416th and 244th, the ligh! ts had gone completely, but there were several cars in the vicinity as if the drivers had also attempted to get a better look.  We pulled over where we thought the lights had been above, but nothing remained, and there was no noise.  When we returned to the spot the next day, there was no evidence whatsoever.<n>

As we left the restaurant, I looked up in the sky and saw a grouping of lights that looked very strange.  There were three separate groups of lights.  The most prominent, and unusual one, was a series of three glowing orange spheres, parallel, and seemingly spaced evenly across.  Not far from this first light was a second group of two lights, both yellow-orange.  To the left of this one, there was a third single light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed these lights out to my girlfriend and mom, and we spent some time talking about what they could be.   At first, we thought they could possibly have been on a mountain, but as we continued driving closer, we realized that they were likely too high to be on one.  As we drove, the single light disappeared.  Then, a few moments later, the group of three orange lights also disappeared.  My mom commented that there was only one &amp;quot;group&amp;quot; of lights too.  Suddenly, they too disappeared.<n>

It was not moveing at a fast past, like hovering with no sound.  Without turning the object started moving north and became out of view.  This was not a plane because there were some in the distance.<n>

They were coming from the north, and heading south. The night sky was cloudless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first ones I saw seemed to be fairly close together, and traveling in a ‘V’ formation. Then I noticed more individual objects coming in from the distance behind them. None appeared to be going any faster than the others, and were traveling at a horizontal level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife and daughter out to see this unusual sight. I jokingly told them them the aliens were here. They came out and witnessed this with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of these brightly lit objects would slowly fade to solid black, then begin a slight downward flight, in a large arc across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought the setting sun from behind the hillside to the west was giving them the bright red/orange coloring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recalled that on the recent news that we could have meteor showers later tonight and into the early morning hours. I thought perhaps this was what we were seeing, but I have seen meteor showers before, and these looked nothing like that. There were no tails, they moved slowly what seemed in unison, and were very brightly colored as if they were on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife took a few photos with her camera phone, and posted them on Face book.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She called a couple TV stations which seemed to brush her off like she was making this up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we looked at photos of UFO’s on the Internet, a couple photos looked very similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes, they had disappeared entirely toward the Southwest, with no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The news reported that the meteor shower was to begin in a couple hours.<n>

While they were hovering and then beginning to move, they appeared to be lined up in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the immediate aftermath (15-30 minutes after), it seemed the jets in the area were flying much lower than normal toward O&#39;Hare, and there were several what looked like low-orbit satellites going by. (normally, we see what looks like a dim star going by - these were more like planet-brightness lights moving across.  we felt as though the jets and the &amp;quot;low-orbit satellites&amp;quot; may have possible been in response to whatever the colored/spinning lights event was.<n>

I ran upstairs to grab my camera and filmed it after it reappeared for the third time very close to us. It was as far as my camera could zoom so it&#39;s a little grainy, but very impressive in real life. We watched it land in a grove of trees where a park is near our home.   There was never any sound coming from it.  Could possibly be a toy, but it seemed to have flown too far &amp; too fast to be one.   Watched the area for about 20 minutes and we never saw it leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately posted the video to youtube :<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SfSbLUfucQ<n>
8/11/12 21:00|Orlando (Near Seaworld/Disney World)|FL|Triangle|Unknown, possibly about 5|I saw 3 very red lights hovering in a triangle shape near Sea World Orlando Florida and they dissappeared about 5 minutes later.|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91739.html|578|ndxe201208| I saw 3 very red lights hovering in a triangle shape near Sea World Orlando Florida and they dissappeared about 5 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were riding a roller coaster called Kraken in Sea World Orlando Florida, and we were being pulled up by a chain pull and we were just about to the top of the hill and I looked to the right towards Disney World and I saw 3 red lights in a triangle formation. They were very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I now we are going down the drop of the ride and I didnt see anything else.  I told everyone and everyone thought was crazy.  I wanted my father to see it so we went on again and I looked in the direction again and it was gone and there was a big thing of smoke that looked like a space shuttle took off in place of it. It couln&#39;t be fireworks because the lights were moving to the right they werent going up. They also lasted like 7 seconds and fireworks last for about 3 seconds. They were not flashing and were very close. Airplanes can&#39;t do that. Also airplanes don&#39;t dissapear or travel the whole horizon in 5 minutes. My dad said the millitary would be watching and the! y would send out helicopters and I think I saw 2 helicopters or maybe I saw the same helicopter twice. There is this video of the same thing happening in the same location 10 days prior. Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeaq0LIvCmA This was also on the news about this happening in another state a few months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the reason why they dissapeared was because I prayed to God for them to go away.<n>

It was hovering in one place, not moving to indicate being an airplane.  The lights on the object seemed to jump and shift.  Upon getting binoculars to look more closely it was triangular shaped with multi-colored lights on the bottom of it that shifted and blinked in patterns.  It remained in the same spot over 12 minutes with the light patterns changing regularly.  It then slowly moved south-west and disappeared on the horizon.  The observers ranged in age from 7 years old to 45 years old from varied backgrounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Hoovering way up in the air.  It stayed there for proll 30.min. It would move occasionally, but not very far. The lights kept spinning in circles kind of like a helicopter.  The whole object would flash/pulsate like it was doing morse code.  I could not hear anything, and it was too high for a elicopter, balloon, blimp etc. my wife and I saw it, along with my parents, neighbors, along with my buddy who lives apps. 2 miles away.   After 20min. I went inside and watched it fly away going SW, the saw it dive down until it fell below the tree/house line.<n>

We saw a huge orange one streak across the sky - I followed its path in the reverse direction, and saw what looked like a moving star.  I said to my friend - &amp;quot;Mike - that looks like a satellite&amp;quot;  He said yep, I see it.  We watched it for a few seconds (it was weird - we both noted that the meteor seemed to start exactly where we first noticed this anomoly), and I thought it was a satellite like I had seem many times as a kid.  Then, to our bewilderment, a yellow/orange beam or fire streak emanated from the bottom of it and went straight down towards the ground.  We both exclaimed &amp;quot;what the fuck!!&amp;quot;.  Then watched it in panic as we realized it was not a satellite, and much much closer.  The object then appeared to slow down (turn) and appeared to come towards us.  It then started to get extremely bright such that it reflected over the lake we were near.  I was in complete panic at t! his point.  The object then slowed, and got dimmer, turned, and disappeared over a mountain.  It looked exactly the same as the craft in the youtube video from Moscow - Aug 14. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oNphD4Iylg<n>

They looked like orbs (one of us thought they looked wider at the leading edge than at the tail) and appeared in a kind of formation of some kind that almost looked like a constellation moving across the sky.  We did not hear any sound, and the leading orange lights disappeared as they reached the eastern sky, possibly in a downward direction, gone from sight by about 8:18 p.m.  We took video, and the lights must have been in the sky for at least 5 minutes that we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I remember the date of the first one because it was the night our city does fireworks and a few neighbors were out watching fireworks.  I have had  two more since then.  These do not seem to be UFO sightings but, I cannot explain any of these things in any earthly way I know.  I have heard you say on coast to coast you want all reports.. So here goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first appeared to be some sort of garbage bag floating in the air floating and spinning which seemed a bit odd but even stranger was behind it was what I can only describe as a &amp;quot;whiff&amp;quot; of black smoke floating along a bit oval shaped this &#34;smoke&#34; did not change shape and seemed to stay course in the sky.  We waited for these things to come out from behind the trees and they never did.  They seemed to just vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days ago I saw what appeared to be a very bright planet in an area of the sky that I know there are not planets.  I walked to get a better view away from the trees and as I got to where I should have been able to see it better it was gone.  I didn&#39;t see it travel anywhere and I didn&#39;t see it disappear.  It was simply gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third was what appeared to be a flock of birds.. but, they seemed to be changing colors from black to white- they almost appeared to be changing color as somehow light was reflecting from different angels.  I&#39;m not sure how this is possible outside. It looked like two flocks of birds not really flying anywhere but being stationary they both appeared as the opposite’s colors one &#34;flock&#34; being black the other white as they were changing colors they were the opposite colors of each other.. IE~ while one was black the other was white, as I looked down to cross the street and looked back up again just mere seconds the whole thing was gone..  What struck me odd about these three things was the quickness of what I was seeing to disappear and the fact that two were in daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked the box to be contacted by an investigator.  I would like an explanation of these things if someone has time a short email is fine.<n>

Since we were looking for shooting stars, I paid close attention to the sky.  Within 5 minutes of being outside, I noticed the bottom left point was moving to the right, and the bottom right point was moving away from the square.  Soon thereafter, the former bottom right point continued moving until it disappeared.  At the same time, a new point was moving upwards toward the former square and towards the bottom left point.  I was aghast, surprised, and while my wife reprimanded me on my use of profanity--it is Summer, and my neighbor&#39;s windows are open--I noticed the former bottom left, new bottom right point move upwards slightly.  About 10 minutes later the upper left point was moving slightly! to the left, and up, away from the uneven square.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I am not a physicist, astronomer, or cosmologist, I am aware that &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot; do not move left, right, or upwards; &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot; do not assume the position of other &amp;quot;stars.&amp;quot;  What did I see?  I&#39;ve never before seen anything like this before, even when out in the middle of the country, where the stars are even brighter.<n>

They looked like they were gliding up from the horizon gently up and to the right.  They all seemed in sync with each other.  We watched this for about 30-40 seconds, then it looked like they went behind some clouds.<n>

After seeing a few, I continued to scan the sky and looked straight up.  Somewhere around Andromeda and Pegasus, I see this &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; or so I thought it was, start moving. I watched it for a few seconds, blinked to refocus, and still seen that it was moving. It moved in a straight line, slowly, no tail or tracer, not blinking, just white, small, and very dim but bright enough to be seen. Definitely an unidentified object, nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before.  It continued for about half a minute, maybe a little longer. Quickly, I called out to my wife, her sister, and brother-in-law. Luckily, my wife and brother-in-law was able to see it in the direction I was pointing.  They spotted it and followed until it disappeared towards Auriga and Gemini.  It was definitely too high for ordinary aircraft. Very weird and an amazing event to have captured with our naked eyes.<n>

They were unevenly spaced, blinking white, and lined up perfectly.  They covered about 60 degrees of my viewing width at an upward angle of about 25 to 30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving very very slowly Northward up the shore line.  At first, they seemed to be over Duluth and I thought they might be our antennae towers, but the distance I was from Duluth did not make sense because the angle of viewing was too steep from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another more faint string of lights directly overhead and lined up South to North. They were moving Northward much faster. Picture the speed of a high altitude jet moving....   then double or triple that for the speed I am talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working a delivery route and noticed as daylight came, they were gone.<n>

I have not told anyone else including my family as they would think I was nuts it scared the living shite out of me it was crazy it was not! the first strange event in the local area,twice over the past year there has been strange activity in the sky&#39;s above our neighbourhood one was a black  possibly camouflaged millitry helicopterthat hovered aboved the neighbourhood for 2 hours it was not a police helicopter or air ambulance which both are common in the air especially the air ambulance which sometimes Daily Lands  at the nearby hospital a police helicopter did however hover above the same spot as the black helicopter just days before after each incident I checked on flight radar 24 and there were no civilian aircraft in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I opened the door to smoke, I froze instantly, kind of shocked by what I was looking at.  I think it noticed me.  Unfortunately, by the time it moved into the tree, I went back inside to inform my room mate, but afterwards it was nowhere to be seen.  Right above the roof was a slow moving cylinder object, facing vertically. I can&#39;t recall the lights that were on it, but they were towards the top, almost like headlights.  The object had kind of a haze around it. It was literally close enough to touch the roof, sort of peaking out over the top from the other side. It made absolutely no noise and moved slowly across the roof and into the tree, where I lost sight of it.  I think it disappeared, but the dogs in the yard below us started to go NUTS.  Barking obnoxiously for about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As we began sitting up our chairs in the dark I thought I saw a spotlight flash across the mountain behind us.  We were in a large valley.  I chalked it up to my eyes playing tricks on me. We sat and watched the star show for about an hour when something made me look at the horizon just above the mountain we were facing.  I instantly noticed a bright, bright star that held my attention because it was so big and appeared to be pulsating different colors. It was above the tree line and I drew my companions attention to it because I wanted their opinions of what it was. As we stared at it and agreed it was a plane it began to bounce in a graceful arc above the trees. It moved in a way that we had never seen from an air craft. We got a little loud with fear and excitement. It seemed to react to our reaction and after the arc shaped bouning for a few seconds it! lowered itself behind the tree line and we could only see it slightly through the summer tree canopy. Needless to say, I watched the spot it dissappeared to all night ignoring the stars and never saw it rise above the tree line again. Was it alien or human aircraft. Perhaps a helicopter but no noise was heard(maybe too far away)and the graceful arc bounce was so unordinary we huddled together out of fear. I&#39;d love to know what we saw.<n>

It was completely dark with a clear sky.  We live in Blaine Washington, so we often go there in the evening/night to sit and look out and talk.  All of the sudden, coming from the North and just to the East side of White Rock, something appeared in the sky, and it looked like an airplane on fire.  We sat and watched not knowing what was going on, as the object moved slowly, and with no sound, to stop for a second or two just to the right of us, and about 1,000 - 5,000 feet above.  I can’t be certain of the height.  It then disappeared after a very brief fading of a split second or so.  We continued to sit in amazement, not sure what we had just seen, when, it came back.  I came about 3 or 4 minutes later, on the same path, again, looking like an object on! fire.  We didn’t hear anything, or see any shape or other lights on it.   We sat there for another 10 min. or so, and saw it come back, but this time it was quite a bit further North of us and quite a bit East of White Rock.  It disappeared again, and we finally left and drove back home.  I was happy to find this website with similar sittings!<n>

I notice several strange lights. The first ones I came across were long bright white flashy lights. These ones moved incredibly fast, mimicking an airplanes straight movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second craft I saw was around the exit of 5600 on 1-15 south bound. I was a large triangular shaped craft with one green flashing light, and 2 blue flashing lights on the matching corners. Also had white lights.  I noticed how slow it was moving, and then another craft shows up. This one, orange in color, a little boxey with six lights on the back.  This boxey orange craft hovered while the triangular craft went underneath it, then both crafts went in different directions.  Around 1:10am I look out my window and sure enough i see another suspicious looking craft.  I monitored it and it rose up in a wavy sort of motion. it looked like it was spinning around slowly and the light became noticeably brighter, colors went from! white to purple and green. It spun around again and headed towards salt lake in a floaty looking manor.<n>

I have to where glasses to watch movies (distance) and keep them on when I go outside to look at stars while I smoke. I was looking up in the sky and saw a bird soaring across the sky from west to east and my first thought was “wow” a hawk or eagle.  As it moved across the sky I started to realize it was different.  It wasn’t until it disappeared into the eastern horizon that I realized the following facts of what I just watched.  The bird, it had a perfect shape wings spread and all, appeared to light, not glow, just like the stars. It sailed across the sky without flapping its wings and the time it took from the moment I saw it, the upper west region of the sky, to the time it disappeared in the western side of the sky, not fully the lower horizon, could not be traversed by a bird.  And there was no wing flap, it was a perfect image of a large bird of pray moving across they sky wit! hout change. I have seen “stars” moving across the sky on these same types of moments when I step out for a smoke. I have seen what could be satellites, or some other space junk.  I have seen what are obviously are planes with the flashing lights and all. But I have never seen this.  It was a fully formed bird with wings spread, soaring across the sky without a single flap of the wings, at a height far above what a bird would soar, and a steady light, exactly like the stars. I have watched many a hawk, and even a couple of eagles, soar around the sky’s and when this was over I realized I had not seen either no mater how much it had the shape.<n>

The sky was very clear, as we walked up Crystal Springs away from Camden Ave about ½ way up the street I looked up to the left ( about 60-70% up in height in the sky) and there were 2 orange, what looked like bright stars, amongst the stars. These stood out because they were about 2-3X the size of others and were bright orange amongst all the other white stars. I pointed them out to the two girls with me and we watched them for about 5-10 min. At first they were stationary, then one started to move down and at an angle.  After moving a distance, in terms of the size of the light, about 20-30 times it size down,  it turned at a sharp right angle and traveled about 10-20 times it’s size to the right and stopped. Then it started up toward the ! other to a point that I thought it was going to go right into the other, then about 2-3 times it size away from the other, it stopped. From there in descended again, this time its light starting to flicker  and reduce in its brilliance, several times it almost went out but then lit up again, all the while it was descending, then it faded one last time and was gone. The other remained there and then it too descended and flickered and then at last it was gone entirely.  All 3 of us were watching the whole time and the kids were asking me what I thought it was, all I could say was that it was not an airplane, not a satellite, not a star, I’d never seen anything that color in the sky move in those directions and then disappear, so I said it must be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we retuned to the house, I sat in my back yard hoping to see something else looking up in the sky. While I did not see any more orange lights moving about, at 10:10PM my entire peripheral vision saw what looked like a meteorite streak across the sky with its tail in full view the entire time even after passing for a moment, it was lower than any shooting star I’ve ever seen, I would have thought it was the height of a high flying airplane. In the morning I looked hoping to see something in the local news paper but here was nothing so I Googled “strange lights in the sky” and saw clip after clip about just such orange lights. Then I Googled “Strange lights in the sky last night” and did see a post about someone in another state and possibly another county on the same Friday night, same time frame, seeing the same thing. Looking up now more often than even before….<n>

It moved closer and closer and it traveled passed our house and proceeded to travel until I lost visual due to other houses blocking my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Sighting lasted for about 3 min. from first notice until I lost visual contact with it.  The object was completely silent and very bright.  Planes fly in the sky around here a lot and are visible with their flashing lights this object was slightly lower than a plane, was dead silent, and had constant light coming from it.  This object was unlike anything I have seen before and I have watched the sky enough to kn! ow that it was in the atmosphere and not way up in space, and to know it was not an identifiable aircraft to me, or my parents.<n>

They appeared to be in a formation that looked like a lightning bolt. We saw them moving slightly one direction and appeared to be moving further away. We ran inside to grab cameras and when we came out, they were gone. We hopped on our bikes and biked a couple blocks and spotted a single orb traveling in the opposite direction. We were very disappointed we didn&#39;t get it on camera. The orbs were definitely not airplanes and they looked like lights in the sky I had never seen before.

Even in the city night sky, this triangle stood out like a sore thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an Isosceles triangle with one light at each corner.  The “triangle” was stationary and did not move through the sky.  While we were commuting the 20 minutes it took for us to get home in the country, my boyfriend kept his eye on the “triangle”.  The lights were brighter than any stars that were in the sky, and the lights were also larger than any stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got home we walked down the road to get a clearer look across a field.

8/10/12 02:00|Seattle|WA|Fireball|2 minutes|Lone Fireball flew over my apartment, zig-zagged, changed colors, flew off(?)|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91679.html|622|ndxe201208| Lone Fireball flew over my apartment, zig-zagged, changed colors, flew off(?)<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the second time now since July 7th, I have had another sighting of one of these things.  Last time I saw upwards of a dozen of these things fly over a grocery store. Last night/early this AM my girlfriend and I were standing on our balcony at 2am, gazing up at the night sky. We&#39;d seen a shooting star (no question in my mind) moments before this and a jet was creeping by off in the distance (no doubt again - could hear it and familiar with the light patterns on airliners).  Then, we saw one of these fireballs. I saw it first and gasped. Pointed up at the sky, said &amp;quot;HONEY LOOK HOLY S* THAT&#39;S ONE OF THE THINGS I SAW!&amp;quot; She watched it as I ran inside to grab something with a camera on it. It had come from behind us, flying over the top of our building at what appeared to be a relatively low altitude.  I started to capture video the best I could on my iPod touch...which isn&#39;t much obviously. Not a great video but I wanted to document it SOMEHOW for my! self mainly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s the strange thing....before I had a very difficult time describing just how odd this thing looked. This time I paid attention to every detail knowing that is what NUFORC needs. Luckily, on this occasion the thing made very erratic movements after coming in a north to south direction over our apartment complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did a sort of subtle zig-zag movement a few times, then glided into a change of direction to the left (East) in a motion that can only be described as perfectly organic. Ballerina like, very graceful and smooth.  At times it seemed to produce a bit of a red trail. It did change color dramatically unlike the last ones I saw. This time it started out BRIGHT yellow, almost white, faded to a blood red, then back to near white again. No real pattern to the changes that I could discern. Luckily my crappy video does at least show evidence of this to some degree, though not to the same degree as to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK here&#39;s the really strange thing... It had this..vibration to it. I don&#39;t mean that in some spiritual way or metaphysical pseudo-scientific sense....Imagine the way a guitar string looks when it&#39;s plucked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting motionless, you can see a guitar string perfectly without interference or distortion. Now if you *pluck* a guitar string, causing it to vibrate and  produce sound, you can still see it. It still maintains it&#39;s same general shape (a metallic line in the string&#39;s case) but it is moving so rapidly that it appears distorted. It gets blurry, sort of elongated at times, or wider at others, but in the center where it normally rests you can still see a basic ghost of it&#39;s shape and details.... It&#39;s definitely there, but your eyes can&#39;t keep up with it. That&#39;s what this thing appeared like. It was definitely round, but there was this weird fuzziness to it that was not caused by distance or lack of efficient eyesight. There was some kind of....other wordly or at least odd and very rapid motion to this thing....that&#39;s what I mean when I say it was &amp;quot;vibrating&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, it went left, going behind a tree, where I could still see it a bit with my naked eyes.  It sat there for a good minute at least, and eventually just was not there when I looked up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Definitely not a chinese lantern. I actually had set one off into the night after the experience I had on the 7th of July just to try to see if it in fact was what I had seen. I can unequivocally state it was not a chinese lantern. I at some point felt electric, the way you do before a lightning storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the weather report for today on the NOAA site, and at that time it looks like the wind was blowing in a Northern direction at about 5mph, max of 8.....but north is the exact opposite direction this thing was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I may upload the video but am hesitant to. It is not good quality, and on top of that I am audibly shaken up by what I&#39;m seeing and sound like a scared little girl or something so it&#39;s kind of embarrassing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ALTHOUGH.....I am a video professional by trade so in an attempt to clean up the crap video a bit and enhance it to get a better look at this thing..... I found something positively EERIE. Right before I stopped taping,  something that appears to be a &amp;quot;gray alien&amp;quot; face takes over the left side of the frame.  Note this only happens when I process the video to increase contrast and boost GAIN levels, which can cause distortion if done inappropriately.   In my opinion I don&#39;t think if grays exist, they have anything to do with fireballs or really care to associate with us, but it is definitely maybe worth noting.<n>

I was driving north along the El Camino College campus road when I stopped at a stop sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was staring up at the sky in the west when I saw what looked like a star but was moving at the speed of a commercial airliner. It’s flight pattern was at an angle and was heading from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it reached a certain height it’s white light went out but seemed to flicker like a dying bulb before doing so. It then changed direction. From south to north to east. This time flying at a level plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw that it was headed in my direction so I waited till it was above me. When it was overhead of me it was far away but I was able to see that it looked like a grey bubble or blob that was spinning like a saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this time Ive been stopped at the stop sign though no signs of any auto failure. The nearest cross street was Marine Ave and I facing North on Crenshaw Blvd. It was also a very clear night sky. The moon was also very visible in the east side of the sky. I believe it was a Third Quarter moon. I didn’t see any one else around who might have been staring at this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to fly East. I would have stayed out longer than I did to watch it but I was in a hurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Definitely one of those moments where a good camera and some photography skills would have been great to have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/9/12 23:30|Schofield Barracks|HI|Light|25 minutes|Non-moving object or light, flashing red, blue, green over a mountain range by Schofield|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91674.html|624|ndxe201208| Non-moving object or light, flashing red, blue, green over a mountain range by Schofield<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying in bed reading, my husband was sleeping, when I had the strange feeling that I should get up and look out of our bedroom window. It was like a thought that came – get up, because there’s something out there. I got up and walked to the window, moved the curtain and turned the blinds, and saw way off in the distance (between a palm tree and a regular tree across the street, in a north-westerly direction) a bright light the size of a large star, but flashing red, green, blue. I watched it for about 5 minutes and it never moved. I watched closely to see if it was just a star twinkling (all the stars twinkle here in Hawaii, every night), but I dismissed that because of the colors repeatedly flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I urged my husband to wake up and come look, to confirm that he saw it too. He reluctantly got up and came to the window, but was too sleepy and tired to focus on anything, and he went back to bed. I stayed at the window another 15-20 minutes to monitor this thing flashing colored lights, and it never once moved. I kept thinking, ‘This has got to be a star, or a pole/antenna on top of the mountain range – it’s not moving an inch.’ Shortly after midnight, black clouds covered the entire area and I could no longer see the flashing colored lights or any other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pinpointed the exact spot I saw this light by using the trees as landmarks – the light was just above the bottom-most branch of the palm tree, on the right side of the regular tree and the left side of the palm tree.  I tried taking a picture or video of the flashing lights, but it was so far away that it didn’t register on my camera or video camera.  When I woke up this morning, I went straight to the window to see if the light could have been a pole/antenna on top of the mountain range next to Schofield – and based on the position of the light relative to the palm tree – there’s no way.  The light was clearly in the sky, not supported in any way by the mountain range – the mountains were far below the spot where I saw the light flashing various colors.<n>
8/9/12 23:30|Puget Sound/Seattle|WA|Unknown|2 hours|Object with three orange lights hovering over cruise ship and shoreline in Puget Sound|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91802.html|625|ndxe201208| Object with three orange lights hovering over cruise ship and shoreline in Puget Sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the last night of our 8 days Alaska cruise on August 9, 2012 aboard Royal Caribbean’s Rhapsody of the Seas.  We were sailing southeast, based on positions of the Dippers, at low speed from Victoria, BC to Seattle, WA at 11:30 PM.  We would pick up local port pilot at 12:30 AM to enter Puget Sound en-route to Seattle.  I could see some shoreline lights to the port (left) side of our ship. When I checked maps after arriving home, the shoreline must be Ebey’s Landing, WA and we were 2.8 miles from the shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Deck 9 Solarum is a large sunroom with an indoor swimming pool, a food bar, and tables and chairs for guests to relax and eat food.  Clear lookout windows occupy entire left and right sides of the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting at a table near a window panel with my wife and a friend, chatting. Not far from us were eight teenagers, probably made friends during the cruise and didn’t want to go back to staterooms too early on the last night of the cruise. There were five or six other people in the Solarum at the time and three crewmembers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 11:30 PM, all the teenagers jumped up from their seats and lined up the windows, looking out. Two adult guests away from us also rushed to the windows. I first thought they saw a whale in the dark, sighting whales had been one exciting thing to do on this cruise. I stood up casually and looked out the window, and there was this craft with bright orange lights hovering over front starboard (right) side of the ship. I ran quickly up to deck 10 to get an open view, this craft has three bright orange lights forming a triangle, inside the triangle are smaller circulating lights forming a circle. The craft was absolutely silent, I looked at it for about 5 seconds and pulled out my iPhone, I moved my sight away from the craft briefly to my phone, wanting to set it to video mode. When I looked up again, the craft was gone. It was hard to estimate the size or elevation of the craft since I only had a brief look at it. I thought it was an exciting but way too brief an encoun! ter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the port side to see if I could spot northern light since people had posted photos online of northern light taken in Vancouver in July, just one month earlier, and this night was the first time we had clear sky for any skyward observation. I could see dim low hanging lights but I convinced myself it was only inland city lights. That’s when I noticed an object with two or three orange pulsing lights above the ground at about 15 degrees angle. Since we were 2.8 miles from the shore, I would estimate the object was 3 to 6 miles from us, making its elevation at between 4,000 to 7,000 feet. This object stayed at the same spot for more than 10 minutes and I was convinced it wasn’t an airplane or helicopter. I called my friend in his stateroom and asked him to bring up his Nikon DX camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The friend came up to deck 10 ten minutes later. To this point, the object had been hovering at the same spot for more than 20 minutes.  He played with his camera’s focus and y speed for low light far-object shooting. He used the max zoom of his AF-S Nikkor 55-200mm lens, it’s probably 3.6x times 1.5 DX camera factor to 5.4x zooming.  The object just stayed near the same spot, from time to time shifting left-to-right and near-to-far, so my friend had plenty of time to adjust his camera, it wasn’t easy though because the low light condition.  The attached photos were all taken with the same optical zoom and cropped with the same digital zoom factor, from 4,285x2,848 frames to 500x400 frames.  One red point in one of the photos is a camera pixel defect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, we saw a small airplane flying to and pass the object.  As I was Google mapping, I noticed there are several small airports in the area.  At another point, which I missed, my friend saw two pulses of bright yellow flashes on the ground right below the object.  Our wives and a friend had also joined us to witness the sighting as well as two late shift crewmembers.  My wife described she could see circulating lights around the object.  Finally, around 1:30 AM the object moved inland and we stopped viewing.<n>

I noticed a bright white light in the sky over some trees across the street. I didn’t think much of it because we have a lot of air traffic over our area all the time. I thought it was just a plane coming toward us. We continued talking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then he saw it and stopped talking. I turned to look again where he was looking and realized that it had not moved any since I first saw it.  We started discussing what it could be.  We still thought it may be a plane far away coming toward us.  About a minute later, the bright light drifted slightly up and right, got a dimmer pinkish color then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never heard anything.  We see what we assume are satellites frequently, it wasn’t that.  We’re outside a lot and always looking up. We’ve seen a lot going on up there (even called the police once). I’m tired of keeping it to ourselves out of fear that non-believers will think we’r! e crazy. Someone else is seeing what we are, and maybe this will be the place to finally get the validation we’re looking for. Thanks for listening (reading).<n>
8/9/12 22:00|Yardley|PA|Oval|4-5 minutes|Three pulsating objects in the sky, moving independently and joined by two more before disappearing|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91670.html|627|ndxe201208| Three pulsating objects in the sky, moving independently and joined by two more before disappearing<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10 PM EST on Thursday, August 9, 2012 I went outside of my home located in Yardley, PA to put my dogs outside before going to bed.  I was standing on my back patio waiting on my dogs when I noticed my ears starting to ring and my left ear started to hurt. I called my dogs and when they didn’t come, I walked out towards my gazebo. I looked to the left at my two dogs that seemed to be staring up at my house.  I looked in the direction that they were looking and that is when I saw three distinct bright lights moving erratically in the sky towards the northwest. It was cloudy and I quickly looked around the sky to see nothing else – no stars – no moon – just these lights.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing – all I knew is that I have never seen an airplane or helicopter that moved like this.  These lights were oval in shape, seemed to have form and were not transparent, smaller than a full moon but larger than a star or planet in the sky.  They w! ere changing color from blue to green to yellow to orange-red and pulsated.  The three lights were independently moving up, down, in circles, from left to right in no particular pattern and they were leaving a light trail behind them as they moved. Like they were moving so quickly I was seeing a trail not like a rocket trail or an exhaust trail from an airplane.  The best way to describe it is if you have a glow stick and are waving it around at night – you see a trail of light behind it.  When they were stationary they seemed to stay mostly a bluish color and when they moved they seemed to change colors to green, yellow and even looking almost orange-red at one point before they seemed to dim and then they were bright blue again.  I would compare their flickering and changing color to watching fireflies in the summer.  When they got dimmer they almost seemed to disappear and then re-appeared bright blue-white.  The longer I watched the more I realized I was definitely not lookin! g at an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden the three independent lights formed a line and stopped moving. To the naked eye they seemed to be in equal spacing from each other. It was at that point that I realized my ears stopped ringing and my left ear no longer hurt. I briefly took my eyes off of the lights since my dogs finally decided to run over to me and when I looked back up the experience just got more bizarre! These three stationary lights now had balls of light dropping from them!!   Or maybe falling from them? I couldn’t tell how far they were falling because my house and a tree were blocking my view.  At this point I panicked and decided I needed to run to my front yard to get a better view and I kept watching because I didn’t want to miss anything – I just felt compelled to keep watching because I wanted to figure out what I was seeing and quite honestly watching something fall from these lights just scared me!  I had a ton of thoughts running through my head – “are these bombs? I’m not h! earing any explosions – why am I not hearing an explosion? If these aren’t bombs – what the heck are they?” As I got on the other side of my gate and latched it behind me my ears started ringing again and the balls of light dropping from the other lights had stopped. I ran and stood in my front yard now and was trying to decide if the dropping balls of light had disappeared behind other trees or just disappeared in the sky.  I certainly didn’t hear anything explode – I didn’t hear any sound just the ringing in my ears. I just couldn’t tell and I had lost sight of the objects for a few seconds while running. Then I see two more orbs of light coming from opposite ends of the sky – streaking across the sky. One from the northeast and the other from the southwest – they momentarily stopped and then darted into the line with the other three lights, lining up on either end of the other three. Now there were five bright lights in a line, in the sky and coincidence or not – they stopped moving my ears stopped ringing! They did not appear to be moving and they were staying in a line with each other all the while changing colors – blue to green to yellow, then orange-red then dim then repeating that sequence. It was then that I noticed they were not changing colors together but it did seem synchronized though. My rational mind was trying to determine if there was a pattern to the lights when they all just abruptly started moving erratically – just as the first three did and then both ears were back to ringing and my left ear seemed to be taking the brunt of it. This is when I had the first thought of “is someone else seeing this?” And then I was debating with myself that it’s only 10PM – someone else has to be seeing this! My dogs were barking as were a few other dogs I could hear besides my own. As quickly as all five objects were moving – all five stopped and darted back into a line. From five different areas in the sky and all of the sudden they are lined up again in the matter of a seco! nd or two! That kind of startled me and I’m thinking, “now what?” and a little bit of panic was setting in. I literally was waiting for all five of these objects to start dropping light balls or start changing color since that is what happened before but that didn’t happen.  Instead I see another object approaching and it was moving much slower and seemed to be a lot closer to the ground than the other objects. I’m watching this wondering if it’s going to join the other five lights or even shoot it. That was a scary thought! As quickly as I had that thought all five objects flashed brightly or got bigger (almost looking like a glowing aura) and then just went straight up in the sky and disappeared. I couldn’t tell if they disappeared in clouds or just disappeared completely.  My ears did not ring when they moved this time and I’m not sure why? The one object still was in the sky and as it got closer I could see it, hear it and identify it as an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole experience lasted somewhere between 5-10 minutes. I wish that I could be more accurate, but honestly, I lost track of time while all of this was going on.  It’s every unsettling and has left me with more questions. I don’t know what I saw.  All that I do know is that stories like this are SO easy to dismiss until they happen to you and hopefully in my lifetime I will have the answers that I now seek.<n>

It seemed as though it would move forward a little then stop and move forward and stop.  Then the lights started to fade as if it was going behind or above the clouds.  There was no sound at ALL.  About an hour latter a plane went by, we could not see the plane at all, but we could defiantly hear it.  So for this orange light to be as low as it was and make not one single sound then disappear seems to be very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we faced south we could see the object which appeared at first to be a very bright star.  My girlfriend pointed it out to me and asked if it was a star.  It became apparent that it was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the object would move to the west in short but rapidly accelerated bursts.  The object would then rapidly change course and head to the north or several times appearing to reverse direction or wobble side to side but in a very rapid fashion.  We observed the object doing these short bursts and also observed it stand completely still.  The object would also intensify and dim in brightness but this did not seem to be related to any type of cloud cover or change in distance.  It also did not change intensity in light on any type of timed interval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 30 minutes a fireworks display shot off by Sea World had concluded and the object seemed to remain stationary at this point.  It should be noted that when the fireworks started the object also paused for a period of several minutes then resumed its irregular flight maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent 8 years in the United States military during which time I was in a flight unit with fixed wing aircraft and helicopters.  I can say that this craft moved in ways I have never seen military or commercial aircraft move.<n>

They were going up and twards us but not making any sound then they cut north of us and disappeared.  Then a few seconds later 4 more came from where the first two originated.  They weren&#39;t moving in any type of formation or anything, but like the other two cut north and disappeared.  Then we saw a single one follow the same route.  We had a tower with a flashing light so we judged the altitude to be aprox 1000 feet and they objects we saw were approximately 2 miles away from us.  They were orange on the Bottem it seamed and red on top of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We had already been star gazing for 15-20 minutes or so, and we were looking at the constellation Scorpius (to our South-West I believe). All of a sudden, a light (just like a star) was moving through Scorpius at a steady pace (which must have been very quickly, because this light/object was so far away, it seemed like a star moving). I pointed to the light/object moving through the constellation we were looking at, and my husband confirmed that he saw it too.  We were silent as we watched it move, and within 8-10 seconds the light/object slowly faded from existence.  We looked at each other wide-eyed, and then stared back at the area of sky around Scorpius for another 5 minutes and never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light/object covered about the distance of 6 inches across the sky before it started fading and eventually disappeared.  The light/object moved in exactly a straight direction, and as it disappeared it was still moving in the same straight direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudless night until after midnight, so the light/object didn’t disappear behind clouds. My husband is Army and has been on multiple types of helicopters.  It was unlike a shooting star, meteor, helicopter, jet, commercial airliner we’ve seen, and we’ve seen all types of aircraft on Oahu; this wasn’t one of them.  This light/object was simply too far away to be an aircraft of ours – this was in space. The light/object moved at a constant speed, slower than a shooting star.  It was definitely an object or vehicle, not a shooting star or meteor.<n>

They formed what looked like the constellation of the big dipper for a short period before breaking into yet another form where 3 of them made a distinct triangle apart from the others.  I was driving and turned away from them to go down another road to get to store.  When I got back to intersection about 4 minutes later, I saw only one fireball left in the sky and watched it float north in the sky for about 20 more seconds before driving off away from it. Never have I witnessed anything in the sky like this before.<n>

Compared to all the overseas jets that fly over Glace Bay this thing seemed to be about 10 to 15 times the size of a jumbo jet   And we could clearly see it was at a high altitude above the clouds.  Whatever this was, it was big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started out looking like a ball of fire and then it was like someone turned off a light switch and the firey glow stopped and all you could see was the large round dark shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked online to see if the ISS was flying over cause we&#39;ve seen it before at night and thought it might have been light play from the evening sun but the online tracking system didn&#39;t have the ISS anywhere near Atlantic Canada at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently there was also a sighting in the Mira Bay area of Cape Breton a week earlier which I didn&#39;t find out about until October.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

8/9/12 09:03|Seattle|WA|Cigar|1 minute|Bright object in sky fades away over Seattle|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91667.html|637|ndxe201208| Bright object in sky fades away over Seattle<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling northbound on I5 (http://goo.gl/maps/PH2Za) while riding my motorcycle.  Having a helmet view of the sky I could see everything very clearly. It was bright and mostly clear. There were a few distant cirrus clouds but when I saw this object it was back-dropped by clear blue sky. The object was flat and bright and moving easterly and  at an approximate 4 or 5 degrees angle upward. The brightness of the object could have been sunlight gleaming from it but it was much brighter than one would normally expect even having sunlight bounce off of it. There was a gleam about the object that appeared to move on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that the object was a jet since this location is near Boeing, and to be honest, it could have been, I guess.  It was probably four or five miles from me, I estimate, and it was about an half-inch wide from my perspective. After watching this object for around 10 seconds the background of the object changed so that th! ere was a very distant and slightly transparent, small cirrus cloud.  As the object approached the location in the sky where the background became the cloud, the object could be seen completely until the last part of the object was forefronted to the cloud at which point the object slowly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I saw the fading occur, I will admit that I was in a slight turn on the freeway which put me in a more north east direction. I continued to watch the location of the sky where the object existed. After a few seconds, I ended up in a more sharp curve putting me in a north direction of travel again while still maintaining as close an eye to that part of the sky without getting in an accident but that object never reappeared *anywhere* in the sky. The cloud in the back ground was small so any flying object would have left that area of the sky back into clear blue sky within seconds. This object did not and I was never able to see the object again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

8/9/12 05:07|Silver Lake|MN|Unknown|3 -4 minutes|Two high altitude, high speed craft converge on each other, one bright white, the other yellowish-gold|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91633.html|638|ndxe201208| Two high altitude, high speed craft converge on each other, one bright white, the other yellowish-gold<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 9, 2012, I was walking my dogs (going West) at 5:07 am in the morning near an open park, when my attention was drawn to the sky by a bright flash. When I looked up, there was a momentary streak moving from the West to the East. I thought it was a meteorite disintegrating in the atmosphere. As I watched the same area of the sky, I noticed two unidentified craft. One craft was moving from the North going Southbound, while the second craft was moving from the South going Northbound. They were moving towards each other. The craft from the South was bright white, and the craft from the North was less bright, and was yellowish-gold in color. Neither craft was emitting flashing marker lights. The craft were very high up in the sky. I am unable to determine an exact rate of speed, but they were moving at good pace. I would say if they were high-altitude jets, they were moving at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the two crafts continuing to converge, there was another streak of bright light from the West going East. The streak appeared to pass between the converging craft before erupting into a bright ball and dissolve into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two craft passed each other in parallel, neither craft altered its course. The Northbound craft appeared to pass on the right (East side). I cannot judge distance at that altitude, but I would have to say that they were within a mile or less of each other. The two craft continued to travel in their respective directions in straight, unwavering lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a few more moment to see if there would be any more activity, and then continued walking my dogs. I looked up occasionally to track the position of the two crafts. When I stopped to look more intently, the Southbound craft appeared to stop in the Southern sky (it did not move or change directions with respect to trees and buildings on the ground, it did not reduce or enlarge in shape). But I cannot be absolutely certain. I lost track of the Northbound craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later into my walk I saw a jet flying from the Southeast to the Northwest. This jet had the normal flashing marker lights and was flying at a lower altitude than the two other crafts. I suspect it was a commercial aircraft leaving the MSP airport (it is normal to see these in the morning). MSP is about 50 miles East of Silver Lake. The observed pace of the jet, even though it was at a lower altitude, moved at a slower rate of speed compared with the two high-altitude craft. As the jet passed to the West I could hear its jet engines.  There was no sound heard at ground level from the two high altitude crafts, nor from the two streaks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions: Cool, around 68 deg F, humidity approx.: 58% Clear skies, no cloud coverage, the moon was visibly bright, there were still a few star formations visible, the sun was still below the horizon. Venus and another planet were visible in the Eastern skies (they twinkled).<n> <n><n> <n><n> No wind, the air was still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was completed on 8/9/2012 at 10:55 am<n>

(reoccuring)<n> <n><n> <n><n> On two separate occasions I witnessed glowing objects in flight that ranged in size from firefly size to navel orange size. The first sighting happened Tuesday August 7, 2012 at approximately 11:30 pm. I was sitting on the deck with my friend and about 60 yards away in the distance we saw glowing objects flying right above a 2 story house in front of the chimney.  From what I could tell, they were round, or spherical objects that could change their size.  At the very least they would appear to be the size of a firefly but much brighter, and at times the objects would appear to grow to the size of a navel orange, but then shrink and disappear.  I watched these objects fly around for about 15 minutes. I walked away for 10 minutes then returned and the objects were still there.  On Friday August 10, 2012 at approximately 3 AM I witnessed the objects again, they were flying around in the same place as before.  This time I had binoculars and with getting a closer look!  I was able to detect that they were not fireflies.  They seemed to maneuver like moths, in a rather erratic fashion.  But they did not have wings.  One of the objects which was about the size of a ping pong ball flew in a corkscrew maneuver within what seemed like an area of 2 feet or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the objects flew within an area of about 3 feet, I did not witness the objects flying away from the area in front of the chimney.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the objects were to appear again.<n>

Each one was about the size of 2 or 3 stars.  They are staying in the same area but zig zag, shoot around in all directions &amp; also hover.  My husband &amp; father both saw them as well. I counted at least 10.<n>

I just happened to look up into the sky and see an orange triangle (best described as the shape of a typical paper airplane) flying through the sky at tree line level. It seemed to have flames coming out of the back of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire object was the color of fire.  I guess it looked like a paper airplane (triangle) on fire, shooting through the air.  It moved very fast and disappeared behind a tree. I waited for it to emerge from behind the tree and it did not. I did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds after this sighting, I saw two bright consecutive flashes in the distance.  The night sky on this evening was VERY clear. I immediately went back inside, as I was a little spooked and alone with my infant son.  I remained inside for the duration of the evening.<n>

I noticed 3 strange reddish-orange spheres in the sky and so parked to look.  As we watched, I noticed that they were slowly moving from a southern position towards the east.  More appeared that were following the first.  I unrolled the windows and turned the car off to listen for noise (plane and helicopter traffic is common in our area).  There was no noise noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and watched 10 to 12 of these lights all head in the same direction.  I then pulled the car into the garage and put my son to bed.  I then went upstairs and looked out my east facing bedroom window and witnessed what appeared to be 2 more (or was it the final 2 in the parade we had witness out front?) heading over the trees to the east.  This sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes.<n>

I walked away from the fire to observe the stars, and saw two red objects over the ocean at about 30° off the horizon, quite far offshore.  They were stationary. They began pulsing and fading after about 30 seconds, then disappeared.  I waited about 5 minutes and saw another one by itself this time. I called my son over, and we both watched it do exactly the same thing as the first two.  I got a photo of the second occurrence, although it just looks like a small red dot on a black background. If these are planes as someone else in this forum suggested he saw by Astoria, they behaved like no planes I’ve ever seen, and if I was American I’d want to know what’s going on up there.  Actually,  I still want to know what’s going on up there.  I can email you the photo if you like.<n>

My first thought was that it was only a faster-than-regular-moving satellite when, all of a sudden, it disappeared. About 4 seconds later it re-appeared (following the same flight path) and began to fluctuate in brightness and intensity. I thought for a moment that I saw 2 smaller very dim lights on either side of the main light, but they quickly disappeared into the blind spot of my eyes. I opened the screen door and called out to my roommate to come quickly to where I was, and she rushed outside. I pointed it out, but again it had disappeared. As we stood there it reappeared again and continued to fluctuate in brightness and intensity. We watched it for about a minute, reappearing and disappearing about 3 times, sometimes looking almost ! like a very soft pinkish color, and then we lost it behind the roof of an adjacent house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Almost nightly there are bright glowing orbs that are orange/ white in color.  They are stationary until just before dawn.  I have personally witnessed one raise from below to the tree line rapidly moving vertical until it was positioned close to the moon, and there it stays. Naturally I know its not by the moon but it&#39;s relation to the moon&#39;s position in the sky is strange. It isn&#39;t a star or jupiter as my friend tried to explain.  I dont know what it is and the pictures I have taken arent very good quality but they are pictures of what I am describing and feel free to check it out. I would like to know what it is.  I took these throughout the month of August and September 2012.

I looked up at the stars as I do late at night.  Then I noticed a &amp;quot;Star&amp;quot; that looked very bright and was kinda an orangish red.  It was not a planet or star though and it wasnt a high flyin jet. I can see high flying jets at night they blink on each wing this thing didnt blink at all.  As I was looking at this weird &amp;quot;Star&amp;quot; it started to move slow at first but then accelerating to a speed that I thought was very fast since it was over the horizen in just under 5-6 seconds. I only wish i had had time to get my video camera.  I look in the same spot of the sky every night since then at the same time an have not seen it since.<n>

This happened sometimes vertically sometimes horizontally.  I estimate it was located north west of san ramon about 10-15miles away.<n>

It was a single orb, glowing solid orange, and it moved steady and fairly fast. I witnessed it pass over from the treetops on my left to the treetops on my right cross the sky in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I did not have any other object to compare it with it is hard to tell what the altitude was, but it was not that high up in the air. It looked to be fairly low to the ground (no more than a few thousand feet). It emitted no sounds that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a distinctive ball shape ... not just a point of light. It did not flicker, change colors, etc. It remained constant in brightness and was distinctively orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen many satellites, the ISS, northern lights, shooting stars, and so on. I&#39;ve been a lifelong observer of the night sky. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. Furthermore, I hold a Ph.D. in philosophy, teach critical thinking, and am a skeptical person by nature. This was a really unique experience for me.<n>

It appeared to stop moving and hover in one spot for a short time the turned, went a short distance then appeared to burn out.  Shortly after that a second &amp;quot;burning fireball&amp;quot; came out of the sky and behaved the same as the first.  About 30 minutes later, we saw what looked like a flashing strobe light moving in a random, zig-zag pattern coming from the north and moving south at a very high speed. It was gone in a matter of ten seconds or so, it flew across the sky with no noise and at a speed that was never seen before by a man made machine.  I still can not believe what we seen in the sky, it was kind of scary!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We noticed a bright orange ball at a high altitude moving fairly quickly across the sky. At first I thought it was a satellite. The porch faces North East and the craft was moving from south to north as it was slightly east of us. It was headed over luzerne county towards Scranton. There were no red or green lights as on an aircraft or helicopter and it was silent, ie. no doppler effect. As it went towards the horizon the orange glow pulsated and faded into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were located on mid East Grand Ave.  It appeared to rise up above a motel on the beach and had not come into view from across the sky.  At first it looked like a rather large glowing &amp;quot;glob&amp;quot; so to speak, until it got closer and was a little higher in the sky. At first sighting there was no specific shape to it.  I thought it might be a flare but as it gained altitude and came over us it took the shape of a cross, more so in the shape of a Christian Style Cross.  The cigar shaped structure that may have represented the belly was rounded at both ends, the cross structure that may have represented wings on a regular aircraft were too short to be wings of an aircraft and also were rounded on the ends. The glow was so florescent you could not tell if there was anything above it, such as height to the craft. My friend said if it&#39;s an airplane than it&#39;s on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both noted there were no lights flashing as there would be on a passing aircraft. I&#39;m not sure of the speed but it did not travel as fast as a jet, it made no sound and appeared to be lower in the sky than a passing aircraft would be.  It almost seemed to be floating and the yellow aura around it was clear and the whole unit was glowing.  I watched it as it went over us heading north towards the Pine Point Area. About time it was in the Pine Point area it seemed to become a small ball of light and was gone. As this sighting was occurring, an aircraft was passing over head which made it very apparent to us that what we had just seen was not an aircraft. Not sure if the aircraft coming after the sighting was checking out this craft as it came shortly after this craft passed over us, I&#39;d say within 3 mins of our sighting. Not sure if this plane was commercial or military as it flew low in the sky, was not a jet, and appeared to be heading in same direction as the object and also at! low altitude. We had a camera inside but didn&#39;t think to go i! t as we could not believe what we were seeing and wanted to watch and see what happened.<n>

A bright star catches my eye. It&#39;s beaming white like a bright 8 point star, then it starts to move in a straight horizontal or slightly curved path.  The object had the brightness of multiple stars.  It looked like it was about the altitude of a light aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for at least a minute until we lost visual as it crossed over the tree line. The object had no sound, and moved at speeds of a light aircraft.  Roughly 10 minutes later it appeared in the same general area we originally saw it, and disappeared within a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like the light blinked or ingulfed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later it showed up in a different location, blinked, then you could see an object trailing like a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw it 1 more time blink above us around 1 AM and called it a night.<n>

It moved under/through the constellation Cassiopea.  The object was moving around the same speed as an airplane but was wobbling erratically, appearing to change direction on numerous occasions. After around two minutes, a second smaller sphere appeared and seemed to be orbiting around the first object for about 15 seconds then disappeared. The sphere continued to move east and vanished into the clouds/horizon.<n>

Didn&#39;t change shape or color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time we have seen a very similar orange orb acting this way. The first time was in the begining of July.

These were in a distinct linear pattern with what appeared to be a few thousand feet of separation.  We thought they could be aircraft traveling in an approach pattern, however, there was no movement off these lights.  They simply appeared, remained stationary for a period of 30 seconds to 1 minute and then they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The top of the triangle was facing up and all three lights strobed. Low to middle of the sky (lower than all the stars). Dont know exactly how long it was there because we noticed it as we were driving and when we got home decided to go back out and look for it and it was gone.  It was in the sky for at least a half hour. Saw 3 cars pulled over, not sure if they were looking at it or it was just chance.  My cousin (14) first noticed it then I (19) did. Called up my friends (19 and 20) that were in my same area and they also noticed it. We are all in to UFO&#39;s and knew the classic triangle formation when we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my first encounter where i was 100% confident it was a UFO.<n>

Appeared on the east side, approaching toward west side, mid speed, no sound, two of them flied relatively low over me, I couldn’t estimate the distance. They passed me, and since I was driving  I couldn’t follow them any longer. I was a little nervous to stop and look back for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a picture when they were distant, but doesn’t show much,  I turned my camera off, I didn’t expected them to come my way, and as they quickly moved, I didn’t have time to set my camera again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day, I pass the same street at about 11:00 PM, (Square Lake Rd &amp; Coolidge)  I was looking for them again, I saw about 3 of them on my right (South of Square Lake Road) that day I stopped, I wanted to get a video but they didn’t registered very well. I still have a picture and the video.<n>

As I was looking in that direction (north) I saw a bright orange ball about 1/2 mile away with the port and starboard edges appearing to be brighter than the center. I thought it was a little lower than an aircraft should be over town so i ran about 30 ft to my car to retrieve my 7x50 binoculars, as I had been using them earlier to observe boats on the local lake. What i thought was an orange ball was actually 3 glowing orange balls in a triangle shape (2 in front, 1 in the rear) on the bottom of a light colored (silvery) disk shaped craft.  The whole thing was surrounded by a very bright orange halo like a round ball. It was flying due south, about the speed of a normal small plane at about 1000 ft altitude, and flew diectly over me and made absolutly no sound. I estimate it was about 40 or 50 ft in diameter.  It flew about 1/2 mile past sraight and level then began climing at about a 30 degree angle without increasing speed. As it climbed it slowly faded in brightness until I could no longer see it with the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes later, a helicoter came from north, north/west and flew exactly in the direction of the craft at about the same altitude and speed. I couldn&#39;t make out if the helicopter was military or civilian, I will say that helicopters fly in and out of the local prison (1 mile away) and the local hospital (2 miles away) so this may have been unrelated to the craft.  As it was flying a perfect intercept course this would have been quite the coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish to remain completely anoymous as there&#39;s nothing more I can tell you that isn&#39;t contained in this report, except to say that the local prison seems to be a magnet for these things. (Yes, I&#39;ve seen them before.  They like to hover over the old State Home Cemetery about 200 yds off the east parimeter of the prison at about 1000 ft altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were 5 or 6 very bright lights that appeared to the south.  All were in a half moon shape and seemed fairly distant from one another but also seemed like they were all in line in the half moon shape.  They all came on, and then went off and then back on in random order. Not flares for sure.  Then later about 10 minutes,one glowed again by it&#39;s self but not the others. I asked another family walking by if they seen it and they said yes and that they just saw the same thing further north about 30 minutes earlier and we both agreed we have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am prior service in the Army and have seen choppers and A10 shoot their flares out in the day and night while serving in Iraq.  This was certainly not the same thing. Very strange how they were all in perfect position in a half moon shape. Later there was some sort of plane that flew in the direction of ! the spheres that seemed to fly as fast as a jet but the spheres were quite a ways away and over the ocean so I could not tell what kind of plane it was. Also, a helicopter flew quite a ways out over the ocean in a circle around the surf, much further out that what the tourist choppers have been flying. I don&#39;t know what it was, but as far out as the spheres were and as bright as they were would make me think that it was not a normal occurrence. My son, myself, and the 3 other people from the other family, that I know of, seen this happen.<n>

The light stopped then began moving again but also began to fade in and out, after which a dark outline could be seen in the glow of the city lights.  I could see a clockwise rotation of the craft which was roughly circular, but had tentacle like extensions and seem to change shape. I could hear no sound from it.  It stopped almost directly overhead and ,at fist length, it was the size of a walnut.  The outline of the object suddenly began to get much larger and quickly became as large as a basketball at fist length.  At this point I felt as though my life were in danger and I sprinted for my front door ( I had initially went out to get my mail and spotted it at the mailbox )as I was sure it was going to hit the ground or stop directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After making it in the house I waited a few seconds then began looking out the windows to see where the object was. I couldn&#39;t see anything so I ( slowly ) went back outside to see what happened. Nothing was around but I quickly spotted the same orange light back to the north roughly were I had spotted it originally.  At this point I decided to run back into the house and obtain my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily it was still there and I was able to view it.  The objects orange light was emitting from the outer edge and looked like some sort of thrust, being bright at the source, then fading outward, not flickering like a flame, but more like light.  It slowly rotated around the outside but did not appear to affect its direction.  I could not make out any specific surface detail but their were things protruding from it.  I watched it as long as I could for about a minute before I lost sight of it. I don&#39;t know it this was a second object or the same one I spotted originally.<n>
8/7/12 21:45|DeBordieu Beach|SC|Sphere|30 minutes|Orange spheres and white lights over the coast of South Carolina|11/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94050.html|699|ndxe201208| Orange spheres and white lights over the coast of South Carolina<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on vacation with extended family at DeBordieu Beach in South Carolina during the week of August 4 -11, 2012.   We were staying in an oceanfront house and on August 6th I went down to the end of the boardwalk to watch the ocean and look at the stars at about 9:45 pm.  While there I saw an orange light, circular in shape, come on over the ocean, then a few seconds later another.  The first light then dimmed and went out, followed by the second light.  Seconds later another light followed by two more.  All three dimmed and went out in order of their appearance.  This went on for about 15 minutes, the orange lights coming and going sometimes 2, sometimes 3 or 4, always dimming and extinguishing in order of their appearance.  When they stopped appearing, I saw a group of white lights moving across the sky, away from the ocean and over the beach and the houses before disappearing.  They were not blinking and they were not in any type of uniform order, just a ! group of white lights. They did not start out over the ocean in the same spot as the orange lights, but a bit to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not mention what I had seen to the family because I knew they would make fun of me!  However the next day I looked up “orange lights over the coast of South Carolina” on the internet and this website popped up.  All the descriptions were very similar to, or exactly like what I had seen.  I told the family then and another friend and her family who were staying a few blocks down the beach.  Of course there were skeptics, so I challenged everyone to come out on the beach the following night, August 7th, to see if the lights showed up again.  We headed out to the beach at about 9:15 pm and waited patiently. Sure enough, after about 10 minutes the orange spheres lit up again, exactly as before.  My friend and her family were was also on the beach in front of their house.  We had our phones and took photos of the lights and stayed in touch with each other to verify what we were seeing.  The only difference in this sighting was the departure of the white lights.  This time i! t was a larger group of lights, brighter and twinkling.  It moved more quickly and was located to the north side of where the orange lights had appeared, instead of the south side as had been the case the night before, but again moved away from the ocean over the beach and towards land.  As before, the orange lights stopped after the white lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked for the lights the following night, August 8th with my niece and my son.  This time we saw only a few or the oranges spheres blinking off and on, lasting about 10 minutes and no white lights.  I have about 12 photos of the lights.  I thought about posting soon after I witnessed this, but finally decided to post now because my friend told me she read a story about the lights in the Charlotte Observer newspaper yesterday, November 1, 2012.  I finally decided I needed to share what I had seen; every sighting might help to figure out what these mysterious lights could be.<n>

The only difference being when it reached the horizon it winked out of sight instantly. 2 minutes later I decided to walk out onto out deck and I noticed a bright light heading toward my position.  As I watched it approach I began filming it with my cell phone.  It was far below the orbits of any satellite, and as it grew closer the light grew brighter in intensit. We are less than a mile from the Augusta airport and there were planes doing instrument takeoffs at the time. There were no strobes or usual aircraft lights on this object. There was no sound as it passed over head and headed Northeast. I am familiar with every form of conventional aircraft having grown up an air show kid and I keep up to date on military and civilian craft that operate I this area.  The crazy thing about this is the next day two of my students who were in Winslow Maine! , which is 15 miles north northeast of Augusta told me they were outside at about 10:00 and an object passed overhead, spun around and took off.I know these kids and they wouldn&#39;t make this up. They couldn&#39;t believe what they were seeing. I also have two videos of the object. In one video you can clearly see the object as it passes. An early video I took as it first appeared shows the object winking in and out as it slowly moves across the sky. The strange thing Is as I recorded that I watched the object as it crossed the sky and I never lost sight of it. It did not wink in and out of sight. I don&#39;t know if it is because the quality of the camera or if it was due to some type of electrical interference.<n>

Light turned bright (resembled a plane headlight coming towards land) maybe a few hundred in the air, then it split into 2 lights, same size, then split in three, the first light disappeared, then the second disappeared and the third light turned from a yellowish orange to red and flew off. About 5 seconds later it reappeared, farther south and did the exact same thing. Both times they alined in a perfect line, evenly spaced. You could see a main craft flying in front/behind them.

We left a restaurant on Grand Avenue August 7th, 2012 in Surprise around 9:15 PM when we noticed in the north sky a triangle shape star consolation.  We all questioned each other…What is that consolation?  Did you ever see that before?  We stood there for a while and watched it.  It did not move, flash, change color or anything else.  It consisted of three white stars at each tip of a perfectly formed triangle. One star on top and two stars on the bottom forming the triangle. The stars/lights seemed to be larger and brighter more so than other stars.  We continued to watch it and then walked to the gas station next door to get some bottled water.  We walked back to the van and took one more look at the triangle in the sky.  It seemed to just hang there and not move.    Dad said let’s go, I wanted to take a picture and he said no, we are going, let’s go.  So, there was no picture taken.  As we left, I felt that I made a big mistake not takin! g a picture.  When we got back to the hotel, I said that I wanted to go and get a picture of the triangle.  No one else wanted to go along so, I left to go back to the restaurant parking lot.  I drove through a couple of blocks of strip malls back to the exact parking spot we were in about 30 minutes earlier.  The triangle was gone, I stayed there for about 20 minutes hoping for it to reappear, but it did not.  I took some pictures at that time and I captured only one star that looked to be in the same spot the triangle was in. I came back to the hotel and shared what I found a felt the need to report what we all had seen.  The triangle was too perfect of a shape; it did not look like random stars making the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TriangleShape in the South West Sky of Prescott, AZ -- August 8, 2012  The three of us traveled to Prescott and again saw the same shape in the south west sky.

Tried to establish distance by how far the planes were flying above the object.  If this were just a meteor shower and the International space station flying over, from seeing other meteor showers before.  It seemed to me that most showers tend to cross in the same direction.

I look up to see what appears to be a very bright, star-like object - not as high as a celestial object and much lower than a high flying plane.  I asked my wife if she sees the thing moving.  She said yes.  We watch it together to see if it is a plane passing by.  It is moving slowly and has no blinking lights.  The whole object was bright, not just the front as if it had headlights.  The object is moving slowly from the South East to North East.  As it moves, it makes erratic jumps to the left and right of its flight pattern - wavering in and out of its flight path.  No blinking lights.  I continue to watch as it moves on heading towards the horizon, still as evenly bright as when we were closest to it.  When it is almost over the tree tops in the distance, it turns red.  Not a blinking red - solid red - and then disappears.  This was viewed on a clear evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We left a restaurant on Grand Avenue August 7th, 2012 in Surprise around 9:15 PM when we noticed in the north sky a triangle shape star consolation.  We all questioned each other…What is that consolation?  Did you ever see that before?  We stood there for a while and watched it.  It did not move, flash, change color or anything else.  It consisted of three white stars at each tip of a perfectly formed triangle.  The stars/lights seemed to be larger and brighter more so than other stars.  We continued to watch it and then walked to the gas station next door to get some bottled water.  We walked back to the van and took one more look at the triangle in the sky.  It seemed to just hang there and not move.  Dad said let’s go, I wanted to take a picture and he said no, we are going, let’s go.  So, there was no picture taken.   s we left, I felt that I made a big mistake not taking a picture.  When we got back to the hotel, I said that I wanted to go and get a picture of the triangle.  No one else wanted to go along so, I left to go back to the restaurant parking lot.  I drove through a couple of blocks of strip malls back to the exact parking spot we were in about 30 minutes earlier.  The triangle was gone, I stayed there for about 20 minutes hoping for it to reappear, but it did not.  I took some pictures at that time and I captured only one star that looked to be in the spot the triangle was in. I came back to the hotel and shared what I found a felt the need to report what we all had seen.  The triangle was too perfect of a shape; it did not look like random stars making the shape.<n>

While at our camp site stargazing at 9:10PM, My wife noticed a bright object approach from the east over some trees over some camp sights appx 100-200 ft in the airwith no sounds what so ever. As it hovered over the tree tops it was a very bright orange (sunlike)with lights (blue,green) underneath. It hovered for appx 3-4 minutes. While hovering the glow proceeded to dim.  The bright light turned into a small point type light. It turned slowly while hovering due southeast it started to cruise slowly and the light blinked twice, then completely disappeared flying southeast over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Iam fairly intelligable person and have never seen any type of aircraft that would handle like that.<n>

Looked up and saw a line of seven fireballs in a perfect row, all flames (not sure the distance from the ground but definitely high enough to be on the level of air traffic) glowing at similar heights and looked suspended and in a parallel line.  The furthest flame went out and then each subsequent flame went out one by one.  A new perfectly formed line of six or seven flames appeared and then went out in the same way as before, this time what appeared to be a plane (blue-green twinkling light) flew from the direction of the fireballs/flames.  Not sure what to make of it, I was amazed and in awe and was sad that no one else on the street was around to see it too.  I hope someone else in Sebring saw it tonight, it was beautiful!  Nonetheless, I will be doing further investigation as two of my initial thoughts were : Kennedy Space Center&#39;s Rockets and the current impending Meteor showers.<n>

Watched as long as I could but had to move on due to traffic flow at which time it passed my field of vision.  The light was steady burn, not pulse and was a deep orange at the bottom and a dark grey at the top, it was tilted with dark grey to the upper left and orange to the lower rt.  The orange was larger than the grey. It had a somewhat triangular shape but rounded at the corners, like a fat pine cone.  Was disapointed that I was not able to stop to watch but my passenger was afraid to stop and traffic was flowing.  The object was slowly traveling in a westerly direction.<n>

On this particular afternoon I was operating the Beechcraft Kingair 200 on a flight from Southwestern France to my destination of Frankfurt, Germany.  I was flying at an altitude of 27,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 14:00 Central European Time, I noticed the other pilot bending his neck in an upward position and gazing out the cockpit window.  The sky was clear and it was a beautiful day.  He said, “that’s another airplane up above us, right?”  I looked up and I did see another jet approximately 8,000 feet above our position leaving a distinct contrail as it flew overhead in a westerly direction.  I said, “ya, it’s beautiful, huh?”  He replied, “ok…but what in the world is that”, while pointing at an object that appeared to be well above the jet we just saw fly above our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange object in question must have been at an altitude of at least 25,000 feet above the aircraft we just saw.  So, that would mean the object was at a possible altitude of 60,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Commercial aircraft cruise in the mid to high 30,000 ft range.  Some corporate jets like the Gulfstream V can cruise in the high 40,000 foot range.  I don’t know of any current operating aircraft operating at an extremely high altitude like the 60,000 ft range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a perfect circle.  It was not a disc, not saucer shaped, but a geometrically perfect circle.  The color was silver.  There were no lights on it. To me, there appeared to be some type of aura or haze around the circle. It was motionless.  We only lost sight of the object because we flew underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reaction is to say it was a weather balloon.  However, I have never seen a weather balloon, so I can not be confident in making such a statement.   I would say its mass would have to be similar to the size of a B737.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event was witnessed by myself, the co-pilot and our passenger.  We joked about it, but afterwards I had a bit of an uneasy feeling due to the fact that I was unable to identify the object we all encountered.<n>

I was facing east and across the street there is a parking lot.  In the northwest corner area of this lot there is a tall evergreen-like tree.  I just happened to look up at the sky in that direction as I often look at the sky when watering the grass at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Positioned above the tip top of the evergreen tree I saw what looked like a large bright star.  It looked like just a typical star, white in color, but noticeably larger, like six stars together.  It was not physically over the tree, but its position in the sky was above the tip of the tree.  I must admit I go a little alarmed because I had heard about alien abductions.  I decided to communicate with it.  But I did this inaudibly.  I sent a thought/question to it and asked if it was from the Christ (meaning Jesus).  And, if so would it blink off and back on again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The star dimmed down, like it had a dimmer switch, until it was not visible and lit up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked if it was here for the rapture.  The star dimmed down again, but this time it dimmed down and lit up twice; and, the second lighting it appeared brighter than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to add that sometime during this occurence, a young man was walking across the street going southbound and I asked him if he could see that huge star.  He said something inaudible and smiled/laughed and kept walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept watching the star, it started to slowly ascend upward.  As it was doing this, off to the right, another star (this one was like an ordinary star in size) started ascending upward and to the left, like at a 45 degree angle as if going toward the larger star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects went upward and out of sight.  The ascension was not swift, but slow.<n>

The objects were red orange blue yellow and  balls of light.  They looked like stars how they flicker in the sky.  But ten times bigger.  They were about 85 degrees from the ground up to the sky stationary.   They were about an arms length apart in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at each other in shock.

The light then moved from left to right.. side to side randomly and faster than you would expect of a plane.  I called my parents out of bed and they came out and watched it for the next 5-10 minutes as it moved about the sky blinking on and off.  The blinking was completely random... sometimes staying on for 20 seconds.. sometimes just 2 seconds.  It eventually went behind some trees and we could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live next to a military base but these objects don&#39;t seem to be man-made.  However, there have been many new fighter jets showing up on the base.  Last night there were at least 20-30 of the UFOs in the sky. They change shape very rapidly &amp; flash different colors, like red &amp; blue.  I believe they are emitting Ingram lights, odd colors show up on the camera that weren&#39;t visible to the naked eye(my camera has a cheap infrared blocking filter so it&#39;s very sensitive to IR lights).

Saint Helens and Mt. Adams.  We saw a large bright white ball moving to the north very slow, no sound, no blinking lights.  The object made a 90 degree turn east and increased speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After being obscured by trees, two jets came, one from the north, one from south west.   At day light we heard a large helicopter, too low to see because of the trees.  The object was the size of a grape held at arm&#39;s length.<n>

My ex-husband is a United States Marine and is a helicopter engine mechanic. We lived on Camp Pendleton in California for over two years. I recognized the helicopter as a CH-46. I was surprised, because I live in a very small farming community and we don’t have any military bases nearby. We only have about 3,000 residents and it struck me as odd that a helicopter of that size was here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:30 later that night I was walking home with my family from a friend’s  when I saw something strange above our house. It was a bright yellow-orange ball of light with an aura surrounding it. I only saw it for a few seconds, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t look or move like a shooting star, a meteor or a plane. I’ve never seen anything like this before. It seemed to be only hundreds of feet from our rooftop, instead of up with the stars and it was very bright. It traveled north to south, towards the horizon and was gone in the blink of an eye.<n>

After the fireworks everyone started clearing out and we let our 8 year old son play one more game that was still running before leaving.  We drove to the bottom of the hill to get gas, about ½ mile away and on our way back up the hill we could see this large red ball of light above the field that we had just left.  It was about 10:20 pm.  We pulled off of the road in the store parking lot and watched this object hover for about 3-4 minutes, never moving and not making a sound.  It slowly started moving away getting smaller and it disappeared then reappeared and disappeared again.  The moon was full and off to the right.  The total time it was in view was approximately 6-7 minutes.  We watched the sky the rest of the way home, about 7 miles, but never saw it appear again. My son was a little freaked out but we told him it was just a light and there was nothing to worry about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday, August 17th at about 10:30 pm I went out on my front porch to smoke and my son and dog followed me out the door.  I tied the dog and looked up and noticed this Large red object coming over the trees and said, “What the H*** is that?”  My son said, “It looks like a helicopter.”  It was the shape of a helicopter with the front end on the left, rounded and completely glowing red and what would have been the tail end on the left, a straight line of red to the right.  It was not a helicopter.  It was coming toward our house in that direction, sideways.  It made no sound at all and was fairly low to the ground.  I told my son to go get his dad.  It came about 150 yards toward me and then totally disappeared before reaching my house.  My son came back out to tell me his dad wasn’t coming out.  He asked me where it went and I told him it was gone.  He looked towards the woods straight across from my house and said, “What is that?”  It looked like a white dome descending o! ver the trees.  The he yelled, “Look mom, there are two more!”  Coming from the exact same location as the first one, two red balls of light came over the trees and continued in a path over the house until they were out of site.  My husband finally came out to see what the commotion was only to see the tail end of the lights which were quite small at this time.  My son is crying at this time and a little hysterical.  My husband told him they were airplanes and I told him if it was something scary, I surly wouldn’t be standing outside watching them and looking for more.  At this point my husband is trying to convince me that I’m seeing airplanes.  I know what an airplane looks like and these most certainly were NOT airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 21st, about 1:30 am.  My husband got out of bed to take the dog out and straight ahead of my porch were 2 glowing red balls.  He said he watched them for a few minutes just hover there and then slowly get smaller until they disappeared.  He did not inform of this until this afternoon but told me they most definitely were not airplanes he was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this site on the computer and see that there was another witness to the 2 fireballs on Friday night from Conway, which is about 8 miles from me so I thought I would put up a post also.  I’m curious to know if the timeframe was similar, although they did not report the helicopter shaped object.  The 2 fireballs came about 3 minutes after the 1st one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights hung still in the air in a horizontal line formation without moving for about 10 seconds before disappearing.  This happened at least 6 times in a 15 minute period with different variations in number of lights.  The lights appeared over the ocean and did not have any trails like a flare or a Chinese lantern.

I am a private pilot and am used to seeing the stars and aircraft in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects did changed color similair to an aircraft light system. but not quite the same. I saw what to my eye were green, red, white, and orange flashing lights. I did see an aircraft moving near the upper most light. It appeared to have a standard red nav lighting.Its postion would have put it north of the top light and it moved back and forth and appeared to be circling.  I did watch for about 20 minutes thru binoculars.  I called my 2 college age children and after some good natured ribbing we drove to a high point and watched as the lights disappeared to the SW. When I say disappear I mean they got dimmer and appeared to drop slightly on the horizon but not below, until we could no longer see them. They still maintained the triangle shape.  They appeared to be several miles apart and at differant altitudes. I do know the military was scheduled to fly Chinook helicopter night flights but those would have been in the opposite direction to these lights 35 miles to the SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman on the phone asked; in relation to the stars I could see how large where these lights. I would say 3-4 times brighter and larger than the other star we could see.Visiblity was good with no cloud cover or moon. Tempature was 81 degrees.<n>

I always tend to look up to the sky and I know where to see stars, because in Northern Jersey it’s hard to see stars.  When all of a sudden, I happen to look up towards the southwest direction; west from NYC, I saw clearing 3 orb shaped white lights in a PERFECT triangle formation. I was convinced that it was a UFO of some sort.  They seemed to glow but no movement, and then I started to think maybe they are stars after all that I never noticed before.  But the formation was so clear; I know I would have not missed it before.  So I went upstairs and had dinner; 30min later it  was gone.  So now I’m convinced it was no stars.<n>

There were seven of us who saw it. It was sort of oval, almost diamond shaped.  It was traveling toward the north at a moderately slow speed, and then it changed direction moving east.  There was no sound and its motion was very smooth but sort of moving up and down.  It seemed like it was rounded on top but the brilliant light seemed to flair which is why I described it as a diamond shape as well.  It lasted about 45 seconds to a minute at the most and gradually faded into the east.  There was no weather phenomena taking place, it was not windy, it was a perfectly clear night.  There is a hill right in front of my house so no vehicles could have made this light.<n>

It rose up into the sky about twenty feet higher than where it had originated.  Then smaller ships seemed to come out of the white ship. They had a skinny metallic center with bright red lights on each side.  They started to disperse while the white light stayed in the center. We eventually lost sight of the smaller crafts.  Then out of nowhere two of the smaller craft flew into sight, and they effortlessly glided one over the other, both going in two different directions. Planes or helicopters don’t fly that close to each other, or that close to the ground.  Eventually when they went out of sight the original white ship started to float upwards until we lost sight of it.  The entire time none of the ships made any sound.  My friend and I saw ufos before but we never saw an entire fleet. We believe that the white ship was here to drop off the smaller ships to research our world, while it went back to wherever it came from.<n>

I had just gotten a text message on the way- at 21:58(9:58pm), so that is my time reference.  Seconds after putting my phone in my purse- I started to look out of the window (passenger side) at the night sky.  There were a few clouds visible, but a good amount of stars.  There was one star in particular that caught my eye- and my increasing interest.  One reason was because of its size….it was much larger than any star I’d ever seen, and second because it seemed to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my husband to stop the car- he did at the location given above and he saw it too.  A car came behind us and we were forced to move- maybe 30 seconds after initially stopping.  I attempted to follow the speeding light but it proved impossible.  Seconds later I lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not have reported this- however what happened next made me really question what we had seen.  A group of three helicopters- two in front- one in the back, triangle formation, rushed in from the NW.  I was able to follow the helicopter for some time- maybe 15 minutes throughout the drive home.  They eventually split up- each taking its own direction.   One of them was flying very low, a single blue light and a single red light- but unblinking.  I’d never seen a helicopter like that- and the original three all had blinking lights.  After arriving home (some 12 miles from the location of the original sighting) I continued seeing helicopters at various altitudes pacing the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing seemed strange…even more so because it is the type of thing you see in someone else’s backyard- not your own.  How I wish I could’ve caught the event on film.<n>

Could throw rock and hit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early August 2012:  Large Craft seen by 5 individuals   I submitted the two earlier sightings to MUFON and to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I did not submit this following report because I believed that it was so unbelievable.  I only told this story to Mary Margaret Zimmer of the Miami MUFON when she visited me in late August of 2012 but to no other authority.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been thinking about this event EVERY DAY since I saw it.  The most important item to retain in this quick summary is that I specifi-cally called this object--  it did not just mysteriously appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my wife saw the large UFO craft on July 8, 2012, I started to seriously begin my research on UFOs and paranormal issues.  I purchased numerous books from Amazon and spent all my free time on the internet.  I learned that many individuals (Steven Greer, Prophet Yahweh, and many others, call UFOS and then record videos of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a cloud covered night in the first week of August of 2012, at about 9 PM, a friend of mine called me and informed me that he was coming by and dropping off some of his traffic tickets.  I am an attorney and had previously told him that I will write up No Contest Motions to resolve these tickets for him.  He said he was close by and would be at my home in minutes.  I decided to wait for him outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a large cul-de-sac with only 3 houses.  My neighborhood has large yards and is very quiet.  It was dark and very cloudy.  I then decided to &#34;play a game.&#34;  I remembered the Steven Greer and Prophet Yahweh videos and started to consciously wish to see the large multi-colored UFO craft  my wife saw on July 8th to appear in front of me just like it did for her.  Approximately every 2-3 minutes I turned around 360 degrees to see if I saw anything.  I did this for about 15 minutes.  Just when I was ready to give up, I saw this huge object on top of my neighbor’s back yard extending approximately 200-300 feet back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not a solid object.  It was made up mostly of thousands of streaks of circular or oblong shaped white thin lights.  It appeared to me that I saw two possibly three distinct outlines formed by the  oblong perimeters of these white light streaks.  One circular object nearest to me was partially covered by the palm trees in front of my neighbor’s house.   This smaller oblong object was connected to a much larger oblong object as formed by the perimeter of these light streaks.  There appeared to be hundreds of swirls of circular white light streaks all inside of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was positioned at a horizontal position rising at approximately a 15 degree incline.  It was positioned at about an 8 o’clock to 2 o’clock format.  It was about 50 feet from the bottom of the backyard of my neighbor’s house to the bottom of this object.  It is difficult to determine its height but I would say that the object was about 100-200 feet in its height.  I was clearly very long, I would say at least 300 feet in length.  (Attached are Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7 which are drawings done by myself, my 10 year old daughter, my friend Luis, and his Wife Sandra).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then started yelling for my daughter to come outside.  My daughter had just turned 10 years old.  She had told my wife and I that both she and I had seen UFOs and she wanted to see one as well.  After about 1 minute of yelling outside her bedroom she came out and asked me “what was that”?  I told her that I did not know but believed it was a UFO in “hiding”.  She just looked at the object in amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2-3 minutes of observing this object, my friend, Luis, who is 48 years old, his wife, who is 52 years old, and the daughter of his wife who is 17 years old drove up to my house.  Both Luis and his wife were trained as engineers in their native countries.  Luis is a conservative Catholic who was raised in Mexico.  He goes to Catholic Mass every Sunday and participates in various ministries.  He never believed in UFOS.  Both he and his wife were shocked and constantly asked me “what is that”.  We all tired to come up with logical explanations but we clearly could not come up with one that adequately explained this phenomenon.  We all doubted whether this was indeed a UFO and discussed that it must be some type of large light “anomaly”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, all throughout the inside of the object, star light objects started to flicker on and off, flashing on and off in a fraction of a second.  I was surreal.  I believed that because we started to doubt this object, it wanted to put on a show for us to demonstrate to us that in fact it was very “real”.  It indeed was surreal.  We were not scared but instead started yelling— “look at that, look over there”—pointing to the stars bursting all over the different parts of the craft.  It was clearly putting on a show for us, or at least that was my impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes, my friends said they had to go and they drove off.   About 5 minutes later I believed that mosquitoes were biting me and I told my daughter that it was time to go inside because the mosquitoes were killing us.  In fact, my daughter told me later that there were no mosquitoes out that night.  After about one half hour later, I “woke up” and realized what a fool I was for just walking away from a scenario that should have been the front story of Time Magazine and every media outlet around the world if I had captured it on video.  I ran outside with my video and digital cameras but the huge UFO craft was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ironic part was that about a month before this event, after my wife saw the huge multi-colored UFO outside our house, I purchased a large telescope, a night vision CCTV camera with adapters to attach this camera to the telescope, an old used SONY camcorder with the old night vision technology and a digital camera with high powered zoom for night shots.  I said to myself “the next time my wife or I see these objects we will be prepared to capture them on video and on camera so no one would doubt us”.  We know what we saw and they were real.  “Next time we are going to prove it.”  	The irony was that it never even entered my mind to take any of these newly purchased items out and take a video or a picture.  About 30 minutes after I entered my house with my daugthter, I came to my senses and ran out with my camera and my SONY video but the UFO had disappeared.  I now have been educated through my various readings that I was “instructed” to go inside and not to take any videos or pictures.  I have learned that various individuals having “close encounters” have experienced similar responses— our minds were totally controlled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that first week of August of 2012, my wife and I have not seen any other UFOs or similar objects either inside or outside our home.  Every day I think about what I saw and have become compulsive over these sightings and these visions have affected my work performance and my outlook on life, our role in our universe, and our relationship as spirits with God.  I am a changed person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SUMMARY  	Previous to these events, my wife and I have never seen UFOS or other similar objects in our life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is not bothered by these events because she is very religious and thinks that these visions were messengers from God.  I, on the other hand, have been “freaked out”.  I started doing research on the subject of UFOs, joined MUFON, ordered and read about 30 UFO books, listen daily to Coast to Coast, etc, etc.  I never even knew that these radio programs or UFO organizations existed.  I am now consumed by the subject.  I need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that I became obsessed with this issue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I am an attorney with the IRS in Miami, FL and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  As I stated earlier, I have various advanced professional degrees in addition to my legal training.  We live in an upper middle class neighborhood in the Killian area of Miami, Florida.  We have lead normal dull lives until recently.  Now I am consumed with my visions and spend most of my free time on the internet, reading books about UFOs, alien abductions, consciousness studies, Near Death Experiences, paranormal and spiritualist literature, Buddhism, past life regression literature, etc, etc.  Over the last year I have purchased and read over 100 books on these subjects and have recently ordered about 30 more.  My wife thinks that I have become compulsive and totally consumed by my new pursuits and I tend to agree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have just recently returned from my first MUFON meeting in Miami, FL and have a recommendation for the MUFON investigators.  Instead of solely relying on “purely scientific” techniques and tools--  the principle approach which was conveyed to the audience— I believe that the key to solving this UFO riddle is to focus on our minds--  our complex “consciousness”, our complex psychic abilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fields of parapsychology, involving the decade long studies by Drs. Harold Putoff and Russel Targ at Stanford and Dr. Robert Jahn at Princeton, in addition to the new “consciousness studies” involving Dr. Edgar Mitchell and his Institute of Noetic Sciences, as well as the hundreds of other “Consciousness Studies” academics that publish in the Journal of Consciousness Studies, provide the keys to “understanding” this phenomenon.  I also recommend that everyone read materials from these authors in addition to the rarely discussed book entitled “The Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century”, edited by Dr. Edward Kelly of the Department of Psychiatric Medicine at the University of Virginia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that I “invited” the entities of this craft to come “visit” me and that the “entities” in this craft made their “appearance” upon my “invitation”.  The key to solving the UFO quagmire is inside our own mind and spirit.  My latest event leads me to conclude that my mind, and other fellow human minds, are powerful and neglected instruments with powerful communication abilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFOs may not be from other planets in our universe.  They may be entities from a neighboring dimension as described in modern quantum physics.  It is very difficult to get a grasp what is going on with UFOs if one solely focuses on the “scientific method”.  The scientific method was developed to describe our physical universe and it does not adequately describe paranormal activities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Science has nothing to do with paranormal phenomena.  Science is based on the scientific method of discovery and experimentation.  The scientific method of discovery was devised for studying things in the physical universe.   Thus, when we are dealing with concepts outside of the physical universe--  things like the paranormal, UFOs, alien abductions, etc-- we are dealing with concepts outside of the physical universe and thus the scientific method breaks down.	  	New methods and techniques of investigation have to be developed to study this phenomenon, and if we do not, the future UFO investigators will remain clueless.  We are now just starting to “academically” explore the universe of possibilities beyond our physical senses to help explain what is “consciousness” and various paranormal activities.  In my opinion, we need to be able to investigate beyond our physical sense of reality and it is this new methodology that will provide a logical avenue to address the riddle of solving the UFO phenomenon.<n>

I noticed an orange light through the trees. It was brighter and larger than a star and seemed to hover just below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a street light but then it started to slowly rise into the sky. It was barely moving at first and then seemed to pick up speed and move at the speed of a plane. However, it moved diagonally upwards  and was at a higher altitude than we thought possible for a plane. Also, there were airplanes out and they were much lower and blinked whereas this object did not blink but seemed to have multiple lights making up a far larger mass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved overhead we tried to get a better view but we couldn&#39;t see through a nearby tree. We thought we had lost it, but then we saw a similar, perhaps the same object, moving back in the direction from which it came.  The first object moved across the right side of the sky, whereas the second came from the left, further supporting the idea that it was perhaps the same object doubling back. As it got closer to the treelike from which it first appeared it didn&#39;t drop down behind the trees but disappeared just above them. We&#39;re still not sure what it was but we know it wasn&#39;t a plane.<n>

I saw it again, coming down, getting closer and it was just the silver ball or disk, coming closer. I could barely make out the lights on it, I looked away for a second to get my roommates attention and it was gone. I ran to grab my camera, I took a picture of the last place I saw the object in the sky. Although I saw nothing in the sky, a bizarre image appeared on the camera.<n>

It looked as bright as Venus. It was moving east at a very fast speed.  I looked for the blinking light to see if it was a low airplane but it was just a solid light.  My cousin also saw it and he works on airplanes he said that maybe it was a airplane that left it&#39;s landing lights on but as low as it was we would of heard it.  It was low I seem other airplanes at the same time and it eclipsed them.  Then we started noticing that it was kind of bobing left to right while moving forward at the same time.  It could not of bin a helicopter because there very loud and we see them all the time.  And it also seemed to slow down midflyt and then speed back up. It moved from Orion to the horizon in on 5 min.

It was just slowly moving forward and seemed to rock sideways as it moved slowly.  It made no sound and continued moving until we could not see it anymore because of the trees that was blocking the view.   am sure it was not a star or flare or anything like that because it was constantly moving, and there was many stars out but they were all still except for this and it wasn&#39;t high in the sky to say it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was about 200 – 400 feet in distance and about the same in height from where I was standing and it seem to flicker as a candle would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t falling or going up in the air, it seemed to be floating across the sky very slowly and suddenly it began to drop and the fire started going out at the same time, then all we cud see is a white odd shaped thing floating to the ground behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too far for us to go see what it was. Before we could gather our thoughts as to what it was we just saw, another one came from the same direction at the same speed but landed in a different location. After that they kept coming one after another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw 10 of them pass us, all landing in different locations. I was facing east and it was moving in a north to south direction. A friend of mine saw it already, not too long ago. I know this because before the first one went out he said that it would. He said it was a Soucouyant{an old folk tale} but I beg to differ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no logical clue as to what it was but I know it was not normal. It didn’t make a sound and it was too close to mistake it for something normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are two videos we took of it with two different phones. Its dark but you can see the light {not professionally done obviously} I have no intentions of getting famous. I just want some sort of an idea to what it was or what it could be.<n>

The sky was slightly overcast and I could see only one star as I looked through the window in its direction.  The moon was visible but with a haze over it.  The moon’s light was diffuse.  I went outside and there was no sound.  Normally there is noise from planes and boats.  It was quiet---no boats or ships going by at the moment.  The water was very quiet too, no strong waves.  The light was too close to be a star.  It did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe it could be a plane coming straight toward me and that would be the reason that it did not move. About ten minutes later I decided that was not a good explanation as it did not seem to come closer either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to get my binoculars and leaned my elbows on the back of the couch to try to keep the binoculars still.  My cat bumped my arm so I shooed the cat away but by the time I looked again, the light had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the kitchen to put the binocular away, when suddenly the light reappeared in the same place before my eyes.  I thought, “This cannot be a plane.  Who in their right mind would turn the lights off and on?” I then noticed a tiny speck shooting very fast that appeared under and going past the bright light.  I would have thought it to be a shooting star but only one star was visible that night and usually a shooting star is seen clear down to the horizon.  The little tiny fast moving thing was lit up as it approached the bright light and for a split second after it passed the bright light then no longer visible.  The tiny moving object was visible for only a split second.  I do not know if it was related to or independent of the bigger bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the feeling that the small thing must be of some reflective material that was light up by the big light as it passed by and underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it get very bright.  At about 1:40am there was a flash of red light and it was gone.  I did not see it fly away.  It just disappeared.  I watched ten more minutes.  It did not come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a beautiful night.  You could see thousands of stars outside.  But as we starred a the sky we saw a red light the didnt move and was just blinking like some of the stars.  But unusual because it was pritty big.

It wasnt a plaine cause we didnt here any jet sounds plus it was moving too fast to be any plane, and moved soo quickly and smooth to be a plane.  We were trying to not blink cause we thought it would disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to us that it was a star instead of a light going about 3,000 miles.  But as we lookk the light starts to fade.  Like litterly fades as we are starring at it.

No sound at all with this object, I thought it was a star but the object moved across the sky from south to Northeast out of view in a 1  minute or longer, not a meteor this slow and no trailing light. It took a good minute or so to cross the full sky.  Most high altitude jets take two  or three minutes to move overhead and out of view.

The colours seemed somewhat translucent and they didn’t appear to be  traveling on any specific trajectory.   They seemed to bob and weave as they passed over us. There was no sound coming nor trail of emissions emanating from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting was about 10-15 seconds.

I was waiting on my wife to get snacks for my neices who were spending the night.  What prompted me to step out of my car were two huge punch hole clouds, as I watched them for about 5 minutes, I the see this big air plane come through leaving a good sized chemtrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point,  I&#39;m ezcited to actually be able with my own eyes how these are going to manipulate these hole punch clouds,  that&#39;s. What they are for,  according to some. As I am really watching I see the punch hole clouds breaking up, there&#39;s. A cloud to my right, almost behind me, the sun was also in that direction blut being blocked by a mushroom cloud,like you would see after a huge explosion.. I then saw a small white craft in the distance,  leaving out of the clods that were holeq punch clouds that are at the time I&#39;m seeing this,  disapated. I thought I was seeing things but its back drop was a blue sky in broad day light,  no sounds from th! e craft,  it seemed to have dissappeared a couple of times as it went verticle in the sky, I was able to regain a visual at great distances apart.  I thought that was crazy, as I look behind me turning to the left to see if any aircraft was in the air, there was none.  I turned back to the right to look for any more activity in front of me, in turning I saw a huge white cigar shape craft,  even just seeing one a minute or two earlier, my minds first thought was hey,  that was there a split second ago. It took a blink of an eye for me to be looking at a space craft up close hovering. I stood there a good 5 seconds, enough time time say to my three year old son who was in his car seat &amp;quot;do you see that buddy that&#39;s no air plane. with the clearest veiw anyone could have. I don&#39;t have any epics or video, I personally don&#39;t. Need them,  I know what I saw. My whole world is shaken. I always thought they were real. I was the guy who would tell people I believed in them just to! get them to just open their minds, yesterday, I became the gu! y that s aw it with his own eyes, that his own family doesn&#39;t Believe. I honestly couldn&#39;t care less if anyone believes, if it would have been for them to see, they would have seen it...  thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

8/5/12 17:50|Newark|DE|Circle|2-5 seconds|Two silvery-white circular shaped craft appeared to use a cloaking technology to reappear and disappear.|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91501.html|795|ndxe201208| Two silvery-white circular shaped craft appeared to use a cloaking technology to reappear and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello. I am the same guy that reported the sighting on August the 2nd after leaving the Glasgow Park. This time I was on the deck of my backyard during the brewing of the late afternoon thunderstorms that were quickly covering Northern Delaware around 5-6 PM Eastern Time.  I was sitting on my deck watching the clouds swirl as there appeared to be one frontal system coming from a Southwestern direction that was bisected by another from a Southeastern direction.  As I stand on my deck watching the clouds move with grace and speed, I noticed in the distance at what appeared to be a great altitude, maybe that of what you would typically see inbound and outbound flights appear at, but just under the main cloud layer that was forming. They were a silvery white colored and my initial thought in trying to recognize what these 2 objects were is that it may have been 2 seagulls flashing their white underbelly as the sung shines a reflection from it to my direction. Howe! ver, what happened next lead me to believe these were not birds or traditionally inbound, outbound passenger airliners as they disappeared as if they were cloaking for 2 seconds and then they reappeared in the next breath to only disappear for good after a few more seconds (another 2 to 3).  They were flying in the general direction that the storm system was heading, a Northeastern direction (they were following the frontal system that was coming from the southwest).   Both of these objects were far from where I was standing, from what I could tell but they were tightly grouped together. They did not zig or zag, they merely were flying in what appeared from my parallax as a straight pattern toward a northeast direction. Maybe due to the sunlight&#39;s distortion or other exogenous factors, the crafts appeared to be silver at first but then they appeared to be more of a pure white color. I did not see any flashing lights, just merely the objects themselves. And as for the shape o! f the craft, they were a spherical or circular fit. I did not ! see any visible wings, but that does not mean there weren&#39;t any wings b/c from my vantage point, I was quite far. The reason I decided to report this is b/c of the peculiar cloaking and reappearing nature of these crafts. I have never seen any aircraft ever do this to my knowledge. As to the specifics of weather, it was not quite raining yet, it was cool outside due to the coming frontal system, daylight was still visible although it was quickly dimming due to the dark cloud systems forming, and this is my 2nd late evening sighting within 3 days. Also, the objects left no visible contrails and I did not hear any audible jet or engine noise.<n>

I noticed what I thought at first was an aircraft, a small moving point of light in the sky.  Then I realized it must be at high altitude &amp; therefore the light must be extremely bright.  I kept my gaze set on it; soon, I noticed this light was not flying in a straight path as an airplane would.  Rather it was travelling in a curve, as though a half-circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving very slow - slower than any airplane, especially one with such high altitude, would be flying.  There was no sound of an aircraft engine at any time.  It took about 3 minutes to circle (from my left-facing to right-facing).  I then noticed another similar light which at first I reasoned could be a star I had not noticed before.  I always look to the sky when I step outside &amp; had previously noted the position of Venus and what was possibly Sirius or Polaris to my north-facing.  I couldn&#39;t see any other stars when I had first walked outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light seemed to be headed towards the new light.  They then merged to where I could only see one light.  That light then disappeared.  Although I was astounded I didn&#39;t mention this to my roommate or his girlfriend in fear they wouldn&#39;t believe me or think I was crazy.  I guarantee this is a factual account of what I witnessed &amp; in my estimation it was certainly not a known terrestrial aircraft, star/Venus or comet.  It says don&#39;t list my name or contact info here but if this site logs my IP address I do not at all mind being contacted or further asked about this.  I listed my phone number &amp; will have minutes available to speak with anyone on Tuesday.  I don&#39;t mind my name being released to anyone in authority that researches or investigates unidentified flying objects, however I would ask my name not be publicly published either in print or online.<n>

Every night the same light.  Sometimtimes higher sometimes lower.  Tonight , my friend was over and I pointed it out to her. As we were looking at it, another one appeared moving slowly around it for about 20 min before it descended down somewhere to the west. 20 min later another one appeared further away. There is no way this is a star, planet, or plane.  It was too slow moving to be a plane (a plane actually did fly by at one point and was over us and gone within minutes). This just sort of hovers, then moves, then hovers.  And way too big to be a helicopter.  Not to mention the original stationary one moved positions over the last hour. Also ... I don&#39;t know if this has any relevance, but there was a second plane that flew REALLY low over us ( I thought it was going to crash in my yard). It was a jet ... Not a small plane.<n>

At the location where I work I have been observing something that I feel is very much abnormal and should be seriously looked into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the past month or so I have been noticing 2 large and exceptionally bright star-like objects appear in the sky coming from the Northeast direction.  This occurs between about 3 – 5 am.  Over the last 3 days it has been occurring between about 2-5 am.  Unlike other stars that are in the sky throughout the night, these objects change position in the sky with my movement on the ground.  No matter where I go I can see these objects from exactly the same angle.  Over the past several months I have been making this same observation but the star-like objects came in from the western sky and they usually remained in the area throughout the night.  I have considered the possibility of a private person with illegally obtained technology, attempting to harass and intimidate me and my coworker just to make himself or herself feel important.  However it has been recommended that I report this as possible UFO activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I make observations of unusual activity I usually have no doubt as to whether I am seeing what I think I am seeing, but I still attempt to confirm it by pointing it out to others.  My coworker said he has made the same observations and I have pointed it out to at least one other person who works in the area.  While making these observations I have never felt nervous or afraid that I was being pursued by UFO’s or Extraterrestrials.  What I have felt and still feel is mental distress from the belief that this is very abnormal and so far no one has given me any assistance whatsoever with understanding what this is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the past I have contacted the Arizona Society of Astrologers, but no one has answered and attempted to assist in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Your attention and consideration will be greatly appreciated.<n>

This UFO was a teal/green-ish color.  It had a big circle in the center with about six smaller green circles equally spaced around the larger, center circle.  There was no visivle connection, so I don&#39;t know if it was one UFO, or seven of them with one mother ship sort of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stood up to show my husband, his mother, and two sibilings the object vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I nearly began to cry from the shock I was in.<n>

It has happened 2 times before and I never said anything.  There is a set of lights that stay in a standard spot but moves around alittle each night I see it.  The smaller crafts move around a lot and move in several directions but always comes back to the standard one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The smaller crafts move around low to the ground compaired to normal plains and there isn’t any sound at all which is weard.  Also, they seem to stop from time to time and lower down some then take back off up and in another direction.  The slow down and stop for several minutes before moveing on again. I have seem up to 8 in one night.  At first they look like stars but they move alittle then they get closer and you start to see the lights.  They are very small crafts and have a white light on each side that is white and turns red.  Sometimes they flash.  The middle has a small white light and a red one. Like I said there is not any sound and they move super fast some times but normally very slow and low to the ground but I put a light on it and it was gone in seconds. It was almost effortless for  it.  They go in one direction til its out of site then comes back about 20 minutes later and meets the standard craft.  From there they go into another direction and returns.  They do a odd thing sometimes, they line up with a star and just set there until another comes up and they fly off again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this two times before but they did not stay in the area this long.  It&#39;s been several hours and they keep returning to the standard craft.  I thought the large craft was a star for most of the night til I noticed it was moveing  around more.  The small crafts can set still for long amounts of time and when they lower down you cant hear any sound at all.  I tried to take a picture with my phone but I couldn’t find them in the screen to record them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been several hours now and the standard craft is still there.  The smaller ones are still returning just like before.  They are always around the large clouds when they are seen.  It is like they try and stay behind the cloud and the smaller ones leave when they large one gets behind the clouds.  It sometimes looks as if the clouds just stop when that happens. Its not like anything I have ever seen but if it still keeps happening   I’ll see them again because this is weard and has happened before. I ready would like to know whats going on and why there is small crafts surrounding the area and why here because there isn’t much in this area.<n>

We seen a magma lava red colored ball was super high up in the sky but still big to the eye , like the size of the moon if not a bit bigger of what the moon looks like on a normal night, it was moving right slow for 3 solid minutes past the moon and then took off up into the sky super quick and was gone.  I was on the phone at the time when I heard all my friends freaking out was when I looked up and seen it.  One of my friends swore she seen it come out of the water.  Not sure if that was the case or if it was just down low in the sky when she seen it, either way we all seen it and was like nothing i&#39;ve ever seen before.<n>

It was moving slowly in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then it began to slow to nearly a stop.  It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept thinking I would hear a noise.  It would have to be a silent helicopter.  I know what a jetliner at 20 to 40 thousand feet looks like.  This pink light was non blinking.  I ran inside to get my 16 year old daughter.  About 30 seconds later when I got her to get her shoes on and come out, the light started moving away. It seemed to be only a few hundred feet up but hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were fireworks (delayed due to drought) that night which were supposed to be done but they kept on going after the finalé.  I had watched those right near my house and I had gone back inside the house after the finalé and had come back out to see why they were still firing them off.  Rain prior in the evening had apparently caused a problem with some of the fireworks.<n>

We witnessed glowing ovals up in the sky over Lake Ontario about 20 miles west of Rochester, NY.  We actually saw them two times.  Once on the evening of Sat. Aug 4 around 10:30pm.  There were about 4 of them, about 30 to 50 degrees in the sky.  They were orangish and it wasn&#39;t the moon, aircraft or other lights, balloons, stars or anything.  They were the size of your pinky fingernail if you held your hand out as far as you could from your face.  They didn&#39;t move a lot, they didn&#39;t move with the wind direction, the wind was strong that weekend.  After about 20 minutes the lights just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time we saw them was at 4am on Sunday Aug. 5.  My wife woke me up at 4am and we saw 3 or 4 more of them.  She was spooked about them, we both thought they were very strange.  I had my camera with me and I took a picture, it was completly dark out and the image quality is average for that time of night.  ! I&#39;ll email you a copy of the picture.  A few other of our friends saw the lights as well.  We can&#39;t explain what we saw, I have never seen anything like it before.<n>

(Wife's report.)|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91470.html|811|ndxe201208| V formation of lights over Hickory, NC<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 5, 2012  Sighting:  August 4, 2012  Time: 10:10pm<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling home from my children’s’ theatre performance last evening, when I stopped at a four way stop sign a few houses away from my home.   As usual, I looked for cars, first to the right then to the left; however, when I looked to the left, something caught my attention out of my peripheral view.  I looked up in the sky to find three strange lights high enough in the air to be an airplane.  These lights did not look like any sort of airplane I had ever seen.  So I was quite confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights were moving, I hurriedly shouted for my children to look out the window up into the sky, and I asked, &#34;Do you see what I see?!  What in the WORLD is that!??”&#34;  Both of them were able to see the lights, and they did not think the lights looked like airplanes either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed at the stop light for a few more seconds studying the sky.  I thought to myself, there is no way that is an airplane or jet, as the lights are a strange color, and they are not blinking, so they must be balloons?  No, I know!  They must be lanterns, since they are a reddish-orange-like bright color.  They are lanterns that have been set free, like in the movies.  Yet, as I studied the sky more closely, I noticed that these objects were NOT floating UP like a balloon or a lantern would.  These objects were very quietly moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects were in a &#34; V&#34; formation, and they were traveling across the sky towards the north, towards my home.  So, knowing my husband watches UFO stories, I rushed three houses down and ran inside to get him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time he came out with the video camera, the third one (that was the lead light) was drifting from the other two.  Its glow seemed to grow fainter, and it seemed to be traveling further away, when all of the sudden, it just vanished.  The other two stayed in view as they traveled further north.  We all got back in the car and followed the lights for a better view away from our huge pin oaks in our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes later, the second light vanished just as the first had done.  We watched the last light, hoping it would not disappear as quickly.  As I was watching it, I noticed that it seemed to be changing shape, almost as if it was in a circular motion.   I remember my husband, who was taking video on the street, telling me what he was seeing AFTER! I had already seen it as well.  Our children also seemed to have a similar account as to what transpired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, the third was gone in the same fashion as the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us sat in the street, dumbfounded and perplexed by what we had just observed.<n>
8/4/12 22:10|Hickory|NC|Light|5-10 minutes|Orange/Red lights seen over Catawba/Burke County NC.  ((Husband's report))|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91469.html|812|ndxe201208| Orange/Red lights seen over Catawba/Burke County NC<n> <n><n> <n><n> 08/05/12 Sighting:  Approximately 10:10pm on 08/04/12 Location: Hickory, NC  I was home alone watching television in my basement room last night and my wife and children were on their way back home from a theatre performance.  At approximately 10:10 pm my wife busts through the kitchen door and yells at me to come outside immediately to see these &#34;strange lights&#34; in the sky.  It took me a minute to realize what she was even talking about, and I asked her to wait a moment so that I could grab our Sony video camera.  I don’t know why I thought to grab the camera other than I know my wife well enough to have seen how obviously amazed she was at what she had witnessed.  She stated that as she was coming down our street and approached the stop sign at the top of our street she witnessed three red lights in the sky to her left as she was driving north.  She said she did a double take and at first thought they were lanterns, but then realized they were too high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceeded outside into our driveway and she pointed to the sky in a SW direction from our home.   At first I wasn’t sure what I was seeing and it took a minute to gather myself.  I saw three orange/red orbs in the sky.  They were moving in a northerly pattern across the western sky.  They were moving in a triangular formation, and unfortunately, the lead orb vanished before I could get my video camera on.  Once the camera was on I focused on the two remaining objects.  They proceeded in a stacked formation across the night sky, but made no obvious sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived nearby and visited many military bases my entire life and have served in the Navy at NAS Norfolk, so I feel relatively comfortable distinguishing jet aircraft in the sky, even at night.  I live near a small local airport, and can hear planes and jets taking off and landing from my home.  There was no such noise.  I did hear the sound of a jet engine to my rear, but it was nowhere near the objects and soon dissipated.  I have also seen enough programs regarding UFO sighting and debunking to know that a reference point is important, so I made sure to include my homes trees in the lower portion of the video I was taking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me most about the objects was the lack of sound and the fact that the light they were emitting was constant, not blinking, as you would typically see in a commercial or military aircraft.  In addition, they were way too bright and large in reference to our location for us to have not heard the engines, assuming they were jet aircraft.  We watched the objects move across the sky for approximately 45 seconds, at which point they were obstructed by the rather large oak trees in my backyard.  My wife and children were still in the driveway in her vehicle, so I had them drive me to the next clear vantage point, which was just next door, approximately 50-60 feet.  I tried to focus on the objects, but could not get the camera to focus due to ambient light coming from a streetlight directly to my rear.  In the second video I shot you can still make out the orbs moving at approximately the same speed in a north/northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I was more concerned with getting what I was seeing on camera than I was with continuing to watch it with my naked eye, so I hopped in the van with my wife and kids and had her drive me to the next clearer and darker part of my street.  This was approximately 50-60 yards down my street from my home.  I jumped out, focused the camera, and remember asking my wife to turn off the headlights on her van.  Shortly after starting the third video, I saw the lower light in the formation “bug out” in a northwesterly direction at a ridiculous speed.  This can be seen in the video footage.  I was shocked at how quickly it disappeared, but kept my camera focused on the remaining orb and closed in on it with my zoom lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to be clear at this point that I was using a Sony Handycam, with a Carl Zeiss lens and HD resolution, not a camera phone.  What I saw next was the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed.  My family and I saw the object begin to change shape in the sky.  It didn’t elongate or anything, it just seemed to change its exterior.   In my video footage, you can see it very clearly as it appears to transition between pointy in one direction to round in another.  I can only describe it as looking like a child’s “top” spinning in the sky, but the point moves from bottom to top to side.  The shape was rounded on edges at time, and you can hear my wife in the background saying she sees the same thing I am witnessing with my camera.  Almost as soon as my wife said she could see it too it also disappeared just as the previous orb had.  Then entire encounter lasted approximately 5 minutes.  I returned outside periodically during the night, but saw nothing unusual in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am neither a UFO expert nor an aircraft expert, so I am not claiming 100% that what we saw was a UFO, but I do know that I have never in my life seen objects  maneuvering  in the sky the way these objects did.  I have never seen a &#34;UFO&#34; before, but I am convinced that is what I saw until someone can prove me wrong.  This phenomenon was witnessed by my wife, both my children, and myself, and as I write this the next afternoon after the sighting, I am still not sure if I’m excited, scared, or amazed.. perhaps all three.  I look forward to hearing from someone from your organization.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS--I will forward the video footage by email if possible, if not I will mail it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, on the day after his sighting, and he sounded to us to be exceptionally serious-minded and eloquent.  We suspect that he is an unusually good witness.  PD))<n>

It was a little after 10pm. I vaguely noticed a light in the sky, I payed no attention to it at first thinking it was an airplane. My mother then pointed to an opossum that was crossing the street. We watched it scurry to the sidewalk for a moment, that&#39;s when I looked back at the sky and realized that the light I had just seen was hovering in one spot, very unlike any airplane I&#39;d ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A split second later I realized I was looking at several hovering orange glowing lights, 5 in total if I can remember correctly, together forming a triangle/boomerang shape. My mind went immediately to the Arizona ufo/lights sightings a few years ago. I had seen a program about it on TV. I said &amp;quot;mom, is that a UFO!?&amp;quot; My mind hadn&#39;t fully comprehended what I was looking at just yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped at a stop sign and gawked for a few seconds, which felt like minutes. I kept saying &amp;quot;I bet it&#39;s military. That can&#39;t be what I think it is.&amp;quot; I then began to feel very creeped out. I told my mother to keep driving. She just said she didn&#39;t want to stop looking at it. I begged her to keep driving. So she finally did. We turned right and I saw that there was a lot of lightning in the distance in the opposite direction of the lights. I don&#39;t know if this is pertinent information but I saw lightning and never heard any thunder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we resumed driving, I looked back at the lights again and there were only three left. It then appeared that the three remaining lights were moving directions. And suddenly I could see no more of the lights. They were gone. This all seemed to happen in less than 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since Saturday I have been looking on UFO report sights to see if anyone else had seen what we had. When I saw a report here from someone else in our area that had witnessed the same thing on the same night, I just knew I had to submit a report of my own. So glad we weren&#39;t the only ones to see this! I&#39;m pretty sure my dad thought we were crazy until we showed him the other report.<n>

I usually look up at the sky because I love to see the stars.  Then I looked up to my left and saw 3 bright orange color lights in the sky not to very far, probably close to the High School.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I were wondering what were they.  They weren&#39;t making any noise. and stayed in one spot for a wile in a triangle formation.  My mom thought they were  Planes but I know planes don&#39;t stay in one spot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then each one started to fade like lights dimming down. after they disappeared they re-appeared farther away and in more numbers, to what I counted up to at least 8 of them.  They all shined bright orange and all together in the same area together, kind of in random positions and moved around slowly and smoothly. they all started to disappear after 1 minute or 2 fading away and left only one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it disappeared and appeared as 3 farther away, they formed a triangle again.  It just kept repeating the disappear and re-appear act but this time just with 3.  It was going in the direction of Northwest I believe. the last that I saw them was just 2 staying in the sky next to each other probably  50-70 feet away from each other, I&#39;m really unsure.  I really can&#39;t tell how high in the sky they were,  probably a few hundreds of feet off the floor.  The sky was dark mostly clear but few clouds.  The moon was very beautiful,big and bright orange/yellow oval shaped, my little cousin described it as an egg.<n>

They seemed to be active, moving,  pulsating moving jerky with a slight up and down movement. When he called me pounding on the window to come see them I ran out and saw at least 6 myself. I tried filming them on my iPhone only to realize I did not have the video on so I only got a still image. I did call the police. Did not seem to be interested only to say do you want a policeman to come out. at that point they were gone from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were about two hundred feet away from each other and were at the elevation of small planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about 30 seconds as the lights stayed in the same place until each one slowly started disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started driving up the hill and right before the last one disappeared I saw in the distance another one shot up from ground to the same height as the other ones and started heading north.  While at the top of the hill watching it a small propeller plane was flying west heading towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about hundred feet of the red light the plane made a sharp 180 degree turn and started heading in the opposite direction to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then was watched the red ball of light go out of sight into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I star gaze almost every night and never seeing anything like! this, they could have not of been flares due to the four staying in the same place and the other one moving.<n>

The light off the craft appeared to pulsate in brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I both saw these; last night I observed a singular craft  at almost the same time but these appeared more round as opposed to cylindrical shape of the craft last night.<n>

I was looking north from near the intersection of Rt. 132 and Rt. 611 in Warrington PA.  My first thought was it’s an odd looking airplane or helicopter.  Though, after another look I spotted a second “fireball” moving with the first at the same steady speed just at a lower altitude.  About 10 second later a third “fireball” came into view trailing behind the first two.  All three “fireballs” were traveling perfectly level at the same rate of speed. I would estimate their altitude at no greater than 500 feet and their distance from me at a ¼ mile.   The second “fireball” seemed to fade after 15 seconds of viewing as the other two kept traveling out of my view due to obstructions.   There was absolutely no sound associated with these objects.  Because of their straight flight path, sp! eed and formation I would have to rule out any type of RC toy, fireworks or balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Growing up in an area minutes away from Willow Grove NAS and Johnsville NADC I’m used to seeing all types of air traffic around my house.   I’ve witnessed everything from a B-2 Stealth to a Harrier Jump Jet around my local skies but nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our exact location is less than 1000 feet from the location of a Google Maps search for Sheridan, CO.  Each object was seen by itself in the eastern sky, with no other identifiable or unidentifiable flying objects in our field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three sightings occurred between 9:00 to 9:25 PM Mountain Daylight Time.  None of the objects appeared to have any physical structure to them, we saw only light.  The first and third craft seemed to be circular, but it was hard to discern a specific shape, since they were quite small.  The second craft was roughly diamond shaped, but didn’t have a distinct shape, looking more like an extremely bright light shining down from a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object we saw at approximately 9:00 PM in the eastern sky at somewhere around 40 to 45 degrees from the horizon. It was apparently at a very high altitude, looking like a moving star. Its color was white, maybe slightly blue. It moved at a constant speed on a straight trajectory from south to north. We observed it for several minutes until it slowly faded from view to the north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object appeared around 9:10 PM, also to the east, but much higher in the sky, roughly 75 degrees. As it moved from west to east, it pulsed a very bright white light at a steady interval. Its brightness was a higher magnitude than any identified flying object, star, or planet I have seen, except maybe the Moon..  The light would appear and build in intensity to peak brightness in about 1.5 seconds, then dim and fade from sight in another 1.5 seconds, disappearing for about 10 seconds before appearing again. After several pulses while moving, it seemed to me to have slowed or stopped its movement, while others said it had changed direction. We did not see it after that. Its speed was slower than the other 2 objects, and it traversed a much smaller section of sky. Total time of observance was no more than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third object appeared sometime after 9:20 PM and looked extremely similar to the first object. The only difference apparent to me was that it seemed slightly brighter.  We watched it move at a constant speed on a straight trajectory from north to south, at about 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon. We watched this object for several minutes until it slowly faded from view to the south at 9:25 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may be important to note that Buckley Air Force Base is not more than 20 miles to the east-northeast of the location of our sightings.  This fact indicates the possibility that we misidentified military aircraft, although I do not think we did.  The objects could also possibly be classified aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial investigation via website sources yields no information on visible satellite or space flight passes matching both the time and location of our sighting.  Although the objects could still be satellites not listed on the websites I looked at, or pieces of space trash, both are rarely seen from the Denver area.  I doubt that any of the objects were satellites or space trash, as I have seen both many times on many occasions in the mountains of Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize for sending in two reports. I accidentally submitted the first one without fully filling out the form.<n>

I was with my husband who also saw the unusual craft.  We saw 3 red lighted craft that had a slow blink to them, which was unusual because most aircraft usually have a faster blink.  The 3 were heading North East and then a 4th joined them coming up from the South.  They were low in the sky ( a typical helicopter level that you might expect on a news chopper or police chopper) but they made no sound.  At first I thought they were helicopters but as they got closer I expected to hear sound and it never came.  Then when they were above me they headed east and a 4th joined them.  When they turned east their lights faded and disappeared and I could not see them.  The crafts I could not see only the lights. It was not totally dark outside, and I took video on my phone but I couldn’t catch them on video.<n>

It came from the west flying at high speed and coming a little down, like their knowing what their were doing.  Realising that they must have know that I was stargazing because they stopped and I had the feeling they watched me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moment I saw the object, it was a large oval red object and at the bottom sparkling yellow lights (bigger then the stars).  Above the lights was an orange mist.  The object flew with high speed and I think it must have noticed me and it slowed down and turned around a little bit and it took a position and stood then still, watching me....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at an object in the sky, I called my daughter to come outside and that moment the object was looking for a place to stop.  It made a circle movement and it seems like they knew we were watching because it came to hold and stood still.  My daughter (6) mentioned that we are all children of God.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to get frightened and walked inside the house but I hesitated I went outside again and the object was gone, nowhere to seen, an amazing experience but my hear is still beating like a drum!<n>

We pulled into a parking space and watched for a minute as they moved southwesterly across the sky, in a row.  We then got out of the car and continued to look in amazement as two or three more appeared (not sure of the number), and they all followed the same path.  They were equidistant from one another, moving slowly and silently. The first one got smaller and smaller, then disappeared, and the others followed suit. I&#39;m guessing it lasted maybe four or five minutes until all disappeared. I&#39;ve researched and can&#39;t find any plausible explanation, and so I&#39;m sharing the experience here on the National UFO Reporting Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

These lights that I have seen all seem to disappear when nearby planes or helicopters pass the area, and the lights flare back up, sort of like these lights are in hiding.  It is awesome to see.  A few times I have noticed these orbs flare brightly and change colors from white to red, blue, yellow, sometimes they look like fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point along Highway 308 in Mathews, south of Highway 90 and the Gheens road, looking north, it seems that these ufos that I have been seeing are coming from the woods/marsh area that lies between Gheens road, Highway 90, and Lake Des Allemands.  They always tend to start there and slowly hover towards the vast area of sugarcane fields north of Gheens road, but south of Highway 90.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happens at night, usually starting around 10pm till 4:00am.

As it got closer we both realized this was no aircraft we had ever seen before, it was round, fairly large, it looked like a red bubble with red glowing lights all around it.  Kind of like a nucleus.  It was not a meteor or comet or swamp gas or any of that other nonsense the Government tries to make us believe, and it was not in any flight path for Newark airport or Teterboro airport.  I know the flight paths very well.  I see airplanes come past all day long,  I know their exact flight paths, this object also had no &#34;sound,&#34; totally silent,  it was to see the least eerie but yet quite fascinating!   The object flew over us then kept going fairly fast, then a few miles away it just &#34;vanished&#34;, poof it was gone.  My son was fortunate and smart enough to whip out his Galaxy S cell phone and record a good 25 seconds or so of this UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And what is really great is it passed an airplane going in the opposite direction so you can see the comparison and to top it off New York City was the backdrop skyline of the UFO, so it is perfect for skeptics.  It can be aligned perfectly and has a plethora of points of reference to prove it was definitely a real UFO!   We kept looking for an hour afterwards but we did not see any more red glowing objects jutting across the sky!   This was truly an amazing experience, I can&#39;t explain how totally and utterly great it is to experience such an event. I have been looking nearly my whole life and finally in my early 40&#39;s I see a bona fide UFO, how great is that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will keep scanning the sky&#39;s night after nigh, looking for the other worldly visitors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Signed, the Lyndhurstinite<n>

I was able to capture a 19 second video of the object however the size and color are not visible.  You can however see the object much brighter than the stars in the background as it moves from left to right.  The object seemed to be moving away from me and increasing altitude. If a star was 1 unit in diameter this was 10-20 units in diameter.  Not sure of the distance away it was, but appeared to be in our atmosphere.<n>

It moved at about the speed of a small plane and appeared to be at the same altitude as a small plane.  It appeared from the north and moved in a southerly direction until we could no longer see it.  The sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.  Although the object looked as if it were on fire, there was no smoke or smell.

Looking up we could see approximately 20 that my friend next to me pointed out of what looked to be orb type objects in the sky.  This was in the area where the planes fly for Lindburgh field the airport as we heard a big airplane fly thru.  They made a formation and looked to be hovering in groups as they were really close to each other, than a couple minutes later they were gone.<n>

Both ufo&#39;s were just like an orange ball of fire with rippling flames and only the first one seemed to have a smoke trail, as if it was really burning and hot.  They had about the average altitude of an airplane however it was moving pretty slow; meaning this was not a comet we have seen those before...  The second one was seen travelling the same approximate path, altitude and speed a few minutes after the first ufo was out of sight.  They were moving from East to North West in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of the ufo&#39;s would &amp;quot;turn off&amp;quot; meaning they went completely out no lights at all...  Then they would &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot; back on.  They made no sound at all and were very, very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second ufo was out of sight an airplane was coming from what seemed to be the exact same location as the ufo&#39;s did and continued along the same path as the ufo&#39;s did, however the airplane did fly in a more Northern direction as opposed to a North West direction after a couple of minutes...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was looking out over the water when I saw what I thought was a low-flying helicopter rapidly approaching me from the Staten Island side of the Kill.  I watched for a few seconds, getting confused as I was not seeing a helicopter or plane shape under a very bright, white light on top.  It was indistinct and dark, with an oval profile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I waited for it to pass overhead I was distracted for all of three seconds, as my dog got twisted up in his leash. I bent down to untangle him, stood back up and looked expectantly overhead to see this strange &#34;copter&#34; but there was no longer anything in the air overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point I had an excellent, unobstructed view of all directions around me, and that craft was nowhere to be found, nor was there any noise emanating from it whatsoever. I remember that the light was so much brighter than what one would normally see on an aircraft, and for the life of me cannot figure out exactly what I saw, or what transpired that day.<n>

The time was somewhere between 3-4 AM.  When I tilted my head back to finish the last of my Mt. Dew I noticed a perfectly round, shimmering object which appeared to be at least a thousand feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the object for several minutes as it crossed the sky in a south west direction.  It was not going in a perfectly straight line like an aircraft would.  I would describe it as a very elongated zig zag pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound or flashing lights, just a solid round lit up circle.  It didn’t appear to have lights on it, it seemed as the entire object was a light.  It was not overly bright and if it were light outside it may not have even been noticeable.  If you were to hold a pencil at arm’s length it would roughly be the same diameter as the object appeared in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 3-4 minutes the object seemed to disappear but as I looked closer it had just become very thin.  It was then that I realized it must have turned on its side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second later it appeared to begin climbing and was out of sight in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night with a large moon.<n>

The craft was either Navy from NAS North Island or Marine from MCAS Miramar.  Craft had the usual blinking red and white lights with the normal loud sound identifying it as helicopter.  Aircraft from both air stations fly east out to desert and return on a daily and nightly bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up I clearly saw helicopter being paced just to its left side by a bright turquoise colored light.  The object was silent and appeared to easily keep pace with the military craft.  The UFO seemed to fly smoother, faster and at some point tended to overtake the conventional craft as we watched both fly into the night towards a mountain range.  The sighting was relatively close and not as high as some of the aircraft often seen operating in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting reminded me of Russian Bear bomber fly- bys observing the aircraft carrier USS ENTERPRISE during operations in the Indian Ocean back in the mid eighties.  At that time I was part of a NAS North Island Helicopter squadron attached to the ship during a Western Pacific cruise.  Whenever Russian aircraft fly by the ship, we send up jet aircraft to closely escort them away.  I personally never seen any UFO(s) during any WESPAC cruises I ever been on.   Also Wednesday’s UFO sighting marked the only time I ever seen any aerial object of any unusual or turquoise color.  Both crafts were not as high up as the ones I witnessed in 1995 and the sighting a couple weeks ago in Lakeside.  After this sighting I asked the off-going guard and others have they ever seen aircraft with turquoise colored lights, and the answer was always, &#34;No, never,&#34; or words to that effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the only other UFO sighting I’ve ever been present, occurred back in 1971 during operations in the Gulf of Tonkin.  It was a no-fly day and a friend from North Dakota and I was at the bow on the flight deck.  It was a clear night and very quiet up there.  We were lying on the deck looking up at the stars when he mentioned that he noticed two white lights, flying very high and fast.  He said both lights flew parallel to one another before suddenly speeding away in opposite directions, lightning fast.  I looked for the objects but apparently they had vanished before I could see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never discussed UFOs with each other prior to that night.<n>

It was such a rare view that I actually tried following the object with my sight after it disappeared from view behind a tree.  Whatever it was it was bright white, not red like othe! r meteorites I&#39;ve seen. and what surprised me was the straight line it followed as if in level flight.<n>

But he distinctly saw 8 orange, dull colored lights in the distance and could not hear any noise, then they all started to disappear one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened approximately at 9 PM Eastern Standard time during a dingy colored full moon on a clear night. Temperature is in the 80s at the time with about 95% humidity.  There were more mosquitoes than average out tonight and I recall some strange activity among animals in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This actually reminds me now of a sighting I saw myself about 2 or 3 months ago while driving towards Wilmington on 95 North, probably a few miles from exit 7. I remember driving and seeing a strange rotating craft appear on my right with 3 distinct lights, it was hard to see, but it appeared that one of the lights was changing colors from red to green and I had my windows down but I could not hear any distinct afterburner sounds.  I was driving most likely around 70-75 mph and I lost the craft as trees began to appear in the foreground.  I have also witnessed strange crafts/lights in the Florida area.<n>

I made a left headed East and once I pasted Brand Rd. to my left there was a bright light that came out of nowhere.  I lit up the sky in a blue,white light and it had an haze around it.  I thought is was a flare or left over firework but it went down and then came up and I saw a small tail behind it.  I was waiting on a sonic boom or engine or rotor sound as it past over my car but there was no sound.  It flew over my car and headed in a southeast direction.  I looked behind me and didn&#39;t&#39; see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky background was not cloudy by grayish and dark as though an artist was painting a background in one fell swoop.  In FRONT of the background was a SILVER (shiny and bright) ship looking like a BLIMP, more than a cigar shape. I thought it strange because I did look for wings and there were none.  It appeared to be facing east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away at the traffic in front of me (bumper to bumper) and then looked back at the sky and no more blimp!  I looked at the sky as much as I could from the driver&#39;s seat of a car and could not see any blimp.  I did see see a regular passenger plane flying west towards O&#39;Hare about 3 to 4 seconds after seeing the blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pondered what I saw later and surmised that it did not appear that the blimp was moving at all or hardly at all.  The entire episode lasted less that 4 or 5 minutes.<n>

It lasted less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definitely wasn&#39;t a meteor and didn&#39;t have any orange trails.  There were no sparks.  It looked like if you took a section of a piece of shoelace and cut it so it was about 6 inches long, inflated it so it was rounded, but still flat... and the shoestring glowed a bright white to almost bluish light saber glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shoe string was huge though.  Miles long and was miles above the ground   It flew directly over head and fell downward, then disappeared all at once.  Not like it fell past the horizon, or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So if there&#39;s anyone else who saw it also, or anyone who might know what it was, please post here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n>

I stepped outside to investigate and what I witnessed was unlike anything I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 miles south of Lake Havasu City AZ I saw a very large UFO about the size of a city or maybe bigger, it was gigantic.  The saucer shaped object appeared to be a silver or chrome plated color glistening in the moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was hovering motionless in the air with seven or eight very bright flickering white lights attached in a circle around it. relative to a star, each light appeared to be about the size of the moon however the lights were not in space.  The UFO also had a plasma like coating around it and was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event only lasted a duration of about thirty seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rushed into my house to find a camera but by the time I got back outside, the lights had become very dim and faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was so advanced in technology, it was like seeing something out of a sci-fi movie. I believe it may have camouflage capabilities and other unknown abilities.  Whatever this was that I witnessed, I believe it is either from the future or a spaceship not from planet earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope my sighting will be taken seriously. I am afraid for my life and would like to find some answers to this unexplained mystery.<n>

We got bored and decided to go for a ride. We got down the dirt road a little way when E said that he wanted to ride on top of the car.  So we stopped and he got out and climbed on top.  I pulled out my camera on my phone and started filming him as we started driving down the road with him holding the luggage bar on top. I took 5 or 6 videos of him riding on The car.  The max video time limit on my phone was like 1 minute something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We get back to the camp later that night and i start watching the videos when i noticed something strange. (Keep in mind that no one saw anything in the sky even E who was riding on the car  Although he appears to notice it in the video)   At the very beginning of the video i point the camera towards the road to show how fast we are going and you can see a bright neon green light in the distance on the left side of the road. I point the camera back to E on the car, then back towards the road and the green light is now a cigar shape and is much closer.  It&#39;s on the right side of the road and is bigger and brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you stop the video about 5 seconds in you can see the reflection on The car and it looks like three green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the people who were there will testify that I did not tamper with this video in any way. And this is not a joke or a hoax. Im not saying it was an alien space ship, but i cant identify this strange light.<n>

I was looking up and around at the stars and we were both observing the full moon and Big Dipper constellation.  I saw something to the side of it that, at first, thought it was a planet and asked my sister to look.  I thought it was a little odd because I don&#39;t remember anything being there any previous nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it flashed into a bright white color--then back to orange.  Other than that flash, it did not blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after that, it flew extremely fast horizontally (and was completely silent), then turned, made a sharp 90 degree angle and took off at an extreme speed into the west( while changing back to white as it sped off) ;  Heading in the direction of the city of Minot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both KNOW what it was because we have seen many things similar to this when we lived down in California; near Edwards Air Force Base.<n>

I spotted this weird thing, and quickly pointed it out to my fiance because I thought my eyes were playing tricks.  But no, he saw it too.  It was this, almost orb of fire hovering across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance almost thought it looked like someone had shot a flare up into the sky, but it just flew in a straight line, no trail behind it.  It was going about as fast as a plane does when you see them in the sky, but it was a lot closer than a plane.  Almost maybe as high up as a 80 story building. I&#39;m just guesstimating here.  But it was moving at a decent speed, but slow enough to follow for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both me and my fiance caught it on our camera phones.  My camera wasn&#39;t to good on the quality, but I&#39;m still going to try and upload it somewhere.  The orb was like a fire color, a little orange, some red, and a little white at the edge.  The camera didn&#39;t pick it up that way though.  Me and him followed it for as long as possible, which about a few minutes, before the flame look went away and all we were able to see was a dark grey disk fade behind the tree&#39;s.  There was no sound to the strange thing, not like a plane would give off, no crash sound later on from like a meteor, no tail on the thing trailing behind it, just a fiery orb floating across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had posted the story on my Facebook, onto my paranormal web site, to see if anyone could help to identify it. And then someone sent me a link to this site.  I noticed some others were having similar experiences as us.  All I know is when the craft disappeared, I had the strangest gut feeling that we were not meant to witness that.<n>

I was only 2 miles from home when i saw it so i told my wife to go outside to look at it,but then it looked like it swelled instantly to 10 times the size it was and was alot brighter,my wife wittnessed this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then pulled over to get a better look when I did I noticed a commercial jet flying close to the object, when the jet passed under it the object began to move with the jet but at much greater alltitude(approx. 100,000 feet), it had been stationary untill then.  As they both passed over head iI noticed that the object had a blue glow on the bottom of it and the rest was glowing bright orange.  It was almost as if it was wanting to make no radar signal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they passed by me the jet kept moving normal,but the ufo took off at an incredible speed faster than any stealth fighter i&#39;ve ever seen,! then it was gone,as if it disapeared.<n>

Woodland ,  kansas City Mo 64155   This is not a UFO but just 3 really odd aircraft that would totally confuse people.      There is a 747-8-International with spot light like lighting going down the  body.   This 747 is visible as a cigar shape  from about 50 miles away, and looks  brighter then venus if it is heading towards you.   paint color seems to be white.     There 2nd aircraft looks to be a 737 with same lighting as the 747 but about 60% dimmer.  You can see it as a cigar shape from about 15-20 miles and looks like a normal large aircraft coming in for a landing.   Plaint color is all black.       The 3rd aircraft looks to be a small business jet with all the same characteristics as the 737.      747 is the main one I have noticed and it is magnificent.  They have been flashing the lights in cloud formations and it can resemble lighting.  If its flying overhead, its brighter then the full moon.     All the planes are zigzag! ging the Kansas City area,  with lights on, sometimes off, sometimes pulsing the lights, and flying around 5,000-15,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It then changed direction and turned green then it propelled downwards as if it was going into Lake Erie.  It was too fast to be a plane and as it changed direction we ruled out the possibility of a shooting star.  We got out of the car and waited for a while.  After a minute of no sightings we decided to drive towards the area we thought that we saw it fall however after waiting by the lake for 15 minutes we saw nothing so headed back to the camp we were staying at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on that night I was sitting out side of my cabin and saw two very interesting things. First as i looked up there was a grouping of 3 stars in a small triangle but when i looked closely the top star in the triangle was moving slightly to the right and the snapping back to the original position like it was attached to a piece of elastic. The second was a constant flashing light coming from the Lake Erie direciton.  A pure white light at tree level.  As I walked towards the direction, there were no cars or lights to produce the flash but it continued for a few minutes.<n>

It was not a planet, like Venus or Mars; it was much bigger than that, and was not a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked round, but it &#34;shimmered,&#34; like maybe it was spinning around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also had a distinct orange tail that came to a point, which made it look a bit like a rocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no debris trail after it, as a comet or a shooting star might have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, it moved across the sky in about 10 seconds, and disappeared over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was some space junk burning up in the atmosphere?<n>

At first I thought it was a helicopter or plane as we see them frequently near the GSP International Airport.  However, after a few seconds I ruled that out because it made no sound and was not flashing/strobing – it was a single red bright light, no green or white secondary lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the first one go past my location and then suddenly go out.  It was 30 sec to 45 sec from the time I first saw it in the distance until it went out.  It moved in a regular straight line, at a constant speed, appearing to climb in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after the first one disappeared, I noticed a second light in the exact same location (west/sw) and following the same path as the first.  I ran inside and got my wife to come out to see the light.  It hade moved on past our location and then went out at approximately the same point as the first.  This happened 3 more times for a total of 5 over about 5 minutes.  The altitude appeared to be about the same level as I usually see local news helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to grab a set of binoculars in time to look at the last occurrence.  The light appeared as a solid sphere.  I would have to compare it to seeing a red traffic light several hundred yards away on a dark night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a mostly clear night and the moon was shining very bright.<n>

8/1/12 21:00|Bedford|VA|Sphere|15 minutes|Dark orange round object/light in the sky, like the glowing and color of flame on coal when it is about to burn out|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91374.html|890|ndxe201208| dark orange round object/light in the sky, like the glowing and color of flame on coal when it is about to burn out<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night at 9:00 p.m me and my family came from Wal-Mart as we were heading up the highway we seen a dark orange round object/light in the sky, like the glowing and color of flame on coal when it is about to burn out, we slowed down to get a better look at it, so did other vehicles around us, we looked at it for about 4 minutes it was over an area with houses, the object was not moving and it did not have any sound, it didn’t do anything, the distance from the ground was about the distance of a low flying plane, then we decided to go up the highway to take the exit back to the road to get to the right side of the road to get a better view so were the other vehicles in front and behind us doing the same thing but when we got back to the spot where it was, it was gone this took about 1 minute to 2 minutes to get back to the spot we didn’t get to see what direction it was going, so we decided to leave the area and go home when we got half way their maybe 7 mi! nutes from the time we left the other area, we saw the object/ light again but it was at a much further distance it didn’t look like it was moving, as I was driving it was getting harder to see because of the mountains and trees in the way eventually we couldn’t see it anymore so we proceeded to go home. It seems strange to me because I have never seen anything like this, it didn’t move nor had sound, but eventually it did move to another spot, but within a 7 minute time frame to another spot that we seen it at, it could have went to another area before we seen it again, it’s odd that it seems like it has a stop and go pattern like it may be looking or waiting for something.<n>

It moved up and down repeatedly at a very quick speed again with no particular pattern or timing.  It began to flash blue and white lights down while still being lit up and moving up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it turned blue once more and went all the way down until it was no longer visible and did not come back up again. The whole thing lasted about 4 minutes.<n>

After following it to a dirt path and as I came to the end where it was at there was a gate that said it was an  animal reserve.  I have lived here my whole life and never heard of that being there.  The other I got on tape with a jet following it but was left behind after the object went to fast for the jet to keep up with it.  It was as bright as a star and sometimes it seems to get as bright as the sun.  It is so bright and fast.  If the sky is right you can see a tail of smoke from it when it goes fastest.  I have it in the day time on video also of the jet behind it.<n>
8/1/12 20:00|St. Charles|MO|Triangle|Every Night, all night un|Numerous Triangular/Chevron shapes of white lights that pulsate every night for over 6 mo. They're hover exact same area & do not move|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97631.html|893|ndxe201208| Numerous Triangular/Chevron shapes of white lights that pulsate every night for over 6 mo. They&#39;re hover exact same area &amp; do not move<n> <n><n> <n><n> I simply want to share that every night, during all dark hours, since August 2012 and longer, I have seen these very same triangular or possibly Chevron form of white lights.  They hover in the exact same locales in the atmosphere.  You see them every night, at any time of night.  They are in the exact same locales, and the lights at first seemed to be idle, then as I watched longer intervals of time each night, I noticed the lights seem to be slightly pulsing.. only enough to notice that they are actually pulsating.  Then, withing the last week, a few nights ago, I noticed they were blinking erratically.  Blinking at fast intervals.. they seem to be &amp;quot;aligned&amp;quot; in the shape of the &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; and they seem to pulsate in a consecutive order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seem to be at only a slightly higher level in the atmosphere as to what I see airplanes flying at night.  I&#39;ve noticed airplanes flying in the lower vicinity of the atmosphere and wonder if they are noticing this as well.  As they seem to go right past the objects, yet at a lower level.  I&#39;ve also wondered if there are satellites in the sky that send signals for towers and internet, etc.. yet I have no clue.. One thing I am sure of though, is that they&#39;ve not been there forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also curious if it could be some sort of lights for airlines as I live within 30-40 miles of the airport and the planes fly a bit lower in the atmosphere here. All said and done.. these objects &amp;quot;hover&amp;quot; in an idle position, they never move and are in the exact same area of the atmosphere.. every night, all night they are visible due to their lights..  Ever since I had seen them blinking erratically a few days ago, they have continued to blink, or rather pulsate consecutively in a more noticeable and faster motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to find a patter in the numerous objects I am spotting, as they are very near to each other.. yet I can only see so far above the housing and trees.. Trying to see if I noticed them being all part of one larger pattern, yet I cannot see a pattern, One object seems to be alone, then I have seen three &amp;quot;sets&amp;quot; where two are very near to each other and both pulsating.  And then by one of these sets..  there is another one.. that really stands out in comparison to all of the others.. as if it is much, much closer in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve tried to take photos, yet I only have a small personal camera and camera phone, and the lights all captured as a solid blur.  It is really starting to get to me, I am wanting to get captures of this and wishing I had a camera that could capture them. I&#39;ve shown them to other family members after telling them about them.. to assure that I had not been seeing things.. and they admit to seeing these objects being visible to them in the same manner as they are to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am to the point that I want to go and rent a professional camera to try to capture them.  I want to show everyone what it is I am seeing every night for over half of a year now.. or longer.. They hover these areas every night, I can see them high in the atmosphere, when standing on the porch, or sidewalk or curbside in front of the house.  I look across the street above the neighbors house, and there is one always above the stack on their roof.   Then looking straight up from the sidewalk at curbside, facing the house, I see a &amp;quot;set&amp;quot;  with another one that is brighter and seems near to the set, yet lower in the atmosphere, then facing SW I see one above the trees in the backyard, and then more towards east, I see two more, then facing NW I see another one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects are, of course, as mentioned before, higher in the atmosphere than airplanes flying over, yet they are equally visible as the airplanes, if not more.. especially very recently, and since the past week or so, when noticing the lights beginning to pulsate more erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m anxious to be able to expose them to others, and wishing I had a camera to take photographs, that can capture them.. as I said, my family are seeing them as well..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I saw a red craft, very far, around the Hudson river, between Lower Manhatten and Hoboken area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was no plane, I have never red lights of the sort, it vanished fairly quick.  Planes pass by every 5 minutes, same flight path, but this one,.. stood out from afar the common flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept flickering prob 3 flickers per second.  It seemed small and headed towards Manhattan, which is weird because usually planes fly around the city, not towards it.<n>

I work in a data center so I get off late at night.  Around 2:30am, I am standing outside smoking a cigarette.  The rain had subsided, but there were still strong winds being blown around in all directions.  I was speaking to a buddy on the phone looking out into the night sky.  The clouds were hanging low and the street lights were giving the clouds an eerie orange glow.  It also lit up the sky.  I caught something out of the corner of my eye moving from the North.  I am facing due West at this point.  It was just under the clouds and moving at a good pace, about 100mph if I were to guess.  It was traveling South just above 75 Central Expressway.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen, or may ever see in my life.  It was a black cube 80-100ft tall.  I was awe-struck.  I really sat and took in the moment even with my friend on the phone.  I knew this was special.  It didn&#39;t make a single noise and was about 500ft off the ground.  It literally looked like it was carved out of a rough black stone.  There were no lights to speak of.  There were no pipes or anything industrial on the outside of the craft. When the craft was directly in front of me I could clearly see the details.  The side facing me was framed on the edge.  I mean that it had a line carved into the stone that ran the entire edge of the side.  Within the framed edge was a circular pattern.  It was obvious to me that it was a deliberate pattern.  I can only say that it would take an understanding of mathematics to create the circle.  As it went from my right to left, North to South, it left a vapor trail that swirled in the disturbed air behind it.  Like I said, it made no sound.  It was absolutely huge.  The rain started to come down again as it left my sight.  I immediately told my friend to go outside as he was South of my location.  He waited out in the middle of his street for 20 minutes looking for it. He was never able t! o see it as conditions worsened with the rain.  I cannot stop ! thinking about this incident now.  I cannot stop looking for this craft.  It is monumental in terms of what kind of an impact this has had on my life.  This changes everything.<n>

After a while I started looking in the skies on the way to and from the mountain and witnessed a triangle formed by orbs hovering approx 4 feet off the water at Hauser Lake.  I took pictures with 24x zoom and they look like mini versions of the sun, yellow, and white even blue.  When you look with binoculars it looks like the people from the movie cocoon, glowing beings or some object in the middle of a beam of light.  I videotaped them and have many photos, what are they?  They stay in the same spots and just bounce around, if you didn’t know any better you would think they were just stars, but they are low to the ground and dance around.  Please if anyone ! has seen these before tell your story, I only seen them in Idaho around the mountain areas.  Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Notes:  Possible stars?  PD))<n>

Since 2012, early september I have been blessed enough to been in contact and i see, hear, and comunnivcate with things that would blow your mind.  They have appeared by my places of residence, work, and personal friends dwelling.  They say they have alot to say to the proper people.  They want to speak to the world.  Scientists been looking for radio signals but the signal is really a telekenetic signal.  They say they send out minor signals that is suppose to be felt not heard.  They want to answer the questions that you have always wanted to know.  That is all for now.   I left multiple messages and believe me it took a year for me to come to terms with this blessing.  At this time they say: &#34; that is all for now.&#34;  The  brain waves if monitored properly will read.  People seen me call down lightning and thunder on a count. B! ut that power is not mine.  Like i said, I have been blessed beyond your wildest dreams.   Thank you ... E. l        To whom it may concern, Im a 39 yr. old male,   born and raised bay area native.  I have 6 children and 3 grand daughters.   I have been looking for people, someone, or anyone that would take what i have to share, show, and hear seriously.  I&#39;ve made attempts to contact respectable and credible establishments such as Lockheed, NASA, Chabot science observatory, and Stanford university, but to my dismay I&#39;ve failed to establish a suitable contact.  Other than Dr. V ahay Patrozian at  Stanford University and Bill Buress at the Chabot Science Observatory,  The &#34;Powers That Be&#34; lead me to your website at this late hour and after diligently reading all you represent by well thought out words alone,  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re the answer to my prayers.  This has been on my top endeavor list and has consumed every aspect of my life.  I have found you&#39;re site searching the word &#34;ANAMOLOUS&#34; -and all that i wish to share with you falls under that exact word, ANAMOLOUS!  It will astound you and impre! ss you and probably most likely answer many questions that seem to be left unanswered in particular areas.  I hope to speak with you very very soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In P.s.  You may respond to this email but a phone call is best.   God bless.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
