I SAW A STAR FALLING AND SAID MONEY, MONEY, MONEY AND THEN SUDDENLY WHAT I WAS WATCHING WAS ABOUT 1000 FEET AWAY,  A DISK SHAPED SHIP HOVERED OVER SOME LIGHTS IN THE DISTANCE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THEN THE TOP HALF BECAME TRANSPARENT AND I COULD SEE PEOPLE WALKING AROUND AND LOOKING OUT THE WINDOWS.  THIS ONLY WAS A FEW MINUTES SINCE MY HUSBAND AND I WERE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND DID NOT STOP.  THE ROADS WERE VERY ICY AND THERE HAD BEEN A 13 INCH SNOW STORM.  THAT IS ALL I REMEMBER.<n>
12/16/72 22:30|Gravesend (UK/England)||Triangle|15-20 seconds|the three lights moved horizontal 1/4- 1/2 mile then shot up at great speed at 45 % stiil horizontal|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45820.html|2|ndxe197212| the three lights moved horizontal 1/4- 1/2 mile then shot up at great speed at 45 % stiil horizontal<n> <n><n> <n><n> From late October 1972 to 21st March 1973 i was in Gravesend Sea Training College (Kent, England, UK)  training to go into the merchant navy.  I had been assigned to &#34;T&#34; class.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night we were having a bit of a friendly fight between ourselves, all of a sudden one of our dormitory got all excited and started shouting UFO! UFO! and started pointing out of one of our dormitory windows.  We all (approx.11-12) rushed to look to see what he was pointing at, there approximately 200-250feet above our football (soccer) field were three big white lights. The single light was nearest to us with the other two beside each other just behind it, the object seemed to be triangular in shape, also there seemed to be no noise, the object was also not moving it was just hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at the object for several seconds (I am unsure how many, )when it suddenly began to move forward at what appeared to be a slow speed and passed over our our building.  Our roof was a flat roof and had no windows so we had to cross to the other side of our dormitory this would have been about twenty feet.  When we looked out of the window opposite to the first one we could see the object still moving in the same direction, it seemed to be at the same height and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how far it traveled but it would  at a guess be a quarter to half a mile, suddenly it climbed at a huge speed.  When it climbed the object seemed to attain its speed instantly, it stayed on a horizontal plane not climbing as with a coventional aircraft, also it left no trail that we could see. The object took about 3-4 seconds to be out of sight, it never altered course it just shot up at a great speed at about 45 degrees from a horizontal slow level flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May i point out that this is the first time that this is the first time i have reported this in writing anywhere, although i have told people at times since it happened.  I also have flown light aircraft, sailed in the Mechant Navy for 18 years so am able to judge distances to some degree.  I was also told this sighting was reported in the local newspaper although i do not know if this was true, this is about an accurate description I can give.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

12/6/72 00:00|Ireland (not sure which town)||Light|5mins approx|1 light comes down from space, two other smaller lights attach themselves and then all go up into space.|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46123.html|4|ndxe197212| 1 light comes down from space, two other smaller lights attach themselves and then all go up into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would just like to state that I was not the witness of the event, but I was retold it by someone who at the time I was very close to, as I was not even born when the event occured:however, the person who was the witness was a very serious man and even didnt want to tell me as he was a sceptic and didnt really understand what he saw: but I thought that it was a very very interesting event that took place and should be on this website:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dates and Time are approx only, In around june, about 1972 the witness was in his garden with his kids in ireland at approx midnight looking up at the stars (as its an incredible view in ireland not many city lights where they were) the witness told me  he saw 2 lights (like stars) moving, they were as high up as what the stars appear to be and one was to the left of him the other coming in at the right (as if heading towards each other)he watched them as they slowly moved closer into contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, and this is the weird and almost unnerving part, a larger much larger light came down (as if from space) the two other lights seemed to join to the larger light, and then the larger light moved with speed back up into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say that the man who told me this was in full awarness of his faculties and as I said didnt even believe what he saw years on, he doesnt like to tell people as obviously it doesnt sound very normal, and like a piece of fiction. But I can say that this person is telling me excactly how the event happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I am not the witness but hope that its ok to post this, but feel free to contact me. I fully support what this site does and am just as intrigued as to what is going on in the UFO world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

12/1/72 20:00|Osowatomie|KS|Circle|15 minutes|In 1972 my ex-husband and I were returning from Christmas shopping. I noticed an object following us and coming closer to our car. When|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29527.html|5|ndxe197212| In 1972 my ex-husband and I were returning from Christmas shopping. I noticed an object following us and coming closer to our car. When I called this to my exhusband&#39;s attention he made fun of it and asked me if I thought &#34;that was a UFO&#34; Suddenly, the object could be clearly seen near the electrical wires running along the road and just as suddenly it lowered itself down and flew next to ythe passanger side. My exhusband became a bit alarmed and I began to yell for him to stop. However he was so scared that he stepped on the gas and the faster he went the faster the object folloewd. I lowered the window and heard a slight humming sound and noticed that one of the side lights of the object was partialy burned. The next thing I rememebered wss our car being stoped alongside the road and the object behind us turning extremely bright and taking off. When I got home I told my mother what we had witnessed. I was overcome with extreme sleepiness I lay down and went to sleep until the next day. It was approximaly 9pm. One of the things that still puzzles me, is why my ex-husband and I never spoke with each other regarding this experience. years later when my son went to visit him in Kansas he told him that we were not the only ones who were pulled to the side of the road. I do not remeember that. When I was in college I told my physics teacher  regarding this experience and a symbol I kept rememebering. he told me it was a Greek letter and a physics symbol that stood for &#34;electro-magnetic self propulsed&#34;&gt;. There is a few things whcih I seem to rememeber about this night but I have never been able to determine wheather I dreamt them or not....This experienced has NEVER left me and there has been times when I try very hard to rememeber and rememeber....to re-live it....My son who was only 2 at the time kept pointing att he pbject and later rememebered the experience until he was 3 or 4 and then forgot never to regain that memoy again..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) Lesemann NY 2203  ((sic--zip codes have four digits.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Her husband was taking me and several others on a church cookout (at a park?). We were riding in a regular school bus. As dusk approached, we noticed a bright blue circle high in the sky - maybe 20,000 to 50,000 feet. It seemed to float there. It was soon joined by another blue one and later a red one. They all seemed to float in some kind of formation. As we rode further still, we noticed that people were pulling over and getting out to look up at the same thing. This lasted until almost dark (about an hour) and then they split up and flew off in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
