Then every now and then the lights would stop (as far as I could see) for a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I saw is was when it floated at the bottom displaying yellowish/white light and then the light started to weaken until the item was gone or no longer visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first only three lights shined on each point of the triangle. The lights were similar to those new, almost blue, lights you see on some cars (neons?). The craft was moving too slow to be a regular plane. It couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter. A few moments later, more lights came on. I didn&#39;t count exactly but I&#39;d estimate a total of 7 lights at this point. The object speeded up a little and eventually moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sounded like...? Wind? Like a very quite plane, but no engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wish I had known to count and notice direction. I was in shock at the time. Wasn&#39;t really thinking about anything else except to watch it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to note that there IS a military base nearby, so perhaps the object I saw was some new test plane? I have no idea. It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
2/28/06 20:57|Taos|NM|Triangle|3 seconds|At night, huge triangle craft with three red lights zooming towards Taos Mountain at an unimaginable speed|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49345.html|3|ndxe200602| At night, huge triangle craft with three red lights zooming towards Taos Mountain at an unimaginable speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was opening my window that faces south to get some fresh air I immediately saw  in the clouds a dark triangle craft with a red light on each three corners and I only saw it for a few seconds because the thing took off through the sky towards the east over Taos mountain traveling at a speed that was unimaginable. It took my breath away that it was so fast. I have never seen anything like it. There was absolutely no noise and the size of the craft appeared to be huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was heading home on heading south on Western Ave. at around 27st. I noticed a bright light to the left side in the sky. I thought it was an airplane as I see many airplanes in that area because they are heading to Midway airport to land. As I kept going on southbound on Western Ave. I kept getting close, but it looked weird. It look like a plane with no wings and it had lights flashing. The lights look like they were dancing. So I speed up and made a right hand turn at 36th street and parked at the corner. I didn&#39;t get off the my car, but I opened the window. As it passed westward I saw this on its side. When I said this is no plane, a red light flashed in my face. It disorientated me for a few seconds. It seemed like a sign telling me they saw me. As It continue westward, it turned now heading southbound. It seemed it picked up speed and I didn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 5 mintues away from home. When I got home my mom was making something to eat. I went right to the mirror to see if there was anything on my face because I felt a burning sensation. I even asked my mom if she noticed anything on my face. She said no. I went to my parents bedroom where my dad was and told him, dad you are not going to believe what I saw. He said to me that he heard it pass by. Before telling him anything. My dad said he heard a hover/murmur noise. My dad said he even look out his bedroom window to see what it was, but he didn&#39;t see anything just the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, this is my story. It is a bit lenghtly, but this is my experience what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/28/06 19:45|South Kingstown|RI|Chevron|3 minutes|Huge chevron or triangular craft with two large white circular lights|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49343.html|5|ndxe200602| Huge chevron or triangular craft with two large white circular lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> While a few miles from my home, in the village of Perryville in South Kingstown, at the intersection of post road and rt.110 I saw a gigantic chevron or possible triangular craft moving very slowly in a ENE direction.  What caught my immediate attention were two huge non-flashing round yellow-white lights, not bright, spaced an enormous distance apart.  I then noticed a black shape and then a small flashing green light in the center of this craft. I stopped my truck and got out. The craft made no noise at all and kind of drifted sideways in the ENE direction until I lost it in the tree tops. I would say it was no more than 500ft in the air on a perfectly clear starlit night.  I drove back out on to rt.1 to see if the craft were still visible but it had apparently drifted north away from rt.1.  I circled around and came back but could not see the craft again.  I called the South Kingstown police, asking if anyone else had reported the sighting but they said &#34;no.&#34;  They did take my report seriously and thanked me for the info.  The dispatcher asked if anything was dropped from the craft and I said not that I saw.  I would say that the craft was as big as a football field or two 747s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While returning home from my daughters horse lessons, I noted two lights to the west that seemed to be standing still.  From my vantage point on Browns Lane, I have an unrestricted view of Narragansett bay, Portsmith Island, and South Kingstown.  I often see lights from aircraft in this area that are heading into T.F. Green or Quonsett airport.  What made these lights stand out was the fact that they didnt appear to move and they appeared to be at the same altitude.  The distance between the two lights appeared to be maybe a hundred yards, and did not have the staggard appearance of distance that aircraft in a landing pattern do.  Having read the report of 28 Feb, I can also add that these lights would have been in the direction of the area that the report came from at a distance of abot 10 miles.  Sighing lasted about 10 to 13 seconds before a curve in the road obscured my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I let him out and he ran to the back chainlink fence, looking up and barking, I looked and saw a dark object about 40 feet away, 20 feet off the ground. It made no sound, daylight did not reflect off it, it was sort of round at the top and square at the bottom, it was small, about 4 feet high by 3 feet wide, it was just sitting there in the air, sort of twisting slowly, as soon as I thought &#34; I have to get my camera&#34; it bent backwards and started to ascend up, slow at first , then quickly, till it entered a cloud bank, but I could see it as a small black dot, it just sat there for a while, then was gone. It seemed to be examining the large Petroleum tanks for the airport fuel cache.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Each craft had a row of lights that blinked in sequence from left to right. they were flying very slow and made no sound. I watched them fly in a straight line away from me for about 6 or 7 minutes untill they were completley out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 10 seconds long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stargazing from the pool area of the Doubletree Hotel in Oak Ridge Tennessee on the 27th of February 2006, when I witnessed three fireballs flying slowly through the clear night sky.  They kept an equal distance from each other until the moment before they disappeared when one of the fire balls on the outside of the formation made a quick and unnatural turn towards the other two.  It was at that very moment when the three disappeared.  I tried to point them out to my friend but he was not able to see them.  I thought that I might have hallucinated it until I web searched &#34;UFO sightings Oak Ridge Tennessee.&#34; It seems that there were a lot of sightings from that area back in the 50&#39;s.

I thought I was witnessing some type of explosion but there was no sound following the flash and no visual evidence presented itself.  Other drivers appeared to notice the flash as well, as the light-to-moderate traffic slowed immediately and noticeably after the flash.  I don&#39;t know if this qualifies as a UFO sighting but it did seem extremely strange at the time and I was curious if anybody else reported anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came from the SE sky very fast for being so far away. It had red and white blinking lights ( I saw 4-5 distinct lights). It travelled from east to west for about 10-15 seconds and then, what surprised me was the 180 degree turn, within 2 seconds; and in another ten -15 seconds disappeared. It may have been a jet, because there was a sound like a jet, but Canada doesnt have a jet like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If the object had been dimmer, it would have appeared the way Mars appears on a normal night. The object was clearly not Mars so I stopped to look at it. For 3 minutes I watched it drift to the west, and then slightly north. In all, it covered perhaps a 10 degree swath of the sky. During this time its brightness varied in intensity. Finally at about 11:03pm it faded out and was no longer visible. I waited an additional minute to see if I could spot it again but I could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw disk object with light under the disk. It was moving slowly above the city. Around the object I saw a lot of helicopters and planes. They were staying it. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know whta happened after an object went behind the building. But after 2 min. I saw another object which appierd on the same spot. It was smaller or may be furhter. Then, I saw another object but I didn&#39;t catch the shape because it was quite far. The only one thing to tell you that it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have everything on the tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/26/06 19:30|Tampa|FL|Unknown|25 - 30 mins|Large diamond or saucer-shaped obect just north of Tampa, FL with red flashing lights top and bottom and white lights at ends.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49311.html|20|ndxe200602| Large diamond or saucer-shaped obect just north of Tampa, FL with red flashing lights top and bottom and white lights at ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Beginning at approximately 7:30pm EST I noticed a odd configuration of lights west of my location which would just to the north of the Tampa International airport.  There were two alternating flashing red lights on top of each other and white non-flashing lights to the left and right about 2.5 to 3 times as far apart as the red lights.  The red and white lights formed an elongated diamond shape (I was never able to make out any physical shape).  I observed the grouping of lights remain stationary for about 5 mins and then they collectively drifted very slowly in a northward directly a short distance and stopped again.  They maintained the same position this time for about 20 mins.  Then, the grouping of ligths dipped slightly clock-wise relative to my position and the object drifted to my right (northward) again, tipped sligthly in a counter-clockwise direction and then moved very quickly in a west or south-west direction, disappearing over the horizon directly west of my position within about 3 or 4 seconds.  About 10 seconds later I saw plane fly over heading in the exact direction of the object moving very quickly relative to other routine air traffic in the area (looked like a fighter jet).  Possibilities ruled out for object: traditional airplane - too big and stationary for 20 mins, grouping of helicopters - none of the individual lights ever changed position relative to the others (not even remotely) and object moved too fast to be a helicopter or multiple helicopters, blimp - far larger than any blimp I&#39;ve ever seen and moved much faster than a blimp when it did move, hot air ballon - don&#39;t think so, lights on building - buildings and radio towers don&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working late on a Sunday so the other person around was the security guard on duty who also witnessed the object.  Address of sighting: XXXX E Palm Avenue Tampa, FL 33605 looking west-northwest.<n>
2/26/06 18:30|Santa Fe|NM|Light|2 minutes|brilliant light skids low across sky without a sound|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49351.html|21|ndxe200602| brilliant light skids low across sky without a sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside at dusk and looked up to see the stars, as it was just then dark enough. Saw a very bright light moving overhead at a good clip; about as fast as a low-flying aircraft appears to move. Thought initially that the light was the landing spotlight of an aircraft but there was (a) no noise whatsoever and (b) the light was unaccompanied by the blinking red and green id lights common to aircraft. Also the light remained steady for the duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was approximately magnitude -5 or possibly -6; it was distinctly brighter than venus, and a yellowish-white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light displayed a peculiar sort of sliding motion in additon to its forward vector as it crossed the sky from west to east in about 2 minutes. (we have a big sky in New Mexico). By sliding I mean that it appeared to move slightly north as it travelled eastward, but to do so in a way that made it seem it was an ancilliary to its primary motion eastward. It&#39;s hard to describe, but it was like when the wind is perpendicular to the road and it makes your car veer slightly as you&#39;re driving. But I the skidding motion of this light was constant and did not seem to vary with the gusting wind that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen the ISS and this did not resemble it at all, being far brighter and apparently closer, and moving faster, as my wife who also saw the tail end of the sighting confirmed. Nor did it look like a balloon reflecting the setting sun, as the light was constant throughout the minutes it took to cross the sky, fading out only after it had gone far to the east almost to the horizon, and this was 10 or 15 minutes after sunset. It was also moving far faster than I&#39;ve ever seen a balloon move, even in high wind. (And the International Balloon Fiesta is about 60 miles north in Albuquerque every year, so I&#39;ve seen my share of balloons.)<n>

Airplanes make their turns in this area and you can always hear them because their so low but not what we saw. It was moving at a steady speed, stoped then disapeared. I wasn&#39;t a believer till now. I called my buddy up a few days later and asked him if we were crazy and he said no because that was fact that they do exsist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

I had my curtains open and was looking at the sky. In almost an instant I saw a bright green light drop in the sky. I at first thought it was very strange but then convinced myself that it was a shooting star. My sister came to me tonight to tell me about the exact same thing that happened to me. She said she has seen it several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went home with him that day. Well any ways his mom was driving us to the high school to get my friends sister. So when we were in the car line a big bright yellow object was floating right over the sun. It was smaller than the sun so it only covered about a fourth of the sun. It floated across the sun and went behind a cloud and dissappered. My friend and I were convinced we had seen a u.f.o.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This followed by a light in the sky moving in some pretty amazing ways. As soon as it appeared it disappeared.  This was the second time i have seen this phenomenon. The other occured, i&#39;d say in early Feb. around 8:30 pm. I was driving with my girlfriend, and in the sky i noticed 3 flashes, then a distinct ball of light in the sky. After about 2 minutes of light movement, it simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, March 12, 2006, an object apeared out of the sky and left a trail. This was seen around 4:30 pm.  Now, i&#39;m not sure if this was a UFO, but the fact that it appeared basically out of nowhere puts a little suspision in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The third was very high up, almost in outer space it appeared. They were alighned an a certian way that it looked as almost they were relaying information. I have a feeling that the creature is as curious about me as I was him. They were not hostile. They played and litterally hid in the clouds. That night was a night i will neve forget. I know the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had my back to it and saw it after I stood up and turned, but others noted flames coming from the tail. It made no noise and our view was eventually obstructed by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were seven people who saw this after a dinner without alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a physician.

2/24/06 19:30|Baltimore/Windsor Hills|MD|Chevron|5 - 10 minutes|3 luminous chevron-like objects silently cruising.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49281.html|35|ndxe200602| 3 luminous chevron-like objects silently cruising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw 3 V-shaped objects flying SE, though they could have been triangular. They were silent, and their distance and dimensions couldn&#39;t be determined, though they must have been quite large. They almost had a translucent appearance, though the front edge seemed luminous (almost as if hazy, glowing lights or a &#34;string of stars&#34; had been strung across the front). Each object remained visible for 5 to 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the first one at about 7:30pm then walked to a less illuminated area for better viewing. About five minutes later two more objects appeared and flew in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/24/06 18:40|San Fernando|CA|Triangle|About 20 seconds|Large triangle shaped craft with three blue lights spotted by by two seperate motorists in San Fernando Valley.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49283.html|36|ndxe200602| Large triangle shaped craft with three blue lights spotted by by two seperate motorists in San Fernando Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a big skeptic.  I keep an open mind, but draw no conclusions.  What my fiancee and I saw was nothing like we&#39;ve seen before.  Around 6:00, both of us got into our cars and proceed home from of different jobs.  I was commuting North from Glendale into Valencia.  My fiancee was coming from Reseda Blvd and was battling out the freeways in heavy traffic.  At about 7:40, going west on the 210 freeway I spotted three lights traveling from the North to the South (San Fernando).  The three lights formed what I can almost positively identify as a solid triangle.  Two lights were a cool blue and did not pulse or strobe in any way, and a thrid, on the side (not directional front) was more white/yellow (also did not flash or blink).  The object was large and low, about the size of a large commercial air craft at about the altitude you see them when they&#39;re approaching an airport to land.  Sometimes you might see a strange light in the sky, but as you watch it it always explains itself by changing direction or distance and you come to realize, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s just a plane... I couldn&#39;t see the wings before.&#34;  But I observed this as it traveled across the complete 180 degrees of my field of sight, crossing over the freeway and continuing on over San Fernando Valley.  This object never changed perspective.  It appeared as a SOLID, large, geometric triangle with three lights at its points.  No curves.  No wings.  And it glided slowly perfectly smooth over the freeway.  Too slow for a plane at that distance and altitude.  This was strange, but I might have been able to dismiss it easier if I hadn&#39;t arrived home to hear my fiancee saw the exact same object from the other side of the valley.  Our observations were identical, and we both agreed that our after-work sleepy daze was broken when this strange object immediately stuck out.  We both, independently came to the same conclusions (not that it was a space ship or anything, just that this was no ordinary plane) and we were shocked to find we both witnessed it.  One case of over-active imagination... maybe.  But two?  I was going about 60 MPH but my fiancee was stuck in heavy traffic.  I&#39;m sure others on the freeway must have witnessed the same thing and I&#39;d like to know if anyone got a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/24/06 15:08|Santa Ana|CA|Formation|4 minutes|3 circular metallic objects flying east to west in a traingular formation over central orange county, followed by another object|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49286.html|38|ndxe200602| 3 circular metallic objects flying east to west in a traingular formation over central orange county, followed by another object<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking my last work break at around 3:00 pm and I had gone up to the upper level of our parking structure, and as I stood there looking northward at the Orange County Skyline,  I saw some movement far in the Distance.  That is when I saw 3 Small, Metallic looking Circular Objects  flying in a triangular formation, Flying from East to West at a high rate of speed.  It almost looked like they were flying on a straight line from the Mountains East of the city of Orange, toward Long Beach and The Ocean. After I lost them in the Horizon to the east, I thought that was the last of it, but two minutes later, another object appeared in front of me, also moving fast on an East-West direction, as if trying to catch the other 3, except that this object seemed to bounce up and down as it flew westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the time the 3 objects flew by, but before the last one passed, a helicopter happened to fly by right over my head, at a fairly high altitude, that&#39;s when I realized that I could hear the copter&#39;s engine noise, but the 3 objects did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t be sure if they were man made or not, but even at the distance and altitude that they flew, they were visible enough to have seen wether they had wings or propellers, and I did not see either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If they were made by the military, all I can think is that they might have been Jet powered Drones, or they must have been testing missiles near our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen strange objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last January I also saw an object hovering over Santa Ana, And I happen to know that someone else saw that object as well.  So now every time I go out on my breaks, I am more attentive of whats above me,  and it seems to be paying off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was seen from a vehicle traveling southbound on Yale. The object appeared to be disk shaped and light colored/semi-reflective (white/light silver).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a pilot so I know and recognize most types of aircraft. This object appeared to be 1/4 mile south of my position and approximately 1,000 feet in elevation. At that distance, it appeared to be slightly larger than an F-15 (which we commonly see here). The object, I believed was going to approach our location as the airport was nearby. I was very curious to see the object closer so I could identify it as it was very strange looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the object didn&#39;t appear to be moving in our direction. Possibly moving slowly and laterally. After about 15 seconds, it began to travel away from us (north) at an incredible speed. It became a distant point before disappearing out of sight after about 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions were calm and clear. No other air traffic was in the immediate area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed behind us about half mile back near the road we turned off shadow looking objects (no apparent shape) coming closer up the road. This was after seeing a orange beam come straight down behind us while driving up the road we turned off. My girlfriend started to drive again while i was in the extended cab of our truck. We turned onto a main road then off onto the next road down from the one we turned off and drove up about a half mile and stopped. It had snowed during the day and the road was covered and a very light snow was falling.  We were looking behind us and near the end of the road alittle up from the main road we could see a white light that looked like it was a car with just its dome light on. It went off then came back on closer to us and then off and then we started to drive again. Looking back it seemed as if there was something right behind us, a black shadow of something and a red beam flashed by the truck.  We then came to a stop sign and turned left onto the road we live on, about 100 ft after turning it seemed like we were in a blizzard with snow flying heavy and blowing very hard. Our satellite radio lost reception during this. The blowing snow stopped after about 10-15 seconds and then totally stopped as if a helicopter had gone right over head.  There was no noise of any kind and we returned home 2 minutes later. 2 hours after arriving home there was a bright white light in the lower sky outside our house moving in circular patterns for about 40 minutes. My girlfriends mother witnessed this light it then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The lights were moving slowly across my rooftop from north to south, coming in from Dallas, TX (Waxahachie is about 35 miles south of Dallas).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two leading edges of the triangle were each lit with 12-14 white lights.  I could see no lights along the back (trailing) side of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Movement appeared initially to be very slow.  So slow, in fact, that I first guessed these lights to be those of WWII planes from the Confederate air force flying in a tight formation.  I quickly discarded that hypothesis due to both the number of lights (estimate 25-28 total) and the precise distance of one from another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the craft cleared my roofline it appeared to speed up radically.  Within 1/2 second it had vanished far to the south.  It made no noise whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot estimate how high the craft or how fast it eventually was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/23/06 23:00|Edneyville|NC|Light|5 minutes|It was as if it wanted me to see it|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49275.html|42|ndxe200602| It was as if it wanted me to see it<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my second sighting within a 6 week period. I live in the foothills of NC. For the first sighting, my neighbor witnessed it also. It had white, red, and blue lights. Our eyes could not focus on it very well, almost as if it changed from oval to triangular. It was close to us, not &#34;way up,&#34; but just on top of the hills. It sat motionless at first, that is how it got my attention. Then it started moving slowly over us, my neighbor and I. The blue lights were moving, like in a half circle.  This was about 8pm. About an hour or so later, I saw it again, only much higher up.  My second sighting, last night around 11pm, was even more bizarre. I was lying in bed, trying to relax, and my eyes drifted out the sliding glass door, and there was the light again, white with hints of colors, but this time it was as if it was &#34;drunk.&#34; It bobled around AND sat still periodically. We live in a fairly isolated area, so it was very dark but the sky was clear. This thing seemed to be hoovering just on top of the hills. There was zero noise for both sightings. It almost seemed as if this thing was trying to get my attention, and how strange for me to notice it in the first place, the way the blinds were nearly completely pulled, and the porch banisters and trees were in the way. It seemed to have personality. Was it a persons toy remote of some kind? I don&#39;t know. It was just WEIRD!!!!<n>

At least 5 bursts of very large bright orange lights of 2-4 second duration were seen several minutes apart.  The orange bursts seem to have come from one of the white dots of light.  On two occasions one light (on the right) of a triangle left its position and passed between the other two and then returned to its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before having worked as a satellite tracker for 6 years (Baker/Nunn Camera Operator) and as an observer at the F.W.Whipple Observatory for 28 years on various telescopes.<n>

At the same time far off in the distance there were 4 small stationary flashing lights that were much higher and further to the south than the &#34;balls&#34;, they did not move and would stop flashing and then start again all at the same time, when the event of the &#34;balls&#34; ended the flashing lights just disappeared.  The balls did not have any smoke trails like fireworks would, they just emerged and then went out as a light bulb does, no dropping or any other movement other than the one splitting into two.  I called the police who said there were no aircraft in the area.  I was on the phone with my sister when it started and called my family out to see it.  It freaked out my youngest son to the point he ran inside and started turning on all the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else in this area see this?  I am getting nowhere with any news station or newspaper.  I have to believe that someone saw this since it was such an obvious sighting, and odd at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared to be inside our atmosphere flying about the same altitude as a commercial airliner would.  No sound, no visible vapor trails (night).  Very bright white, no blinking lights.  Moving about 3 - 4x as fast as a jet airliner from Southeast to East then veered East and disappeared perhaps behind a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/23/06 18:32|West Little Rock|AR|Light|4 minutes|Bright bulging light moving like hot air balloon on fire, except it reversed its course superfast!|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49261.html|46|ndxe200602| Bright bulging light moving like hot air balloon on fire, except it reversed its course superfast!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking up my parking lot stairs with my trash, I saw a bright yellow light (like a plane&#39;s headlight) coming toward me (moving southwest). The altitude appeared somewhere between a prop plane&#39;s and a jet&#39;s cruising altitude. I was a bit curious because no plane should be on that path since the airport is southeast of me. Also, I saw no flashing marker lights. I stopped and stared at the light waiting for it to go over my head. After about 1 minute of watching, an incoming 737 flew by from the west. Jokingly in my head I thought, &#34;they&#39;re going to hit each other&#34;. Then, right as the jet passed just in front of the light, the light quickly backed up! After the plane was gone, the light began moving east as if after the jet. A bit worried, &#34;I called for my wife to get the camera&#34;.  After about 30 seconds, the light appeared to bulge twice its size like a slow explosion. When my wife came up with the camera I tried to snap a photo, but it was just too dark for a good picture. Then the light, continuing to speed up toward the east, dropped two small lights from it burning out after about 3 seconds. These small lights were about a 10th the size of the light and look like it would if someone dropped road flares from a hot air balloon. The light then disappeared above the clouds. The duration was just over 4 minutes. At that altitude it would be about ½ mile the light backup up, and in only  1 or 2 seconds! We thought it might be a weather balloon on fire, but I can&#39;t explain the quick speed it had when it reversed! About 10 minutes afterward, about 4 military sounding helicopters flew overhead heading east. I hope that was a coincidence. If anyone else saw this light at this time, please post it on this board if you have an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moved my gaze to the left to see one or the other of the  planets and then moved my gaze back to the object that then dimmed and moved backward in the sky, shot out a light that lit up around it. This then happened two more times [3 times in secession] then just disappeared.The degree of brightness in the shot out light was the same intensity of the dimness it had dimmed to. The distance covered backward in the sky, each time was the same in each manuver. The tolal time it took to do the three backward shifts was four seconds. The length of the sighting is estimated at about ten minutes or perhaps even less.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I can&#39;t wait to see if it happens again tonight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> last night i glanced out the window and thought i saw a star blinking slowly, then i looked closer and realized it wasn&#39;t a star.  i called my husband into the room to have a look too, we though oh, it must be a plane, but it didn&#39;t look like a plane, then i said maybe it&#39;s a helicopter, we went outside, but there was no sound, we shoulve have heard something if it were a helicopter.  i called a friend who lives down the road and told her to look out the window.  she did and saw the same thing.  it looked like it was coming closer, then started flashing different colors, but always staying a bright white as well.  we watched it for an hour and an half, then it started moving away...it took 30 mins more before the light just disappeared...  during the time we watched it, it didn&#39;t move much, just stayed in the same place.  we both wanted to report it, but didn&#39;t know who to call, we didn&#39;t want to sound crazy, i&#39;m convinced that we saw something.  what can stay in the same place for that long.  it didn&#39;t flash all the time, only part of the time and sometimes looked like it was spinning. we compared it to other planes that we say in the sky, this was way brighter and didn&#39;t blink like the plane lights.  we also know that it was too low to be a star and they don&#39;t flash like disco balls.  i am convinced that we saw something.  something that i will never forget.  i just want to know what it was!!!  the only my friend and i could keep saying was i wish the cameras were working...why don&#39;t we have telescopes, and i&#39;m out of tape for the camcorder!  how great is that!  the strangest thing we&#39;ve ever seen in our lives and have nothing to back it up with.  aggghhhh, not fair!  i&#39;m going to watch all night, maybe it will come back, why would something stay here for so long?  i live in the country, field behind my house, but still....so many questions and no answers!<n>

Originally I kind-of assumed it was a star but after watching this object for a couple of minutes I realized that stars do not change color from an extremely bright white/halogen blue to a brilliant red and seemingly every color in between... this thing was amazing and SO BRIGHT!! I ran inside and grabbed a monocular that I have and ran back outside to &#39;get a closer view&#39;... what I saw when I looked through the monocular was a little blurry at first (the monocular doesn&#39;t have the best range) but after stabalizing my arm and focusing on the object, the lights seemed to be shaped like a triangle (many small lights making up a triangle shape) and the object was kind-of pulsing. I was in dis belief!! This couldn&#39;t really be happening!! I always watch the sky and until this night... I have never seen anything that I couldn&#39;t associate with some type of known object (star, plane or helicopter). After I was able to see some shape to the lights, I attempted to contact a friend who lives about 2 miles from me (I felt it was very important to have another witness - especially from a different angle then my view)... but he did not answer...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for 1 hour and 21 minutes until it eventually moved behind a building and was no longer visible to me. During the last 8 minutes of the sighting, the object literally completely disappeared from visibility for about 2 seconds at a time on four occasions!! I would describe it as either rotating and therefore the lit side of the triangle was not visible or the lights on this object simply dimmed out completely... but the object was never completely dark for more then about two seconds. I verbally said &#34;OH MY GOD&#34; when the object first disappeared from sight completely and then re-appeared two seconds later... it was absolutely unbelievable!  I took 5 images with my Nikon Coolpix 3.2 Mega Pixel digital camera but only one of the photos came out somewhat decent (attached to this report).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I REALLY want to know if any other people saw this object and what thier description is... my monocular isn&#39;t the best so hopefully the triangle shape I saw was not a trick of lighting or caused by the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for being here to take this report!! I feel absolutely blessed to have been a witness to this amazing object!!<n>

I&#39;ve seen these lights at all times, even until 5:45am EST before dawn and it has no sign of letting-up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw last night, 10 minutes into my walk was a brief orange ball, at the top of the hill I walk to over the house-line. Then nothing, I continue walking down a long slope once again under the tree-line...and then a sound that I don&#39;t remember exactly followed by a bright series of lights in a horizontal pattern, A UFO! I stop cold, and think about turning back, it dissappears after 5 seconds or so, and so I continue down the hill. For the rest of the time, I see two dark-red glowing craft (far below star-distance) following with me, and stopping with me whole way back to my street. One was always to the right of me, and another was also ahead on that side and also appeared on the left side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very amazed, but not scared because of the frequency of their appearence. I didn&#39;t run, because my nighttime walk is long, and they seemed to have me cornered, and knew my path. For the past 2 weeks I try never to walk along at night because I will always see them if I am alone. If someone is with me, they are not there, or are at a star-distance only.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking west at Orion  at 8:55 on Wednesday , Feb. 22nd 2006.  It was a clear night with moonlight.  I turned east to see if my cat was around, when suddenly I noticed that  the moon light seemed to be dimming.  I looked up to see something strange coming towards me.  It covered my yard and looked like a flock of large birds soaring  in formation except the point was missing.  Starting from the back bottom edges and going towards where the point should have been , it seemed like dim lights (light gray) or reflectors shaped  like  east - west marque gems  on either side of a small circle .  There were about 6  or more on either side.  As it flew past I noticed that the marques on the right side were starting to stack up on each other, that is when I realized it was banking right and turning toward the north. I use to live by LAX and this object made no jet sound or  propeller sound. If I had made a fist it would not have covered it up.  My brother in law says birds do not fly at night. If it was birds, there wings never flapped.  It headed north. Is this a UFO ???<n>

I was heading to my parents house who live in Tustin near the 5 freeway to pick up my son.  I arrived at the mobilehome park that they live in and parked my car in front of their house.  I stepped out of my car and came towards the back end to get some things out.  Please know that my parents live in the direct path of arriving airplanes that land at John Wayne Airport so we know what a plane sounds like and looks like day and night.  I saw that two planes were making their way to line up to land at the airport when heard this low rumbling noise of an aircraft that was high up in the sky.  I looked straight up above me and did not see anything at first and I finally made out an object that looked like a huge boomerang.  It was black and pretty much blended into the night sky.  The only way I could make out the shape was because on two ends it had these tiny red faded lights and the tip of it had a tiny white light.  I have great eyesight and they were hard to see.  The object was higher than the incoming planes so there was no chance of it crashing into them, but not much higher.  It was moving westerly towards the ocean almost towards the airport at what seemed about 40 to 50 mph.  It had to have shown up on radar at the aiport. There&#39;s no way anyone would have seen it on the road unless they were in it&#39;s path, outside and looking up at the night sky because it looked like part of sky. Also, Ive seen what the stealth bomber looks like and seen it fly (which is pretty fast) and this thing would make the stealth look like an ant, it was slower and it was a bit of a different shape. Ive heard of people describing objects the size of a football field and I would guess the same on this.  I believe in UFO&#39;s whether it being man made or from out there in space, but it was truly amazing.  Is there anybody out there that saw the same thing? It had to have crossed through parts of Irvine, Costa MEsa and if it went out to the ocean part of Newport Beach or Laguna.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of the places I camped was Harris beach state park north of Brookings Oregon, on the south coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 1.45 am and i had all my gear set up and had just fed the dog. I layed down on the picknic table to watch the stars, the night was very clear and the stars were beautiful. Then as i was looking strait up I saw an interesting object that was moving slowly in the sky i thought it was a satelite. During my trips across the counrty i have seen many satelites and have even tracked them through websites. This object that i thought was a satelite was that high up, just a dot,it had a red tint and was definatly not in our atmoshere. After The object had caught my eye for about 5 seconds it did an amazingly fast j turn. Moved in the different direction for another few seconds and then dissapeared. The j turn is the best i can explain it. The turn was not a sharp angle but kind of like a loop. I didnt see anything else like it the rest of the night. It definatly sped up for the loop, during the loop and then slowed down again before it dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> what did i see? sattelites dont do that. do they??<n>

No object outline was seen. Its apparent speed was slow, but in a South Direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object &#34;strobed&#34; approximately once every 7 seconds, as it moved in what appeared a straight line. I asked the Captain if he could see what I saw, but from his seating position in the aircraft, and the height of the sighting, he could not, and did not get out of his seat. We turned down the &#34;DU&#34;s...(Data display units) in the aircraft to rule out any reflections from inside the cockpit.  I called NY Center and asked them if they had any traffic or military traffic 20 to 30 thousand feet above and behind us and he indicated that he only had a Falcon Jet behind us going North...  &#34;Center&#34; asked other aircraft in our general area, if they could see any other traffic on their TCAS, or visually if they had any other reports. I think we were talking to NY Center, as our position was about 40NM south of KBGM (Binghampton, NY).  As the object passed above and behind us, I was indicating to the Captain where to look out his rear Clearview window to see the object.  He did not see it, as we were flying Westbound and the object was proceeding Southbound. We were out of range visually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All Aircraft reported nothing.  I think they asked Southwest and American, and possibly United. At the end of the sighting the time was 0020 Zulu or about 19:20 Eastern Time local.  I don&#39;t believe it was a satellite, as the sun was down, and satellites dont have strobes.  I have not run Nova Satellite prediction software, so I don&#39;t know if satellites were in the area.  http://www.nlsa.com/index.html Air Traffic Controller indicated that he was not surprised at the sighting as he receives them from time to time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To Clarify:  In my report I refer to &#34;object&#34;.  I could see no object just a visible strobe.  No position lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also thought when I first saw the strobe that it could be a distant star going supernovae.  Just a thought, as I was trying to figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> END.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be an excellent witness.

OK, alot odd.  I was traveling north on Rt.1 last night at about 9 PM in North Kingstown, RI just past Oak Hill Road but south of the Exeter exit, when I saw what looked like two very bright lights on the west side of the road (about 100 or so yards off the to the north and west.  As I approached, I realized the lights were standing still.  I slowed way down in my right lane to get a better look because as I passed the bright white lights, there were about ten neon blue strips of lights in triangular and pentagon shapes just hanging there in mid air above the trees but back into the woods.  I started to pull off the road to get a better look but I was A) shocked at what I saw and had a little bit of fear B) concerned that the cars behind me would be staring at the same thing and would rear-end my car instead of watching the road and C)I didn&#39;t want to be late to pick up my daughter from the movies in Warwick.  As a result I only got a 15-20 second close look at this &#34;thing&#34;.  I found it odd that only about 2-300 yards away there was the usual police officer parked on the south side of the road looking for speeders and he obviously didn&#39;t see anything (but he was facing north looking for the cars.  I went back with my daughter hoping it was still there and that there was a logical explaination but there was nothing there when my daughter and I returned about 9:55pm.  Anyway, I was wondering if any of the other drivers reported anything to explain this VERY UNUSUAL Phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.- I&#39;m a physician with a scientific background.

As i looked out my widnow the object seemed only 100 feet away.  It then stopped adn just hovered near my home.  After staying there for about 30 minutes it zoomed back into the air with a loud bang noise as it sped off.  I went back to try to find the object and it was gone.  This was not the first time I have seen UFOs in my area.  However, usually they are really high up and brealy able to see.

A VERY very bright ball light started moving up and west into the sky at a much faster speed than an aircraft, with absolutely no sound.  When it reached 3/4 of the way up, it rotated 45 degrees or so, and we could see what looked like an underside.  There were 3-4 bright blue lights in semi-circles at the top and bottom long sides, and greenish 1/4 circles at the front and back (assuming that was the front and back)  then it stayed in that position and took off to the North-East going only slightly faster than it&#39;s ascencion, and kind of circled up/down and went completely out of my visual range.   I can&#39;t say that is was round or oblong or what, but the way it looked was a kind of oblong star shape, if that makes any sense.  And the night is completely clear with little or no moon at this time.<n>

Anyway, I was out feeding my dog in the backyard and when I finished I looked up to observe the stars which were beautiful and clear.  I noticed across the road to the west on the horizon and through the trees a very bright, white light was shining through. There is nothing there for miles as it is a huge tree farm and very rural. I thought &#34; I bet somebody is night hunting.&#34; I also heard, and saw, a plane  going overhead coming from the east. I could clearly hear it. It was about 20000 feet up. Oddly, it had landing lights on. It blinked its lights 3 times! Just a few seconds later a huge fireball with a long burning tail came from the northwest. I thought its going to crash to the earth! But it burned out just seconds before impact. Strangely the light on the horizon blinked out and the plane shut all its lights off and I could hear it heading off to the west. All this occured in seconds of each other and may have a mundane explanation, although it appeared to be comminication of some sort to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The lights were swirling in a stationary area and then just swept away toward the south. I then saw another formation that did the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 45 degrees was the angle from which I saw the star like light.  Clearly in our stratusphere, in the direction of south-west (which is contrary to what I said on the phone-I&#39;m bad with directions) the light appeared next to the jet for about five seconds, bright as a bright bright star, small as one as well.  Then all of a sudden my friend and I watched it disappear, in the blink of an eye.  The light was stationary, with no flair up or any indication that it could have been reflected light from a satalite or any other orbiting object.  The sky was in the midst of going down, about 30 min prior to primary darkeness.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just thought... this is Nevada.....and went to a casino<n>

I was getting ready to leave like I do every morning to take the bus. I just remember that it was in the winter and that it was still dark outside. We had a snowfall the night before and therefore each of my neighbors on both sides ( left and right) were busy shoveling the snow. I happened to look in the sky and there it was in front of me. Strangely enough, I did not say anything to my neighbors and I was not scared.  I was awed and I just stood there for a while and observed it. It did not have the shape  usually  reported in the newspapers. It was huge and grey. Its was like two rectangles forming an obtuse angle of 130 degrees and below it, there was like a globe with some shadows.  It was standing still in the sky right in front of me. I looked at my neighbors but I didn’t want to say anything. I decided to cross the street to have a better look. As soon as I did, I turned around to glance once more at the strange object and it was gone. It was just as if there had never been anything there in the first place. I am not making this up. I never told anyone but family and friends all this time. By the way, when I was a child, my parents did see a UFO. They always told me about it. It was then in the province of Quebec and it happened in the early evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seemed dark outside.  I wondered why there was no moon &amp; looked out the window.  There were quite a lot of &#39;poofy-type&#39; clouds but I saw no stars to start with except for one very bright one &amp; it was fairly large. I still have no idea what happened to the moon !  - Telepathicly I asked this very bright light to verify in some way if it was not a star - believing that this is possible from past experience.  Amazingly it became larger &amp; closer for a short time then it receded again becoming smaller, and then it proceeded to vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - It may seem a bit crazy, but I was wide awake when this happened.  In all honesty it&#39;s not the first time similar events to this have happened in the past, and they say &#34;it&#39;s all in the mind&#34; !!  :o)  Two other sitings worth mentioning here were June 2004 in Malinalco, Mexico - a siting shared with a Mexican female friend while eating lunch together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second one was in the Denver, CO area (Golden, CO) again June of 2005 when on a research trip accompanied by others.

I went outside to take a look and saw some fish splashing. Then I looked up in the sky and saw at first what appeared to be 2 airplanes. One was at 12 o&#39;clock and one was at 3 o&#39;clock.(This was the position in the sky) So I kept looking at them and they were not moving. So I thought maybe helicopters or so. I went to get my binoculars and when I looked thru them the first one (12o&#39;clock) appeared to be green and red lights circleing a white light. Then I looked at the 3o&#39;clock one and that was a solid red. I went back in and woke my wife to show her. Although she could see exactly what I described she wasn&#39;t sure of what she was seeing. It was a pretty clear night and the rest of the stars were way farther away and not nearly as bright as these two. I looked at all the stars thru my binoculars and they all looked like stars. I think my wife started believing her eyes when after a long long time the two ? started moving very slowly but in seperate directions. The one at 12 o&#39;clock went straight out toward the horizon and the 3 o&#39;clock one went on the same height straight out to the right. The rest of the stars did not move in the same pattern as these two ??. After watching them for awhile the 12 o&#39;clock one seemed to turn sideways and the lights were rotating fast. My wife and I both agreed that this could not be anything other than a UFO sighting. I have never seen anything ever before in my life that looked like this. In fact before this I was not sure how I really felt about UFO&#39;s. I figured that it was possible but highly unlikely. I am not a nut and I own my own successful business. After last night  (actually early this morning) I believe 100% that what my wife and I saw was in fact UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had the exact same flight pattern in the same area as my last sighting a few months prior, but at a different time. First off in the distance it looked like a flashing star, but the movement was surreal. It was moving wild and zigzagging. At this point it has a very strange and eerie sound... a vibration type noise like wubwubwubwub. As it got closer into view it revealed the same red blinking light on its black frame as i observed in the previous sighting. But also as it came close into view the eerie sound faded and was gone and gracefully glid in the air and off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The one on the left slowly drifted off to the left behind the mountain top. The other one at this time remained stationary. I lost sight of it shortly behind some tree tops.

He eventually called my boyfriend and I out, his wife pursued.  He pointed to the sky asking what I was seeing?  At first glance I just thought &#34;stars&#34;, I recognized some constilations:  Orion, the Big Dipper, Seven Sisters.... oh wait!  Some of these &#34;stars&#34; are flasing red, blue, white and seemed to hover and move very slowly!  Could my eyes be playing tricks on me?  Possibly, but could 4 sets of eyes be playing tricks at the same time?  As I looked closer at the sky I could see many more of the same flikering colored lights mingled amongst the constilations.  Some seemed to be stationary while others moved slowly, almost unknownst.  Then I saw what appeared to be smaller white lights leaving a brighter flickering colors cluster!  My mind raced with curiosity and bewilderment, could this be UFOs??  The rest of the evening I couldn&#39;t keep my mind off of what could possibly be going on in the sky above, I found myself returning to the patio to see if there had been any changes?  Most of them hadn&#39;t moved all evening while others had and as I stood there for a long time I could tell that some moved slowly, most kind of hovered, moving back and forth and a couple traveled at greater speeds.  It&#39;s incredible!  They informed me that they and a few friends had been watching them for about 2 years!  As the morning drew closer, the lights moved higher in the sky, disappearing as the sun came up.  I have to admit that while I knew what we were watching I was still questioning what I had witnessed that night.  Since that night I have been watching and noticing that most are still in the same place while the constilations have traveled.  I know these are not stars!  Although I am a newer viewer, my friends have told me about the happenings they have witnessed and also showed me pictures of the same pattern of greenish lights (formation something like a spoon) which they have photograped on various occactions.  It is truly amazing!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I happened to look out the window to the East when a red flashing light caught my eye.  The first thing I noticed was the cadence of the blinking.  It was like nothing I had every seen before.  Then I noticed two more identical flashing lights behind and off to the sides in a triangular shape. Now the first light was visible out the windshield of the vehicle.  I said something to my friend (the driver), and he craned his neck to look at the light.  As he noticed the strange light, it banked left across our path heading West.  He mentioned at this time that he saw four blinking lights in a huge trapezoid formation.  After a few seconds I also noticed the forth set of lights.  The objects (or object) was directly in front of us around a mile away and approximately 15,000 to 20,000 vertical feet.  As the lights moved to the West it stayed in perfect formation and appeared to be one huge object.  But I could not confirm this.  If this were one object, the shear size of it is mindblowing.  The lights slowly disappeared to our West obscured by Mt. McGee and the Eastern Sierra&#39;s.  The whole incident lasted around a minute and a half.  There was a steady stream of traffic heading North on 395 that night.  There must have been others to witness this, but I have not come across other reports yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed an intense orange light low in the southern sky traveling at high speed.  I had seen an object similar to this last week that did a right angle turn so I grabbed my binoculars to see if I could see it closer.  Within a one-minute period, the object had traveled from above the hills in the south (15-20 degree elevation) to directly west of me (at about 45 degrees elevation), and had slowed to roughly 1/3 of its speed.  I could not make out any discernable features either with or without the binoculars.  As I was watching it, it disappeared.  I continued watching the sky for another two minutes, and the object did not reappear.  I am accustomed to aircraft in their approach patterns here, and the speed and light intensity of this object caught my attention immediately because it was not at all similar to aircraft.  As a note, I saw an object similar to this last week (earlier in the evening) traveling east to west at a extremely slow speed, and when I saw it make a right angle turn, I ran for the binoculars.  When I returned 30 seconds later, it was gone.  In both cases, skies were clear, it was several hours after sunset (and before sunrise), and there were no objects blocking my ability to view the object in question.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/16/06|Pacific Ocean (inflight, Japan-Los Angeles)||Triangle|30 secs or less|I was sitting in seat 47K (a window seat on the right side of the jet airliner) of Japan Airlines flight JL 060 on Feb 16, 2006, on my|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50797.html|99|ndxe200602| I was sitting in seat 47K (a window seat on the right side of the jet airliner) of Japan Airlines flight JL 060 on Feb 16, 2006, on my return trip from the Osaka/Kansai airport to Los Angeles.  We were well into the flight (2-4 hours) when I happened to look out of my window, even though I knew there was nothing to look at except clouds and the ocean.  It was broad daylight and we were flying above the clouds.  The jet I was on also had a large video display which showed our location on a map, and it showed nothing but water all around us (no land appearing on the display).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what I saw when I looked out of the window took me by surprise.  There was something hovering at a medium distance away (not far, but near enough to get a decent look at), and at just a slightly lower altitude than the plane I was sitting on.  I could see it when I looked straight out of my window and down slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw looked like jet-black smoke, except that the smoke was in the shape of a &#34;V&#34; with curved sides and a rounded point... like a 2-D parabolic curve.  And the orientation of it was that the vertex of the parabola was pointing in the same direction as my jet was travelling (parallel with the jet), but it was also pointing slightly towards the jet.  Also, the dimensional plane containing this 2-D parabolic curve of smoke was parallel with the surface of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how large the object actually was, but I can say from my reference point that it was roughly 2 inches long at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oddest thing about what I saw was that the black smoke looked to be flowing within this parabolic curve shape, but the smoke never left this shape!  And the motion of the hovering was the same approximate motion and speed of the wobble of a toy top when it just starts losing stabilty (as it slows down), except that the wobble motion and speed of what I was looking at stayed constant.  The parabolic curve shape itself wasn&#39;t spinning (it kept pointing in the same direction as described above), it just had a slow and steady wobbling motion to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at it as long as I could, trying to figure out what it was.  How could smoke hold a constant shape and wobble like it was a solid object???  I did look around briefly to see if any other passengers near me were also looking at it, but I only saw people reading, watching TV on the small displays on the backs of the seats in front of them, or sleeping.  I was travelling alone and didn&#39;t know anybody to talk to about it anyways.  I also wanted to get up to access my stowed bag where I had a disposable camera, but I knew that by the time I got the camera and returned to my seat that the object would be either out of view or too small to take a good picture.  So I quickly looked back out the window to watch it and study it as much as I could.  As we travelled, it slowly drifted towards the rear of my jet and became smaller as we moved away from it, until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore from my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking back at this experience, it was most unfortunate that I didn&#39;t think to take note of our position -- the jet airliner also showed (along with the map) the latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, etc. of where we currently were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is there a way to find out who the pilots of this flight were, and contact them to ask them if they also saw it?  And can the same be done with the passengers of this flight???  I am 35 years old and I have a 4 year Bachelor&#39;s of Science degree in Electrical Engineering.  But I can&#39;t think of anything that I know of which could describe what I saw.  All that I know for sure is that I saw a black, smokey, parabola shape wobbling as a solid object, but I couldn&#39;t see anything else -- no vehicle!  Yet I was near enough to see the flowingness of the smoke.  And even though I was looking at it mostly from the side and slightly from above, watching it wobble gave me a good feel of its overall shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only explanation that seems to make sense about what I saw is to imagine some kind of invisible triangular craft hovering there, with the black smoke eminating from the outer edge of the bottom of the craft as a result of its hovering mechanism.  Also, maybe the black smoke completely dissipates shortly after being produced.  This could explain why the smoke seemed to conform to a certain shape -- the shape of the craft producing it -- and why the entire parabola of smoke looked to move together as a single entity while the craft was wobbling...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have a habit of scaning the sky because I have seen some bizare stuff latley in the sky around my area( this is the first report that I have filed out though, I will be filling out reports for the previous experiences) i was scanning the sky for only a couple of seconds when I saw what looked like a plane or a jet crashing from the west,I noticed there was no noise or smoke which would have been present had it been a conventional aircraft. it seemed to be crecent chaped or a cresent with a point in the middle, it emited light which looked green on the front of the craft but changed to orange at the end of the craft, it seemed to have a &#34;tail&#34; or maybe It was just moving so fast it just looked like it. it appeared from the west hurdling toward earth then it leveled of level to the horizon,slowed for a split second and speed upward at about an 80 degree angle then it veared of course diagonal to the horizon disapearing to the east. when it move it looked like objects moving really fast under a strobe light, it was a really jerky moving object. the duration of this was only 3 to five seconds.I will be emailing a drawing showing the craft and a depiction of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were of an odd color, a pale yellow would be the best way to describe them.  After a period of about 50-60 seconds, I lost sight of the object due to it heading one way and myself heading another.  As I was in a moving vehicle, I cannot state whether or not the object made any noise.  It was not very large so I suspect that it was at an altitude of several thousand feet..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a clear night with out wind, and at the point I was out there it was also very quiet.  Our apartment complex consist of 7 builings that form a circle.  In the middle of them is a little park next to a little building that is the offices and the pool.   There also is the parking which is significant because the parking areas a lit with orange parking lamps.  As I was looking around this large open area I noticed another light that was the same color as the parking lamps except it was hovering over the building across from me.  The distance from my building to that one is about 200 feet.  After it had registered in my brain that a light shouldn&#39;t be there another orange circle apeared next to this one.  They were stationary and silent.  From my view point the UFOs were just above the three story building.  At this point I yelled for my girl friend to come out side and bring my camera.  As she was coming outside three more UFOs appeared below the original two.  After a couple of seconds the bottom three dissappeared.  Then one of the remaining two vanished.  When they would dissappear they would vanish like a light bulb being turned of slowly with a dimmer switch.  Now only one remained.  A couple of seconds later it vanished, but reappeared only now it was in a different spot.  It moved a little more east than it original position.  It repeated this action two more times.  Than it vanished for good.   Both myself and my girlfriend witnessed this.   However, it was very short.   My digital camera didn&#39;t have enough time to turn on.  I have never seen anything like this.  Like I mentioned above it was very quiet outside so that rules out any conventional aircraft.  These lights were solid and did not have any trails behind them.   They were very solid and smooth.  They were very bright, but did not emit any hue in to the night sky.   Since then we have seen them again, but in another area of Florence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And proceeded to do very elaborate circles, then shot east across the sky and did the same thing. This “falling star” for about 10 minutes was making very non-pattern movements in the sky. We stopped staring and left to grab my video camera but we never could find it again. The place we saw this “ufo” was very open, and empty (i.e. an empty church parking lot). It was a very clear night, and along with my ex her mom was one of the witnesses as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The sky was overcast since it had been raining all afternoon. I saw what appeared to be an object hovering several hundred feet up in the air in a northwesterly direction, it had what appeared to be flashing red and green lights all around it.  They were flashing in a running motion sort of like neon lights do or like a series of bulbs going on and off in a very quick pattern.  It was equipped with a powerful floodlight that is turned on occasionally when hovering and pointed the light up into the clouds.  When I first sighted it it was motionless in the sky with just the lights flashing, I ran to grab my binoculars to get a better view and when I got back it had turned on the floodlight on by the time I got the binoculars focused the light had switched off and the craft was moving at a rather fast rate going over my house.  When hovering there was no noise but as soon as it started moving I heard a noise rather like a lowflying airplane.  I ran to the window on the other side of the house and watched it&#39;s flight it paused again just before the treetops would have hidden it from my view and once again turned on the floodlight. I watched it for several minutes more until it just winked out of my sight. There were low hanging clouds in the sky so it may have just risen above them but from my perspective it just seemed to vanish into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if what I saw was a UFO or just a survey helicopter, since I have never seen a helicopter at night I can&#39;t say for sure but what caught my attention were the lights flashing in a pattern in what appeared to be a circle around it, I have seen airplanes at night and to my knowledge they carry signal lights that just blink.  The other thing was the complete absence of noise until it started moving, won&#39;t a helicopter make a noise even when hovering and lastly the powerful floodlight that it only turned on when it had stopped in the air and pointed up into the clouds.  What I would like to know is could it have been a UFO or just a helicoptor with its nightlights on.  I would appreciate a response from someone on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few minutes later, the lights would reappear.  They would be in the exact same area of the sky, but would take on a different &#34;formation&#34;.

I noticed a silvery round object in the sky to the slight northwest. At first it seemed like it was right outside my windshield and about an inch round. I moved around in my van and it moved so I knew it was further away. What was wierd is it was hard to focus on. i couldn&#39;t tell it&#39;s distance away from me. I kept blinking trying to focus. Then some clouds partially obscured it and I knew it was way up in the sky. Then the clouds cleared or it moved closer to me and I could see it clearly but I still couldn&#39;t focus on it for depth perception.then it started fading. I never saw it move.  I checked the road for an instant and I looked back and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned into the first house I saw and the lights did too, I did not get out of my car but I blew the car horn for about 45 minutes and the bright lights were still there then I saw figures standing all around the house with theirs eyes glowing at me so I called my mother on my cell phone I had to tell someone then I made about 2 or 3 more phone calls as I was dialing I could hear my dial tone coming from my radio inside my car then my phone and car went dead by that time a guy came by that I had called before the phone went dead and said he did not see anything as I got out of the car I look around and in the air I could see it taking off and He seen it and we jump in the truck and left. I went back to the house about an hour later and my car was still dead so I had to get boost off and the man in the house said he did not come to the door because something strange was going on outside his house ever since about 5:00AM that morning said his house was lit up and he and his wife thought they had over slept. The man said the he looked around his house after that and did find evidence that something was going on strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been debating with myself whether to bother reporting this, and decided it looked odd enough to do it...I went out onto the balcony to have a cigarette early this morning, and first saw two dimly lit (yellowish-white) objects pass over me, heading south.  When I first saw them, I thought they might be military jets, and then that perhaps they were birds.  Anyway, after these two had passed, I noticed what at first looked like a string of similar dim lights, then appeared to be a loose V formation, I think a dozen or so lights, heading south-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way they moved, I still think they could have been birds, night herons perhaps, that just looked like they were glowing because of the ambient light being amplified by snow on the ground.  The way they appeared to glow through the cloud cover, however, seemed odd to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, just thought I&#39;d post this in case anyone else saw these lights and thought they looked unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a White Ball of Light fall from the sky, took about 5 secondsto fall from far up into the sky. Any who my next door neighbors house blocked my line of sight after wards so no clue what the hell it was. i DO live neer a airport but, this was too close and moving to fast to be a Plane, a Jet perhaps But there was no noise ( typical ).  i waited and listened for a crashing noise, but then i started getting a bad feeling bout staying out side, i never heard any thing after that so i went back inside.  I thought it may have been a Meteor, but it couldnt be. They look way different from what i saw. Any who. i did a search on UFOs i guess for Shits and Giggles. found this Odd web site and figured what the hell.  Some body may want to know.  As long as yall dont be bugging me about it cause i have nothing more to say on this topic. i already belive firmly the we are not alone, and perhaps its only a matter of time before we find out 100%.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not jet exaust, it was fire.  And the fire looked like it had debris or bits and pieces of something in it including red and blue lit peices.  The fire left a strange trail of debris.  My passenger asked &#34;is it launching a satalite?&#34;.  The object looked like only about 1,000 feet above and infront of us.  I pulled over on the side of the freeway and opened the moon-roof of the car and watched the object.  Fire continued coming from it as it moved slowley westword.  At first I thought it was a plane coming apart because of the &#34;debris&#34; coming from it and the fire.  At one point an object came out of the fire and consisted of 6 or 8 blue lights in a line (or around it).  The fire object bagan to move faster and faster and turned upword and began gaining altitude upward and away from us.  We watched it until it turned into a tiny speck and we could not see it anymore.  The blue-lite object remained stationary, and we left.  I am an avaiation buff and I am aware of most all aircraft.  This was nothing like anything I have ever seen or heard of before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I think we must live by some testing area of area 51. Most of the time we see lights that hover that look like a star.They move around mostly when we are driving but tend to stop when we stop. There are usually two or more of these when we see the big ones. These small ones are quite high and seam to patrol around. The big ones we see light up to a kind of orange glow when ever they move.The look like a orange light slightly wider in the middle. i have seen 5 of these lit up at the same time. we have a farm out in the edge of nevada and are very isolated from alot of people. i am kind of getting used to seeing strange things in the sky. I say this, these are not airplanes because they Hover. I could get pictures if i had some way to zoom way up. Strange huh it<n>

Across the street was a huge brilliant cluster of light.  Not moving, just perfectly still above the tree line.  I waited to see if it could be an airplane in distress.  Then an airplane was higher in the sky and I knew this was much, much larger than a regular plane.  So I ran in to get my binoculars, I looked through them and it was just a glistening huge ball of light.  So I thought I will wake my husband so he could see.  He came out, looked through the binoculors and said, &#34;I don&#39;t know what it is, what do you think it is?&#34;  I said I did not know.  So he went back inside.  Within minutes it slowly drifted across in a straight line.  I waited, and after some minutes it slowly started moving towards my home, the closer it got the faster the speed was.  I watched it go over my head, still very brilliant.  I heard a faint sound of a muffled engine.  The center of the object had a small red light, the rest of the lights were brilliant white (with that sparkly glow).  I could not make out the shape very clearly because by this time the speed had increased.  But I only made out a pointed side heading east, with a small tail shape as in a tail of a plane where the logo usually is.  But comparing it to a regular plane, it was considerably larger!  I watched it as it moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(kids ages 9 &amp; 13) An hour or so later my fiance went to go see what I saw (It could be seen about a block from my house) and it was gone. We&#39;ve heard jets flying around our area lately, but this object did not make a sound.

It was a cloudy night. On our way home we both saw these two lights hovering in the sky right beside each other that were of a amber color (like that of a pole light). Neither one of us said anything for about 2 minutes because we thought that they were perhaps some sort of airplane. Then after noticing that they were not moving at all, I asked her what they were and she told me that she had been watching them and that she was wondering that same thing.  We pulled over to see if they were in moving and we came to find out that they were sitting completely still. We decided to move slightly closer to them just so we could get some sort of a perspective of where they might be hovering over and as we were driving we passed by two trees and once we passed those trees, we looked for the lights and they were gone. We decide to turn around and go back up the hill thinking that for some odd reason maybe we just couldn&#39;t see them from the angle that we were at. So we went back up the hill and we still saw nothing. We drive past where we saw them the first time and when we almost get to our home, we saw them again. So, we drove closer to them yet again just on a different road this time. We parked the car and watched them for about 3~5 minutes then, as my mom was looking for the binoculars, I saw the first one fade out. I told my mother and she looked up and with the binoculars, she watched the second one fade away. They did not reapear so we decided to go on home. We got home and were inside for about 5 minutes and then went back outside to look for them once more. We got outside on our backpourch and through the trees we saw 5 of them, all in a line just like the 2 earlier. We go out to the end of our driveway and they were still there. We watched them for about 5 minutes yet again and then we both watched them slowly fade away. There were two others sightings. One was another person who saw them that night and the other one saw them the next night between 1:00 and 2:00 am central time.<n>

I am quite familiar with this highway as I live in Hutchinson, not far away.  At approximately 18:20 I saw three very bright amber lights in the sky to my right and ahead of me.  At first I figured them to be on an airplane approaching for landing in Wichita, but then realised that these lights were not on the normal landing path, and also over several seconds and then minutes, did not move.  The lights were evenly spaced with the one on the left being a bit lower. The highway slants to the left (north-west) at the place of this sighting (near Moundridge), so I figured them to be somewhere west of McPherson at the time. They were lite up when I first saw them so I do not know their total duration, but after about 20 minutes I watched as the one in the center went out, then the one on the right, and a couple of seconds later the last (lower) one went out.  During this event I phoned a couple of knowledgable friends asking about the colors of flares, and this orange/amber colr was not a typical flare color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then proceeded north and a few minutes later, four more lights appeared, spaced evenly as before with one slightly lower than the other three.  These may have been there for some time before I saw them.  This time the highway was going straight north so I could see that these lights were over the city of McPherson.  I then rolled down my driver&#39;s side window and reached for my digital camera and began pointing and shooting in the direction of these lights.  During the photos, I saw something dark brush me directly in front of me.  As I approached the Highway 56 exit, the lights began to disappear in the same fashion as the earlier ones that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting at the dock in McPherson getting loaded, I downloaded the photos into my laptop. Most of the photos are jiggly but some of them captured the lights.  In closer examination, I noticed that I must have captured the (object??) that brushed me.  This object shows lights that do not belong to anything in the area, and I can not identify the object, only to see a vague outline of something...like a craft of some sort, containing white, amber and green lights in square an &#34;I&#34; shapes.  I can send you these photos if requested.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/13/06 21:35|Austin|TX|Other|2 minutes ?|Floating "Veil" Austin, TX|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49121.html|132|ndxe200602| Floating &#34;Veil&#34; Austin, TX<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was in backyard with dog, happened to look up and saw what I can only describe as a very large, long semi-transparent &#34;veil&#34; moving acrooss the sky, heading in a generally northward direction.  The movement of the &#34;veil&#34; was very smooth, flowing, and somewhat ripple-like.  I did not hear any sound, although it was close enough that if it had made any type of noise within human range, I would have heard it clearly.  It also did not seem to be illuminated; the sky was light enough to see it moderately well (there are many streetlights and the moon was out as well). It was difficult to determine how high up it was - I was simply so shocked to see it and also was trying to determine just what I was seeing that I can&#39;t even guess.  It &#34;flew&#34; over the roof of the middle school that is approximately 20 yards from my backyard (north of my backyard; the yard faces east). As the &#34;veil&#34; moved across the sky toward the school, my dog started barking and ran to the north side of the fence with ears and tail up, but she was looking toward the school rather than up at the object.  The neighbor dogs also started barking at that time.  I then went back into the house, out the front door &amp; looked down the street (runs north, past the school) but saw nothing at that time.  Decided I needed to tell someone, so called my sister.  While chatting, about 10 mins later, a &#34;cop&#34; car drives slowly down the street in front of the house.  I use italics because by the time I got the front door opened &amp; turned the porch light out so I could see, the car had reached the end of the block (also an intersection for a street that runs east/west.  The school sits at that intersection, as well), and I could only see that the shape and size resembled a police car.  It did have lights across the top, but they were white.  Interestingly, another similar car was waiting at the intersection.  After a short pause, they both continued on the north-running street, shining spotlights on the outside of the school.  They continued north on the street.  I went back into the house (still on the phone, telling my sister the events as they transpired), then again to the backyard.  After another 10 minutes or so, an airplane flew over the school, fairly low and slow.  It did not fly north, but rather toward the east and then south.  Thanks, and would be curious to know if others saw anything like this that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The background is a residential area close to St John&#39;s Seminary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What caught my eye was these lights looked like the they emitting light with out casting a shadow like the light was incased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights where dimming, getting brighter, getting smaller, getting more distant then getting closer, then some diaspeared, and then three formed a triangle, soon after that they just disapeared!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am baffled! These objects where obove the area of TRW behind San Clemente.  I wonder if you had any other reports in that area?<n>

We turned towards the crafts and followed them until we could not see them anymore because they were drifting away too fast over the horizen.  while we were following them we could see at least 10 ships then one went  straight over our truck.  When it was straight above us it was about the same size as a full moon but it looked like it was still pretty high in the air.  We then watched the U.F.O fly away over the horizen rizing slowly until the shipes one by one were out of site.  The ships looked like they were all together about 1 inch from eachother in the sky, accurately about 1 mile apart in the sky but they still looked close enough to be together.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At dusk I saw it again but it was dark and still hovering and moving slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/13/06 17:15|Woodland Hills|CA|Sphere|8-10 mins|Amber objects performing high speed maneuvers; overing|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55274.html|138|ndxe200602| Amber objects performing high speed maneuvers; overing<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday February 13th, 2007.  My vantage point was from outside my office in Woodland Hills, CA.  I noticed a large (747) FedEx jet flying over my office and I thought it was strange for such a large jet to be headed towards Burbank Airport, as this airfield is generally for smaller commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched to see if the plane would turn into the landing pattern for Burbank Airport, I noticed a bright point of light in the cloud directly behind the FedEx jet.  At first I only saw one object then I noticed there were at least 2 others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights I saw were an amber color. Almost as if the object was reflecting the setting sun to the west. I believe I saw 3 distinct objects.  But they were only visible as a group for a short period of time.  Each point of light would vary in intensity.  From very bright (they seemed to expand as the light got brighter), to barely visible.  The lights had to be quite bright because the objects were clearly visible while being either in the cloud or behind it. And the cloud itself was rather dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, these lights were moving in some rather strange patterns.  I would describe the flight patterns as parabolic.  They would move in one direction and perform what I would describe as a &#39;U-turn&#39; and move back in the other direction.  These &#39;U-turns&#39; were executed at a high rate of speed.  At one point I saw multiple lights performing these maneuvers. It resembled two squirrels chasing each other around and up a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point one of the lights was performing the parabolic maneuver (on an off axis) and it stopped in its tracks.  It hovered in that position for roughly 10 seconds.  Then without a noticeable acceleration period, continued the maneuver at the same high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the movement I witnessed was at a relatively high rate of speed.  I would estimate the altitude to be about 10,000-15,000 feet and the distance from myself to the objects at about 20 miles.  I have never seen an object in the air travel this fast or maneuver like these objects did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time were these objects visible outside the the cloud that was moving past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole episode lasted 8-10 minutes.  At which point the cloud had changed its shape and had moved off into the distance and the objects were no longer appearing.<n>

The farm is at a rather high elevation and we had a clear line of sight for several miles to the Southwest across US Highway 60.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound became louder and we saw literally thousands of birds flying across the highway from my uncle&#39;s farm.  They appeared to have been startled by something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute later we then heard a helicopter coming from the opposite direction.  When the copter came into sight we noticed that it was a flat black in color and had dark tinted windows.  I got my binoculars from my truck and got a closer look. The aircraft had absolutely no marking anywhere on it.  It flew to the Southwest to almost exactly where the birds had come from and began hovering not more than 75 to 100 feet above the field on my Uncle&#39;s farm.  The craft continued to hover for several minutes and I watched it the entire time.  There were no marking at all and all of the front bubble glass appeared to be tinted very dark.  I was unable to see anyone inside and it was close enough that I should have been able to see the pilot clearly.  If anyone else has had any type of contact with a black chopper like this, I would like to know who these people are and if the birds and the chopper are related incidents or just coincidence.  Thanks!<n>

This light would have been approximately 30 to 35 degrees elevation, and was not much more than a pinhead in size. I originally thought it was a plane at high altitude, but it was soon followed by another very similar point light. These two lights then proceeded to circle each other for another 15-20 seconds, and seemed to either descend slightly together, or possibly were heading downrange. They were no longer visible after that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the one witness, myself, I am a mechanical engineer working for a NASA contractor. I am thirty-six years old and am a Houston native.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

During the time i was outside, i was trying to spot which way the sun would rise, i thought the whole event was funny because while it was a little bright on one side it was still dark on the other side. When the garbage can was finnaly by the road, i decieded to take in more of the early morning view and as i&#39;m turning around to look for the moon i spotted what appeared to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i watched the object in question for about three more minitues i noticed that it moved very slightly, i was trying to reasonable about it could have been, first i thought it could have been an airplane but realised that it was&#39;nt simply because of the time, it wasnt a blimp also because of the time, i tried to mentally check off a list of every possible of what it could have been, but i could come up with explanation of what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i called my older sister outside of the house to come take a look, and all she could do was look no words could excape her mouth, so i asked her &#34;what do you think it is, i truly think its a UFO,&#34; and she answered &#34;it looks like one!?&#34; then asked her &#34;does it appear as though it is moving?&#34; and she said yes, i then told her to watch while i get my camara, she then shouted &#34;hurry up it looks like its leaving!&#34; a couple of seconds later she said &#34;never mind its still there.&#34; as i run outside the house with my camara and snap the first picture, it starts to move more and with every picture i took the more it moved, finally when i thought that i had enough pictures, my sister and myself retreated back into the house, at around 4:55 a.m. i went back outside to see if was still there and it was, which lead me to believe that it was there long after i went back into my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time the pictures were taken everyone in the neighborhood was still asleep, because when i atempted to show the pictures to a close friend and neighbor, she and her mother did not believe me, which left me disheartened at what i and my sister had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/13/06 04:30|Springtown/Azle|TX|Triangle|2 hours|SAW BRIGHT LIGHT IN SKY THAT FOLLOWED ME.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49108.html|143|ndxe200602| SAW BRIGHT LIGHT IN SKY THAT FOLLOWED ME, AND APPEARED TO HAVE OTHER ORBS AND A TRIANGULAR AIRCRAFT DESEND FROM IT<n> <n><n> <n><n> I DELIVER THE FORT WORTH STAR TELEGRAM, AND I WAS OUT DOING MY PAPER ROUTE. AROUND 4:00 IN THE MORNING I NOTICED A BIG BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT IN THE SKY. IT WAS MOVING, BUT SLOWLY. THEN I NOTICED A SMALLER WHITE LIGHT LOOKING TO BE A PLANE OR SOMETHING RIGHT BY IT. THEY SPLIT UP. IT WAS NOT TOO MUCH LONGER THAN THAT WHEN I NOTICED THE BIG BRIGHT LIGHT SEEMED TO BE FOLLOWING ME. WHEN I WOULD STOP MY CAR AND LOOK AT IT, THATS WHEN IT WOULD START MOVING TOWARDS ME. AT ONE POINT WHILE I WAS STOPPED STARING AT IT, I FLASHED MY HEADLIGHTS AT IT TO SEE IF IT WOULD STOP MOVING AGAIN. (I STILL THOUGH MAYBE I WAS SEEING THINGS.) AFTER I FLASHED MY LIGHT IT STARTED COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE GROUND AT FIRST AND THEN STARTED DIRECTLY TOWARD ME AT A HIGH SPEED.. SO I PUT MY PEDAL TO THE METAL, AND TOOK OFF. IT WAS BACK IN THE SKY AT THIS POINT. AND I LOOKED A LITTLE CLOSER, AND I SAW ABOUT 10 OTHER LIGHTS FLYING RIGHT NEXT TO IT, BUT THEY WERE SMALLER AND DIMMER.. AND THEY JUST DISSAPAEARED. I WAS FREAKING OUT BY THIS POINT. I CALLED MY FRIEND TOMMY WHO WAS AT WORK TELLING HIM WHAT I WAS SEEING. HE SAID I WAS CRAZY. WELL, WHILE I WAS TALKING TO HIM, WHAT SEEMED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT OF SOME SORT LOOKED LIKE IT CAME OUT OF THE BALL OF LIGHT. IT WAS FLASHING RED, AND JUST WENT STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR UNTIL I COULDN&#39;T SEE IT ANYMORE. IT WASN&#39;T TOO FAST. AT THAT POINT I STARTED CRYING, I WAS REALLY FREAKED OUT. I STARTED HEARING LEAVES RUSTLE AROUND MY CAR, AND IN THE FIELD WHERE I WAS BY I SAW A FEW FLASHING RED LIGHTS, MORE LIKE ORBS. I WENT TO ROLLL MY WINDOW UP BECAUSE I WAS SCARED, AND MY WINDOWS WOULDN&#39;T ROLL UP. THEY ARE POWER WINDOWS, AND DIDNT EVEN MAKE THE SOUND AS IF THEY WERE TRYING TO ROLL UP, IT&#39;S LIKE THE POWER WAS OFF. AND MY CAR STARTED MAKING A STRANGE SQUEALING SOUND, LIKE WHEN PEOPLE START THEIR CARS AND THEIR BELTS SQUEAL. AND IT WAS ALSO VERY WARM RIGHT AROUD THE CAR, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ABOUT 20 DEGREES OUT. WELL, AT THE END OF MY ROUTE WHEN I WAS DELIVERING THE NEWSPAPERS TO MY STORE, THE STORE CLERK WASN&#39;T THERE YET, SO I JUST GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND STARED AT THE LIGHT. IT WAS 7:00 AM THEN, AND IT WAS JUST STARTING TO GET LIGHT OUTSIDE. WELL, ANOTHER CRAFT CAME FROM THE LIGHT. THIS I KNOW WAS AN AIRCRAFT FOR SURE, BECAUSE IT WAS FLTING AT THE LEVEL PLANES DO, MAYBE EVEN A TAD BIT CLOSER. IT WAS A TRIANGLE. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS, JUST A TRIANGLE  SHAPED AIRCRAFT. IT WAS GREY IN COLOR. THE THING THAT REALLY STOOD OUT THE MOST TO ME THOUGH WAS THE LIGHTS AROUND THE TRIANGLE. THEY WERE RED WHITE AND BLUE I BELIEVE, ONLY THEY WERE FLASHING EXTREMELY FAST. JUST LIKE A STROBE LIGHT. I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN AIRPLANE HAVE LIGHTS THAT FLASHED THAT FAST, AND IF THERE IS SUCH A THING, PLEASE TELL ME, BECAUSE I AM FREAKING OUT. THE LIGHTS WERE DIM TOO. IT MADE A REALLY STRANGE SOUND.WELL, MY STORE CLERK PULLED UP FOR WORK, AND THE SHIP WAS STILL IN THE SKY, HE SAW ME LOOKING AT THE SKY, AND GOT OUT TO SEE WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. SO HE SAW IT TOO, JUST NOT AS CLOSE AS I DID. I TOLD HIM ABOUT SEEING THE OTHER STUFF, AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT HE HAD SAW THE BIG BRIGHT LIGHT. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE, AND I AM GOING NUTS. THERE&#39;S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THERE IS LIFE OUT THERE NOW... IF ANYONE ELSE HAS SEEN SIMILAR THINGS, I&#39;D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IT... THANKS<n>

As I was driving I looked up in the sky and could see a greenish light moving in a circular pattern. It would make one revolution about every 2 seconds. So I continued to travel northbound and the light seemed to move with me as I moved. I pulled into the Georgetown Ice arena so that I could get a better look at it. It was not too high in altitude, probably about 50 feet in the air. While I was stopped it was making a perfect circle around the house across the street. After about 5 minutes of pondering what it could be I continued down the road, and it seemed to move with me. It never got any closer or farther away. I turned eastbound onto M-45 and it started to move eastbound with me also. Once I started to get into the city it got farther into the sky and higher into the air. After I arrived at the grocery store to pick up my girlfriend I looked up and could not see it, but I didn&#39;t think that it was gone, so I traveled northbound on Collindale rd in Standale, mi and once I got to a location where there were no city lights and it was still there. Looking on a map it appeared as if it was circling over the Sand creek golf course. The time now was about 6:50 am. I traveled back to the store and picked up my girlfriend, and went back to the location where I saw it on Collindale rd, and it was still in the sky, but very faint as the sun had started rising. We could see it faintly on the drive back home on M-45 in the North sky. We lost sight of it at about 7:17 am. the light could not be coming from a stationary object on the ground because it when I first sighted it, it appeared to be about 150 yards north of me, later in the morning it appeared to be miles away, but still north of me. The sky was kind of hazy/foggy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was snowing heavily outside and the lights began to flicker.  At first I thought &#39;Lovely. I still have tons of shampoo in my hair, and the lights are about to go out.&#39; Then I started to feel this terrible sense of panic.  I looked at the light bulbs and they were slowly dimming and brightening, dimming and brightening.  As I grabbed a towel they went completely out, and I went to my brother&#39;s room close by for some moonlight by which to grab a flashlight.  As I walked up a brilliant blue light flashed above the house, covering everything I could see in blue.  After the flash I ran to grab my mom, who was instantly terrified by my mood.  I was deeply frightened. I could feel a presence near me, and although I am normally sensitive to people&#39;s emotions (i.e. knowing something is wrong without any hints or expressions) this was magnified many times over, and I could not stop praying. After I went to sleep a while later (according to my poor shaken and sleep-deprived mother) the lights came right back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I took my little sister and her friend to the movies.

I asked him if he was holding something at arms length between his thumb and index finger that would represent the objects size what would it be? He said, without hesitation, “about the size of a BB”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the strangest things about it, he said, was that when it appeared it was already moving “as if it decided to just appear as it was moving slowly west”. He stated that it made no sound or changed it’s direction of travel. After observing it for about 30 seconds or so he said he picked up the faint sound of a jet and then he saw it pop up over the trees in the west. When  he glanced back over to the object it had stopped moving.  After just a few seconds the object headed north at an incredible speed and disappeared below the horizon. He said he tried to count down the seconds using the 001 method as it moved away from the jet but never made it to the second zero.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our friend has always been a true blue skeptic about these things, but now as he states, “I’m not so sure about this anymore”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second, close to identical, sighting of this object from our property in six months. I filed an incident report last September 30, 2005 that was an identical match to this one except that object was literally on top of us. It’s color, shape, point of origin (north), and direction and speed of departure (north) were the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this object is, where it came from, or what it’s interest is in this area but my curiosity is now getting the best of me. I would like to find out how many other sightings have taken place that have not been reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/10/06 19:30|North Hudson|NY|Formation|less than 30 secs|Saw a string of white lights extending into the sky at  45-75 degree angle above mountains in Essex county.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49461.html|158|ndxe200602| Saw a string of white lights extending into the sky at  45-75 degree angle above mountains in Essex county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving North on the northway 87. It was about 7:30 PM or so when I was around exit 29-31(cannot specifically remember). I came to a spot where there was clear view of the large mountains in the area and something caught my attention. There was a group of dim lights in the formation of a line at about a 45-75 degree angle. At first I thought it might have been lights from chair lift poles set up on a mountain ski resort. But after some more glances (mind I was driving 65 on the highway) I saw that the lights were far to high to be on a mountain. It was difficult to see the mountains as they were dimly outlined by the sky as the sun was well below the horizon and the sky was turning darker shades of blue. I am positive it was not on a mountain because the lights were far too high. After driving out of viewing range of the mountains and the view disapeared behind roadside pines I was unable to see the lights any longer. I waited impatiently to see if the lights would still be there once I closed some distant on the highway but I didnt see them again. As I approached the plattsburgh area I did notice what seemed to me to be an unusual amount of airplanes out that night as dozens crisscrossed the sky at altitudes so high they only appeared as white dots with their blinking wing lights. As far as describing the UFOs, they seemed to be nothing but dim white lights around in a fairly straight line at 45-75 degrees or so approximately. As far as how many lights there were I would have to say anywhere between as little as 25 to as many as 50. I wasnt able to count because I only saw them briefly and had to focus on the road. I thought I remember seeing slightly orange  lights mixed in with the white maybe at the end of the line, but Im not certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/10/06 17:30|Seattle|WA|Cylinder|2 minutes|Cylindrical object with 3-4 rows of bright lights & vapor between ground & object  hovering silently at 500-1000' above ground.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49164.html|159|ndxe200602| Cylindrical object with 3-4 rows of bright lights &amp; vapor between ground &amp; object  hovering silently at 500-1000&#39; above ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object that appeared to be around 40-50&#39; in diameter appeared to be hovering silently at an approximate altitude of 500-1000&#39; above the ground.  The object had 3-4 rows of extremely bright lights (with clear lenses) around its perimeter.  These lights made it difficult for the observer to determine the shape and size of the upper portion of the object.  However, the underside was circular and the sides with the lights were cylindrical in shape.  From the bottom of the object was a somewhat thick, white trail, like a water vapor, with no sign of gray exhaust (or any type of carbon-based fuel).  This object hovered at this low altitude for about a minute.  When the witness (my wife) and I returned to where she saw the object (1-2 minutes after sighting), it was gone.  This sighting was in NE Seattle, at the corner of 14th Ave. E and NE 120th (above the Pinehurst Park).  The next day, I spoke to another person who had witnessed (what she described to be) a similar object in the sky to the west of Magnuson Park in Seattle (towards where my wife saw it). 10-15 minutes later, another witness saw (what appeared to be) a military/security helicopter rushing towards the direction of this sighting, despite the fact that we did not report it.  Perhaps someone called 911...<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/10/06 17:25|Seattle|WA|Unknown|1-2 minutes|Object with rows of very bright, clear lights around perimeter hovering silently 1-2 minutes before exiting.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49245.html|160|ndxe200602| Object with rows of very bright, clear lights around perimeter hovering silently 1-2 minutes before exiting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object was seen hovering silently at an approximate altitude of 1000&#39;. Its exact shape was obscured by the brightness of its lights, as well as the vapor which appeared to be underneath it and somewhat around it (this was not a particularly cloudy day).  However, the bottom of the object was circular, it had several rows of circular, clear-lens lights around its perimeter (sides), so it appeared to be either cylindrical, conical or saucer-like.  Again, its top was not clearly visible, as well as its sides (other than the lights). (See sketch provided).  This object hovered for at least 1-2 minutes, then exited, leaving no signs of its presence.  The vapor was white in color, somewhat thick, and was underneath the object, as opposed to being behind it while it was moving across the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Across the street of Franklin Pike Circle is a Target convience store. At this location, I saw a black ball floating in the air. The object was bigger than a softball but smaller than a basketball. I wathed the object for 7 to 8 seconds. The object then began to move slowly in a westernly direction upwards for at least 3 to 4 minutes until it was completely out of sight. I don&#39;t know why, but I have seen objects like this 3 times over the period of 32 years. Two were at night and they glowed; this one was during the day and it was black. After I saw this object, there was a small Cessna-like airplane in the area. I think (but not sure) it belonged to the Civil Air Patrol.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I slowed my car but didn&#39;t stop. Above a treeless yard was a hovering object, silvery or grayish, with an &#34;art deco&#34; sort of smooth, stair-step shape. I did not count the number of different levels in the shape, but it was longer than it was tall. From right to left lights were flashing, first red, then blue, then green, then the red at the far right again, etc. Each flash was not particularly fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how high the object was hovering. I am bad with distance measurements. I was doubting my eyes and thought this might actually have been a small (12&#34;x24&#34;) object suspended not too high in the yard, but I have looked in the area twice since the sighting and have seen nothing. I believe I saw something quite large that was hovering very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two-second flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This appeared more a celestial body than a vehicle or craft.  It entered at 60 degrees, north from south, one-quarter up from the horizon.  It was a fiery, golden globe, not as large as a full moon.  It had no tail.  As it reached what I would have assumed to have been impact (given the hilly terrain beyond the trees), there was the suggestion of flaring. I imagined that if it had indeed reached Earth, it would have set vegetation on fire or broken through a roof.  There were no such reports in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Instead of flashing lights, there was what appeared to be long, stringy, sparks dripping from underneath the object. The object was about half the size of a full moon. It also had what appeared to be brown flood lights all around and shining forward. It appeared to be moving slower than an airplane and it was visible for about two minutes. As it moved towards the west, the lights started flashing and they went out one by one until it was totally dark. The sparks stopped before the lights started flashing. After the lights went out, there was a dim egg shaped glow that still appeared until the object disappeared in the night sky traveling east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/9/06 19:40|Butler|MO|Unknown|25 MINUTES|WHILE I WAS AT MY FARM PASTURE I SAW A STRANGE OBJECT IT WAS VERY STRANGE.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49233.html|166|ndxe200602| WHILE I WAS AT MY FARM PASTURE I SAW A STRANGE OBJECT IT WAS VERY STRANGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out on my farm pasture on February 9, 2006 on a Thursday evening about at 7:40 P.M. in Butler, Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out by my barn and I looked up and saw a strange light in the sky up above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw a strange object above me and it was round and wide on the top and it got narrower as you go to the bottom of the object it was orange lighted with red vertical lines around the sides of it and it had a blue light on the middle of the top and a blue light on the middle of the bottom.  I saw it over the nearby lake also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as I was standing by the barn it hovered over the barn and went down by the nearby lake and it hovered over the lake.  So I walked down by the lake and I still saw the strange object. I was puzzled and I didn&#39;t understand where this object came from.  It wasn&#39;t a plane or a weather balloon and it wasn&#39;t a star that I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no sound to it.  I watched it and it disappeard going towards the west I looked up and it was no where in sight and I didn&#39;t see it no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I got in my car and left my farm pasture and I didn&#39;t see it no more it was a strange object  I saw at my farm pasture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was party cloudy when I saw this object at my farm.<n>

And then heading east on Prairie Avenue spotted a very large bright light low over the vicinity of Coeur d&#39;Alene, Idaho.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very large white blaze that was moving slightly faster than a hover, very low and directly to the south. Traveling in an east to west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the large bright light disappeared to be replaced by a dimmer red glow.  And then from a dimmer red glow it became a very large bright light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing on Prairie Avenue to watch it and then having to move to keep it in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second witness:  blond haired woman living on Prairie Avenue coming out with a bag of trash.  I called her over to look at the slowly moving light that was now a red glow.  She asked if it was a plane or a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this light did not act or move like either. Then she suggested a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do not know her name but she lives in blocks of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of seconds of her joining me to watch this light, it began to pick up speed and then disappeared.<n>

I watched the object from a stationary position inside the car, after pulling briefly into a center turn lane. The sky was perfectly clear, ground winds were from the North, and gusting (perhaps 20-25 mph).  I watched the object sporadically as I continued driving (in heavy traffic), but then apparently it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Estimated in sight for two minutes or better. It was about 1/4&#34; in diameter at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen many helicopters, small private planes, and commercial and military.  It was markedly different from these conventional craft.  No exhaust smoke or condensation trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely, in Sept. 1999, I was in the same approximate location when I saw a bronze-colored cylindrical object (with an orange appendage) in a clear blue sky at nearly the same time of day.  It remained stationary, and then apparently vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other Federal Way resident confirmed the sighting on the NUFORC site.<n>

It was around 9:00 p.m. and I looked up at the sky toward the North. I saw about two planes and then saw a whitish/yellowish big light that was flickering and was definitely too low and big to be an airplane.  It was not moving in the sky, just flickering.  No noise was heard, as it was not THAT close.  I watched it for about 30 seconds then called my friend to come see.  By the time he got there (about 30 seconds later), the big light had faded out slowly and risen in the sky.  It was now a lot higher and looked like an airplane high in the sky with a red light flashing.  We watched as it flew away to the West at the speed of a regular plane.  I KNOW that could not have been an airplane, as it was stationary at one point and it rose very high in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of the fighters was within a couple three hundred feet of it and the other two were approximatly 2 miles behind in hot pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large object peeled off and was out of sight in a matter of seconds, however the fighters did not follow but they did kick on their afterburners until I couldn&#39;t see them anymore, even w/ bino&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called my girlfriend outside to see this and apparently while I was looking at her telling her what I saw, she saw something move very quickly across the sky 1 sec +-, this definatly freaked her out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch the jets and afterburners, I caught comething by pure chance moving at a high rate of speed, thought it was a dim star but it was moving extremely fast coming from the direction the jets were heading,<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the base came alive and more jets were put into the air.

Upon opening my eyes, I looked up to see a &#39;black dot&#39; simply stationary in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mean it was COMPLETELY stationary in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it didn&#39;t register, because I couldn&#39;t figure out how it could be just HANGING there.   I continued to look at it, and either it periodically &#39;turned over&#39; to reveal a red area, or else it was flashing a red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems like it was pretty far up there, but since I don&#39;t know exactly what it was, I don&#39;t know for sure how high it was.  However, if it was a conventional aircraft of some kind, then how high would it have to be to be about the size of Venus?<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was definitely NOT Venus or any other star or planet, not a helicopter, satellite, bird, or balloon.  The reason I rule out balloon is because if it WAS a balloon, then it would have to be extremely big, circular, black and red (or else black with a flashing red light)  AND have the capability of hovering.  Does this fit any known balloon?  Even if it were caught in a up draft, could it remaing ABSOLUTELY still?  It was NOT bobbing, jerking, wiggling, or doing anything else except possibly gently turning periodically to reveal another side which was red.  It could also have been a flashing red light.  I just don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was about 5:30 pm, but it was still quite light, and the sun was behind me, so it could not have been in its own shadow. It was definitely black. That much I know.  What I DON&#39;T know is what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for about 3 minutes, it suddenly disappeared.  Just gone.  Like that.  Poof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not zooming, or fading out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my question is this:  Has anyone ever reported a BLACK UFO, a black/red UFO, or a black UFO with a red flashing light?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS - Right before I wrote this email, I was outside to see if I could see it again.  Well, I didn&#39;t, but I did see 2 white &#39;lights&#39; (similar to stars) moving VERY fast across the sky.  At first I saw one, moving in a straight line, then zig-zagging, then back to a straight line, and a couple of seconds behind it ANOTHER one, making similar movements.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least 3 UFOs in 3 days.  Should I file a different report for that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the day before (Thursday) I saw a similar &#39;light&#39; or whatever, but this one was just meadering, not going fast.  In fact, it was rather slow.  This has been the weirdest few days of my life.<n>

It glowed an intense white glow that enveloped the whole ship. I could only see details better when I had my sunglasses on. It had a diameter of 6 city buses. When I looked closely at the rotating dome I saw strange runes or glyphs encircling the top dome emitting a blue glow that out lined these odd symbols. It went the same for the smaller rotating domes underneath, yet they were colored separately purple, red, green, and yellow. It circled around my house practically brushing the tree tops. After about 15 minutes of circling it hovered directly over the house. Intrigued, I went outside to get a better view of it. The glyphs on the small domes then became brighter and the domes began to spin faster and faster. Then all of the sudden a dazzling blast of light focused on me. I was so scared I couldn&#39;t move. Then something very crazy happened. All of the sudden there was a horrible shrieking noise inside my head. It was deafening and incredibly painful and forced me to the ground clutching my throbbing head as though I was to die from it. Then there was a brilliant blaze of light and the shrieking stopped. The ship then began a steady climb towards the stars. As it did, four orbs about the size of a car appeared to have risen out of the forest and began circling in bizarre patterns around the ship. The craft rose faster and faster into the night sky, till it was only a speck in the sky a roared of at an incredible speed. Battered and reeling from the encounter and the intense pain that still clawed my brain. I stumbled into my room and crashed on the bed and fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was holding the ladder as he was on the roof. The skies were perfectly clear and you could easily see the moon to the east. I looked up and saw a large silver cylinder shaped object coming from the North-east. It looked like it was larger in the back with front being more narrow. It made no noise and glided rightover our heads. I am not sure of the altitude. I yelled to my husband to look up but he was in a precarious position and failed to see the object. I watched it as it headed south and it just vanished out of sight. Then another object just like it came from the same direction and I told my husband to hurry, hurry and look up. He saw this object as it passed over but this one headed in a easterly direction and it too just disappeared from view.

There is a sports arena close by and I thought it was a blimp because I have seen them flying during the day in that area. The bottom of the craft seemed to be lined with lights that formed almost a full circle, about 3/4 of a circle. The craft dipped below the trees and began to head north at a lower altitude. I wanted to show a friend and my husband who came out and we watched it continue north through the tree branches and skyline until it seemed to head east again and disappear from site. I also heard a helicopter but could not see one. There is a flight pattern in the direction it moved towards and I saw many planes and heard helicopters for about 20 minutes after the sighting. I tried to find a blimp schedule with no luck. I did look up some pictures of blimps at night and this did not look anything like what pictures I found on the net. The lights twinkled and seemed clustered together at times and the shape seemed more mushroom shaped at times. It was a huge light in the sky, easily 100 times the size of Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides just e-address.  PD))<n>

Nothing made noise and it had seemed that the entire planet was asleep until I realized that it was sneaking over the horizon with the sounds of screams breaking out and the pyramid deflecting the sounds until it was quiet.

Opening the front door I witnessed a red helicopter pulling a rope up and then it flew away.   Moving back into the house my parents walked up to me looked at me and said I needed to go to the hospital since I looked crazy to them however I didn’t want to tell them what had just happened since something could and possibly would have caused harm.  At the hospital I was given a pill which put me to sleep and I decline to openly speak to people about it since I believe there is a reason to respectfully remain silent until a professional approaches to prove the floating black pyramid exists.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There was a plane quite a way away from it and there was a helicopter flying torwards it but way below it. once the helicopter came just a little  bit close it vanished and never appeared again that night.It was about 60 degrees from were i was standing and the object had no flashing lights it was a constant light but the dissapeared right as it started moving torward my house<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then, she saw it move East and it went back in it&#39;s original direction which is North.  I saw it moving North after it did it&#39;s turns and it was moving very fast, faster than what an airliner or private plane would be able to go.

The tail ended in a point at the back and it had no visible rear stabilizers. When I saw it the craft was making a slow right hand turn going up in a corkscrew style.

As I approached closer, I noticed the lights were attached to a triangular shaped object and it appeared quite large and the lights were solid white lights at each tip of a triangle. The object appeared to be hovering as it didn&#39;t seem to move for a long time, it then seemed to rotate and slowly moved north and increased speed in a northbound direction. There were no colored and/or blinking lights visible on the craft, only the solid extremely bright white lights. I tried to follow the north bound path on Marion road but soon lost sight of it. I continued to travel north hoping to see it again and as I approached 26th St and Marion road intersection I saw what appeared to be a single white sphere come straight down from the sky and appeared as if it would have collided with the earth. It was northeast of my location but I was not able to judge it&#39;s distance from me. The sphere appeared small but extremely bright. I contacted the police department at 7:40 PM to see if anyone else had called in anything out of the ordinary and as of that moment they had no other calls regarding this but they would keep it in mind if anything came up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the north of this incredible and stunning scene were a series of white similar in size triangles one above the other in also a vertical postion.  The rainbow was very large and of equal width up and down with what I thought was the sun at the base of it-due to the brillance and size-but upon walking back out only a couple of minutes later I could tell the sun must be too low on the horizon...what is all this?? A jet appeared to be in the process of intersecting with the base of the rainbow upon second time out to look at it.

If he had said it looked like a UFO, I wouldn&#39;t have bothered looking.  But, he said it was a blimp.  But, when I looked, I knew instantly that it was NOT a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what I saw:  A long, cylindrical shaped &#34;something&#34;; shiney silvery-white color; by this I mean, at times it appeared to be glowing white, but then it would look silver; there was no sound; no contrail; it was about the size of an airplane, but nose not pointed, no wings, just a cylinder shape.   Saw it very clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be close, about 1/8 mile up in the sky.  Appeared at first to be floating.  And, was moving slowly, horizontally, instead of up and at an angle the way planes do.  Although it seemed to be floating and moving slowly, it crossed the sky into a small dot within one minute!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t really know how to express how weird it was.

It proceeded to the south, where it hovered for approximately 3 to 4 minutes. My attention was distracted by an approaching helicopter, and when I looked back, the craft was simply not there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the day, about 5 pm, I saw an unmarked black helicopter hovering in the approximate area the craft had been in earlier.<n>

We thought it was a shooting star, but then it just stopped in the sky.  Then the light changed to a bright white light and we saw two more lights. They were in a triangular shape and they were blinking in a pattern. We live mear Shaw Air Force Base and we are used to air craft and jets flying over our house. This object did not make any noise. My husband was in his truck behind us and he saw it too.  We saw it for about 30 seconds and then it just disappeared.  It was just so eerie, not only to see, but the feeling that went through my body was just indescribable.  It just sent chills through me.  We did not report it.<n>

I noticed lights in the sky but they looked strange.  I see planes often because I live near an airport but it was too big and had too many lights to be one.  And it was also quite low and it wasn&#39;t moving.  It was almost like hovering.  I tried to get a better view but I was driving.  Then it started moving slowly north.  This thing I saw had white and red lights.  It looked just like a row of lights but it was very long.  There were for sure two bigger red lights in the middle...I can&#39;t remember if there was a third one in the centre and a bit higher then the other two red lights.  Then there were a bunch of smaller white lights on the sides lined up beside the red lights.  So basically it looked like straight white lights on the endsand in the centre were the red lights.  I couldn&#39;t tell the shape of this object because it was dark.  All I saw were the lights and they were just a straight line.  And it was big and quite low.  It had too many lights to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/2/06 18:30|Puerto Vallarta (Mexico)||Disk|2 hours +|Irreguelar "cloud" formations in sky above Bahia de Banderas.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48975.html|223|ndxe200602| Irreguelar &#34;cloud&#34; formations in sky above Bahia de Banderas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to my report of last night, which I myself find UNBELIEVABLE.... I was sitting at a beachside cantina located within the Bahia de Banderas when I noticed over the far northern most point of the bay (Punta de Mita) a saucer shaped flucuating cloud.  This was a rapidally forming cloud that seemed to dissapate within about a sixty second time frame and than basically reform in a basic triangulation (or saucer type shape) in a two to seven minute context.  I witnessed two appearqnces before I notified my friends,  seeing as the experience the past evening was a little out of the ordinary for us. This &#34;phenomenom&#34; followed no exact time pattern and we were witness to it for over two hours.  As I explained in my report last evening (02-01-06), we had witnessed five different unidentifed sources.  Upon first noticing the &#34;cloud&#34; above Punta de Mita, there was one clear, distinct, but slowly and yet rapidly, changing SAUCER shaped cloud.  I will elaborate further, however I have lived in Puerto Vallarta for almost NINE years and I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING like this before.  This &#34;cloud&#34;continued to dissapate and reform multiple times before my eyes as wells many others all within the same approximate location.  When it had disaperred from this location for the second time, I began to look around and noticed that the same type of formations &#34;clouds&#34; were forming and dissapating in other locations  in the north bay (Bucerias, La Cruz de Huanaxcatle, Sayulita).  The primary(?) cloud source was an in and out over Punta de Mita.  There was one, and then two, and then three sources from my viewpoint above Bucerias which is north of the airport.  The ones located towards Bucerias maintsined shape for much longer than the PdM.  I do not know what to think , but the Pd M was primarily 1, and at times 2, faint flash points to largely growing and then disproportionate saucer shaped &#34;clouds&#34;.  These &#34;clouds&#34; (as my friends kept referring to them) were all in the SAME location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very slight oval to circular in shape and had a bluish haze to it. After grabbing binoculars (10 x 50) and observing the object in the same position for around 20+ minutes it suddenly and very quickly moved to the 9 o’clock position of the moon and continued to move toward the 10 o’clock heading north at a very slow rate.  At that moment there was a large puff of misty light-grey smoke and the object immediately dimmed and exploded into red flames and plummeted towards the earth.  As it fell, smaller pieces broke away, and the flames appeared to grow brighter until after a minute or so of falling it burned out and I was unable to continue tracking due to low light.  However, for a moment after the flames went out I did see a dark object continue to fall.  As far as distance from me that the object was I can only guess at least 10 miles maybe 70.  It did take well over a minute for it to fall about 8 inches at arms length.<n>

Dog got agitated as it got closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live just south of Puerto Vallarta in Conchas Chinas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three friends and myself were sitting outside looking up at the stars from my deck around the pool.  I looked over to a radio tower that is approximately 1 mile from my house.  I noticed three lights that I thought at first were balloons and I told my friends to look.  Everyone thought that it was indeed baloons until they broke into a formation of first three, then four, then five reddish orangish almost squiggly like lights.  They were moving in a formation at a very high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were in a direct line to my house and also a short distance afterward, my dog became very agitated and started to whine and cry.  None of us heard any sounds, nor did we feel any vibrations.  These lights were traveling at a very high speed, almost similar to when you see a satellite in the sky but they were only about 1500 to 2000 feet up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for about 50 seconds (maybe less) until they were rendered invisible to us due to the city lights.  We are all in agreement that none of us has ever seen anything like this.  When first spotted we all thought that it was balloons, so I guess it started out as an oval type of shape and then it turned into more of a squiggly shape.  There was one prominately on the top that was visible at all times.  Then we were able to see two more that basically formed a triangle type formation, followed by two more that were below in a triangle type line.<n>

It hovered for a few minutes when 2 airplanes from the north approached the object. It was there for at least 20 minutes if not longer to the fireball/light round in shape. It was slightly bigger than your normal falling star. VERY bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I walked around there at a scenic overlook deck and took two still photographs using a disposable camera.  Later after the film was developed I noticed an odd speck on a photo taken from the scenic viewing deck looking south and dismissed it as a defect in the photo.  Yesterday while scanning and digitizing some old photos I scanned it and noticed zooming in that the odd speck was actually a white colored egg shaped object, with a completely black shadow on the bottom, and what appeared to be a rectangle red in color, and the appearance of a mirage shimmer along the left hand side of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was observing and using the film camera I never saw the object, but upon zooming the scanned photo noticed an object in the shot.  I have the print from the photo lab available,but cannot find the negatives. I am uncertain as to the nature of this phenomenon.<n>

It was rainy, and I saw a couple shots of green light earlier on my drive home.  The light originated from the sky not from any ground fixture.

2/1/06 00:00|Lake Elsinore|CA|Light|5 Minutes|Grouped Lights / No noise / No body|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50048.html|232|ndxe200602| Grouped Lights / No noise / No body<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, some background on myself.  I own my CNC machining business.  Have been a race engine builder for years.  Worked with GM for years.  Studied astronomy, physics and engineering.  Very down to earth person.  I don&#39;t look for phenomena, but have always had a major interest in the natural world.  I quest for knowledge in all my endeavors.  I not easily swayed, I seek facts and details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could go further, but that being said, here&#39;s my event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> February 2006;  I was driving home late at night, ~12:00 a.m. from my shop.  My girlfriend was with me at this time.  We were heading north on I-15.  Just passed California Oaks off ramp, we both noticed a very bright light hovering just above the horizon about NW, 10:30 from our position.  It was very strange in that there was no traffic in our direction.  No lights ahead and one set of lights very far behind us.  Very unusual for the busy I-15.  We commented on the brightness of the lights.  Like they were pointed right at us.  They were brighter than any aircraft lights I&#39;ve ever seen.  But there were 3 together but distinctly separate.  We thought it may be a helicopter.  It moved ever so slightly towards us, maintaining it&#39;s altitude.  We continued to comment on the strangeness.  As we approached Bundy Canyon, the object seemed to start to draw a bead on us.  Again there was oddly no other traffic in our direction, but a sporadic car passing on the opposite side heading south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed Bundy the object was now even with us and within a 1/4 mile to the direct West of us and falling slightly behind us, say to the 8:00 position.  It&#39;s altitude was maybe 200&#39;.  It then turned and maintained running parallel to our direction exactly off at 9:00.  It maintained that distance for ~ 1/4 mile, then moved in to us.  It continued to fly directly over the truck.  I become very uneasy and speed up to around 100 mph, because I felt like it may hit us.  It flew directly above us for maybe a 1/2 mile and then started to veer off to the East and disengaged slowly.  I could not see it off the passenger side except for just a couple of glimpses.  My girlfriend continued to eye it.  She said it then shot off to the East at an extremely high rate of speed.  Faster than a jet she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange facts:  NO noise.  This object made NO noise, even flying about 100&#39; above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three aircraft type landing lights up front and two of the same type lights in the assumed &#34;Rear&#34; of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NO traditional navigation lights or strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the most amazing aspect of all is that there was no visible body.  We could not make out any physical type of structure to the object.  NO wings, NO fuselage, NO body.  Just lights and void between the lights.  Even as the object came over head, we could not see any type of body.  The object did appear to be circular only becuase of the way the lights were positioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured you may like to add this sighting to what ever compilation you may have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You may contact me anytime if you would like to ask any further questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
