We were in his VW|11/19/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04833.html|1|ndxe197802| I was active duty (USAF) at the time, I was driving home (car-pooling) with a fellow worker, his name is ((Name deleted)). We were in his VW Wagon driving home from work at RAF Bentwaters (we lived at RAF Weathersfield base housing) anyway we saw this very bright light near what we throught was RAF Mildenhall (Military Air Command Transport Base) in the U.K. We could see the lights from the base near a hill we had to drive over before entering close to our neareat village (Weathersfield). We both noticed how bright it was, we had never seen anything like this! Next think we knew the light was right over Mikes vehicle, we stopped and tried to look up at it but it was far to bright to get any lind of identification. There was &#34;no sound&#34; coming from it at all! We watched it for a few moments when we all of a suden heard jet engine noise&#39;s (we were both aircraft maintenance) so we knew the sounds but it wasn&#39;t coming from the light, it came from to British fighters shooting out &#34;photo flash cartridges&#34; to light up the sky for taking photo&#39;s. These were &#34;Recon&#34; birds but this light shoot across the sky like somethinmg out of &#34;Star Wars&#34; with the same type of light as the &#34;light saber&#34; would make! In a flash it was headed towards London (you could see the lights of London from this hill). The aircraft tried to &#34;chase it&#34;, they kicked into &#34;burner&#34; (full throttle - afterburner)but couldn&#39;t even catch up. While we watched this chase, the aircraft seemed almost half way to the city (London) when the light streaked back over us (it was like in the wink of an eye). It hit us with the light and then shot straight up and vanished! The fighters flew back towards our area and kept going! I raced back and woke my wife out of her sleep, also the security policeman at the gate (gate-guard) saw the light and asked if &#34;we&#34; saw what was going on! I turned on the radio ( 0200 ) and the radio said that London was buzing with reports of &#34;UFO Sightings&#34;. I called the OSI (Office of Special Investications) next day and filled out a rep! ort and that was the end of it. ((Name deleted.)) didn&#39;t want to talk about it to anyone! Everyone seemed to think we &#34;worked too hard&#34; but we saw what we saw, I beleive it was an &#34;UFO&#34;, for years I only told some family members but most still think I&#39;m a nut. After twenty six years in the USAF (aviation maintenance) I&#39;m here to tell you &#34;we&#34; (USA of allies) have nothing like this thing I saw! I just had to report this to some agency that seems to care or at least act like they care! This was no joke! I wish I knew what what it was or that I could see something like that again! I now beleive that this was not of this world. I&#39;m a college graduate and private pilot that was decorated by President Reagan in the Oval Office of the White House (September 1987) for being selected as the Senior Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year for the US Air Force (worldwide, just to let you know that this isn&#39;t some guy making jokes. I now work as a government contractor (on the F-16 aircraft) if you ever would like to discuss this further please let me know (I&#39;m retired from the USAF) and would love to talk about it!<n>

SUDDENLY, AN INTENSE BEAM OF LIGHT, SIMILAR TO OLD FLASH BULBS, ONLY CONSTANT, HIT JUST THE CAB OF OUR RYDER TRUCK. THE TRUCK SLOWED DOWN AND STOPPED IN THE EMERGENCY LANE OF I25. WE WERE PARALYZED.  I COULD ONLY MOVE MY EYES. MY MOM WAS BEHIND US FOLLOWING IN OUR OLD BUICK. SHE WAS FLASHING HERE BRIGHTS ON AND OFF. THE BEAM WAS NOT ON HER. I REMEMBER THAT MY HANDS HAD A TRANSLUCENT LOOK TO THEM.

That area is pretty much all farm country, and at the time there was at least 8&#34; of snow on the ground from a previous snowfall. The night was clear and very cold...around 20 degrees Fahrenheit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to a stop at a remote four-way intersection, and sat at the intersection, and carefully looked both ways for traffic. While looking to the left, a circular light suddenly appeared on the snow, as if someone was shining a spotlight straight down. The light was approx. 30 feet in diameter, and was about 150 feet from my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no houses in the immediate area, and there was no sound being made. I was driving my winter car, an old Camaro, and the curvature of the window restricted me from looking up to see the source of the light, and the window handle was broken, so I couldn&#39;t roll the window down in order to put my head outside to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I sensed that something very strange was happening, and pretty much floored the accelerator to exit the area as fast as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to work, I was relating the incident to a few of my co-workers, when another worker (an off-duty policeman) arrived and announced that his police radio was bristling with reports of strange lights and ufo&#39;s all over the region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My brother in law saw it as well from another location in the vicinity.  We are sure was not an airplane nor an elicopter. We really never knew what it was. What it call our attention is that it was cpmpletely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/15/78 10:00|St.Thomas (U. S. Virgin Islands)||Disk|130 seconds|Visible in the mid-day|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53605.html|5|ndxe197802| Visible in the mid-day<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 11 years old, living with my mother in an apartment on the North Side of St.Thomas, in estate Rosenthahl. The North side of the island was very undeveloped at the time, so there were few houses nearby, it was mostly jungle or &#34;bush&#34; near our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was out on the balcony watering potted plants when she called me to come look at something. I came out and saw a saucer like aircraft hovering almost at eye-level to us. Our apartment was aproximatley 500 to 700 feet above sea-level on the side of a mountain. Magen&#39;s Bay was to the left of our view and we looked out at a small hill just opposite of our building, about 400 feet opposite. On the other side of the small hill is now Mahogany Run gold course which, at the time belonged to St. Thomas Dairy and was a pasture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Atlantic Ocean is beyond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a perfectly clear sunny day and the sun was behind us, we were looking due north. The craft was brilliantly shiny, like highly polished chrome and the sun glinted off of it, the rest of it appeared dark because it was in shadow. I was trying to figure out how far away from us it was; I think it was beyond the hill opposite of us, probably about a half mile away, hovering above the pasture, but visible to us over the top of the small hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to this experience, I thought a spinning saucer shaped ufo was an absurd concept, but this was not spinning, and there it was before my eyes. It appeared disc shaped because of the way the sun was glinting off of it, but we were seeing its edge, from the side. It was like two thin pie plates one inverted on top of an upright one on the bottom. It was sleek and stealth. The lower portion in shadow was more pie plate shaped, with more vertical sides, the top was flatter. It was not mushroom cap shaped. It was not very large, about 15 to twenty feet in diameter. It made no sound. It was a quiet day and all you could hear were the birds singing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most remarkable thing about it was how it moved. At first it was absolutely still then it moved from left to right with unwavering precision, and back again and up and down a very little. It moved only about 20 to 40 feet to the sides, as if it were focusing or getting a better angle. It moved up and down only about 10 feet or so. Every movement it made was exact, no wobble, and it went from absolute standstill to movement with no acceleration or deceleration. It moved with phenomenal speed, from zero to super fast to zero again without any lurching. It stopped between left and right movements and stayed unmoving for a couple seconds, and I definitely had the impression it was observing my mother and I as we were watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed in the same area of the sky, right in front of us for the majority of the time, and then moved further to the left, as if it was checking out something else and stayed there for only a few seconds more and then it abruptly took off in an ascending arc, going north-west from horizontal to about 45 degrees at a phenomenal rate of speed and disappeared from sight into the dark blue zenith of the sky. The duration that we observed it was hardly more than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was looking out the window of my house approximately WSW and trying to figure out a &amp;quot;triangle&amp;quot; of stars I was looking at, approximately the same size as the &amp;quot;Summer Triangle&amp;quot; with Deneb, etc.  As I was observing it, the single star at the top of the triangle moved slowly down to the lower left &amp;quot;corner&amp;quot; star and seemed to stop.  Then it (or the corner star) moved across the sky to the other bottom corner star on the right and stopped.  I was so astounded that I sat and watched it for about another half hour, waiting to see if anything else happened but no other movement occurred there.  Meanwhile, way off to the west on the horizon, low in the sky - a silent red light was moving back and forth something like a helicopter might do if looking for something, but there was no noise at all.  I had the w! indow open, despite the time of year just to check.  Was too close to the tree line tho, couldn&#39;t see it after a while and gave up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was about 2 AM.  The bus let us off at the top of a hill, and the veiw comanded all of the bay area.  The bus pulled away, and we started walking down the road and looked out over the bay to see hovering over the ocean, about 2 miles away, a cigar shaped, almost floresent orange colored light. It was a clear crisp night, no fog or clouds.  The object was low to the water, maybe just 1,500 ft. We stared in total amazement, after about two mins it&#39;s color seemed to brighten, and all at once it seemed to streach, like a pitcher that someone moved in, a blurr, if you will across the sky and over the visable horizon. Like an elastic?? it was in all places at the same time, that&#39;s the only way to explain how it moved. We vowed never to tell anyone, at 15 years old I didn&#39;t sleep well for many nights, and I have never told anyone untill now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This object flew just above the tree tops and made a low humming noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel there are two points of particular interest regarding this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, that my brother filmed the object and other strange lights seen that night then immediately drove to the news station in Detroit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My memory fails me at this point but I believe it was channel 7.  The news station aired the film on the eleven p.m. news.  All that was on it were neighborhood dogs he had filmed earlier in the day.  It was made out to be a hoax.  I also seem to remember that it was somehow proven later that the film had been tampered with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second, that I was interviewed at a later date by Air Force personnel regarding the sighting.  I was alone with the personnel at our kitchen table as I gave my account of the sighting.  I remember being asked to draw a picture which I did.  Other witnesses in my family were also interviewed seperately the same day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been searching to no avail regarding the newscast or Air Force report referencing this sighting.  I found one report on this sighting at www.cohenufo.org.<n>

It was around 10:00 in the evening.  The object was basically triangular in shape though it was pointed something resempling an arrow.  The underside had three very bright white lights equally spaced in the corners.  In the center was a flashing red light (smaller). The right side had what appeared to be illuminated rectangular windows. there were two rows of either three or four on the horizontal. The rear of the object had three more very bright white lights in a linear line-up. THey were so intense that they gave off a prizmic effect.  They also sort of pulsed which also gave a random moving effect.  They seemed to be located behind some kind of a grid. Two other aspects were that it was very large, though my perspective was difficult having nothing to measure it against. It just appeared large.  It was also very quite and gave off a magnetc sound.  A humming as it were. We were all very surprised and had no idea as to what it could have been.  A flying wing perhaps? This was back in 1978.  One other point I wish to make, I consider all of us to be of sound mind. I myself currently work for a medical research and development company in Greenwich CT where I reside with my wife and child.  I went as far as grad school and feel that I am &#34;normal.&#34;  The same is true of the class mates who were with me at the time.  This was a very odd sighting and it was definitely there! I hope that this is of some assistance with your research.  Regards:- ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

It was stationary for a few minutes then suddenly it zoomed behind the moon in the wink of an eye.  We never saw it again.  This was a long time ago, things like this were not spoken of and we felt we would be ridiculed if we reported this.  My daughter and I also witnessed two grey objects during daylight hours hovering over each other in circles then moving straight up at a very fast speed out of sight.  This was in Kalgoorlie West Australia in 1984.<n>
2/1/78|Detroit (metro area)|MI||1-2 Months|Detroit UFO Flap of February 1978|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55967.html|13|ndxe197802| Detroit UFO Flap of February 1978<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is of a historical nature.  I want to emphasize that I did not witness a UFO during the time period described. Back in 1978, when I was in high school, I vividly recall a major UFO Flap that occurred in February and March of that year. My friends and I were very excited by it because almost every day there were reports on the local news and radio about another UFO sighting. Some of them were quite spectacular.  However, this major UFO flap seems to have been forgotten in the UFO literature, so I did some research at a local university library of The Detroit News from that time period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was disappointed that only one article was written during that time. The article has been sent electronically via email. It discusses some of the UFO sightings, but not all of them.  The one I remember most distinctly occurred during afternoon rush hour.  The local television news reported that many witnesses reported a low flying UFO buzzed down the I-96 expressway in Brighton, over hundreds of cars. Apparently, many people got out of their cars to get a better look.  This occurred a week or two before the report about the UFO following the park rangers, which is in the article.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked a coworker if they remembered the flap.  He said that he did. Surprisingly, he went on to explain that his father was a narcotics detective for the Detroit Police Force and that one of his father’s friends flew the police helicopter. During the time period in question, the Detroit Police helicopter pilot stated that a UFO followed his helicopter. He tried to lose it but could not. I wonder how many other incidents like this may have occurred that were never reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will continue to inquire regarding this interesting time period.  Perhaps other readers of your website remember this flap also and can add further details or historic sources.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
