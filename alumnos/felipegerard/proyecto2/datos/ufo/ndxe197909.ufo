We stopped for dinner and then attempted to get back on the interstate to head home. We parked in an abandoned Gas station along I-55 to figure out how to get back onto the interstate. For some reason we both looked up and observed an egg shaped object that was approx 1,000 - 3,000 feet above moving at an incredible speed toward the south/south west. It went right over our car and reached the horizon in seconds. I only remember this as being a white glowing egg. My father thought he saw red lights in the shape. This craft made no noise and to this date has intrigued me. The only other information I remember is several weeks later there was an article in the local paper about UFO sightings in Michigan. The article detailed accounts of several Michigan Police officers that observed a glowing UFO that hovered over Lake Michigan. I believe the area was the Muskegon, MI area. The article indicated that the last event was on the same night we saw our UFO and that it shot off toward the south west. The time was 10pm EST and I saw my UFO at 9:03pm CST. Looking on a map my location was almost a direct line from the location of the Police reported UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is an old case, but I know what I saw and there was or is nothing on this earth that could move like that object did without making noise. It was too low to be a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Just at sunset.  Seen from pontoon boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were heading east by southeast.  Racing to get home before dark because the lights were out on our boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an oval to circular object.  Silver in color.  Approximately 15 ft. X 15 ft. X maybe 6 ft thick.  Couldn&#39;t tell thickness very well as it was not at a good angle to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between shallow and deep water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Took off from almost right under our boat.

We had taken the kids to a movie, and then pizza hut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling up 331 I believe the.I reached for a cigarette and saw what I thought was a blimp. this was about 6:00, the sun had gone down. My husband military was all in avaition for 22 yrs.  I questioned him about that &#34;blimp&#34; he said that is not a blimp..<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing is was there were no other cars, or traffic. there is a Y in the road, at that time there was a little hotdog stand, the craft was hovering above it.  The left side of the Y was 331, the right side took you to the shopping centers. the cigar shaped craft had windows, and they blinked one window at a time, when the back of the craft windows could be seen on the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said there was no other cars on that intersection.  My husband backed the car across a 4 lanes in the road and parked the car in a Gulf gas station. the kids were asleep.  My husband and I got out and stood at the front of the car. (remember that it was 6:pm.  The next thing I remembered to check on the kids in the back seat..  To my surprise it was 10:00pm.  I have no memories of talking to my husband, and he wasnt talking either.  Both of us had no memories of being that late at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still standing at the front of the car, we saw the craft shoot up in the sky very fast.  When we got home, my husband called the FtBragg to see if anyone saw on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have questions as to what we were doing in the hours between 6:00pm and 10:Pm its all just a blank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A spere shaped Spacecraft with dome on top appeared about 100 feet in the air.  It was about the diameter of a DC-10.  Golden in color.  There were bright lights that rotated around it.  There were black windows that appeared to be absent of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship made a soft hum, almost silent, and could move in any direction.  It slowly moved over us for 5-7 Minutes then shot of into the horizon.  We showed it to my friends Mom but she wasn&#39;t sure what she saw it was now so far away.  My parents wouldn&#39;t believe me until the next days news reported a sherif attacked the same night.  There is unaccounted for time in the middle of my encounter. I saw my friend in 1991.  It was the first thing we discussed.  It felt good to have him verify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

She was traveling east and she when topped the hill on 80th  near the police station in Cottage Grove. She notices a saucer shaped object hovering  over the houses off to the right or south. I questioned her about that part because there is a water tower about a ¼ mile east and south  of the police station, but she said she could clearly see the water tower and the ufo was closer to her and further south a little. She said she watched it til she came abreast of it and continued on towards home feeling spooked and not wanting to stop with our three kids sleeping in the back seat. When she got to keats ave about a mile or so further east she did stop the car and got out to look at it, as it was still in approximately the same position. So she had watched it for about 5 minutes and was as close to it as a half a city block.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So our kids are grown up and married and my oldest girl and her husband were over for supper one night many years later. He started  telling us a story about his 13th birthday party and how a tiny object no bigger than a foot in diameter flew right between him and a friend while they were playing in the yard  My son-in-law lived right about where my wife saw the ufo and it was the same weekend in Sept. 1979  We have thought about filing a report or calling the police but not wanting to get the notoriety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife describes it as about 30-40 ft in diameter and about 8-10 ft tall at the center, she says this because she thought that it was as wide as the houses under it. She says it was about 50 ft in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object was a pulsating light and the shape was unknown.  It appeared to be five miles out over the ocean and was moving slowly north by northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for a few minutes, the police officer directly south of my town contacted us and told us that there was an object over the ocean, approximately five miles out over the ocean heading our way.  Two police officers were sent to the beach area where they were able to see the object.  The Sergeant guessed that it was 500 feet off the ocean between 3 to 5 miles out over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was directly off our coastline, the object made a sudden turn South and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week prior to this sighting, a caretaker of a local lighthouse called our police station, quite upset.  He asked to have an officer come see him regarding an object  that was actually floating on the water approximatley 100 yards off the rocks. He saw the object from ground level and ran up to the top of the lighthouse to get a btter look.  When he got to the top of the light house, the object took off from the water straight up in the air.  The object lifted at a high rate of speed, not consistent with a helicopter or anything he was familiar with.  He wanted to see one of our officers to confirm that he had not been drinking and was sane (he had to make a report to his supervisors).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Other witness remembers nothing.  Tractor beam taking water aboard craft.  5 miles downrange, appeared 300 feet long and 60 feet in diameter.  Based on angle at tree top level, and known range, object was around 6600 feet long and 550 feet in diameter.  Many other events, one involving screen memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ship was dull orange on sides, bottom was brilliant white with a blue beam of light amidships.  I saw the craft on Pamalee Drive hovering just behind Highland Nursing Home.  Craft was long and cylindrical, with a disk in front that was the full diameter, and a forth as high.  I could send you a drawing if you like as it is very difficult to visualize.  The man that was with me recalls nothing of the event, while I remember seeing it for about ten to fifteen minutes.  I was not afraid of this craft, though I knew in my heart it was from another world.  The bottom of the craft was flat, the top a half circle, and the back when it took off was flat with what appeared to be cargo doors.  When the craft took off, it slowly gained altitude and moved forward, much like a helicopter.  After this slow ascent, it moved so fast that it was on the outer fringes of the earths atmosphere in less than a second, spewing out long streaks of white light behind it.  My friend is a recovering alcoholic, and has no memory of the incident.  I recall that when we returned to his house, our watches were both 50 minutes slow.<n>

He said that one night about a week after Hurricane Frederick hit Mobile, Alabama, he saw a bizarre-looking object hanging motionless in the southern sky just before the sun went down.  He had gone outside to feed his dog and the object caught his eye because it was so bright, it seemed to be lit from within.  It had a row of lights horizontally across the center of every color which were alternately blinking (&#34;chasing&#34; was the word he used).  He said he stood stock still for 4 to 5 minutes watching it and it neither got larger nor smaller nor moved at all.  He said it suddenly turned, made a kind of funny loop in the air, and shot off straight up faster than any man-made object could possibly have moved and was gone in less than a second toward the zenith.  He said that just as he lost sight of it, he heard jet air crafts and saw two (what he thought must have been Air Force) jets flying toward the spot where the rectangular object had been hovering. Further observations:  my ex said the rectangular object really looked like a flying mobile home made of silver with a string of Christmas lights wrapped around it.  He said he was looking due South at it which he said would have situated it in the Gulf of Mexico. He estimated that it was about 10 miles away and he said he felt all weird and creepy when he realized how big it must have been for him to see it so clearly from so far away.  He said it was about the size of his entire thumb from tip to hand at arm&#39;s length (he has a big thumb--he&#39;s 6&#39;9&#34;!). My ex is a man of little imagination and less verbal ability and so his story struck me with it&#39;s clarity and I was stunned by his recitation of the facts.  His discomfiture was obvious and we had been married for 5 years without him ever mentioning it.  In September, 1979, when this occurred, he was seventeen years old.  He&#39;s a licensed electrician now. I found this site while researching Whitley Strieber whom I had seen on a Fox News hour-long special on UFO&#39;s and, after deliberation, decided to report my ex&#39;s experience.<n>

It was toward the of the end of summer as the days were beginning to get shorter. I remember playing in the front yard.  I lived in the Oaks. Its mostly mid-class families.  The sky was gray and somewhat cool as it gets in Texas towards the evening time.  I was on the corner of where our yard where we lived at Briar Oaks and well the cross street was Carter Creek, well it turns into Carter Creek at the Curb by the Royal Oaks Racket Club use to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a Bright light hovering above our yard. It as I could tell somewhat oval shaped as the light resemble a floucent light color but much brighter.  I describe it as oval shape as that was how the light extended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for- it felt like a long time probably between 10 to 15 min.  It didn&#39;t appear to be very high maybe 1 to 2 football fields high. I wanted to get a ladder and get a closer look.  After several minutes of watching it, I remember my neck hurting from staring into the sky for so long.  There was no sound and the craft was just hovering with No moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember running inside a telling my mom.  I ask if we had some binoculars to get a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said &#34;No&#34; we didn&#39;t. I told her she had to come outside to see it.   Once back outside it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I remember telling my mom that we had to watch KBTX Channel 3 to see if anyone else saw it.  The weather man did say something.  I thought that was awesome.  He stated that several other people called in that night about a bright light in the sky.   He laughed, joking and said we all hope it was just a weather balloon with no real explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope someone in that neighorhood who saw what I did will also post there experience that day.  I am very surpised with the number of calls the news recieved no one else has placed anything on this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently 34 years old and been serving in the US Army for over 15 years.

I turned 180 degrees around and saw an object moving at a uniform distance above the roof of the house in front of me, about 2 ft. above the roof, coming towards me from the backside of the structure, and it occurred to me that it was maintaining a uniform distance above the roof as opposed to an arc over the house from the other side or a path that would lead it way past the house---it was &#39;hugging&#39; the roof as if on purpose. The object was a sphere, maybe 1 1/2X the size of a basketball, emitting a VERY bright blue light but a light that didn&#39;t hurt my eyes as I watched it come over the roof to stop about 5 feet above the ground maybe 15 feet in front of me, between the house and where I was standing. It emitted NO NOISE, NO ODOR, and no noticable spinning or other movement---it just hovered there---I then began to think---I believe that all of my mental processes had ceased as I watched it, from complete amazement and captivation, with no fear or any emotion. However, as soon as I began to &#34;think&#34; about it, this object went from right in front of me to over the horizon, perhaps 1/2 mile away up the hill I was on, and disappeared. Again, NO NOISE ans NO anything---it just &#34;left&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I ponder what I have seen, the most powerful part of my memory concerns the following: I believe that it would have stayed there in front of me until I began to &#34;think&#34; about it, and as soon as my brain kicked into gear, it took off at light-speed+ to get away from me, protect itself or whatever. It could differentiate between observation and analysis---these are just my feelings---no proof of anything, nor any harm done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have decided to call it a &#34;probe&#34;, something sent to gather inormation as I saw how it was hugging the roof-line as though it had a useful &#34;range&#34;, and I would go farther to guess that what it &#34;records&#34; is brain wave activity or something like that---based on it&#39;s reaction to my &#34;discerning&#34; that it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to know the answer someday----you never can know for sure!!

We had a lantern out over the water to attract the fish.  It was dead quiet and no breeze whatsoever.  My father-in-law and I shifted around in our small boat and ended up virtually back to back (east to west).  The fish had quit biting for some reason, so we tried to get comfortable and be real quiet hoping the fishing frenzy we had just experienced would return.  My eyes started wandering from my fishing rod when I looked up and saw directly over me an &#34;orb&#34; moving incredibly fast.  It was perfectly round and I mean perfectly.  It was divided in half by bright &#34;colors&#34;.  I believe the blue was in the front (or the direction it was heading)and the red in back.  Perception wise, it looked about half the size of the way a full moon looks to the naked eye when it close to the horizon.  . It was almost directly above me, possibly a little to my right or south.  I watched it fly by at an incredible and steady speed. What made the experience even more awesome was that it appeared just above the clouds.  There were a few small cumulus type clouds slowly passing overhead.  Each time the object passed over one of these clouds, it lit the cloud up and turned it a beautiful red and blue (the whole cloud) for about a fraction of a second.  To see those clouds light up one by one as the object streaked by was unbelievable.  What made it seem even more eerie was the fact the there was absolutely no sound from the object and everything else remained perfectly still.  It disappeared on the horizon somewhere pass the trees and I just sat there in disbelief.  It was then that my father-in-law finally broke the silence and said something about how &#34;God really knew what he was doing....etc. And I broke in and said &#34;Did you see that&#34;.  I immediately told him that we had just seen a UFO and he said he wasn&#39;t sure what it was, but we both agreed it was an awesome sight.  Before we could discuss it much further.  The wind picked up and clouds rolled in! at an a larming rate. We barely got the engine started when all hell broke loose and we almost got blown off the lake.  We managed to get to shore safely in a full blown thunderstorm. I&#39;ve brought up the incident to my (now x-father-in-law) a couple of times thru the years and all he does is shake is head and agree that what ever it was, it was “sure somethin’”.<n>

There was this somewhat fluttery haze around these objects&#39; paremiters.   Each was the size of if you held a penny out at arms length.  I can&#39;t tell you for certain there were 7 objects, but I recall -around- that number.  They were in a straight-line formation, but side-by-side abreast, closeley, not single file.  They were seperate and not lights on something, because you could see the sky inbetween each one.  They came flying directly over me and my friend, coming from West and heading East.  Silent.  They seemed to me, about as high and fast as a sort of low small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a 19 yrold female HS grad, working manual labor factory miscellaneous and living with parents and siblings at that time.  My friend was a few short years older, female, living with one parent, doing miscellaneous print-shop work.  We were sitting outside across the street from her house, on wooden bleechers in a sports field of a school, and it was dark there.  We had a &#34;boom box&#34; audio cassette/radio player, and acting generally silly.  The neighborhood was a quiet one with rarely to any criminal behaviour about.  That I knew of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather that night was warm but not very warm.  No inclement weather.  I recall the sky mostly clear, the stars mostly visible, for a residential neighborhood of a medium city in 1979.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

9/1/79 21:30|Carrollton|MO|Sphere|2 hours|UFO Abduction ofr Four People Near Missouri River in 1979|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84071.html|19|ndxe197909| UFO Abduction ofr Four People Near Missouri River in 1979<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and our next door neighbors and I decided to drive out to the Missouri river outside Carrollton, Missouri at around 9:00 pm to have a picnic at the river.  I don&#39;t remember why we would do such a thing after dark out on a country road with no lights or houses around, but we did.  After we arrived at a certain spot the four of us got out and took a couple of blankets and some sandwiches and drinks out of the car and went down the embankment.  We ate and talked for about 20 or 30 minutes.  The two men got up and walked towards the river&#39;s edge and were throwing rocks in the water, when I noticed a bright light across the opposite side of the river and some distance away over the woods.   The light was moving towards us and getting larger.  They guys thought it was a star at first, then realized it wasn&#39;t because of the size of it.  Then the light shown on the water.  We thought it must be a helicopter.  It moved quickly towards us, getting larger and ! larger as it approached, heading directly for us and flying very low – maybe 60 feet or less above our heads. The odd thing was that there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  As the bright white light came over all of us, we ran up the embankment, intending to get into the car.  At that point, my memory is a blank.  All I remember after that is getting back to the house at about 12:30 am and not knowing how we got there.  With time to drive to the location and eating it should have been one hour before we headed back, so we should have arrived at the house at about 10:30 pm.  So we had two hours of missing time.  I spoke to my husband and our neighbors about it the next morning but all they said was it must have been a helicopter.  No one had a good explanation for what happened and none of them wanted to talk about it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often wondered what happened that night and since then asked my now ex-husband about it two or three times since our divorce in 1981.  He claims he remembers nothing at all – not even going out to have a picnic that night. I lost track of the neighbors so can&#39;t ask them about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a regression done by a licensed therapist recently and found out that we did not get into the car when I thought we did.  The light stopped right over our heads and there was a large cylindrical craft hovering above us. We were taken up into the light and onto a craft, where I saw each person take to a different room by short, grey beings.  I was not afraid or trying to get away during this experience.  I was allowed to look out of a window as the craft moved away from the Earth, and watched as the Earth got smaller and smaller.  Then the craft took off at a high rate of speed and I could no longer see objects out of the window.  I was taken to a room and sat on a table, where a couple of these beings placed needles in my arms and calves.  They didn&#39;t hurt.  They had me look into some type of eye examination device that had a bluish light inside of it.  I couldn&#39;t focus on many details in the room – or perhaps there were none to see besides what they brought near me.  ! I could hear talking in an unknown tongue, but also sensed that there was some type of telepathic communication between me and one of the beings, who stayed near me the entire time. I don&#39;t know if they were male or female.  They were muscular, thin framed, short (about 4&#39; tall), had no body hair or hair on their heads.  The heads were large, and the being with me had a larger head than the others did and he had a more whitish tinge to his skin.  I remember seeing his mouth move.  He had big eyes with large irises that were a strange lavender color.  I remember thinking that must be why I am leery of people with lavender eyes. I was then shown a planet outside the window that did not look like Earth. It had two moons, with one larger than the other and farther away than the smaller one.  We did not land on this planet, but the being told me some things about it that I can&#39;t remembers.  We were shortly taken back to our vehicle.  I did not see how they got us to drive or get! to our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We would catch up to it as it hovered over different areas such as woods, or fields only to have it take off in a different direction. Once as we watched it slowly fly above a wooded area it came to the end of the trees by a field ,it slowly tilted and followed the contour of the landscape. As it came to trees again on the other side of the field it tilted upward again. After reaching the tree tops it took off(every time it took off it was at an extremely high speed)and we had to search the area until we would spot it again. This craft made no noise at all and once when we were looking for it my husband looked in the rear view mirror and saw the glow of lights. we stopped the 8888 88<n>

I will never forget it i had a friend in the passenger seat who would back me up on the encouter.i have not stoped lookin in the sky since.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Instead of continui|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42529.html|22|ndxe197909| Returning home from an evening shopping trip my husband spotted several bright lights in the sky into the distance. Instead of continuing through the city to our home, he turned back and headed towards the lights, which made our journey home through the country roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw were about 8 and sometimes more very large round lights following the south side of Mine Rd. As we drove beside and watched them, trying to figure out what they were, we began to notice that some would suddenly go dark while another would light up nearby. They all stayed fairly close together and they continued their path directly beside us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned left on Landsdowne Rd and they also turned with us. Landsdowne Rd is several miles long, so we drove slow and observed.They stayed beside us. We had no preconceptions about UFO&#39;s, therefore we did not feel any threat from this, just curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a helicopter appeared in the sky on the north side of the road. When we heard the helicopter&#39;s engine and saw the small light in comparison, we realized that the lights that we had been following (or following us) made absolutly no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we turned right on the next road my husband decided to keep past our development and go as far as the small airport to see if that was their destination. They continued beside us and on past the airport. This seemed to be a never ending journey and we were beginning to feel a little strange about it so we turned around back to our house, which was just a few blocks off the main road. We could still see them behind us and they seemed to be hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once home, my son went to get his friend to tell him about this. They climbed on the garage to see if they could see them. The lights or whatever it was had crossed the road into a large unpopulated area next to our development. My son and his friend watched them hover in that area until they got tired and came in. Of course I had no fear then about abduction, etc. because I wasn&#39;t aware of such things. Today, I would not have taken it so lightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day someone called into our local radio station and was talking about the lights and how none of the local military bases had anything like this in the air. I then knew that more people than my family had witnessed this. It was a very dark night so we couldn&#39;t determine if the lights were attached to one large craft or each was a seperate craft. I would love to know if anyone in this area recalls anything about this. I now wonder about the reason they stayed with my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
9/1/79 20:00|Farmville|VA|Disk|split second|2 out of 3 witnesses sitting together saw saucer fly by overhead, completely silently and suddenly.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52373.html|23|ndxe197909| 2 out of 3 witnesses sitting together saw saucer fly by overhead, completely silently and suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1979, in warm climate, I was sitting outdoors with 2 friends in college right after dinner.  We did not drink nor do drugs so our vision and minds were not under any influence.  In the dark, all of a sudden, a UFO flew by silently and right above the 2 story dining hall building that we sitting outside of.  It flew by us in a split second.  One friend looked at me shocked in disbelief.  I would not have believed my own eyes, except my friend saw it too.  The other (third) friend never saw nor heard anything and was convinced that the two of us who saw it, had fabricated the story.  That shows you how silent and quick the UFO flew by. The shape was the classic saucer shape.  The size was huge - bigger than a helicopter, but smaller than the building.  The UFO was a dark silver color, and had one string of lights going around it, on the side I saw. The amazing thing is that it was so close and yet so absolutely silent.  I have never seen anything ever again that flies so silently.  I always felt bad about not reporting it, but we didn&#39;t know who to report it to.  I was glad to have recently discovered this website and hope this helps by adding one more piece of the big puzzle to solve credible and mysterious UFO citings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Object was about 500ft up moving at about 10 MPH. We watched it form about 1/2 mile out to where it was directly overhead. Some sound of a propulsion system, not a prop or helicopter, but similiar to a jet engine. Round light pattern of multi-colors, dozens of lights, in a circular patten. Object was solid and nearly hovered above the house for 2 minutes. In a instant, the craft went form a near still position to a speed that must have been 1000 MPH, absolute impossible acceleration, going to the North to a distance of possibly 3 miles in a matter of a second. It then did a rapid zig-zag pattern 3 times and shot up into the sky and was lost form our sight. (Mother, sister &amp; myself) Object originally spotted by my aunt who saw it form her house about 5 miles away and called us to go outside and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was silent and very much visable.  The night was clear.  I think it was Aug. or Sept. because it was a little nippy outside but not time enough to stay off the balcony yet due to the comming Winter.  The craft was spotted about 1 to 2 min. it was lost behind some buildings.  I lived on Ocean Parkway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked over to the left of the room after seeing something move. There was a very small person, no different then pics we see of so called Aliens today. This little guy move across my room and went into the living room. I jumped out of bed to see where he was going. He vanished.. About 3 months later I was living at my sisters house. I woke on night,there was a sound of a huge heart beat,very loud, but machine like. I could not move, not even open my eyes. I than could fill myself moving, but I couldn&#39;t fill anything below me. I think I was just floating, I then found myself outside of my bedroom, I could fill the cold air now, smell the pine tree next to my room. I was scared to death. I have told my children of this, they always laughed at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Saucer shaped about twice the size of a quarter held at arms lengt|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01888.html|27|ndxe197909| SUMMARY:  Saw a very large object 1000-1500 ft in diameter having difficulty.  Saucer shaped about twice the size of a quarter held at arms length about 2 miles distant.  Rotating  windows from left to right.  Saucer was wobbling very slowly for about 5 minutes.  About 20 windows observable.  Looking at object to west.  Reported to Pecatonica state police about 1 hour later and laughed at.  Reported to J.A. Hynek; NW University next dawith drawing sent in later.  I have had my son approximate these drawings with computer graphics.  It finally stabilized and floated away to the NW toward Pecatonica.  Only  a white blinking light remained after window lights were shut off.  Light appeared to be center top.  Also, no sound and other witnesses did not seem to be too concerned that they did not what this object was.  The wife and I know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background will mildly rolling with numerous houses and apartments visable.  Object was at time below the horizon in a slight valley just to the west of the Bel-ford theater on IL RT 20 which runs between Rockford and Belvidere.  This object was extremely large and seemed massive-heavy but suspended in the air and wobbling slowly like when you spin a frisbee on a string. spin it slowly and then strike one side.  At the time I told Hynek&#39;s secretary that I thought that the windows measured about 20&#39; x 70&#34;. 20 wide - 70 high.  In retrospect, I underestimated these dimensions.  Probably more like 50 by 300.  At that time John Anderson from Rockford was running for president.  Haven&#39;t heard much about him lately. He lost as a third party candidate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 49 years old now but it is still vivid in our memories.  Most people look us strangely when we mention it.  Neither of us have seen anything similar since.  We also called the Rockford Airport the next day and they said they had seen nothing unusual on rader the night before.  They said it was probably an advertising plane pulling a lighted banner.  Yea, right!  I have never seen an ad plane that makes no sound, flying around at midnight with a lighted sign the size of Commisky Park.  I just gave up trying to convince peiople.  I guess it doesn&#39;t really matter anyway.  Sooner or later everyone will see these.<n>
