I looked up into the sky and saw a bright light. It moved across the sky like aplane but it stopped directly in the sky and the light just dimmed and stayed there for a couple of seconds and dissapeared. A few minutes later I went back outside and saw A flashing light moving aacross the sky about 3 miles away from the position of the light. It moved acros the sky flashing at the same time. It did look like it was on orbit or something but I can&#39;t be too sure. I told my mother but I don&#39;t think she belived me. An aircraft was near the area but I am not sure if it had to do with the event<n>

One of the lights maneuvered erratically as they moved across the sky at a high rate of speed.  The formatin steadied and the lights disappeared to the north west. Because we are adjacent to DFW airport we are accustomed to seeing aircraft at night.  These lights were not like any of the aircraft lights observed in the past.  My wife was the first to notice and called me outside to observe.<n>

For the past wo evenings we have seen these lighted objects overhead orange in lighted color. On the morning of 5/31/04 at approx, two am five of us witnessed this object and twice it released what appeared to be like balls of the light (orange) that would fade as they went down what seems to be a hundred or so feet? We saw the same thing happen this evening. At other times it is moving low through the sky and at times hovering then fading to a blinking light. Sometimes they just fade out like the fireballs they release.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/31/02 21:10|Warminster|PA|Light|1/2 hour|A friend of mine in Warminster PA last night at 910pm while online stated that he was seeing from his window two unidentified phenomeno|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23091.html|5|ndxe200205| A friend of mine in Warminster PA last night at 910pm while online stated that he was seeing from his window two unidentified phenomenon. First only one appeared in the sky (Sky condition thunder and lightning, electrical flashes)He stated the first one was a single whitish light which divided into three lights, twirled in a spiral pattern then returned to regroup into the single light. I asked him to time the occurrance and he said 20 seconds. About 10 minutes later he said another identical phenomenon appeared, so that two of them were in the sky simultaneously. I asked him to try to interpret them as the electronic billboard of a commericial blimp and he said that it did not seem to him that that was it.  I emailed another person who was in Warminster PA online at the same time and asked them to look into the sky but they said they saw nothing. My friend said that the occurrance &#34;faded&#34; into the electrically charged sky. Total time of occurrance about 20 minutes. I suggested that he email the Airforce to try to document the phenomenon with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether this event can be ascribed to an advertising light, but that is only a guess.

5/31/02 01:00|Windermere to Canal Flats (Canada)|BC|Flash|40 minutes|Bright, white strobe light on deserted highway.|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23132.html|6|ndxe200205| Bright, white strobe light on deserted highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were travelling from Vancouver to Kimberly. It was about 1am when we reached Windermere. A few miles south from there we saw a bright strobe light above some trees. We thought it was a beacon of some kind, but we noticed that it took a long time to reach it and finally pass it. It was almost in the trees and the road travelled in a way that we could not see it when we passed it. A few moments later we saw another bright, white strobe light just above the trees quite a bit further down the road. At one point I could see it flashing just above a house. We were getting closer now and we finally realized it was moving. There were no marker lights, no spotlight and we were in a bit of a thunder and lightning storm so I really do not think it was any kind of legitimate aircraft. This second light stayed with us for a minute or so travelling at our speed just above the trees about 50 feet to our left. It stopped &#34;following&#34; us just before the next small town. When we reached Fairmont, we stopped and I could still see it flashing in the distance. We continued on, quite scared now. We crossed a small bridge and I saw another one on my right but it was stationary. Then as we travelled alongside Columbia Lake we saw another one. This one was on the other side of the lake, but it stayed with us for a few minutes. When we reached Canal Flats, it stopped, and when we looked back there were two hovering over the town. We were frightened and continued on our way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This road was quite deserted, but there were probably thirty other vehicles that must have seen something. We sure won&#39;t be the same.<n>

When I ride my motorcycle (my motorcycle is suzuki satria) accross the highland call Lembang Bandung, i saw some strange light (blue and orange light) at the sky. When i looked up the light become closer to the land and levetate over 10 meters and the range from me is 50 meters. I seen the shape like a disk but the strange is the disk had no color (just chrome color) but flashing blue and orange that i didn&#39;t know where the source of the light is, it&#39;s like the steel and source of light become one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That thing levetated on some general graves i&#39;m affraid they took some dead body or skel and bone of human). I just shaking and couldn&#39;t moved my body until that thing flying fast 45 degrees to the west of the sky. Since that, I&#39;m affraid going alone at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot confirm that this report was, in fact, submitted from Indonesia.

As it moved across the sky the stars disappeared yet when the stars reached the middle they reappeared, giving the suspicion of it being a formation of three crafts together.  It may have well been just one craft with some sort of missing center.  Also, there were airplanes around it, or in its &#34;vicinity&#34;.  It suddenly stopped and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was about ten thirty when I went outside and saw what looked like a silent fireworks show. 4 white, triangle shaped objects were seen flying LOW over my house. Shortly after that, 4 more of these objects flew past high overhead. We felt the wind off the first four but heard absolutely nothing. Sort of like a zone of silence. One of my friends fell ill later but that is of little relevance. My radio also went haywire.<n>

I looked up through the windshield but didn&#39;t see anything and just absently thought, well, thats a reflection, but realized that there was nothing I&#39;d seen that there could be a reflection from, so I looked upwards  through the windshield again, and was jolted by what I saw.  It was a very large, low flying object.  The ligts on the front of the object looked like large windows.  My companion had put his head outside the window and asked if I was seeing what he was seeing.  He was driving, and almost ran off the road, so he told me to look through the rear window to see if I could see it.  I saw it seeming to follow the side of the highway, then veered off, crossing the highway and was out of sight, over an area of dense trees.  My companion had seen the lights  approaching us while driving, but thought they were stationary.  I did not see them until the craft was overhead.  When he put his head out the window, he was looking up underneath it, and  saw the triangular outline of it, with very soft solid lights, but the flashing light(s) were on top of the object. I did not see the lights on top, or the triangular shape of the object from the front view.  It was a low, slow-moving object, and despite its size, there was no sound coming from it whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

They appeared to be flying at approx. 7-10,000 feet and rising at a steady rate. The larger aircraft looked to be the size and shape of a Boeing 747 (not military). The smaller aircraft which was just above and slightly forward of the larger (jet?) had the same approx. shape but was smaller by about 50%.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them cross the sky together, so we know it wasn&#39;t the case of two jets with one more distant on the same trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was unusual besides their close proximity, was that both objects were all white with no apparent markings, no sound (if they were regular jets we definately should have heard something) and no exhaust trails! It was quite a site. Very strange....<n>

I watched it for about three minutes until we rode about 10 seconds down the rode and I looked back and it was gone.  It was also shiny mettalic like.  I know this was not a bird because of the point and it was not  a hot-air balloon or helicopter or airplane etc.... It was not a balloon because it was only 60feet above the forest and there was not a place to take off in a balloon there, (Plus it was hovering so how do you explain that??). Please tell me what you think it is, or if you have gotten any reports with a craft like mine.<n>

This object was difficult to identify because it was either very small or far away. The object gradually ascended and disappeared in the clouds.  The object appeared to be moving from the Southeast towards the Northwest.  It had the shape of a kite, but I thought it unusual to be flying kites in this area because our office is located in one of the main approaches to Sea-Tac airport.  I do not think the object was a balloon although it did gradually ascend in a smooth motion.

I witnessed one very large oval shaped sphere with what appeared to be a small triangular tail wing on the back and a small dark oval shape on the surface. The object was floating slowly from behind one cloud into another, and although it was overcast I could see a bit of the sun shining on this creme/white frosty surface. It seemed too big and round to be a blimp,I knew right away that it was something I&#39;ve never seen before, it made no sound. Can someone tell me if what I saw sounds like an experimental craft that maybe NASA or Boeing is working on? Before I could think about pulling over to really look at this thing, it disappeared into a cloud and was gone..<n>

They were very bright, and hovered in the general area for about a minute, then one of them stoped glowing for a split second and when it apeared again it was a great distance above the other one, perhaps several hundred feet.  The problem is it changed locations so fast that I can not believe it was man made. And it was a sperical ball of light, not resembling spot lights at all.  I was so amazed that i pulled over my jeep and got out to gaze at them hovering over the ottawa river, then without any sound they disapeared like they had stoped glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means midnight of May 29, 2002.

Suddenly all the lights went out.   A power outage.   I quickly decided &#34;time for bed!&#34;  So I went through my new custom of walking throughout the first floor rooms, closing the windows before retiring upstairs to the master bedroom.  Only this time, it was pitch dark.   As I went to the little rear left bedroom, I went to the open window which faced east and watched as the whole area was without lights.   I could see the large light standards near the high school about 1.5 miles away which were the only operating lights that I could see.  I could hear an occasional vehicle go by on Volcano Highway three blocks to my left (Northwest).   I stood there enjoying the wonderful, sultry trade winds blowing directly into my window on this beautiful, mostly clear evening.  The moon had risen to my right (Southeast) Suddenly, slightly to the left (North) I saw a sphere of blue-white light coming in this general direction.   I figured it was a helicopter with a searchlight coming to investigate the power outage situation...maybe to locate a transformer out of commission.   But I have seen MANY helicopters with searchlights, having lived in Pasadena, CA, where the police use them nightly; and in New York City, which has more choppers than any city in the world.   They have a definite beam of light (this didn&#39;t) and, of course, helicopters make lots of noise (this was totally silent).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could still hear the traffic go by on Volcano Highway and this object was &#34;hugging the treeline&#34; as it made somewhat acrobatic moves and an &#34;S-turn&#34; or two.   As I looked at it, I figured that it was no more than 1/4 mile from me and the light source had three distinct &#34;spike-like&#34; beams emanating from it.   Almost like an astronomical image with a diffraction pattern.  One beam went straight up (0 degrees), another to the lower right (120 degrees) and another to the lower left (240 degrees).   As it kept moving, I was aware that I would shortly lose sight of it as it passed behind the outcroppings of my neighbors&#39; properties across and down the street.  So I ran upstairs where I should get a longer view of it.   It took perhaps 6-7 seconds to get upstairs, but alas, it was gone.  I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was anxious to see an explanation of the power outage.   In the Hilo Tribune-Herald of two days&#39; hence there was an article.   At 11:30PM a blown transformer caused a power outage in Kurtistown, Mountain View, Keaau, and the Kawailani section of Hilo.   The Kawailani section of Hilo had its power restored at 11:41PM (which is right after I saw it) and the other areas (including mine) had their power restored around 12:45AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked for anomalous objects all of my life, and this is the first one that I have seen fairly close by that I really could not explain.  I possess a degree in Astronomy from Caltech.<n>

Education-BA Liberal Studies and an MA in Educ Avid back yard astronmer and ufologist for over 15 years.  This report details the sighting of 3 anomalous objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date of report: 6/1/02 Preliminary information: On May 29, at 10:32PM (three days ago), I was at roughly the 6800ft elevation in the California mountains up along highway 108 in California, north of Yosemite past the Dardanelles, near a resort called Kennedy meadows.  We were staying at a private cabin and I was using a 4&#34; refractor telescope and binoculars to view the crystal clear, high country night sky.  It was moderately cool with no haze or weather -- a great night for viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were only two of us.  As we spotted a number of clusters, a couple of distant galaxies and nebula, we also concentrated on counting satellites that silently trekked across the sky.  We also spotted what ostensibly was a military craft flying quite a bit higher than the commercial planes that occasionally went by.  I figured it was military because it flew like a plane but did not display the standard red and green wing tip lights.  this presumed military craft had a single white strobe that blinked about once only every five seconds.  Satellites are uniquely different from other objects in the sky.  They are distinctive since they are small spots of light, obviously very high, even beyond the high-flying military craft and soundless. Satellites also move quickly across the sky and should appear to move more slowly since they are further away, yet due to their high speed, they are still noticeably faster -- orbital velocity is roughly 17,500 mph.  Not all satellites however travel at the same speed -- some seem to be faster than others but this may be attributable to the altitude of their individual orbit -- some are further out into space than others and apparent speed becomes difficult to discern.  They also often change their light intensity since they are so high, reflecting sunlight that shines from far over the horizon.  If they are spinning, they will seem to slowly flicker as their surfaces reflect light in different directions, or their trajectory might not be conducive to good reflectivity of sunlight.  To the best of my knowledge, satellites don&#39;t emit much light of their own; this is something I need to confirm with someone who knows.  The altitudes and trajectories of satellites vary greatly, yet they all share the same features of being small, fast moving, silent points of light, well beyond the altitude of other craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting details: After spotting over 12 satellites, most travelling in a north to south or south to north orbit, I spotted another.  It was noticeably bright white, more so than most of the other satellites but I didn&#39;t think it unusual since it had virtually all  the features of satellites previously described, with a few exceptions.  I would rate its brightness to be roughly between a magnitude of 3 to 4 (using star magnitude rating). To compare it with something familiar, it was about as bright as the star Orion, (even though I don&#39;t know Orion&#39;s specific magnitude rating).  I noticed the object&#39;s intensity was constant and I thought &#34;this is a good one&#34;, since often times satellites can fade quickly or come in and out of view based upon their reflective properties and surface features.  Again, it was in the same area of the sky that we had spotted many others and nothing seemed odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, within about two seconds of spotting it I saw two more flying behind it adjacent to one another.  They were all the exact same intensity and the three formed a perfectly symmetrical triangle.  Their exact position to one another could not be determined due to their distance from me and the effects of parallax, but I quickly went to my scope and was able to spot the lead light.  I was using a high quality 19mm eyepiece that provides about 50x magnification with my scope.  I tracked it briefly then held the scope still.  The following two lights flew right through my field of view.  They were all shaped identical, somewhat like orbs with a slight teardrop shape to them.  I wouldn&#39;t call them disks though.  I wasn&#39;t getting any significant resolution to determine specific details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their speed was faster than some of the slow satellites we saw earlier in the evening and slower than fast ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting seemed to last about 4 minutes -- longer than usual satellite sightings.  I did have enough time to repeatedly track them using just my eyes, the binoculars (regular 7x35), and my 4&#34; telescope.  My companion also saw the objects both through the binoculars, and with his bare eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation was perfectly symmetrical in that, they moved as one unit, in the shape of a triangle, however it is important to note that the space between them did not occlude stars behind them as a solid object would do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Therefore, it can be inferred that they were three distinctly separate lights moving together as one, hence, flying in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amount of sky occupied by this formation can be described as such: Hold your arm out at length, close your fist and hold up your thumb (as if you were giving a &#34;thumbs-up&#34; to someone).  Place the lead light on the tip of your thumb and the trailing lights at the base of your thumb and separate the trailing lights by the width of your thumb -- this forms the size and the triangle of their formation.  At the apparent distance of these objects, this would constitute a formation that was considerably wide apart, yet they maintained perfect symmetry from one another and continued that way with the same heading (north to south in this case) throughout the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they finally moved low enough to the horizon, they became occluded by trees, however it is important to note that they maintained their intensity of white light throughout the entire sighting. The area of the horizon into which they disappeared, was a region that no satellites were spotted.  Every other satellite heading south disappeared long before this area due to lack of direct line of sight with the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we speculated about that which we had seen, we continued to watch for a few more hours until about 3:30am.  We were particularly vigilant for the next 90 minutes after the initial sighting since, if they were satellites, we might have caught a second glimpse and dismissed the event as ordinary satellites -- (they should have reappeared as they orbited the planet once again) -- however, they never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are there any &#34;ordinary&#34; satellites that have been placed into a synchronous orbit with one another, so as to move in perfect formation through their orbits? No other unusual lights were seen throughout the rest of the evening or the next night of viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End of Report<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was watching what are suspected to be N.O.S.S. satellites, which we believe are launched periodically by the U.

You certainly are a very good witness, and you have reported the event excellent well, I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My suspicion is that you may have witnessed the U. S. Navy&#39;s N.O.S.S. satellite trio, which has been reported to our Center since approximately July 1996.  Although the Navy will not talk about them, they were first investigated by Dr. Terence Dickerson, an astronomer (I believe), who writes for the Toronto Star.  He had received many reports of three &#34;satellites,&#34; which appeared to maintain formation over the course of several weeks&#39; time, and which exhibited characteristics of typical man-made satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are many such reports of the phenomenon, which can be seen on our website.  Interestingly, most of the reports seem to be from the summer months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We will post your report in the near future.  Thanks again for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> May I forward your report to another investigator, Linda Howe, who has been interested in the phenomenon??<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> Thank you for your swift reply.  I knew the sighting was odd, but could not say for certain that they were not satellites.  Thank you for clarifying; it sounds that they may indeed have been the N.O.S.S trio of which you wrote. I would like to know more about them; the mysteries seem to be unending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that the lead light of this trio had a small protrusion of red light pointing downward towards the horizon.  It was constant, in that it was not flickering, flashing nor did it have any strobe-like modulation in any way, and had no visible means of connection to the main sphere.  However, at such a great distance, I doubt any support structure could be seen, even through my telescope.  I intentionally omitted this aspect from the report since I only caught a brief glimpse of this feature and could not described it with any accuracy other than what I just mentioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, you may use my report and/or forward it to Linda Howe -- I am quite familiar with her fine work.  You may also include my contact information thereby allowing her to contact me if she deems necessary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You are an exceptional and dedicated Ufologist and I have had the pleasure of listening to many of your contributions to the Jeff Rense program.  I wish you continued success, and you can be assured I will be listening in the future as I have been for so long.  If I have the fortune to see anything of interest in the future you&#39;ll be the first I contact.  After 15 years of studying the subject and scouring the skies as an amateur astronomer, this recent event is the first legitimate anomalous sighting I&#39;ve ever had.  Hopefully, we&#39;ll have good reason to speak again sometime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> best regards,<n> <n><n> sincerely,<n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

There was no sound what so ever coming from it. My brother told me if i could see the stars between the lights, I seem too be able to see the stars but it seem blurry when viewing the light between the three point of lights on each corner point. as it moved forward i can tell that the lights on the back (two on back one in front)were close together , to form a narrow type of triangle, not a true pyramid shape.  It disappear, not like vanish but like it went behind something. Like the front of the triangle disappeared first and then the rest followed, like it went into a hole in space slowly passing into it. Then after it was gone we saw another slow moving single light follow it and disappeared in the same spot in the sky. Shortly after that we saw anther light, orange in color, it seem to move erratic, like it was flapping, with wings we watch that disappear in another place in the sky, not like it went out of site it just seem to fade away... I do not know if it was related to what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was watching what are suspected to be N.O.S.S. satellites, which we believe are launched periodically by the U.

If not careful, it could be confused with a satellite but the difference is that this object zig zaged and did not have a constant speed.  It moved from side to side too and sped up sometimes.  It would slow down and then increase speed all of a suden and then slow down again.  A similar object was seen about an hour and ten minutes later that behaved similar to the first object seen.  It was indeed an extraordinary sighting.<n>

Last night, the 30th, I was talking and looking at the stars with my girlfriend.  All of a sudden something caught the corner of my eye.  I stood up and saw 2 bright orange lights that appeared to be very big being very still in the sky.  Three seconds later they fade out.  Another three secs and 3 lights appeared west of the first set.  Then fading again..  We ran inside to tell her parents.  We came out and looked for about 15 minutes, then the same light caught my eye.  We stood up seeing 3 orange light fade away.  Then 2 seconds later *four* huge orange lights appear in a vertical line then the middle fades out, then the rest go.  I was scared ((deleted)).<n>

I went out and noticed a saucer shaped light, engulfed in gold light,hovering near mountains and over the city of Sedona. I tried to sound calm when I asked my wife to come out to look at this object. When she did, I asked her if &#34;this thing had been here the last few nights.&#34; She said &#34;no.&#34; It was then that I noticed red and blue lights beaming from underneath the object. At that point, I ran to get a camera. When I ran back, my wife told me that the object &#34;just blinked out of sight like someone turned off a light switch.&#34; The next day went on as usual, but the morning AFTER that, my wife and I woke up to five large military helicopters flying over our hotel room and heading right to the spot in which we saw the UFO a day and a half earlier.<n>

Brightness was equivalent to a evening star/planet and occurred in a 1 second flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching and this occurred again after maybe 3 seconds and it appeared the source had moved.  It happened again a third time, also a few seconds later.  I moved to the outside porch and watched intently in this area for another 10 minutes but saw nothing further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The impression was of some object emitting a powerful flash from a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with the flash from a rocket booster tumbling in orbit.  That is merely a guess, however.  PD))<n>

5/28/02 22:05|Strathmore/lLndsay|CA|Changing|2 minutes|Large Carft sighted in Strathmore/Lindsay Calif. in May 2002 with large panel lights.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43034.html|29|ndxe200205| Large Carft sighted in Strathmore/Lindsay Calif. in May 2002 with large panel lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of May 28th 2002, I was sitting outside stargazing and invited my girlfriend of the time to come outside and view the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat and watched the stars we noticed approx. 3 to 4  military jets going from porterville, ca. heading north when reaching hwy l98 and then returning to porterville and continuing this cirle at which time an aircraft like a C140 joined in this picket fence.  Id say they were about 5000 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for at least a half hour. We were between strathmore and lindsay calif. towards the foothills. At approx l0:05 pm we were gazing to the northeast when my girlfriend noticed exceptional large lights in the sky approx l/4 mile up the the air.  The craft flew within a 1/4 mile from us to the north and was approx still 1/4 mile off the ground.  The craft stopped directly north of us.  It stood still (hovering as some would say) but no movement.  No noise at all.  Again no movement from the ship with the exception, the large panel lights.  I assume the panel lights (rectangle) went all around the bottom of the ship but we observed 3 and l/2 of these.  The size of each panel light would be approx a little larger than a double wide mobile home.  These panels were strobing at a slow strobe.  Their were additional lights on this craft, but because of the exceptional purity of the lights i focused on the panel lights.  These were light red in color and stayed light red untill after a minute the craft started moveing towards the west.  At this time each panel started turning purple from the outside going inwards, towards its center. Again these were still at a slow strobe.  Since this purple didnt appear untill the ship started moving I can only say this must tie in with the flight system it uses.  Again the clarity of these lights would make normal light look dull or muddied.  As it moved to the west I ran to the road west of her house and ran north because of a tree blocking my view.  As it flew at a very slow rate of speed  30mph? I was able to view it much clearer from the horizon of the west.  The craft was boomerang shape in front and as i looked from the ground to the ship about three times I would be able to say it was approx. 3 football fields long.  Very large.  When my girlfriend and I later compared our experience she said it was like a six sided cut ruby shape,  So i can only assume it changed shape, (perhaps the reason it sat still for the minute above us).  Although she was able to make out the shape when it was north of us I was not since she sees better than I.  I am sure of its shape as it flew west but only its front since it was at night l0:05 pm.  I can say that the dogs for miles around barked all nite as we retired at 4:30 in the morning were still barking.  This is in the country so one can hear quite a ways. I have since moved to Three Rivers, CA.  I have found two other witness&#39;s and they were with others.  They said that the center of the ship was clear and that they could make the stars out.  Either a force field, something like glass or clear plastic that one can see through.  I didnt observe this because of the ships position from us. Ive heard that others also seen this craft in our area but have not met these people.  I assume that the military did set up a picket fence to observe it, whether or not they saw it I cant say, since it was low to the ground and they were much higher up.  We did call Lamore Naval Air Station, and they stated they didnd have anytthing up at the time.  We also called National Institute of Discorvery science.  They called back the following morning wanting to know the pattern of the strobe.  That I couldnt give them.  I can only say that each panel strobed slowly and indepentantly of each other. Many people say they have seen a UFO. I can say I saw an Alien Space Ship.  Very close to us for such a large ship. I would be willing to take a lie detectors test.  I stand by what I saw and Im sure the others that ive met and saw it would do the same. Two additional facts to report towards this is that NASA was tracking a an object of unknown size and material that went a third of the ways between the earth and the moon that night and orbited back out to space.  Haveing no where else to log it, it is labled Asteroid 2002 KG4.  I couldnt say if it in any way was related to the craft I saw.  Additionally a friends fiance, spotted a small alien craft near woodlake at about the same time period near a reservoir in woodlake calif.  Again I stand by what i saw and was not intoxicated in any way.<n>

The light was a blue-white light, like a star or planet. There was no sound. I followed the light until it was obscured from view by trees. Compared to commercial aircraft that fly over my house, on a southeast to northwest track normally, this object appeared to fly about twice as fast. Also, there was no strobe activity, and it seemed to be lower in altitude than commercial aircraft that fly over. Approximately 10 minutes later, I observed a commercial aircraft on a northwest to southeast track, with strobes flashing. What appeared to be above, and on a perpendicular track, was a single light similar to the one I saw earlier, only not as bright. The dim light actually intersected the path of the commercial craft, but it seemed at a higher altitude. I also followed this light until it was obscured by trees.<n>

I noticed a cigar shaped silver metallic craft about 100 yards to the north, travelling south .  It was silent and seemed to float in the air eeirely.  It moved very slowly.  The craft was approximately 25 feet long and 10 feet high at its highest point (the middle of the craft).  It was symmetrical in shape, and in classic flying saucer shape.  It had no visible windows or markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was aluminum or bright siver in color.  It was approximately 500 yards off shore over the Pacific Ocen in Manhattan Beach.  Once it came to a point directly in front of me off the coast it began to wobble in a strange slow wobbling motion.  At that point I became alarmed with internal emotion and recognized it to be 100% conclusively a flying saucer or UFO.  I probably stopped beathing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an instant, the craft took off in a blur.  It became a pinpoint of orange-yellow light, similar to a minature sun.  It seemed to be imprinted as this light in the far distant horizon.  the duration of this fixed pinpoint of light was approximayely 10 seconds.  It then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later, shaken up and returning to my towel I noticed a whilpool of water about the same distace (500 yard off the coast) but probably just caused by the wind and tidal conditions.  A clouy haze moved into the horizon.  The sky had been crystal clear previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the incident to the nearest lifeguard.  I stopped at Los Angeles Air Force Base on the way home and the security guard told me to file the report on the internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a Bible believing and God fearing Christian swear this to be true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO before today.<n>

(THERE WAS NO DRINKING AT THE PARTY... EVERYONE WAS SOBER)  There was a light wind, but not too strong.  We were sitting on the hood of my car, Nick&#39;s girfriend just went inside.  We wern&#39;t looking up but we noticed something.  We got really quiet.  There was literally no sound what-so-ever.  The dogs, horses, and all other stuff was utterly quiet.  What we saw were three lights.  It came in from the north and made no sound at all.  it flew directly south... STRAIGHT SOUTH!!!  It moved extremely slow.  it made a hard right turn and it was at this time that it broke the speed it had moved at the whole time.  It moved faster, but not real fast.  We watched it go toward the horzion until we couln&#39;t tell the difference between it and the stars.  When it passed overhead, it was low enough that the lights from the garage seemed to reflect off of it.  Literally, it seemed to be only a few hundred feet off the ground.  I have to say, it made NO SOUND AT ALL.  Until it turned, it never broke speed.  In turning, it didn&#39;t actually turn.  but just changed directions.  It was unmistakably a triangle.  CLEARLY TRIANGULAR.  See, in wichita there is an Air Force Base (McConnell AFB)  Nick and I both talked about it for a while.  We both thought when it flew overhead that it was a B2 Bomber, but IT MADE NO SOUND and when it turned, we knew it wasn&#39;t a bomber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had noticed an object moveing in a northly direction which I could not identify. I then brought it to the attention of my neighbors the object then appeared to become stationary it held it&#39;s position for several minutes. At this point my neighbor went and got her binoculars at this point we were able to see some detail of the object it appeard to have 3 very bright red/orange lights on it that were in a triangle formation. I then got my camcorder and began videoing the object I recorded about a minute and a half of this object I could not see much detail with the camcorder the object appears as a small white object on video. There is one interresting point on the video where the object simply dissapears and then reappears in a different area of the sky. I have good footage of it dissapearing but not reappearing as I could not focus on it after it dissapeard from my screen but it could still be seen with the naked eye for another few minutes.

Before Moon came up behind hills, I looked to the East over Topa Topa Mtn. and saw a very bright object.  My first thought was that it was a craft just hanging still in the sky - the discussion at the moment with my partner was about life in the Universe, etc. and Hope for Mankind.  It was at that moment I saw spherical light that I think became momentarily brighter ( pulsed).  I told my partner &#34;Quick Look!&#34;.  He looked then, as it began to dim - more and more dimming as it moved out and up in oblique angle --- and then disappeared.  It felt special and significant to both of us and seemed to be carrying some consiousness(subjective impressions).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One possible explanation is the characteristic flash of an Iridium satellite.

Weather conditions were quite clear, beautiful stars and a nearly full moon just rising.  There was some humidity in the atmosphere that gave a slight halo to the moon, as well as to the object of interest soon to appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I took an evening walk, looking at the stars, waking east, with the moon just peaking through the silhouettes of trees ahead and to the right a few degrees.  We were discussing the large amount of water/ice just discovered on mars. I was just commenting about how the prospect of life on other planets would affect many people&#39;s religious beliefs and how it would shake up the world …when my girlfriend called out for me to look up …and said that she had just seen a big pulse of light! I looked and saw a very bright star or planet, brighter that any object in the sky with the exception of the moon.  It had a small visible halo, the only planet besides the moon that did, and was basically a very brilliant single white or yellow/white light.  There was no blinking or movement. At first I thought maybe this was the ISS reflecting or a possibly very large satellite. From the time I saw it, the light sat frozen in place for what seemed at least 5 seconds, then suddenly it began to move.  Its intensity began to dim quickly, the halo vanished, and then it then appeared more similar to a satellite in motion, except that it reduced in size very quickly, so quickly that in approximately than 5 seconds it was gone completely. To the eye it appeared to be going away very fast from the earth&#39;s surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Specifically, I was facing east and the object was positioned overhead and forward some, maybe 10 degrees East from directly overhead and slightly to my left or North, surrounded by a group of stationary stars. It moved diagonally toward my right and forward or in a generally southeast direction slightly, and at the same time outward very fast. It was positioned near a small cluster of stars, maybe three or four fairly bright ones, but none comparing to it in intensity.  They were my reference for the object&#39;s motion. The total length of its movement in the horizontal plane appeared to be less than 10 degrees while the movement outward appeared infinite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: My girlfriend previously submitted a report to you which I have not seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station passed over Ojai, CA, at 21:17 hrs. on this date.

A train was directly East of us and we had been watching it for a number of minutes because between the almost full moon above it-it was quite beautiful-and not much else to look at in the Arizona desert at night on a long drive. The reason it probably caught our attention was because it was so very very strange and large-larger then the moon is size in the sky.  But what was so incomprehensible is that it appeared like someone or something had simply ripped open a whole in the dark sky leaving a huge opaque white diamond shape, then in just a few seconds-just enough to comprehend somewhat what we were looking at-it slowly but perfectly evenly from the top down disappeared!  It did not fade out-nor just &#34;turn off it&#39;s light-because it didn&#39;t glow, but more like something rolling back up perfectly.  I did not write this report before-because it didn&#39;t appear to be a flying saucer or anything of the more common UFO shapes, and didn&#39;t know if it would fit here.  It had perfectly straight edges-no variance in color or intensity of color and only white.It also did not appear to be 3-D. I have traveled the Arizona roads at night probably about 50 times at least and never seen anything like this.  It was so incredible a thing to see-it&#39;s easier to understand the flight of unknown objects-then wrap your mind around the sky doing something like that!<n>

I didnt believe him at first, I just told him that it was a blimp, but he kept on bugging me.  Finnaly he i just pulled over the car because he was bugging me so much about this weird thing in the sky.  As soon as i looked at this object carefully i soon found out it wasnt a blimp.  It was too fast to be anything other then a UFO.  The flying saucer with bright lights then circled around us about 3 times.  The saucer was about 400 feet up in the air.  Then all of a sudden the object vanished.  I am telling you the truth about this sighting i have never seen anything like this ever in my life, it was really spooky to see this for the first time.  Now i am a definite believer of life in the universe.<n>

The light became brighter and an orange light shoine from the object then.  The object continued to move forward and back, then in tiny little loops.  We then questioned if it could be a falling airplane, but it&#39;s height did not change much.  This continued for sometime, and then an actual airplane flew by, far below the object.  The object then became still and did not move for ten minutes.  WE then left the area---confused but assured it was not a plane, and far too high for a helicopter.<n>

It flew under two commercial airliners, so I am approximating its altitude at 10000 feet.  If it was at this altitude, I would make an estimate that it was 40-50 feet long.  It was white and the shape was like a tylenol caplet. It had no wings, markings, vapor trail, windows, doors, or anything.  The whole event lasted a couple of minutes.  I called another family member out of the house to see it, and they saw the same thing I did.  I have seen these craft flying before.  Once back in 1994 about 10 miles NE of Binghamton, NY, I saw a similar craft.  I watched as an F-16 went chasing after it at about 15000 feet.  It went hiding in a few clouds, and was just toying with the jet. I was the only person in a parking lot at the time to witness that one.  It was a Fall day, about 4 PM.  I hope that this helps.  Also during both sitings, the objects made no noise.<n>

Within about thirty seconds, what were initially long streaks of light coalesced into three very distinct orbs of varying color.  They shifted from red, to a blinding yellowish/white, to a cool blue.  It did not come very close to the ground, nor did it make any very sharp movements or sound, but it was definitely moving; it plotted large concentric circles over an approximate area of 1 square mile.

The object was flying southward down the valley above state highway 26 from I-70 toward the town of Morrison.  The object was glossy red on top and black underneath, about three feet long &amp; two feet high.  In shape and color it looked vaguely like a giant ladybug flying without it&#39;s wings.  The object was roughly at eye-level when observed from the hiking trail on Dakota Ridge, flying about 150-200 feet above the valley floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was silent and flew at a constant speed of roughly 30MPH, perfectly straight and perfectly level, covering a distance of more than a mile while observed.  Despite erratic breezes, the object moved in an absolutely rock-steady manner with no shifting around or any changes in speed, direction or altitude.   Although breezes were generally blowing in the same direction that the object was moving, the wind&#39;s direction was erratic and it&#39;s intensity was inconstant during observation.  The object seemed to be moving at a speed and in a manner that the ambient wind conditions would not have allowed if it were free-floating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression upon seeing the object after my companion pointed it out was that it was a small flying device of some kind.

She viewed the object over the bonfire and was watching it move over the main stage area when I arrived.  I watched with her as it moved over the fairgrounds.  It headed out towards the hills and I assumed it would vanish over the hill, but it actually went into the hill, thats when I determined it had been traveling very close to the earth and was pretty small.  It floated over the treetops on the hill for a moment then decended in to the wood.  The glow of the craft remained, on the ground for a moment then went off.

The vapor trail just turned into clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness observed a normal contrail behind a high-altitude jet.  PD))<n>

Celestial objects in the western sky, where several planets currently are located in the early evening, do not &#34;rise.&#34;   If, in fact, and object moved from the western sky to the eastern sky over the course of an hour, it is not a celestial body or satellite.  However, we suspect that the witnesses may have mistaken stars rising from the eastern horizon for the planets which had set to the west.  PD))<n>

It moved very slowly toward me from the south almost directly above,  moved to east a little then away from me toward the south east.  It was blinking the whole time in irregular pulses, at times I could not see it till it shimered/ pulsed.  I got my small pair of binoculars out and it looked somewhat incondecent, with difrent colors the way oil on the wat pavement looks. i could not dissurne a specific shape, something like a ball but it was very small and I could only see it when it was pulsing lite. it went behind a tree from my point of view so i came to report it in hopes someone else can take a look if they are in the area.

5/24/02 05:50|Oregon City|OR|Rectangle|10+ minutes|Bright, non-circular object hovers far above Oregon City OR at dawn, 2002/05/24|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23010.html|58|ndxe200205| Bright, non-circular object hovers far above Oregon City OR at dawn, 2002/05/24<n> <n><n> <n><n> After carrying trash out for pickup, I started watching a jet passing S-N nearly overhead, a little to the east. Dawn was imminent and the sky was bright and clear with an intermittent light high cloudiness. The jet was in sunlight, I was not. I was noticing the contrail was made by four engines (wing-mounted), a little more unusual to see these days. So, probably a large airliner or military transport. As I was working this out, I noticed a steady bright spot just east of the contrail, approximately due east of me. Only Venus or maybe Jupiter would shine so brightly, but this was roughly 40 degrees above the horizon and perhaps just a tad larger than Venus at its best. Besides, it&#39;s been all over the media that all the bright planets are currently grouped in the west just after sunset. I noticed the object did not seem to move, so it wasn&#39;t an airplane or satellite (Later I checked with the Starry Night planetarium program, and no bright planets or stars were in that part of the sky. Any satellites that showed up in the program were moving much too fast.) I noticed the contrail was drifting eastward, toward the object, which appeared stationary. I ran in and grabbed a pair of 20x50 binoculars. By the time I returned, just a few minutes (3?) had passed but the contrail was now east of the object, drifting and spreading. I had the impression the object was much higher altitude than the contrail, but did not witness the one cross the other. The object had not moved. If it were moving as a star or planet, it would not have moved far enough in the short time to be noticeable, however. I leaned against my car to help steady the binocular image. Focus was consistent with a very distant object. It was still small, but not a point source, and appeared to be somewhat rectangular, or possibly a cylinder if it were oriented roughly NW-SE and pointed down about 60 degrees toward the northwest. It was bright white, I assumed by reflection of the coming Sun, but there were two much brighter round spots on the north, lower-facing side. These were so bright they must have been bright lights or direct specular reflections of the Sun. The light was not colored, appearing white. I watched it for a total time of at least ten minutes, during which time I did not perceive any motion, neither gross translation nor wobble nor spin. Angular size was very small, perhaps 5 arcminutes. I returned about an hour later, after the Sun had risen, but between the bright sky and a slight overcast, was unable to reacquire the object. If I had to guess, I&#39;d say the jet I saw was roughly 20,000 feet altitude (did not appear to be on approach to PDX, of which I see plenty), the high thin cloud layer at roughly 25,000, and the object high above the clouds at 45,000 feet (which would make a 5 arcminute object around 65 feet long). Surface winds were still, but according to the weather service winds flowed west to east at 40 knots up at 37,000 feet, slower at lower levels (surface calm, 5,000&#39; &lt; 10 knots; 10,000&#39; 10-20 knots, all W to E). Witness is a licensed pilot, amateur astronomer and space educator, familiar with most things in the sky.<n>

They would come together and meet in the middle continually moving and then branch out as if pushing away from one another. They stayed a certain distance from eachother as if coming from four corners of a diamond. I was talking at the time to a friend in the same building. I asked him to hang up and come up to see. He observed the movement for over five minutes. I then reported this to the police. A car was immediately sent out and it patroled right under where the lights were spinning. The lights then went out. The lights appeared to be over the clouds and not circular, they were a bit like large feathers, wide and flat looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing an advertising light, which was based on laser projection.

I was sitting up front in our motorhome, around midnight, and watching for the wild dogs said to be roaming at night.  As I looked on about 200 yards beyond me, I could see what, at first, looked like the lights of the ranger&#39;s truck, but them there seemed to be an entourage of vehicles going along quite fast.  I yelled for my husband to look and he was looking and we saw the pairs of lights in the entourage change to single and go up into the sky. They seemed to go directly upward, then dissappeared.   When leaving the park the next day, we could see that the area where the lights were , was a big field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been thinking about that ever since.  This was on the night of May 23rd, 2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you heard of any other sightings such as this? Thank you,<n>

My three year old son pointed to a military craft flying and leaving a vapor trail. I turned around and indeed saw the plane, but something else cought my attention. Flying in fron of this plane was something else. It was barely noticeble but it was there. It left no visible trail or disturbance. It was traveling at a nuch higher altitude (I assume) and at a much greater speed. I saw it outdistancing the military jet. Both were flying in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we competed our shopping, we left the store and proceeded south on Rt 130 to the local Wendes. Halfway there my 11 year old daughter and I saw two football shaped objects, flying at a high rate of speed in an easterly direction. There were no markings, engines, lights and windows on both objects. They were flying in very close to each other. It appeared that it was less than the actual lenght of the craft. This event lasted about 30 seconds.<n>

I wanted to request further information.  I really am curious to see if anyone else has reported anything similar to what I saw.  I&#39;m not convinced it was a craft but for the fact that the light couldn&#39;t have been traveling through the cloud from the ground, I would have seen the light path as it passed through.  Secondly the circular clound surrounding the event and the chill as well as the silence and then the sudden disappearance (though I didn&#39;t witness it leave) convince me that this was more than just an average light or cloud.  If not a UFO what else could it have been?  I was being facetious about the alien contact comment.  It was late and I was rather ashamed of myself for getting so scared.  I&#39;ve looked through numerous entries on you site and others and haven&#39;t found anything quite like it.  And though I distinctly remember reading something about UFO&#39;s hiding in circular clouds I cannot find anything confirming this.  There are numerous UFO sightings in the Tacoma/Lakewood area.  One night several years ago my daughter, a ffriend and I saw lights streaking across the sky betweem Tacoma and Puyallup, then they hovered and took off again, we all agreed it could not have been a plane and that was confirmed when we listened to the rradio, numerous people called the station and saw what we saw.  Interestingly even though we are near an airforce and army base there were no aircraft in pursuit.  We see planes all the time in this area, of all types.  This did not appear to be a plane.  So though a long time skeptic, I&#39;m becoming a believer.  Aliens?  I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;d love to find out.  As long as I knew I was safe that is.<n>
5/23/02 03:00|Tacoma|WA|Light|30+|Hovering light pattern under cloud cover in otherwise clear night sky|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23039.html|66|ndxe200205| Hovering light pattern under cloud cover in otherwise clear night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been up late working on an art project and stepped outside to shake off the clay dust that had accumulated.  The flashing light in tthe sky caught my eye, and at first I thought they were spotlights shining up from tbe ground as they do sometimes for movie premiers or grand openings.  I thought it was such a foolish thing to do at 3AM.  The more I watched the more interested I became.  At first I was attracted by the pattern the lights were making, then I realized the lights were not emenating from a completely stationary source, and at about the same time discerned that the beams were not in fact coming up from the ground.  I was sure of this as they were shining through the only cloud I could see in the sky.  the cloud itself was interesting in that it appeared to have a clear though pitch black center and was itself approximately circular shaped.  The lights themselves repeated a pattern; they would efveidently &#34;cluster&#34; (for lack of a better word) around a center slightly forward and to the left of the cloudless center and then would shine or fly outward in four or five different directions, evenly spaced apart, forming a circle.  If the spacing of the lights was any indication of an object behind the clouds, the thing would have been huge!  The more I observed the more certain I was that the beams of light were not seperate from an object, as individual light objects forming a pattern and flying independently, but were from a fixed point though I couldn&#39;t quite track a beam through the clouds.  That could be explained as lights shining down from the bottom of something moving along a &#34;track&#34; and going back to a center point.  I can&#39;t think of an analogy.  I bbecame aware tthat the lights were getting closer and that they could actually be coming from something quite low to the ground.  I got scared and went inside.  But I heard one of my neighbors come home and went out front to the parking lot and pointed the lights out to him.  We watched them for a few minutes and he said he had seen them! before, that they were a secret government project &#34;designed to make us look crazy&#34;., mind you he&#39;d been drinking, so I don&#39;t know what to make of his comment.  I looked up again and the lights had again shifted towards the side of the building that the parking lot is on and seemed to be coming closer.  I again went inside.  I was scared an excited and ddidn&#39;t know what to think.  The only thing I could hear when I was outside were crickets, absolutely nothing else until my neighbor&#39;s car pulled in.  I realized my cats were still outside and stepped out one more time, it was still there and this time started moving closer right away and was almost directly overhead.  That really shook me up.  I debated calling the police or the news but didn&#39;t want to sound like a nut.  I was afraid that by the time anyone offical checked it out it would be long gone, it had already been there for at least a half hour.  This time I went on my computer and instant mesaged a freind that had come on line and told her what I was seeing.  After 15 minutes I decided to look and see if it was still there.  It was gone, so was the cloud, and the night was suddenly warm whereas before it been decidely chilly even though the weather forecast had called for a relatively warm night (finally).  I seem to recall reading something about ufos creating clouds but couldn&#39;t find any descriptions that matched what I saw.  Especially the distinctive pattern of lights.  They were all white, no other colors.  So are there any logical explanations other than a UFO?  Are these the nice ones or the meanies?  Should I step out and greet them the next time?  If there is?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM SAME SOURCE, SUBMITTED JULY 27, 2002))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previous report and update plus one several years ago<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the sighting already on 5/28/2002.

It is fairly light out tonight so there are not many stars in the sky. I was heading north on the road towards my home, when I noticed a light out of the corner of my eye. I turned and watched it accelerate greatly towards the north. Then it stopped instantly and just hovered. This object may have been up to 10 miles away or so. I watched it and continued to my home (It still just hovered). Then I called a friend out of the house to look at it. She thought it was odd as well so she got the binoculars. We both took turns looking at it for about 5 minutes, then it suddenly disappeared then reappeared at a high altitude. Then in slowly dimmed out. It was oval in shape and was giving off a red/orange/yellow pulsing tone. There was also aircraft activity in the area and we compared what they looked like from a distance and could not get a match. Also I would like to note that I have seen several other objects and have a weird one on tape as well.<n>

As I got in my car and was driving away I noticed it follwing me.  I thought it was just my imagination fooling with me so I continued to drive on.  As I reached my house, which is in a rural rea, the light on the ship seemed to continously change color.  It went from green to yellow to blur then back to green.  I found this to be very odd so I called my sister outside.  She got out the binicolors and noticed that there was tiny little windows in this ship with something looking at her but she couldn&#39;t make t out for sure.  But as soon as we entered our house we heard a boomb.  We walked outside and say the ship fyling away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.

At first I thought it was a meteorite but noticed it left no trail from atmospheric friction. Looking at the object I saw two red lights beside each other with a white light above and between the two red lights. The object then levelled and headed north very quickly.

We live at the top of the interbay peninsula within Tampa Bay, of which at the foot is MacDill AFB. We regularly see airliners on approach to TIA, and tankers on approach to MacDill. This object was straight above the peninsula, heading West. At first it looked like a silver Mylar balloon, but to be that big, it would have to been very close. A balloon nearby is buffeted by air currents. This was flying in a straight line, at a steady pace. It did not have contrails. It looked like a one-foot wide Mylar balloon at 1,000 feet cruising at 100 mph. We are good at spotting different airliners, tankers, and other aircraft night and day. In the day you can see the silver cylinder of a jet. This was a wide round silver object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I could be more specific. It was only visible for a brief while, and at first was difficult to notice as my girlfriend was pointing it out. She saw it only because she was looking at the moon.

The interesting thing is, I was four minutes away from beginning my Internet chat with my class, ((deleted--pertains to astronomy and exobiology)). Yes, this class examines the nature of the Universe, the chemical, geologic, and biologic issues in searching for life. Also the means of communication, but we haven&#39;t gotten there yet.

Last night, May 21, at approximately 2:30 am I took a 15-minute break from guarding.  I usually just go down to the cafeteria and grab a cup of coffee but that night I noticed the hallway door had been open to the outside.  This was rather strange because the doors in the hallway were always kept shut to make sure no prisoners tried to escape.  The hallway was pitch black as I walked towards the door, and just as I went to grab my flashlight a bright beam came shining through the open door.  I rushed over to try to find the source of the light.  As I got to the doorway I looked up to the sky and I noticed a large craft hovering above me.  My breath was taken away instantly and a rush of fear came over me. I tried to call for the other guards to come and check out the scene but no words would come from my mouth.  I was speechless.  The large craft swayed back and forth through the air, still with its light beam shining bright.  There were no windows on the craft so I could not see any activity inside.  As the thought came to me to run and grab a video camera, my feet grew heavy and unmovable.  I just stood there, stunned, for a good 5 minutes until the bright light turned dull and the craft shot straight up into the air and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never in my life have I experimented with hallucinogens or any other drugs.  I had not been drinking alcohol the night of May 21 and I was not the slightest bit drowsy.  The chances of sightings like this may be one in a million, but I firmly believe now that there are other life forms out there.<n>

I am certain of what I have seen, and the only reason I am willing to share this information lies within my hopes of finding someone in my area who may have seen it, and for the further research of UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1:45 in the morning I was out on my porch finishing a personal conversation with a friend. As she went inside to get ready to go to sleep, I thought I saw something flash by in the sky, but disregarded it as a result of my being tired. No more than one minute later I was proved wrong. I saw something (what I took to be an odd airplane, which isn’t uncommon with the navy base close by) flying through the air, in the direction of the base. What I am about to tell you I do not expect most to believe, as I would not had it not happened to me. I believe that I was taken onboard their UFO. My memories of it are very vague. I cannot tell you how I was taken onboard, but I can tell you how it looked. The UFO appeared to be circular, but as it got closer to my location, and slowed down to a hover, I could see that it was a triangular shape, and was given its round appearance because it was rotating so fast.  I remember only a few things. I was on a table, but not by force, I felt like I had the option of being there. For various reasons I believe that I was being examined, but only to be released due to their dissatisfaction. To be honest I think they were looking for a female. The next thing I know I was sitting on the step of my porch. If none of the above is true after all, I do not know how I got there, because I am certain that I do not get up and walk over. I also cannot account for 30 minutes of that evening , the same amount of time my friend was in the shower. The thing that made me believe for certain is her description of what she saw dart off right as she was coming outside. Her description was identical to mine, only I had not given mine to her yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You must know that I do not, and have not ever taken ant illegal drugs, and that I am not currently on any medication that would alter my own judgment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.

It was May 20, 2002 and it was a dark night. When I went out to put the trash out I spotted lights flashing across the sky like the search lights that you sometimes see for airplane landings. These did not look like searching lights but I ignored them and went back to doing my job because I was getting off early. A while later I was pulling out of my job and I saw the lights again. They were flashing now up on the hills of Ventura up by the two trees. I drove closer but all I could see were the bright green lights. Then I heard a huge noise like a door was slamming but not a regular door, like a metal door. After the loud noise the lights disappeared and there was wind surfacing my car. Since I had the windows down it blew throughout my car and then everything stopped like nothing had happened. I am reporting this as a UFO sighting because I don’t know what else it could be. I could barley make out what it was but it looked to resemble a cone shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.

I was looking up and I swore I saw (what I thought was a typically star), moving left and right just enough to notice it. It wasn&#39;t flashing like stars do, it was solid.  And as far as I knew only planets did that.  So I thought it was a planet, but something seemed to make me second guess it.  I leveled my hand with it vertically to a nearby star.  The object went in and out of view from behind my hand.  I started to ask them (my friends) if they saw it as well, and one of my friends said and I&#39;m quoting &#34;Do you see that star?  It&#39;s F***ing moving man!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching it go back and forth for several minutes.  I saw a &#34;satelite&#34; and pointed it out.  It was going in the direction of the object, off at 30 degree or so.  It continued until it passed the object on the left side.  It started to go around in a large circle until it was on level with the object, and TURNED  45 degrees heading directly at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all watching it with anticipation of what was happening and freaked out.  What happened next is what got us.  It hit on the right side and a flash or spark went shotting out the left side at about 3 times the speed.  When it hit we all said some exclamations.

I made myself some spagetti, and watched the tonight show for a little while.  I was not very tired because I had alot of coffee after work, and caffine keeps me up, and since I had the next day off, I didn&#39;t see any rush to get to bed.  I was just about to head to bed at about 1:30 when I took my cocker spaniel outside to use the bathroom before she went to sleep for the night.  As I go outside, I was looking upp at the sky because the stars are very visable from my house, especially at that time of night.  I saw what seemed to be a round object moving fairly slowly around the sky.  It had bright lights, was definetly brighter than any star or planet.  My dog saw it also, as she started to bark.  I noticed blue and red lights on it as well.  As it was hovering pretty far up, it moved in circles, not straight like an airplane or satalite would, changing directions frequently.  I was amazed and immediatly ran inside to get my husband.  When he came out, at first we couldn&#39;t see it, but after another minute or so, it appeared again, and did the same thing, circling around.  We watched it for another five or so minutes, and then it was no where to be found again.  I am sure this was no airplane or anything else of that nature.  It did not make any sound (that which we could hear at least) and did not look like anything I had ever seen.  I did not believe in UFOs until this night, but you can bet I know what I saw, and I believe in them now!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.

It didn&#39;t make a sound.  It was circular, but I couldn&#39;t tell from the angle if it was completely circular or a disc.  My guess is that it was a disc.  It was silver, almost like a stainless steel color.  I followed it with my eyes till it reached the horizon, heading north.  Then the sunlight reflected off of it, giving the object a bright gleem.  After that it was too far for my eyes to see. My friend and I were conversating at the time.  We both shut up as soon as we saw it and didn&#39;t say a word until the object was long gone.  Interestingly enough, just two days before we saw the object, I saw, along with a group of other people, two A-10 Thunderbolts circling the area.  I&#39;ve never seen A-10&#39;s in that area.  The field in which the sighting occured is next to a heavily wooded area, known as the Savannah Preserves.  There isn&#39;t anything out there but, wild life.  Still, the preserves aren&#39;t that large and the object had to have passed civil areas as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My two friends, who wish to remain anonymous, were with me and we decided to ivenstigate from a closer distance. When we pulled into the gravel parking lot of Padre Serra Church, the object slowly descended out of site behind the mountains. Before it descended out of site, from this distance, we could tell that the surface of the object had a distinct liquid-like texture resembling a ball of water in zero gravity. From where, I assume, the object had landed past the horizon; there was a short but distinct flash of light which momentarily lit the surrounding area to the point of daylight. When this happened, the headlights of my car instantly died followed by a sputtering motor about three seconds later. When I checked my cellular phone I found that it was also dead. I saw, what I assumed to be, the same spherical object rise above the horizon again. This time, at a terrific speed, the object approached us and halted directly above the car. My car was about and eighth the size of the sphere. It&#39;s surface was definitely liquid though we could not see what was inside due to the silvery reflection of the surface. My friends and I panicked and tried to run from the car in different directions at which point the object descended with the same terrific speed, encompassing the entire vehicle as well as us. At that instant, there was another flash and the cold feeling of the liquid on my skin was gone. Neither my friends nor I knew what happened but when we checked, we found that we could not account for a twenty-four hour period of time. Although we pleged to keep it a secret, I believed it important to inform someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.

I glanced up to try and figure out what it was and it was a teardrop shaped object that was a bright green color, one of the ends was a pinkish, and it sent off green beams. There was like haze around it also. My friend and I saw this, and tried to go run inside to show our other friends, but by the time we went back outside it was gone. It was no where in sight and we stayed outside for a while after that just in case it were to reappear. It was flying real slow and kinda high. We saw this for five minutes.

I looked up to the sky to see if the clouds were forming or if an on-shore flow would produce fog for the night. I noted the weather was clear and the moon was one-quarter full and at a 30 degree arc from straight up. It was during my weather evaluation that the UFO or UFOs came into view. Their movement was rapid, and were only in sight for about 5 seconds. They moved across the sky at an 85 degree arc in less than 5 seconds. There were at least 7 lighted objects, blue in front and mostly red in back, but they did not have a tail like a shooting star. They came side-by-side and their formation was straight. They flew past me and then ascended rapidly upwards to the point where I could no longer see them. I realized these were not military aircraft of any kind, and this discovery was quite startling to me. I was listening for a sonic boom as they passed, but it did not happen so I went inside the house and called 911 who stated to call the UFO Center.<n>

There is a nearby house closer to the base of the mountain, approximately a quarter mile from my mother&#39;s home. Other than that, the nearest house is about one mile away. The only access to this area is via one road, which passes by an abandoned quarry. We were hiking throughout the day, and as early evening approched we made a campfire at the end of the quarry, where the heavily wooded area begins, roughly two-thirds of a mile from the nearest paved road. We stayed there until it was all but completely dark, and headed back to my mother&#39;s home where my Jeep was parked. The road we walked on splits in two at this area, the left road going to the lower neighbor&#39;s house (a summer home for a married couple who are teachers) and the right fork leading to my moher&#39;s home. As we travelled to my mother&#39;s home one of us spotted a bright light moving through the trees near the house below us. It moved very erratically, swooping up and down, left and right, etc. We all began to look at the light and talk about what it could be, all the while moving closer to my mother&#39;s home. As we neared the house the light turned its attention towards us. It looked like a set of car headlights, only they were very bright and emitted no beam. The light was intensely bright but was easy on the eyes. The light maintained an elevation equal to ours, and the distance the light was off the ground is about thirty feet or so. This ruled out most things we could name it as being, and the fact that it made no noise and created no wind was beginning to intriugue us. We approched the house and stood in front of it, the light following and &#34;watching&#34; us the entire time. When we stood still, we noticed a second set of lights that appeared to the right of the first. At this time I noticed a third set of lights above the trees to my right, moving up and down the mountainside, appearing occasionally. Our attention was most! ly focus ed on the two sets of lights in front of us, &#34;inside&#34; a cluster of trees, about thirty feet ahead of us, if not closer. The lights hovered in place, but moved in an erratic pattern staying about two to three feet in one spot. It looked like it was peering from person to person, checking us out. We all had the feeling that this was unusually strange. The lights had a mesh-like covering. It was like looking at a huge set of diamonds that glowed brightly, mostly with a yellowish-white color. The lights began to move between the trees and appeared to be moving closer, bobbing left and right, but they were moving closer so slowly that you wouldn&#39;y notice them getting closer unless you stared at them. At this time we decided to move up to the deck surrounding the house, and I went into the house to check what time it was. It was 9PM. I went outside onto the deck and joined my friends, who were still watching the lights intently. We continued to watch the lights for about fifteen minutes. All of a sudden, the set of lights on the right shut off, as quick as a light switch. About a second later the set on the left shut off, but they shut off in two stages. This first stage decreased the brightness to about half, then they shut off completely. They also made a sound, they only sound they made that we heard, a sound similar to shutting off a circuit breaker switch. Before shutting off the left side lights angled slightly, the right-most lens being higher than the left. At that moment I said, &#34;If anyone wants to leave, just say the word&#34;. Two of my friends said yes, and I agreed. We walked quickly to the rear of the house, got into the Jeep, and as I put the key into the ignition I thought about people not being able to start a vehilce when nearby to something like this. Thankfully, it started and I turned on the lights, checked the time, which was 9:20PM, and began to drive slowly out the road. We all peered around the corner of the house, and one of us saw a set of lights streak into the sky straight up, at an in! credible rate of speed. I drove to the nearest public place, which was a retaraunt about two miles away. We got out, looked around at the tree line in the distance, and decided that we were going home to discuss it further. The following day one of my friends and I returned with cameras in hand, but found no trace of what we saw. The trees looked unharmed, there was no disturbance to the forest floor, and everything looked as it should. There isn&#39;t a day that goes by that I don&#39;t think about what I saw. We were all pretty freaked out about it at first, but I plan to spend more time this spring and summer up there...I hope to get some answers. My viewpoint on life and reality itself is now changed, and I need closure of some kind. I know that at least two of us will search for answers. Wish us luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were a few scattered fair weather clouds floating by, but for the most part the sky was clear and blue. Suddenly,in the northwest,something caught my eye.It appeared to be a shiny ball,heading to the southeast at high speed. Not a disc on edge, but a ball! At arms length, I estimated it to be the size of a BB. If it were manned and surely it was,it probably was at least 8 ft.in diameter. It &#34;flew&#34; across 50 degrees of sky in 5 to 7 seconds. It was NOT a Mylar balloon or a weather balloon. Its course was straight and true.

We jumped out of bed and looked out of the window, toward the northeast, and saw a cluster of bright lights at very low altitude. My best guess is about 3000-5000 feet. it looked like six bright white lights in a hexagonal cluster with a bright blue light offset from the middle and a flashing bright light near the bottom. The red light was the brightest of the lights. It was moving very fast from the east to the west. I ran to the front of the house and looked out of the front window to get a better view. and saw it for about another 10 seconds before I lost sight of it behind some trees.<n>

Sitting out with my dogs this evening I noticed what I thought was a satelite moving very fast up off the horizon towards the west - rising straight up. I noticed it because it was bright - brighter than any of the stars around it and it was moving fast enough to get my attention. It took perhaps 30-45 seconds to move from just over the horizon to nearly overhead. I still thought it was just a satelite - but then it stopped. The light did not change it just stopped. And then it started to fall. Almost as if it was some type of rocket that had reached the apex of it&#39;s trajectory. &#34;That&#39;s weird&#34; I though and I kept watching. Then it stopped again and started to zig zag. Whatever it was - it was very high in the sky - really just a point of light about what you might expect of Mars viewed with the naked eye. I ran in and got the binoculars and watched to for another ten minutes as it zig zagged around. I know it was moving because I had to walk from the West to the North side of my house to keep it in view. Then it was gone. Through the binoculars, the object emitted a faint redish light. It&#39;s movement was extremely fluid. When it zig zagged, it looked like a tadpole swimming in shallow water. It moved very slowly at times, hovered, and at others moved very fast speeding out of the view of the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound (then again the frogs and crickets are very loud in the field and drown out Route 95 some 3 miles away so I would not have been able to hear anything but a very loud sound).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the object when it past by the sliver of the moon that was out this evening. I did not see it again. I watched whatever this was for about ten minutes.<n>

I was driving home with my co-worker one late night and witnessed a strange object just floating over the road in front of us. It was about 100 yards away and had a reddish tint to it with orange and yellow lights pouring out of its cone shape. It just hovered there so we decided to pull over.  And when we turned off the car we heard a noise that sounded like a radio station frequency that wouldn&#39;t come in. We waited there and after about 10 or 15 minutes the objects lights got really bright, almost so you couldn&#39;t look directly at it, and then it just went black and it was gone. All that was left was a smokey trail that the object had left behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want everyone to know that I was under no drugs or alcohol of any kind, and what we both saw was true to life and should be investigated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.  The reports seemed to us to be not convincing at the time of the call, a fact which we shared with the callers.  Shortly afterwards, approximately a dozen reports were submitted from that area.  We have no way of confirming any of these reports.  PD))<n>

I was only able to see it for a few seconds before it went behind a tree line.  The sun reflecting off of it burnt the retina of my eyes from being so reflective.  Someone else I know has seen it on two separate occasions, where when they saw it during the night time it flew past some trees and the next day when they went back to the same location the trees were burnt around where it was at.  Attempts that she made to take pictures of it resulted in all the film in her camera being totally ruined as if it&#39;d been burnt.  She reported that during the night time it has red and blue lights which I think at another time years before the time I witnessed it in this account, I saw it as well but at night judging by the way she described it.  I would submit an image but like I said, all the film in the camera that the pictures were taken with was ruined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As if it was going to splash down in the puget sound between bremerton and Bainbridge island. I could not see the water because it was blocked by houses between me and the water. At that time while I was watching it What I noticed is that it was very bright because there was a lot of light in the background sky and it was getting light. The other thing that seemed odd is that it appeared to be moving slowly not just ripping across in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as size it was large, by large I mean larger than a car but smaller than a semi. truck and trailer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports of this incident.

5/15/02 23:00|Ballston Lake/Malta|NY|Unknown|15 minutes|BALLSTON LAKE/ MALTA/ BALLSTON SIGHTING, Possible government UFO|7/13/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44786.html|119|ndxe200205| BALLSTON LAKE/ MALTA/ BALLSTON SIGHTING, Possible government UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was promted to report this peculiar sighting because of a sighting of a UFO that was posted on the New York nuforc page as the 8/22/03 sighting in Ballston lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In that exact area the summer earlier (late June or early July), My friend and I were getting out of my car after comming back from Saratoga. It was approximatley 11 pm, and we were at his house which is situated on the North side of Eastline only about a half a kilometer west of the Sweet Road, Eastline Road intersection. As we walked towards his house I casually glanced over his back yard (facing north). As I scanned the placid and quiet field that expanced an approximate distance of around 300-400 meters between his back porch and the wood line, I first noticed the light that was situated stationary just below the tops of and behind the trees at the forested area which border the edge of his property. At first I thought it was some kind of tower with an affixed light source, most likely a floodlight I assumed since the intensity of the light comming through the trees seemed like it was something like a helicopter searchlight, or some other kind of spotlight. I did not however hear any type of engine noises that would accompany a conventional aircraft at such a close distance... I swear it was so quiet I dont even think there we any animal noises or even car noises for that matter. Being perplexed, I brought the unusual light to my buddie&#39;s attention and inquired if that was a normal occurance, he replied he had never seen it before. We stared at it and became even more curious when it appeared to move and then stop MOTIONLESS, then reverse direction, move and stop motionless again to a location that couldn&#39;t have been tens of meters from its original location. During it&#39;s transverse I saw what looked like the beam of the afor-mentioned light scan through the tops of the trees, now motionless again and still without sound. Thats when we became incredibly exited, we ran to a picnic table close by and stood on top to get a better look. After another few minutes it silently but quickly moved back to its original location, it then rose from behind the tops of the trees. There we could see other less brillient lights located to the right and in line on what appeared to be the physical structure of the craft with the main light still visible as what I will call the &#34;nose of the craft. Although we couldnt make out a definate shape it&#39;s structure seemed to change while producing other lights sporatically (it could have been just changing its orientation in relation to us) This is when the UFO semmed to dip it&#39;s &#34;nose&#34; Towards the ground and move very rapidly to the south, it then stoped, more like hovered and decended towards the ground around the vacinity of the Sweets Road, Eastline Road intersection. We imediatley jumped into my car to attempt some sort of persuit, but even at 80mph when we reached the estimated &#34;landing site&#34; of whatever this thing was there was absolutley nothing, not even a plane in the sky. We remain clueless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an afternote I would like to say there are no airports in the vicinty, or anything capable of supporting aircraft. The area is however, a major conduate for huge powerlines which pass within 100 meters of the sighting location. The region has had other strange sightings in the past especially in and surrounding the saratoga lake area which is also home to a government facility which developed &#34;Space and Energy&#34; Technologies during the cold war. A personal inspection of this area reveals a 6-7 story tall, rusted out rocket gantry (complete with a blast pit) no different from the gemeni launch pads a cape canaveral Florida, and other building/hangar-like structures with paddock areas which appeared to be abandoned. On a personal note, I am finishing up degress in both Geology and History and plan on attending graduate school for geology next year. I am very scientific minded and am not prone to making up stories, I have seen some strange things in the sky before, but this event was truley the strangest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(I was living in military barracks at the time.)  His balcony faced north-west, directly toward the peak of Kaala, probably 15 or so miles away.  He already had his video camera running and told me about this light that pulsed bright and dim coming from behind the mountain, rising up through the clouds, and drop back down.  So of course I stuck around for awhile, I have never witnessed anything unusual like that my entire life.  After talking for about ten minutes, camera still running propped up towards the mountain, we saw the clouds over there get somewhat lit up from some light source behind Kaala.  It raised up, kinda like a sunrise I guess, and kept going.  At first I thought it might of been someone driving around up there, but when it raised up through the clouds, pulsating from a dull orange to a brighter orange, going from dull to bright in about a second, I quickly changed my mind.  It pulsed at a rate which had similarity to a sine wave.  It went up, hovered for a few seconds above and behind the clouds.  We could still see the light pulsating, reflecting off and through the clouds.  It then dropped back down, between the clouds and the mountain where we got a clear view of it, and then back behind the mountain.  It quit, then about 5 minutes after it disappeared, it lit up the clouds again but never surfaced from behind the mountain.  This was all on video-tape and we showed it to a few friends.  I transferred it to my computer, (about 4 Gigs worth).  So quite a few people actually saw the shot, and still had no idea of what it could be (One person said it could have been some machinery that they use for the pineapple fields.)  Unforunately, he ended up taping over it, and my harddrive crashed.  Government conspiracy?  Maybe not, but it was still cool.  Personally I think it may have been some flares, and there also is an airfield back there, where people often skydive, so I am still very skeptical and know there is a! realistic answer to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to have his hard-drive reconstructed by computer forensic specialists.  This footage might be quite interesting.  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then I heard a jet. I looked and saw a fighter jet come over the hilly horizon. It was following the light in the sky (going the exact same direction as the orb of light). Then I realized that the orb of light really was quite low and small (it could not have been larger than a VW beatle based on the size of the jet following it). Both jet and orb disappeared over the hilly horizon. I wondered &#34;did I just see an ET craft?&#34;. Then I thought to myself &#34;insuffient evidence for that conclusion&#34; and a couple seconds later another identical looking light moved through the sky in exactly the same direction as the first. There was no jet following the second light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Since it is very strange to see a star in broad daylight we watched at it.  Then we realized there were about 50-100 dim pinpoints (stars) of light.  They seemed to be partially behind a gray haze (cloud) and some of them kept fading in and out behind the haze. I think the objects were producing the &#34;haze&#34; as a camouflage.  The brightest object was in the rear of the pack. The only clouds in the sky were on the horizon and the objects seemed to be headed in a SE direction at a steady speed. I couldn&#39;t guess at an altitude but, we are near a large airport and these points of light were much higher in the sky compared to the planes.  We watched them for 10-15 minutes.  I was a little freaked out by what we saw and did not ask other people around me to look at it which I now regret. I have not heard or read anything about it since.  Has anyone else reported anything like this to you? I took photos with a digital camera but nothing turned out. Only a couple of blurry Spots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks ((name deleted))<n>

Often airplanes will fly fairly low over the surfers just to check us out on the weekends.  I was at a surf spot called &#34;sharks&#34; which is near the &#34;Hook&#34; a surf spot that is directly at the end of 41st avenue which runs from Highway 1 to the cliffs at the Pacific.  We were sitting there and we looked up because there was a twin engine conventional aircraft approaching at about 1,000 feet and below it and moving much slower was a triangular craft small at about 500 feet and approximately the size of a hang-glider except that it had firm trailing edges and there was no bow in the wing as there is in hang-gliders.  Additionally this craft was completely silent and about 2-3 feet thick. It looked too thin to have held a human and there was no landing gear. This craft had 2 props located approximately 3 feet from the left and right tips of the triangle. It was white with no other markings.  It flew directly overhead and the continued to go at the same altitude directly over the land. At this point the twin engine conventional craft banked off to its left to avoid going over the land at a low altitude. Before and after the conventional craft came and went the triangle traveled at about 30 miles per hour and was completely quiet.  One surfer said to me &#34;what the hell was that?&#34; I replied that it looked like and unmanned aerial vehicle.  The other two surfers said nothing.  Most of the time us surfers prefer not to talk to each other at all.  It is not like a friendly atmosphere with other surfers as we are basically competing for the best waves and there is more hostility out there than friendliness if any conversation at all. A few days later I called the nearest airport which I believe was in Monterey and I spoke with an air traffic controller.  I questioned him about the legal altitudes for aircraft over water and I believe he said that it is 100 ft. over the water and 300 ft. over the land but I am not sure of those numbers.  The reason I asked this question is because of the fact that the twin engine banked off when the craft went inland.  It looked to me that the twin engine had seen the craft and was buzzing it from above to see what it was.  The air traffic controller said that he had not recieved any other reports but asked me to report to him if I saw it again.  As an important side note; my brother-in-laws father worked at Lockheed Missiles and space in Silicon Valley and also in L.a.  In L.A. he worked at the skunkworks as a purchasing agent and he was buying wooden hand made props for  unmanned aerial vehicles that he said were powered by chainsaw engines that had exhaust systems installed to make them perfectly quiet.  He said they used wood props because they were only 2 feet long and made by some obscure small time person who could shape them the way they needed to be effective and also quiet.  The craft I saw looked too thin to hold a human although if the human was lying down in the prone position perhaps he could fit inside.  What amazes me is that the military would fly such a craft over heavily populated areas on a weekend in Monterey Bay and over land too. It was interesting but looked very much man-made.-((name deleted))<n>

It did not seem to be twinkling and moved in a steady path and speed.  It faded out when in got to the Little Dipper (from my perspective).  I looked back to where it had come from and saw two &#34;stars&#34; moving in generally the same direction. They were not moving parallel to each other, more in a slight &#34;v&#34;, so I was unable to watch them both.  I focussed on the brigher one until it disappeared close to the Little Dipper. I glanced across the sky but could not see the third one. I waited for about ten more minutes looking south but no more moving stars. I would not have thought that much about a moving star but three really caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have witnessed a cluster of satellites, perhaps the three which are seen to fly in formation over several weeks, and which are thought possibly to be part of the U.

It seemed to speed up and fly directly over me, no sound at all.  I could barely see the shape of it against the sky and it looked to be triangular.  It had three white lights around its edges one at the very front and the other two down both sides.  This is the same thing that me and two other friends seen about 2 years ago at a lake about a mile from here.  I drew a picture of that encounter and it is definitely the same.<n>

NOT helicopters- read on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on a mountain in Pennsylvania..,  and from time to time i will see one or two large bright lights hovering over the tree tops of the woods a few acres from our house.  The lights will not blink and are one steady bright white light that moves around- often moving fast when it/they decide to shoot upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This past May 2002., i&#39;ve noticed there were two lights.    One would hover over the trees, and then dip into the forest floor and remain there for over 10 minutes. The light is so bright that you could see it through the foilage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other light remained over the tree tops and remained stationary for several minutes, then moved right in a straight fashion over the trees.   Then it would change direction in mid-air and move left-wards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it would raise upwards and shoot up fast into the Universe while the other light remained on the forest floor.       I was too tired to stay and watch if it also would raise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night,  I saw nothing.,  and both nights were clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I usually see just one of these lights moving in these same strange ways..,  and my mother has seen them for decades in the same area.    The last two years were the first times i ever noticed them or had been awake that late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights make no noise whatsoever.,   i have seen them while outside of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One time i was coming home late from my boyfriend&#39;s home., and noticed one light hovering over a newly built house in the farm field- right near the roadside.   It was as close to the ground as a bird flying., and was quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next few minutes later, i&#39;d peek out the window, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen many a helicopter at night., but these lights don&#39;t move like helicopters or make any sound.   Also, i&#39;ve seen these lights from 12:30 to 2:30 am.  when the local aircraft isn&#39;t aloft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also,  the lights seem to be interested in the wooded area  near our house and remain hovering throughout that area.   We live in a rural area that used to be a dairy farm nieghborhood.  It has lots of prairie-like fields, and Wetland areas with coyote, deer and bear,herons, and other waterfowl throughout the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to note that i&#39;m not confusing these lights with the planet Venus that is brighter than the other stars..   Because at the time i see the UFO&#39;s  Venus is located on the other side of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These UFOs are primarly seen in Fall, and Early Spring.  I havent&#39; seen them since May, but have seen them off and on for two years now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked away for 2-4 seconds while moving to get a better view, and the object was gone. Had it been an aircraft it would have continued to be visible. As I looked in the direction of the tree I heard the rasping sound of an animal such as a bird. I have watched night skies for over 40 years, am a former pilot and have an excellent knowledge of all types of man made aircraft. There was no sound. This event left me puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I heard and explosion, assuming it was thunder, but different. It was immediatly followed by a jet sound. It was curious enough to go outside and take a look. The jet was far gone, but I noticed that the sky was partly cloudy, and no thunder the rest of the night. Sonic booms are very rare here. The boom sound radiated from the west, as well as the sound of the jets retreat, towards Holland/Grand Haven area.(25 miles away).<n>

It was in the sky and maybe about 600 feet from the ground.  The lights resembled a pair of very bright car headlights.  The craft was heading south and to the west a little.  I was driving at the time, heading south, and was on a road with very little traffic, so I could speed up and try to get closer to it.  I sped up to try to get closer and it appeared to be slowing down.  I kept watching it and when I became parallel to it I pulled over and turned off my car.  The lights were coming from the back of the craft and there were no lights on the front.  There was a less bright light above the two, creating a triangle of three lights.  It was making some noise and the closest thing I could compare the noise to was a high pitch radio frequency.  I watched it briefly and after about 60 seconds it slowed almost to a stop. It began to go straight up and turn directly around and went towards the north again.  I tried to follow it again and it quickly drifted to the west and I no longer could see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, the observer, have never previously seen any objects I believe to be ufos first hand.  I was not on any hallucinogins or drugs at the time of the sighting and I am convinced that what I saw was definately real - I wasn&#39;t just imagining something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length, and we found him to be seemingly serious-minded and credible.

We wondered if it was just a pole or something else.  As we got closer we saw there was a red flickering light in the middle.  We pulled over and watched whatever it was and it looked like it hovered.  It all of the sudden took off back toward town.  I rolled down the window and listened to it.  It sounded somewhat like a lawn mower.  We turned around and followed it.  We were going about 55 or 60 mph and it was speeding way ahead of us.  We thought it might be a plane because there was an airport  (Central Wisconsin Airport) that way but couldn&#39;t figure out why it was so low and why it was going so fast.  As we kept going, we saw it hovering over a field again.  We saw that it looked triangular and somewhat flat.  We pulled over and watched it again.  It took off once again and we saw yellow lights now.  As we followed it back the other way, it looked like it dipped and crossed the road and hovered about 50 or 70 ft above a house.  We reached up with it again, pulled over and watched it again.  This time, it took off very fast and looked like it landed in a field somewhere or something up ahead but it was too fast to see where it went or landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a written report from the other student-witness.

It was slightly off to my left. At first I wasn&#39;t sure what it was. It was low to the ground, about 1000ft, and it had one light on top that flashed very brightly. It was a white light and it flashed about every 5 seconds. As it approached me it was moving at about the same speed as a passing car would. I slowed down because something seem odd about it. unfortunately, I was loaded very heavy and did not have time to stop before we passed. So I was trying to look at it and drive at the same time. I got two real good looks at it though as we passed, and when the light flashed it lit up most of the craft. It was gray and kinda shaped like a hot air ballon. But with very rigid angles. It also had none of the lighting required by the FAA. It mayed no sound. Never changed course, speed, or altitude. There is also no airports for 60 miles. So that furthered my suspicions. Well as I drove away in the opposite direction, I watched its flashing light in my mirror for a mile or two. I noticed the lights of another semi behind me. I got on the CB and asked him if he had seen that flying object. He saw exactly what I saw. No wings, no sound, no blades, no reason not to believe that we just saw an UFO.

I found it particularly interesting, in that I, too, sometimes find myself in the Cascade Mountain passes, gazing at the beautiful night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first suspicion is that you may have observed a satellite that &#34;flew&#34; into the Earth&#39;s terminator, a.k.a. the shadow behind the Earth.  When satellites fly into that shadow, they disappear from the sight, given that they are no longer being brightly illuminated by the Sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suggest that you watch the sky again in the near future, to see whether you can observe a similar phenomenon.  If you do, please let us know, since we would like to &#34;flag&#34; the report to let the readers know what caused the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is only a guess, on my part, but we have handled MANY reports of satellites, and yours is certainly not inconsistent with a satellite sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END RESPONSE))<n>

We were sitting outside in my jeep wrangler, the top was down.  It was a very clear night &amp; the stars were out.  I first noticed the object directly above me.  I thought it was a satellite passing over like it did the night before, but this time it was different.  The night before it was a solid orange glow moving in a straight descent heading north.  Saturday night, it was the same color, but changed.  It moved very quickly, showing itself, then fading out with a light spark trail to darkness then appears again. It moved across the sky like someone playing &#34;skipping rock &#34; on the water surface, only this was in the sky.  The big dipper was toward my right side ( north ), I was facing west &amp; looking directly above me.  I focused on the object, following it to descern any shape.  I did notice I could see it agains the black night when it stopped emitting the orange glow. I turned dark gray, light then glowed orange again.  I am not sure if it was a jet, or fighter jet  or not but I do not believe it was a satellite. The object was apprx 20, 000 feet or more ..distance equivalent to watching a passing jet. My son thought it to be a fireball or comet crossing the sky&#39;s path.  Did anyone else notice anything like it? Thanks.<n>

When leaving store to go home, my 16 yo. daughter and I saw an orange light in the southern sky (SSW) moving VERY slowly. It was VERY bright, much brighter than any stars or planes and moving much slower than the satellites we often see. We drove the two blocks home, still watching the light move in a northerly direction and at varying but still very slow speed. I called my husband to come out and look. He thought it was odd also, not like a satellite. After 5-7 minutes it began moving more to the northwest then west. During this time we also saw a satellite for about one minute (moving much faster that the orange light) and a plane quite high in the sky. We all noted that the plane had the green and red side lights and white strobe lights that all registered aircraft are required to have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time I also attempted to call the tower at the local airport (about 2 air miles away to the east). The tower was closed as there are no scheduled flights that late in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remained outside with my husband and daughter while using the phone and watched the light. After about 15-20 minutes it began to fade and appeared to drop lower in sky in relation to the horizon before disappearing from site. We noted that it was moving too slowly for an aircraft to remain airborne and was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day, I contacted the local airport tower and was informed that our facility does not have RADAR. I was given the number for the flight control center in Boise, which does not have the Lewiston, ID,-Clarkston, WA area on its RADAR.<n>

My boyfriend looked out the window (facing northwest I think) and yelled to me that he was seeing something strange.  I looked out the window and saw a bright orange light which looked quite large.  It looked like nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went outside with a pair of binoculars and looked at this orange thing for about fifteen minutes or so.  With the naked eye, it just looked like a large, bright, strange, and orange light.  It was circular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the binoculars we could see it much better.  It looked like a yo-yo on its side.  Like two bright orange halves connected in the middle by something--like a metallic cylinder that wasn’t visible without the aid of binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing is that it made absolutely no sound at all.  It was a quiet night and if it made noise we would have heard it.  It also seemed to move slowly, almost like it was just hovering for a little while.  When it left, it was slow as well.  We watched it get smaller and smaller as it went in a north or northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it has been quite a while since this happened, but I swear I will never forget it.  I kind of guessed about the date, but it seems to be about right.  I know the year is correct (well, pretty sure-- could be off by one year).  I saw a report from someone else who saw something that was described like what I saw in my town.  I know they saw what I saw.  Same time of day and everything.  I regret not reporting this sooner.  I think more people saw it and just have not reported it.  Like I said, this is something that deeply affected me and I will never forget what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, my boyfriend and I were sober (not on drugs or alcohol) at the time and we were both about 21 or 22 years of age.  It was also a clear night with little or no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It just about didn&#39;t catch my attention .  Then I thought to myself, Wow the Space Station. It was moving about the center of the sky from west to east.  The speed was the same as if there was an airplane at about 30,000 ft.  Real slow.  Then it got really bright.  I could not look at it it was so bright. I looked down toward the ground and noticed my shadow.  Then the light dimmed.  I looked up just in time to see it fade away. About 8 seconds later there was a low rumble (like a jet plane when reversing the engines), Then a loud boom. I felt it in my teeth it was so low frequency. I checked everywhere I could think of to see if there was a launch but found nothing for todays date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports from same source.

Took bus to long term parking lot G (now lot P) to get our car.  Had trouble locating car due to writing down incorrect row.  Wife and friend went one direction and my son (16 years old) and myself went another direction to locate car.  While my son and myself were walking around in the parking lot we heard this very loud sound similiar to a jet engine which came from 5 or 6 different directions at one time in about a 4 second time frame.  The two of us automatically looked into the overcast sky thinking it was some type of jet since they were landing right over our heads.  After thinking of what we just heard it was imposible for this to be a jet since the sound was coming in from many different directions to the point where we were standing in this very large parking lot in a very short time.  We had looked into the sky but I noticed nothing as  my son said he noticed a rectangle object that was gray in color which vanished as fast as the sound we both just heard.  Not sure what this was but it has to be the strangest thing I every experienced in my life (48 years old).  Not that my son and I didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s now that I heard this and my son did see something in the sky we have had our own experience which if it wasn&#39;t for both of use being together when this happened I don&#39;t know if I would beleive it myself.<n>

But then I observed that they were much too closely spaced to be regulated aircraft.  As they got near downtown they began to move in motions of lazy turns, banks and doublebacks like seagulls, at random and not in formation, and not like any planes I&#39;ve ever seen.  The front of the craft had half a dozen white lights.  There were no other lights and no sound was heard.  I used an 8x eyepiece to get a better view. The rear of the craft was square so the whole thing appeared to be an obtuse triangle with the large angle at the nose.  The craft appeared black.  I double-checked myself that these were not blimps, spotlights, laserlights, helicopters, normal airplanes, birds, nor reflections.  Their size appeared to be about twice as big as a large commercial plane.  After a few minutes they moved slowly off to the northwest and disappeared in the haze.  Their altitude was about that of planes coming into the city just about 5-10 miles from the airport.  Their speed was similar to jets flying normally, or just a tad faster.  The weather was mostly clear with some haze.<n>

She could not understand why she could not see if anymore and she showed me where she had seen it by the position of 2 bright start to the west. I looked where she had seen the flashing and suddenly saw what I thought could be a satelite ..... suddenly I could see that it was in a triangle shape or v shape like a flock of geese ...... we could see about nine points in a v formation and believe it to be one object because of the way it moved as one. There were no lights no sound. It appeared large and fairly low down and seemed to be picking up light from the city lights or had a faint glow on those points. The points stayed in a rigid formation and moved in a northeasterly direction ..... it was also moving rapidly (faster than birds can fly.) There was no wind of any kind at this time and no thermals. It stayed in a straight line of flight and was gone from our sight in about 10-15 seconds from the first that we had seen it. My wife looked at me and said &#34;what the hell was that?&#34; ..... I replied, &#34;I have no idea.&#34; I am a hunter and outdoors person and look in the evening sky on most nights. I have seen meteorites, satelites, planes, but nothing like this. I have watched geese and ducks in formation and have hunted both and again this was nothing like that. One thing ... besides seeing what we saw .... was a total lack of sound as it went over our heads, the rigidness of the formation and the constant speed of the object.

I really think I heard this, but it was through the static as I tuned in.  The announcers thereafter went on calling the game as though nothing unusual had happened.  I don&#39;t have time or inclination to check it out, but if you think its worthwhile you can.<n>

It was moving above the tree line and then disappeared in the trees so we sat there watching and what seem to be a half an hour went by it came out the other side and then it started to fade in and out like it was hovering there turn in its spot going bright to dieam and it look like it disappear and then it went bright again so we then we decited to go somewhere else that was more open so we can see it better but by the time we got to were we can see it better it had moved to wher it was just above the tree lines and then disappeared again for good. we went back the next Satorday but we didnt see it again<n>

I go here every night with my friends. It was just like every other night but most people went in early, which was strange. There was only me and 2 other friends left. We talked for a while. After 15 minutes had passed I noticed something up in the sky, as we were looking at the stars. At first we thought it was an airplane or some kind of air transport, so we took a closer look. The craft moved silently down from the sky. It was very high up and moved far too quickly to be a plane. It stopped, and then moved around a bit more. We could now see that it was an oval shape and had blue and red lights round it. Out of nowhere another craft appeared, the same as the other one. They way it moved explained that it couldn&#39;t be any kind of our air transport. The two crafts stopped and hovered. They started flashing to each other; it looked like a kind of Morse code. Suddenly a beam of light shot between them both. It only lasted a fraction of a second. A third craft appeared. It also moved about a bit then sped of at a high speed until it got so fast we could not see it. The second craft did the same. We watched the first craft carefully as it zigged-zagged across the sky. It moved in a triangle shaped then moved quickly across the sky, accelerating as it went, then disappeared. We didn&#39;t know what to say to each other. We all decided to go home our separate ways. When I reached home, 10 mins later, my brother was in. He thought something was wrong, as I was as pale as a ghost. I explained and he believed me because I wrote down what happened and drew a picture of where the crafts were, my friends also did this and the stories matched. I didn&#39;t think much off it until a week later. My dad was sat in the car listening to the radio. When I got into the car he said there had just been a special on UFO&#39;s as people had been phoning in all week with sightings all over the area. I phone up and explained what I saw. The next day there was a report in the newspaper. I thought, great, It wasn! &#39;t just me that had seen them. A few days later there was another article in the newspaper saying that the things that everyone saw were meteorites! Bullshit! I thought. Since when did meteors have blue and red lights and can control which direction they go in, and hover and move around in circles. I don&#39;t care what anyone else says. I know what I saw. I will tell anyone who wants to know about it. As they say. Seeing is believing<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to obtain the newspaper article the witness alludes to.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of a flurry of reports we received from Ventura County, CA, following three telephone calls we received on May 18, 2002, from a raucous student party.  The reports seemed to us to be not convincing at the time of the call, a fact which we shared with the callers.  Shortly afterwards, approximately a dozen reports were submitted from that area.  We have no way of confirming any of these reports.  PD))<n>

Look out the window as something caught my eye....<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I watched a green light float down to the ground apparently....my first reaction was that it was a flare....but the light was consistent and color did not fade or vary at any point. Speed was slower than a typical shooting star by a wide margin. I have seen comets....but there was no typical tail to this object. just a floating circle....in a straight line to the ground. Then no more sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this happened...I was intrigued by the sound of a helicopter, which at this time in the night is rare unless it is a police copter....I know the San Jose copter is very quiet due to high tech blades it has for low level flying and stealth. The copter I heard was flying just before the incedent for about 15 minutes before it went out of range....but though I searched for the copter with lights off for 5 minutes....no lights were seen. Then 5-10 minutes later ...I saw the light.<n>

It was moving very slowly over the freeway. I was getting onto the freeway and happened to glance to up as I was checking to my left for oncoming cars. When I looked away for a few seconds, by the time I turned again to look in the direction of the craft it had disappeared. I heard no engine noise and saw no lights anywhere. It was GONE!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the sighting occurred at night, and we have amended the time.  PD))<n>

(approx. 21 mi. north of downtown Houston, off I-45), I went out on our outside apartment patio to smoke, and after I sat down, I looked up and saw an object moving from left to right in the south sky (moving east to southwest). My immediate reaction was that it had to be an aircraft, but when it suddenly stopped on a dime, and stayed in one place, my changed very quickly about what I was seeing. I wanted to go tell my sister, but was afraid it would go away, and I&#39;d miss what it would do next. I waited then, and it then started moving in a straight line to the east, from it&#39;s stationary position I seen it move to. It was then I knew I better get my sister, so at least someone else could see this. My sister came out in time to also watch this dimly lit white object continue to move, more rapidly now in a straight line to the east. This thing was definitely going MUCH faster than any commercial airliner, or Air Force jet ! We watched it getting farther to the east, when suddenly it stopped ! -- and I mean it stopped on a dime, too... about 10 seconds of sitting there, it then started moving back towards us (southwest), but this time it was moving slower....it moved towards us for about 15 seconds, then turned around and started going east again ! It continued at the same slower speed (but still very fast for any flying craft we have - or at least anything to our knowledge that we have).....It kept going this time, moving eastward till we couldnt see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited around 10 mins. for it to come back, but it didnt, and it was a very hot humid night here in Houston, anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went at got the binoculars and will keep them outside from now on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a feeling that whoever was contolling this thing, they know they could really go faster than the speed we seen it move..... :) I hope anybody else seen this last night will also come forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS : There was a commercial jet flying west to east, much lower than the UFO, but they wouldve had no problem seeing this on such a clear night if they just looked upto their left.<n>

We saw a strange orange fireball fly away from us. It seemed to big to be anything like a meteor and it was flying away from us. It then disappeared suddenly. We shook it off, but then we heard neighbors talking about how the planets are aligned. We became a little interested. We then continued walking around and saw another one exactly the same, fly by across the sky at about 1:00 AM. Later at 2:00 we saw the same thing. At about 4:00 am we saw it fly across the sky again and suddenly vanish. We live near an airport but their is no way this was anything I have seen before. We also heard ,and saw, large (military maybe) jets flying around. We did some research and found no explanation for what this was.<n>

All the craft fly to this light and then everything disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this is so close to Pearson International airport it would seem reasonable that they would know what these are and be monitoring their movements,however in my estimation these are not passenger aircraft.This is happening now as I type this.

It seemed to be fading away from us and did not change direction.  At one point the round bright orange vortex of the chevron flared stronger.<n>

We were just talking and I looked up at the stars because I love the stars. When out of my periphial view to my left I saw somthing. Its weird but at first glance I thought it was an owl gliding across the sky. Then my mind thought it was a flock of ducks flying in a V formation. But when it was right over my head the light from the stars vanished behind it. It was a black triangle craft making no sound at all. I looked at my wife and pointed to the sky and I kept asking what is that. She didn&#39;t know of course. It had no lights no sound and glided across the sky to the north west. I watched until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. We jumped in our car and tried to follow it but I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I;m telling you if I hadn&#39;t looked straight up I never would have saw it. I went home and looked on line at all the stelth planes that are known to exsist. none of them looked like it. the edges were rounded. It was the creepest thing I&#39;d ever seen. I have listened to you and Art for years and never thought I would see somthing like this. At the time I didn&#39;t report it because it wasn&#39;t as fantastic as all the reports you seem to get. The only reason I amm sending this is to add to your evidence that we are not alone. Thank you for all you do. One more thing, it might sound weird but I got a strong impression that what ever was in that craft knew that I was watching it. I wish I would have reported it sooner but like I said I didn&#39;t think it was a big deal. If you do get in touch with me I did have questions of a dream I had in 1996.I know I might sound dumb but it was a dream of little greys taking me from my bed and putting a clone of me in my place for about a year. I know it was just a dream but I&#39;ve always wondered if I should talk to someone. Couple of my friends I told just laugh until I tell them I had a second dream a couple days before my surgery that the little guys brought me back. Then they just say how weird. I dont think I&#39;m crazy just wondered what you think. Is there a connection. Anyway thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Well, on the night on may 10, I got much more than expected! At about 1 AM a meteor streaked across the sky; and as I was looking in its direction I rested my glance on a dark patch of sky into which it disappeared. A few short moments later a light appear in the dark patch. Based on appearances it looked like any other star, but then it began to pulse:bright, less bright; bright less bright, it continued in this rythmn for about 2-3 minutes then began to move from its location WSW sky(from my perspective) to ESE sky. It was VERY high in the sky and had no accompanying noise until a 45 degree angle was formed with me being the crux. In other words, if I stretched out my arms at a 45 degree angle and extended the lines in the sky, that was where the noise was relative to the &#39;ship&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps 5 to 10 minutes later another streak painted the sky and disappeared into darkness. I waited and sure enough a light appeared and then began to pulse. What&#39;s more is out of my peripheral vision I noticed another pulsing. It appeared as if the two were communicating because when one would pulse the other refrained and vice versa. Again the incidences were in the WSW sky and started to move ESE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two more occurences happened in the same way witht the correlative streaking prologue to the pulsing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sixth event happened as before except there was another light which necessitates a brief explanation. Imagine a cloud in the sky with a bright light behind it resulting in a fuzzy light. This fuzzy light looked as if it was lower in the sky than the others but ascended straight up at an incendiary pace then disappeared. The sixth light began to pulse and the seventh light appeared in the NWN sky and these two began the &#39;conversation&#39;. The sixth started its migration to the ESE sky and the seventh began its travel to the NEN sky. I followed them both until they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When these things appeared as lights they were the color of a star-whitish blue, but the pulsing was red. This red light seemed as if it rolled across the width? length? of the object. Perhaps it had wings or was triangular in shape and had alternating red lights on both ends? The actual shape was too difficult to discern as there was a new moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to include Luke Air Force Base is les than thrity minutes away by car. Perhaps they were taking a few Stealth Bombers out for a night trek? Can the stealth hover? Strange days in Arizona. I am about to go out again tonight<n>

Es Blitzte immer nur eines dieser Dinger auf, aber es waren ca 5-10 Stück die sich mit ihrem Leuchten abwechselten.Es sah ein bisschen so aus als würden diese Dinger über die Lichter miteinander reden?!Es handelte sich nicht um ein Gewitter oder so etwas, wir hatten eine klare Nacht, keine Wolke am Himmel! Ausserdem waren die Objekte zu niedrig dafür. Wir hatten beide ein komisches Gefühl, haben uns das aber nicht anmerken lassen.Hinterher wollte uns niemand unsere Erlebnisse glauben.

Initial sighting was at 30 degrees above the horizon and it was falling left to right at 10 degrees from vertical. The oject was silver to white and was brighest immediately before it disappeared at 10 degrees above the horizon. In checking with the Regional National weather station the following day, they had other similar reports of the same meteor-like object, one from a location 50 miles to the north.

JUST SOUTH OF ILLINOIS 60.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DRIVING ALONG, I SUDDENLY NOTICED WHAT I FIRST THOUGHT WAS A FLAIR IN THE SKY DIRECTLY OVER A RETIREMENT HOME ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IN AN INSTANT, I REALIZED THIS WAS NOT A FLAIR.  IT WAS A STREAK OF FIRE IN THE SKY MOVING STRAIGHT DOWN, AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED THAT A FLAIR MOVES.  AFTER A SECOND OR TWO, THE STREAK ENDED, AND THERE WAS A SUDDEN SMALL FIRE-LIKE FLASH AT THE SPOT THAT THE STREAK ENDED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THAT IS ALL THERE WAS TO IT.  I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT IS COULD HAVE BEEN SPACE JUNK RETURNING TO EARTH, OR PERHAPS A METEORITE. MY QUESTION IS DID ANYONE ELSE WITNESS THIS INCIDENT, OR TRACK IT ON RADAR?<n>

As I walked, about two miles further, I came upon some very large animal cat tracks, which were approximately 10 inches in diameter.  This was very strange, because, there are no such animals in this part of the country, with the size of paws which would make tracks that big, period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I examined the tracks, I could see that they had jumped from somewhere and landed to the left of the trail I was walking on, and as the tracks first connected with the ground, they made an impression with the three front claws on each paw, digging into the dried mud which I assume was moist when the prints were left.  The animal then began to walk with its paws flat, with all five claws digging into the mud and leaving track of a walking animal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed these big cat tracks up a cutline which is a service path between the highway and the hydro line, to where the cat tracks stopped at the top of the hill.  Then things got strange, as the front paws of the big cat moved to the left, one after the other, then to the right, also one after the other, then forward one step with both paws.  The next thing I saw was two sets of size nine, mans hiking boots following the cat tracks, which followed the same pattern.  The men’s hiking boots moved to the left, one after the other, then to the right, also one after the other, and then forward one step with both feet, then proceeded to walk down the other side of the hill towards the highway and right up to the pavement, where they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the tracks from the highway, all the way back to the top of the hill, where I was looking for the continuation of the cat tracks, but I could not find any continuation.  I walked down to where I first encountered the tracks which jumped out of nowhere, and looked in a semi circle, up to at least thirty feet from where the tracks had landed on three claws, but I was unable to find the beginning of the cat track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After studying the track for some time, I was under the impression that there was something quite unusual going on here, but what?  I talked with different people over the years, and some thought it may have been a hoax, others thought it was a shape shifter, still others thought it was the devil, and so on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area was to far from Thompson for anyone to stumble onto the tracks, which were left their since the last rain, maybe three days before.  So what could have, jumped from out of nowhere, walked in soft mud to leave tracks, and changed into a human, gone to the highway and disappeared, possibly into the City of Thompson?  Who or what is moving among us, and where do they come from?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The balls of light were flying in a continuous formation and constant altitude, and each had an illuminated contrail. The lights continued on what seemed to to be a constant heading until they went by our right wing 10-40nm away. As they passed, the second light split into two separate lights, as if up until then one light was obscuring the other. When the lights reached our 5 oclock position they all disappeared. I would estimate that each light was 200-400 feet in diameter, and each contrail was illuminated for 2000-4000 feet. We notified ATC and they had no other aircraft in the area, or anything on radar. Also, another aircraft 100nm behind us at FL280 stated they had seen the same lights. Both myself and the other pilot have been flying for more than 25 years with over 10,000 hours each and neither of us has seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this airliner crew member, and found him to be an excellent witness.

We had passed overhead of Toronto and were proceeding in a straight line from Toronto to Vancouver. We were flying at FL390, and making good a track of about 300 degrees magnetic. It was a clear night, no moon, and many stars visible. When we were south of Sault Ste. Marie by about 80 nautical miles, I suddenly observed two large bright white lights in our 1 o&#39;clock position.  At first I thought they were two aircraft in formation flying towards us. They seemed to be about 8 to 10 miles away. I brought them to the attention of the F/O, and we both agreed that they were very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked air traffic control if they were aware of any aircraft in the area, and they said that there was nothing in the area either on radar or know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed them for at least one minute, possibly close to two minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared as very bright white objects followed by a very long trail.

We had just finished cleaning up after supper and I was getting ready to head back to my new home.  I was loading my truck with a suitcase when I glanced up and saw due north of their home a large dimly lit orange/yellow/red sphere.  My estimate is it had a diameter of at least 200 feet as it was 4 times the size the barn that it was hovering over (barn was 50 ft high) and it was at least 200 fet over the barn.  The object was hovering over the neighbors farmstead, namely the barn.  I quickly ran into the house and told my brother and my sister in law what I had seen, they said it was a helicopter.  When they came out it was gone.  I did not argue with them about it.  Just minutes earler to my sighting the Northwest 10:00 pm flight to Peoria, IL from Minneapolis, MN had flown over my brothers place, but always runs 10-5 minutes so exact time is within 5 minutes (I have flown it frequently on business).  The date is accurate as I was reminded in a telephone call to pickup items I left, and my brother happened to mention my &#34;sighting&#34; and the date.  I am not a nutcase, I am gainfully employed and happended upon your website to get this out of my mind once and for all.

Our apartment is on the side of a hill in the Silverlake area adjacent to the Highway 5 freeway. The balcony faces East, and I went on to the balcony to see what the helicopter was doing. As I looked up, I saw the red lights of the helicopter and then I saw that there was something next to it. The thing next to it was hard to see as it had no lights on but there was clearly the outline of some type of flying machine but it had no lights on and it was flying next to the helicopter. I observed it as they went North East from where I was facing, over what is the City of Glendale. It went about a mile or two to the point where I could no longer see the object, just the red lights of the helicopter. Then I saw the red lights coming closer, heading South West from Glendale. Soon the object came back into view, and it was clear that it was a cigar shaped object, similiar in shape and form to that of a Boeing 737 but it had absolutely no lights on, I could see the sillouhette travelling through the bright night city sky. I yelled for my room mate to come to the balcony so I could be sure I was not the only person seeing this. After straining his eyes (he wears glasses, I have 20/20 vision) he saw it and became excited and suggested we go to the roof. There were now two helicopters following it. It went over the area of San Fernando Road not far from Glendale&#39;s Forest Lawn cemetery. There was a marine layer in the air and I could see the object go through the low clouds as it made it&#39;s way southwest towards downtown. It continued in the direction of downtown Los Angeles and Dodger Stadium. It passed behind a hill and I could no longer see the helicopters or the object. Phone calls to the local police and media brought no answers. The object did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be quite credible as a witness.  We do not know what it was he saw.  PD))<n>

I returned to tell my mom and the noise grew louder as i walked away returning to our living room. I then went to our screen door and looked outside nothing could be seen or heard. But the noise continued. My mom then went to our dining room window and looked outside. She looked up above the house across from are apartments to see a saucer shaped craft spinning and hovering above some trees beside the house. It had lights around the whole craft. The lights were red,blue and some green. We first thought it may be an airplane or a helicopter. But we would of recgonized the noise if it was a helicopter and planes can not spin and hover in this such way. In the hovered their for about 5 minutes max. Then all of a sudden it just hovered down fastly and it was gone and did not appear again.<n>

I looked out my window at the stars for a few minutes.  Everything was normal, except that this one particularly bright &#34;star&#34; was moving.  At first, I just thought my mind was playing tricks on me, but it was clearly descending slowly in the night sky. It must have been hovering for the 5 minutes or so I was watching the stars, because it didn&#39;t catch my attention until it started descending slowly.  It dropped down below the buildings on the horizon, so it was out of my view. I tried to foget about it.  Around 11pm, I was still tossing and turning in bed, when I saw it again, over the same set of buildings.

The shape of the craft was chevron shaped, but was unsymmetrical as it had an &#34;extension&#34; on one side.  The underside was lined with what appeared to be round and dim lights.  The aircraft appeared to be flying somewhat low and relatively slow.  Also, it made no sound as it flew over our apartment complex.  At first the outline of the aircraft wasn&#39;t completely visible.  It was the lights that first drew our attention.  As it got closer we began to see the outline of the craft more clearly.  When the craft went over the roof we ran around to the other side of the building.  When we looked up the craft was nowhere in sight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I went to the window and watched as it came closer...then saw a second aircraft following it.  They looked like they had very large headlights (two) with a cluster of lights, perhaps one light was red, in what appeared to be about 4 smaller lights in the center of the &#34;headlights&#34;.  I couldn&#39;t see any shape to the body or back of the aircraft...yet, after I watched them pass...I went to a window in the front of my home and saw an almost identical light pattern on the back of the aircraft as it left.  Very strange, indeed.  I called KIRO News, to see if anyone had reported seeing them.  I was told that they hadn&#39;t heard anything, but would check into it.<n>

I was facing west and looking straight up and previously noticed a satellite slowly creep in a straight line across the sky directly overhead, nothing unusual.  Being so close to Chicago, star visibility is rather poor, I can see the big dipper, some planets and a few bright stars and I have a knack for spotting satellites.  The majority (satellites) I see over time tend to travel South to North, I&#39;ll pick it up in plain site and try and follow it acoss the whole sky until it fades out of view.  The one on Monday was something I never saw before, I thought I spotted a satellite, a pinpoint of light just moving in a straight line (North to south, this time) and 2 seconds after I spotted it, it began to slowly grow in white brilliance (I immediately thought this thing was entering the atmosphere) the &#34;glint&#34; on this object got to be as bright as a full moon, and I noticed I had to squint it was so bright....suddenly the light contracted and continued its straight line course, returned to its normal illuminated pinpoint of light and faded out.  If this is a satellite (or ISS) it is glinting the sun in certain positions that are really gonna freak people out. Only explanation I can think of.<n>

The frogs down by the pond stopped croaking which was very strange.  It was about the size of a golf ball held at arms length.  It was moving slowly to the South West.  After about 8 seconds it disappeared only to reappear to my far right (SW) a second later.  Then it took off straight up into the sky at a high rate of speed.  After a few minutes some kind of aircraft with unidentifiable lights were seen in the same place this ball of light had appeared and heading on the same path the object went. No sound was heard.<n>

There was chaos on the road.  Two cars were pulled over by the police with flashing lights, could be an accident.  Also, there was an ambulance and Fire Truck going to another scene around the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving, instead of looking at the chaos, I looked up into the sky and saw a saucer the color of the moon.  It was about the size of the moon, however, it was moving and I was sitting still.  It was cruising from East to West...maybe 25 miles per hour from where I saw it.  It went behind a building and I was not able to follow it.  An airplane flew by in a NW direction and the sun shone on it and there was a silvery reflection.  But this saucer had no silvery reflection, it was glowing like the moon would glow.<n>

When I saw it, I knew what it was; at the time I really didn’t know much about UFOs and Ets.  But after that day, ever since I’ve looked up everything I could about them.  I don’t think it was a alien space craft, I do think it was a government imitation ufo not the real thing.  Ill tell the story now so you can understand why I think this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in school at the time and every body had to go inside.  To go inside you would have to line up in front of the door.  Then the teachers would count the students.  While we where lined up a kid on the side of me said “hay what’s that” and he pointed to the sun.  At first I didn’t see it the sun was really bright and the sun was right behind the ufo so I had to squint my eyes to see the ufo but a cloud went in front of the sun and I got a really good look. It was just sitting there not moving no sound.  Ok hears the description it was silver it had metal plates with bolts holding the metal plates on, there was no window or door or any way to see who was in side the ufo.  The ufo was not spinning like in the movies it just was very still no noise it was very right over the play ground. I could of through a ball and hit it but I wasn’t allowed and I didn’t want to get it mad because I didn’t know what it could do.  The teachers by that time where scared.  See this was a Christian school but I don’t go to a school like that any more it was like a one time thing for a year.  The teachers where scared because I don’t think they believed in ufos so they quickly rounded us up and sent us inside.  Later I came out to see if the ufo dropped anything but there was nothing there and the ufo was gone. IM NOT ASKING ANYONE TO BELIVE ME OR IN UFOs JUST LOOK UP ONCE IN A WILE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU WILL SEE  thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

So I did not pay it much attention.  A few seconds later, I looked out again the light was still moving.  I noticed how quickly it was traveling.  I rolled down the window and watched it for a few minutes, nothing real extraordinary.  At this time I exited my car, and watched it fly for about 30 more seconds, when the object started flashing very quickly, exactly like a strobe light.  THE OBJECT UNMISTAKEBLY WAS FLASHING AT A FAST PACE AND HAD STOPPED MOVING ACCROSS THE SKY. After flashing for about 30 to 60 seconds the light disappeared.  Leaving me confused and exited.<n>

The first time i noticed them I was just watching the night sky when I noticed this light moving across the sky it looked like a star. They get bright and they fade, they appear to go around stars, Some times they appear to wobble. Anyways the first one i was watching kept going back and forth from one mountain ridge to the other till all of a sudden another one came and met up with the one i&#39;d been watching and they flew off together side by side.   I&#39;ve also seen them going across the sky and stop and go straight up and dissapear. I&#39;ve seen one go across the sky and had fire or some kind of bright flash then dissapear. I can&#39;t get them in veiw with a telescope they&#39;re to fast i&#39;ve tried binocculars they&#39;re just brighter lights. I&#39;ve tried to get somebody to come out to see these lights from the university here but no one seemed interested. When I came acrossed this website I could&#39;nt believe how many others are seeing the same thing or what appears to be the same thing. I am really interested in finding out what they are.<n>

It was a clear evening and the sun was just setting.  I noticed an object in the sky that was moving from WSW to ENE [the street I live on runs east and west and the object was moving at a slight angle to it}  Facing due South on my driveway the object was at an approx. 45 degree angle in the sky, approx. 1 1/2 miles away and I would guess the altitude to be in excess of 20,000 feet.  Extending my hand and trying to measure the object between my thumb and fore finger, it measured approx. 3/4 of an inch in length and approx. 1/8 inch thick.  The color of the object was a shiny gold and the shape was similar to a cigar or cylinder viewed from the side.  No noise was heard, no com trail, and no airplane features were observed [i.e. wings, tail, engines etc.]  I had been watching it about 45 seconds when a neighbor from down the street came walking by with his daughter from the east to the west [Scott is about 50 and Bria 13] We exchanged hellos at which point I pointed the object out to them in the sky.  The three of us looked at the object another 30 seconds or so and made some comments about it and then Scott and his daughter continued their walk home.  I continued to watch the object another 15-25 seconds until it disappeared in the eastern sky.  I am a retired police sergeant with 27 years on the job and have seen a lot of strange things in my career, but none like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies self as former public employee.

I was looking south toward Safeco Field when I realized that what I was seeing was NOT a plane.  It looked like a tin can in the wind, except it looked in control and it varied in speed.  Also, it hovered like a helicopter at times.  It was black on top and very shiny (almost like a mirror) on the bottom.  At first I thought it might be the stealth fighter, but I don&#39;t remember the stealth being able to manuever quite like this vehicle.  Once it got to West Seattle, it shot up straight (from approx. 5,000 ft. to at least 35,000).  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  It was NOT a plane, nor the stealth, nor some weather balloon.  This thing then zigzagged and must have flipped backwards.  It then shot up again, probably another 5-10,000 ft.  I could see it&#39;s black speck hovering for about 10 minutes.  Then it just followed the cloud format! ions back towards downtown Seattle heading east, very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a student at the UW and a runner who doesn&#39;t take drugs or make stuff up.

5/5/02 15:30|Christmas Valley|OR|||Oregon UFO Review Case:  Daytime cattle mutilation...same animal hit twice.|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23020.html|216|ndxe200205| May 5, 2002 on a ranch about 15 miles south of Sand Springs, a 2400 pound bull worth $2,000 was found in a shallow crater not far from the water trough. His owner, Fritz Morrison had been at the water pump at 12:30 p.m. and his bull was laying beside the trough chewing his cud, seemingly well and content along with several cows. But when Fritz returned only three hours later at 3:30 to do more work at the pump, he found the bull dead, stiff and the left eye had been removed and was &#34;bubbling&#34; moistness from it. Fritz then returned home to retrieve a chain to pull the animal away from the side of the road so as he wouldn&#39;t have to look at it as he drove by each day. When he returned around 5:00 or 5:30, he found that a complete mutilation had occured on the dead bull while he was gone. The tongue had been excised deep within the throat, the testicles and shaft had been bloodlessly removed leaving penis stretched out on the ground, and the rectum was cored out. One ear was also missing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three days later, Keith Bumpass, Deputy Sheriff of the Lake County Oregon Sheriff&#39;s Office was contacted and an investigation was launched. Keith was put in contact with Dr. W.C. Levengood of BLT Research, a consultant for OUFOR. Dr.Levengood suggested looking on the animal for signs of small dark particles of dried blood. Although the bull was black, the Deputy Sheriff found a small amount around the rear of the animal. Those samples were sent to Dr.Levengood in Michigan and the results of the preliminary tests are that they are probably pure hemoglobin particles, indicating a processing of the blood had taken place during the mutilation process. Bovine Hemoglobin is a component of blood. The presence of hemoglobin indicates that a processing of the whole blood has occurred. The usual procedure for isolating hemoglobin from whole blood is rather complex. It involves separating red blood corpuscles from the lighter plasma components by centrifugation. The plasma is siphoned off and ether is added to the corpuscle paste, causing the cells to burst. Another centrifugation removes the ruptured cell envelopes and leaves a clear red solution of hemoglobin. With mutilated cows, every other component of the blood is totally disintegrated with the exception of the hemoglobin. It&#39;s turned into its elemental form. Assistant Director Eric Byler of OUFOR spoke with Deputy Sheriff Keith Bumpass the morning of May 21st and it now appears a second cow has been found. The Deputy Sheriff found the animal the day before and went out to take pictures and further investigate. He said that it appears that the animal had been dead for several weeks and it was thought that it probably went down around the same time as the first animal back on May 5, 2002. The cow also had all of the signs of a classic cattle mutilation including the tongue surgically removed at the base of the throat, the utters missing and the rectum cored out. Cattle mutilation expert and OUFOR investigator Jean Bilodeaux has been notified and will be workin!<n> <n><n> g closel<n> <n><n> y with the Sheriff&#39;s department on further cattle finds in this area of South Eastern Oregon. Byler was also in contact with Colm Kelleher of The National Institute for Discovery Sciences and a top priority of securing a veterinarian to contract out with NIDS was discussed.  The owner has agreed to turn over any future Bovine to OUFOR that is found and verified as being alive 24 hours or less before being found. The animal will be brought back to Salem for extensive necropsy work as paid for and contracted out through NIDS. As a side note, we at OUFOR are very pleased and appreciative of the combined cooperative efforts of the many outstanding organizations who have come together to work this case as it unfolds. Those organizations include the exceptional data gathering talents of Linda Moulton Howe, Colm Kelleher of The National Institute for Discovery Sciences, Dr. W.C. Levengood of BLT Research, cattle mutilation expert and OUFOR team member Jean Bilodeaux, and most of all the work done by Keith Bumpass, Deputy Sheriff of the Lake County Oregon Sheriff&#39;s Office who took the incentive to ask all the right questions and sent samples to the right places. We look forward to working with this talented investigator for Lake County in case of future animal mutilations that may come within the next few months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Eric Byler of Oregon UFO Review for sharing this report.

As I came to an overpass, I saw at the extreme East side of the overpass a UFO, that had apparently moments before lifted off the ground, because it was very low and moving slowly.  I got on the radio and said, &#34;Does anybody see that?,&#34; and there was no reply.  I worked it out in my mind as to what it could be other than what it appeared to be, and there was nothing of manmade origin that it could be other than some kind of holographic projection from an aircraft or satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to me to be approximately 35FT in diameter. And it was not shiny, nor illuminating light. In fact it was the exact opposite of the typical UFO story, the craft was a color of beige, brownish red. It was sporting and shotrt strut like antenae, that had about a 80 degree bend at the elbow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the harder I looked at it the harder it was to see it in crystal clear clarity, it was as if there was some kind of energy field around it. There existed a certain blurr to it, though not to the point of obscuring it. Again, this is in broad day light and it is at low altitude. The craft actually passed over me, movong from my left to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited off at the next exit and saw it still. It was moving along I-4 toward Orlando. There were condo units that it was moving toward. The whole thing was unbeliveable because it moved low and slow, (i.e., 50 mph?). It move higher than when I first saw it, which is why it appeared to me to have just lifted off. The area where it would have lifted off from is woody.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no strange tales of alien abduction to share, nor  seeing at little green men. I saw what I saw, and it was real, not imagination, and not man made.  Remarkably, I attempted to write it off as anything but what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Barring a holograhic projection, it was an alien craft of unknown origin.  The antenae was the same color as the rest of the craft.  It was by trying to see the see the detail of the antenae, that was on the side of the upper part of it, that I first decerned that it possessed a blurr to it, as if it emanted an energy feild of some sort. and it was just enough blurr to obscure 100 percent visual acuity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was odd to me for is contrary to typical UFO sightings? Was it camouflage? It&#39;s color closely resembled typical Florida roofs and ground terrain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not much is it? But it is what I saw. No big deal. What I found interesting in retrospect is that it apparently did not give two bits for our interdiction capabilities, it was was low, slow, and in your face. Always thought if I ever saw a UFO it would be at night, never did I ever believe that I would see one like I did, in broad daylight near a major city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 35 ft. diameter does seem conducive to what we know of the requirements for interstellar flight, so where does it come from?  To me, in truth, man is technologically speaking, retarded. What we think is laughable. For here is a craft that defies the intellect of our monkey scientists, who would say it does not exist because our understanding prevents it&#39;s existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, the occupants of the the craft I saw possess a different viewpoint.  Most scientists are waking talking  boobs that are indoctrinated in schools of learning from our masters, and therefore possess no independent thought.  They are unable to think beyond the confines of what they were rotely taught, and as such - a typical scientist is a boob.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So spare telling me what I saw was impossible because it defies are science??????   And then these self appointed scientist rubes will say because it defies our monkey science then it must have been imagined?  There is a lot of truth to the original, &#34;Planet of the Apes.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Jenning&#39;s is one of the temple apes apparently.  By the way, shortly thereafter I purchased a camera phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It hovered there for a while and then it started to circle around us various times. Then after circling us it just took off and there was another burst of light. The observers are a lawyer who has had nine years of practice and his wife who is a hygenist at a dentist&#39;s office. Neither has had any background of psychological disorder.<n>

Oklahoma in a small town/city and there is not much to do so I spend a lot of time being bored.  Tonight (04 May &#39;02 around 10:15 p.m.) I was sitting outside since there was nothing overly interesting on TV.  I was watching one of the many of what I assume to be satellites go thru the night sky.  One in particular caught my attention because it seemed much brighter than the rest.  I watched it for maybe 15 seconds or so pass almost directly overhead going south to north. My attention was distracted from it for a couple of seconds by a loud pickup leaving the intersection just to my east going east.  I reached over to the small concrete step for my pack of cigarettes.  I found them quickly because of the moonlight and then it hit me that I couldn&#39;t even see the moon from where I was sitting.  I looked up and there was a really bright light almost directly overhead.  Kind of like the light coming from a full moon.  The only sound I remember hearing was the normal non stop barking of the neighbors dog and myself saying &#34;OH SH**!&#34;.  All at once the light just went out and I was staring at the stars trying to get my eyes to focus.   I&#39;m kind of freaked out from it all and I loaded every gun in the house but there is a about an hour or so I don&#39;t have a clue what went on.  I&#39;m thinking that it took me an hour to load 3 guns but even if I had to drive to Wal-Mart to get shells I&#39;d be back home in 20 minutes tops because its less than a mile away but I have lots of shells on hand and the guns are normally loaded except for a round in the chamber.  Two friends and myself were coyote hunting back in the early 80&#39;s and seen something similar but it was just before daylight.  What is it that I&#39;m seeing?  Living where I do we see lots of strange things we don&#39;t admit we seen but I just don&#39;t know what to think about it all.<n>

(I have never seen Mars before in the night sky and thought that this was one of the planets in the planet alignment that is going on at the moment.) I said to my husband &#34;Look...that must be Mars...thats right the planet alignment is still happening now&#34;.  We have been looking every time we remember to see if we can see the planets align with our naked eyes every time we leave or enter our house.  We have been seeing big bright stars that we are gathering to be the planets that are aligning...but this one was different in the fact that it was a BRIGHT ORANGE!  THat is why we assumed it must have been Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband said &#34;WOW.&#34; thinking it was Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a small but bright white star just above this bright Mars-like planet and it was very close above the star like maybe a centremetre at the most directly above the orange planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was all very interesting but not unusual in the idea that we were looking at what we thought was Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we were almost at the intersection I said &#34;Look-its moving!&#34;...my husband looked up from the road and said &#34;What...Mars?&#34; with a tone of disbelief in his voice, as I would have also if I were him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said &#34;No...the little white star above it!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked and yep it was moving alright.  He didnt believe it until it actually OVERLAPPED THE MARS LIKE PLANET!  then it kept on falling/moving down vertically.  It was descending at a slow steady pace.  We followed it to a darker part of the same road and when we got to the cemetary we stopped but about halfway up the road before the cemetary the white star faded out kinda instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said stop the car when we got to the cemetary a few hundred metres later as I still wanted to stare at the sky (as my eyes had been glued 100% at this white descending star) and I wanted to get out of the car and look in the darkest part of the road where we were now at.  My husband wouldnt let me get out of the car as he feared we might get mugged and rightly so lol.  I also didnt know we were next to the cemetary or I might not have been so keen lol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up again from where the white star had vanished about a quarter up from the bottom of our windscreen (we drive a small car) to look at the Mars like planet again and my husband said that it had gone...I said &#34;it has not&#34; and I looked at where the Mars like planet WAS and it WASNT THERE ANYMORE...I said &#34;What happened to the Mars thing?&#34; and he said with disbelief and incredulity in his voice &#34;DIDN&#39;T YOU SEE IT? It disappeared exactly like the little white one did!&#34;...I said with disbelief in my voice &#34;NO!&#34;  and he said &#34;Yes...I saw it...didnt you see it?&#34;  I said &#34;No...I was too busy watching to see if the little white one would come back&#34;...he said &#34;Well it did exactly the same thing as the little white one did-where is it then...look its not there..I&#39;m telling you it did the exact same thing as the white one did!&#34;  I said...&#34;What it descended vertically and then faded above the horizon in the same place the little white one did?&#34; and he said &#34;Yes!&#34; ON a side note...there was an article in our local paper about LOTS of ppl ringing in to report large orange lights in the skies a few weeks ago...I thought nothing of it as we didnt see them...and secretly I thought that they were silly and were mistaking the planets in the planetary alignment for UFO&#39;s...now I know better!  If we didnt see this ourselves than we would have thought that all those ppl that reported those lights weeks ago were idiots...but now we know that they are not! I read about the other reports from Wodonga and Adelaide on this sight with great amazement!  I didnt know that Adelaide saw those lights a few weeks ago also? But what about tonight?  Did anyone see anything tonight around 6pm? We also saw what we thought were stars too small and too fast and too horizontally moving to be be stars or meteorites on the night of those meteor showers a month or so ago but that was NOTHING compared to this sighting and whereas I could be fairly easily convinced that those were airplanes...I KNOW THAT THIS SIGHTING TONIGHT OF THE ORANGE MARS LIKE PLANET AND THIS SMALL WHITE STAR WAS NOT A STAR OR PLANET-BUT SOME SORT OF UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for airports and military bases...well there is an airport in the opposite direction to where we saw these objects tonight...and there is a military base at Bandiana past Wodonga.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What are these spacecraft/lights? And why so many sightings now?  Is it because of the theory that UFO&#39;s like to try and hide in the sky when there are meteor showers and alignments so you&#39;ll confuse them and think that they are normal occurances?  By the way I dont think that there was a moon tonight...we didnt see one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure if there was a moon the night of the meteor showers but it was also a dark night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I&#39;ll go write a letter to our local paper now...my first letter ever to a paper as I am motivated by the thought that there are other local ppl that might have see this tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way...the mars like planet and star were high in relation to our car windscreen..in other words it was about 3 quarters up the windscreen at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also there were no noises that we could hear and no other effects  these were purely light objects...in other words no &#39;craft or metal etc&#39; could be seen.<n>

I noticed something moving in the sky above.  It was moving in a straight line from approx. WNW to ESE.  It was viewed from about 60 degrees to about 90 degrees vertically(directly overhead), until it was obscurred by the roof of my car.  Without any reference points to determine size/height, I would guestimate that it was somewhere between 300 to 600 feet in altitude.  It&#39;s diameter I can only describe by how much sky it blocked...I liken it to holding up a penny at arms length(I know...not very professional).  It was either relatively close and small, or relatively high and large.  I could not discern which, although I am leaning toward the former.  It&#39;s speed, if the former is in fact correct, I would guestimate at about 110 to 120 Knots(about the speed of a Cessna 172).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell its overall shape (whether it was a disk or saucer) due to my looking up from almost directly below it.  From below, it was circular in outline.  It did not appear to be solid, but more like a ring. It was the exact color of the very clear, blue sky.  At the risk of sounding crazy, I would have to say that it was invisible/transparent, with a slight darkness around the edges.  What I did see was a wake of whitish blurring sky moving along with it, following it&#39;s trajectory, as well as a larger blurry wake(?) being pushed(?) in front. There was also a somewhat darker white blurring towards the sides. I can only liken it to when a ship is cutting through the ocean, as it&#39;s bow pushes through the water, it creates a white foam in front of the ship as the bow parts the water.  The foam travels around both sides of the ship, and then rejoins at the stern, and then leaves more foam behind.    Other than these &#34;wakes&#34;, the object was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As to my background...I am a ((deleted--law enforcemtne)).<n>

It was like an egg shape object about the size of my thumb. I know it could&#39;t be a plane because that circle it made was pretty small. The object continue to travel in a straight line until it disappear. It was below the clouds, and it was a sunny day.There was no sound at all.I pulled my car over during the sighting. It was a busy afternoon, and other people didn&#39;t seem too interested they just went about their business without even looking up.As the trail evaporates it look like chain links.the color of the object was luminous. It reflecting sunlight.Soon after that I went into Best buy, and I heard a plane or two passed over.<n>

Fixed equipment and was heading down the hill toward the southwest, had a beautiful view of the horizon, and noticed what I thought was an aircraft way in the distance with a trail of sparks behind it. Looked almost like a rocket plume behind it. It stayed steady in my windshield, and I almost thought at first it was a large bug splatter, so I stopped on the side of the road and watched it. It was traveling about the speed of a jetliner, from west to east, level about 15 degrees above the horizon. After a few seconds, the plume went away, and the light continued steady towards the east. After a minute, the object turned south and another large shower of sparks and light eminated from the rear, then the object disappeared.<n>

My teenage daughter was asleep in the passenger seat. Just south of Bridport, VT, as I was coming up a rise, a brilliant emerald green circle appeared at the top of my windshield (coming from behind us). As it moved it left a slight green trail behind it. My car&#39;s compass was reading NE, and the object came at a slight angle from right to left, so I estimate it was moving N (this would put it above Lake Champlain). The duration of the event was no more than 1 second. By the time I reached the top of the hill (about 100 yds), the object had disappeared. I had a clear view of several miles, with clear skies.<n>

To one observer, the object was an extremely bright silver teardrop less than 1/6th the thickness of a little finger when held at arm&#39;s length. To the other observer, the object was an extremely bright silver ball with a short comet-like tail. Both agree on the size. The object first appeared at the top of the windshield and looked like it was descending at about 45 degrees or more. At the end of the sighting, the object disappeared as it seemed to level out relative to the horizon. The total time of the sighting was less than one second which indicated to the observers that the rate of speed was much greater than any known craft could attain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two observers had never experienced this type of sighting in their 70 plus years, and neither are involved with drinking or drugs.<n>

Three orange balls appeared in the sky when we were facing North East, at about 45 degrees.  At first the three phenomenon appeared to form an arrowhead type shape, then as the three of us watched, the three balls moved into a perfectly equalateral triangle and kept this shape for the duration, until the botton left first dissappeared, then top soon after.  The last phenomenon then stayed visible for another 30 seconds or so, then finalley faded away.  As they dissapeared, they looked to be almost heading further away from us, at the exact same tragectory as they originalley came.  At first they looked as if they were coming towards us, by the look that they were getting bigger as time passed.  The best description i can come up with is that they looked like balls of fire, yet the transfer of shape, and the holding of an equalateral triangle for at least a minute and a half seems to put forward the idea that these were more than just atmospheric anomolies.<n>

I live near a small airport and frequently see small aircraft like Cessna&#39;s and corporate jets. The weather was clear with a few very high scattered clouds. After several minutes of looking up I observed to the south of me a triangular shaped craft flying from south to north. I estimate it&#39;s altitude at about one half mile and the distance from me of less than one mile. I could see it clearly. The craft itself was triangular with rounded corners, dark in color, didn&#39;t reflect any sunlight and made no noise that I could hear. I would guage the size of it to be similar to a large commercial aircraft. The surface that I saw appeared to be smooth without any lights on it. When first seen I thought it was a kite drifting on the wind but it flew smoothly in a straight line, not erratically like one expects a kite to do. It flew slowly enough that it was in sight for at least two minutes. During this time it maintained a steady flight path and did not change it&#39;s altitude or distance from me. I finally lost sight of it to the north due to the edge of the building I was in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching this craft a small Cessna took off from the airport and reached an altitude of about 1500 feet going south/southwest. The engine on this plane was easily heard. It appeared to be about midway between the ground and the triangular craft but closer. I should note that there are several military bases to the southeast of Kansas City. Perhaps what I saw was an aircraft from one of them. I&#39;ve seen the B1/Stealth aircraft in flight at distances of a 1000 feet and the craft I saw yesterday evening was a little different. What impressed me the most was the rounded corners, total lack of noise, it&#39;s shape and that it didn&#39;t reflect any sunlight at all even though it was in the light of the setting sun. There are lots of small aircraft the use the nearby airport and Kansas City International Airport is about 30 miles north of my position. I assume the craft was tracked on radar by both of them and was visually observed by others on the ground and in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am ((deleted--40 + year-old)), college educated, an((military)) veteran, worked many years in the ((medical)) field and am currently state certified in ((public service)).

Looking up into the cloudless sky, I observed four lights, slightly dimmer than stars, moving east to west at a tremendous speed.  It could have been either four objects in formation or one object with four lights in a chevron pattern. This craft was MUCH faster than an airliner and was out of sight in about seven seconds. There was no sound; in fact, I had noticed before this that there were no planes (large or small) or helicopters in the sky, which is unusual for this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never did find out what caused the flashes.<n>

5/1/02 23:05|Birmingham (UK/England)||Light|10MINS|objects that appear as stars 'dancing' in the sky.|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22723.html|246|ndxe200205| objects that appear as stars &#39;dancing&#39; in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed a white light which appeared at first to be a satelitte moving overhead at great speed,in a southerly direction. However, after it reached an arc of approx 50 degrees from the horizon, the object rapidly slowed and then curved sharply to the east. The object then hovered in a random-dancing motion before halting to a stationary position. Then, to the north of this object, i notice two similar objects, parallel to each other, moving overhead-north at satelitte speed. These two objects then simultaneously changed directions by an angle of approx 40 degrees in opposing directions, appearing to cross paths and flew off, one to the north-west &amp; one to the north east. Another object then appeared close to the stationary object, travelling towards the east. This object looked identical to the first object and was again, moving in a &#39;random zig-zagging&#39; motion, as if dancing in the sky. The brightness of this object then became very intense for about 5 seconds. It then dimmed and &#39;shot-off&#39; at &#39;satillite speed&#39; towards the north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness uses the European style for the date.

I went out my front door and stood on the porch.  I thought it may be a satellite or a planet but the light seemed to bright for that.   I then went into my house to get my camera, I had figured since my eyes wern&#39;t so good I could get a better look with my zoom lens.  It was still there and looked as if  it was trying to hide amoung the stars. I only took one picture not thinking it was a UFO and all it looked like was just a bright light in the sky.  I then dismissed the whole incident until I recieved the picture and negative back. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes, the picture is just a saucer of light, not much definition but the negative showed what it was for sure in my eyes. It was saucer shaped, tilting slightly, enough that I could see a brighter light in the center, possibly pulsating to the edges and a shape more pie shaped.  This all happened in the northern sky and my beliefs are now confirmed.<n>
5/1/02 21:00|Chicago|IL|Oval|3 Minutes|Craft Orbiting the Moon...|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31617.html|248|ndxe200205| Craft Orbiting the Moon...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,  When I started to hear what your guest saw, I knew it was EXACTLY what I saw thru my scope last year in the spring.     I have a 4.5 reflector, observing the moon, which was in half-moon stage.  I saw this object appear from the left... transit to the right and disappear into the dark portion side of the moon.  I could see the object shining against the black of the moon, and followed it move to the right of the moon until it disappeared. I kept viewing the moon...astounded.. and the object reappeared again from the left and traveled across the face toward the right once more!   This damned thing was ORBITING the moon!   It must have been incredibly huge in order for me to have viewed it.  It is described just as your guest had told.  I could not discern a shape, just a dark silhouette on the bright side, and a sparkle of light on the dark side of the moon. From what I could tell, it wasn&#39;t in close orbit to the moon, it was some distance away from it.  It would have to be in order for me to observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an amateur astronomer since a child,  taught astronomy, and have spent countless hours observing the heavens.  But I have never seen anything like this before or since.   It too spooked me. I have told some people, but they dismiss it.  I considered many factors such as a satellite, high flying birds, aircraft, but all do not &#34;fit&#34; in explanation.  I have caught Earthbound objects in the eyepiece, highflying birds and planes, but one tell what they are immediately. But this unknown object behaved in a different manner. And as this thing was viewed twice in a span of three minutes, it must have been orbiting the moon very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is something up there, but it &#34;ain&#39;t&#34; of human construction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted; astronomy organization deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I slowed my driving, because I thought it was an airplane coming in for an emergency landing on Route 340, just south of Rippon, WV and ten miles north of Berryville, VA.  As I slowed, the craft disappeared from sight, even though it was only about 200 yards from me.  I saw no other witnesses.<n>

I do not remember the day; but, it was in 2002 mid-summer Glendale Arizona.  I finished shopping at the Fry’s Grocery store at 51st. Ave/ Olive.  I lived at 51st. Ave. and Bell Ave. which is a straight shot north to home.  I owned a black jeep wrangler at the time which I had the top off.  A beautiful day, I noticed lights through the upper part of my windshield.  There were three, round lights. I watched them as I continued home.  They moved in all directions and at times disappeared and reappeared.  Up/ down, come together and separate. I must of watched them for 20-30 minutes.  When I pulled in my driveway I rushed in to get my binoculars and was unable to find them.  I ran out to see if they were still there and they were. I ran to the neighbors to have them look too; but, no one was home.  I am really sad to this day that I was unable to share/ witness this.  The lights retreated up as far as I could tell and vanished by light or by distance it was hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
