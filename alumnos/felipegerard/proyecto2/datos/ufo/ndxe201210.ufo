Setting completely still and no sound.  Kept driving and saw 2 more, one above gas station and another over a bank on other side of street.  Only several  feet from eachother.  Went about 5 miles down the road and saw 2 more flying very close to each other.  All 6 were not moving setting still and close enough to the ground that I could see their shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were no lights on it or coming from within, but it appeared gray in color at night.  It was moving way faster than a bird could fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew in a straight line north but seemed to bob up and down irregularly. Then suddenly, just before it left my line of sight right above the distant tree line, it vanished for a split second then I saw a brilliant white/yellow flash.  What baffled me most was the shape and size of this flash.  Its shape looked like a pie slice with hard edges and about 5 times the original size of the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of the event was no longer than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a light rain falling and calm winds.

This Light was not as bright as the other one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I headed north I passed the seafood restaurant on the right which is near West Rollingwood &amp; 249 North.  As I came up to the 249 and 1744 split the light started to move east and not as bright.  It was an amber colour with no strobes or marker lights of any kind.

It&#39;s outer edges brighter and almost flame like than the center. Traveling North to South it started to jump around in all directions as if trying to register  coordinates of some sort. With a large burst like streak, it traveled at an extreme rate towards airline flight path and as it traveled closer to one of the planes the illumination from the object suddenly dimmed to nothing.

It was moving parallel with us. It looked to be hundreds of yards long, a few thousand feet up in the air.  We were traveling at 70 mph, and the lights stayed in formation as it moved to the west.  At the location where IS 630 ends at IS 430 the object was no longer to the north, but due west in front of us.  It made no noise, and seemed to be a triangle that covered a large area in the sky.<n>

Myself along with a few neighbors looked up to see a large, round, orange object, moving fairly slow.  It seemed to have a weird haze around it, almost like it was on fire.   It was very bright, silent, and seemed to be twice the size of a 737 airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was dark, it was hard to tell how high it was, but I’m guessing maybe 1,500 feet or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved toward the west.  My son was terrified and demanded to go home and stop trick or treating.  I have seen meteors, shooting stars, the Northern lights, airplanes, helicopters, etc., nothing compares to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only around for maybe 25-30 seconds (I was trying to get my phone for video, but was too late) and then it started to fade in and out, until finally it was completely gone.

As the road came up to the cross road Hirschfield Road, the light broke into two smaller lights and I had to pay attention to the ramp traffic going up to 249 North and the North Bound Service Road,  I looked up and both lights were gone.    There were no clouds that I could see; the Light when at its brightest was just as bright as the 249 streetlights  or brighter.   When they broke into two, I could only see these lights and no stars.  There were no jets in the air around either and neither at marker lights, strobes or red lights as aircraft is required to have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former truck driver and now small business owner.<n>
10/31/12 19:10|Lakebay|WA|Cigar|10 minutes|Three red lights on either end of cigar-shaped craft, large; moved forward, sideways, then back without turning.|11/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94022.html|15|ndxe201210| Three red lights on either end of cigar-shaped craft, large; moved forward, sideways, then back without turning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a UFO the evening of October 31, 2012.   At least it was U by me.  It was very large, cigar shaped (fatter in the middle) with three large red lights on each of the two ends.  I only saw it from one angle.  It moved toward me, it tilted slightly a few times (after I waved at it), then it went sideways, then it went back in the direction from which it had come, without turning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just after 7:00 p.m.  I was sitting in my bedroom with just one low night-light on near the floor, watching TV, with all the windows uncovered so I could see the lights on the islands across from me.  (I live on a huge body of water in the state of Washington, 100 feet above the water, with an almost-180-degree view of water, and islands many miles away from me.)  It was a lovely night, clear, still, well lit by the near-full moon that was just beginning to rise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see planes across the way all the time, over land;  the only aircraft that fly over the water are recreational, flying low, usually only in summer and during the day and usually only amphibian planes.  The only aircraft that fly in my direction are military planes (sometimes) and helicopters (quite often)—and those are really loud.  Once I saw one of those black triangular military craft, flying so low and slow I wondered how it could stay up in the air.  I’ve never seen a military craft fly over this area, staying over the water like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was way different.  So, I was sitting there watching TV and saw out the window some red lights flying slowly, quite low, across the water, coming almost in my direction (if they had continued this course they would have passed me to the North).  There were two groups of three red lights, big, with a wide space between—too wide for them to have been wing lights.  If they were wing lights, the plane would have had to be five or six times bigger than a 747.  Helicopters, I thought.  But I don’t recall having seen red lights on a chopper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two groups of red lights were flying in such synchronization I thought, wow, if those are choppers, the pilots are amazing.  So I went to the window to watch them.  They stopped moving and hovered.  Then I thought, what the heck is that, and went outside in the dark and walked across the lawn to the fence, at the bank above the water.  No noise.  If they were helicopters, I would have heard them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was bright for night, with high white clouds far above.  I could make out a faint outline connecting the red lights, kind of a cigar shape, fatter in the middle. Then I thought, cool, I think it is a UFO.  I put up a hand to beckon them to come closer to me ;-) The red lights began to wobble, as if the “cigar” was tipping back and forth, like plane wings would do if the pilot were goofing off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they moved sideways, and then they started moving back in the direction from which they had come—without first turning around, they just started moving away.  I watched them until they disappeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO or … silent helicopters?  Does the military have silent helicopters with red lights?  It’s possible that my vision fooled me, that I didn’t see the cigar shape—but I doubt it.  If they were indeed two silent helicopters, they flew in perfect synchronization … and, they would have turned around.  So, I’m sure it was a very large cigar-shaped craft with three red lights on each end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m 62, female, retired family law paralegal.  No mental problems.  IQ 138.  This is my first sighting of a UFO.  I wish I had got a photo of it, but I didn’t want to take the time to go back inside and get a camera, wanted to see it for as long as I could. I&#39;ll be watching with a camera nearby in case it happens again!<n>

It was moving across the sky north of my house and was moving from East to West.  It was moving so fast that it traversed the sky in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was approaching the West side of the horizon, it turned its trajectory away from the ground and disappeared  from view.

I looked away, then glanced back up, and noticed that the &#34;star&#34; was moving rather quickly from North to South.  I then noticed 3 aircraft that appeared to either be traveling in formation with the white object, or chasing it, coming up from the North of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds, I could make out individual strobes on the 3 aircraft, and a blinking red light on just one of them.  The original object was solid white, not blinking or pulsing, and did not have any red or green lights to it.  The intensity of the white light never varied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds after this, the aircraft on the Northern end of the &#34;formation&#34; of 3 sped up, and placed itself on the Southeastern tip of the formation, and closest to the white object. About now, I could make out the body of the aircraft that appeared to be in the middle of the formation, and saw reflections from it’s strobe on the bottom of the airframe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects proceeded directly South, with the white light leading the group and the 3 aircraft in apparent formation back to its North, Southeast and West.  The 3 aircraft following the unblinking white light never once overtook the (object), but stayed to its North, East and West, even when the Northern aircraft sped up to overtake the other two!  I cannot say for sure, but, I thought I could make out some type of structure to the object emitting the white light, because of the moon shining onto it.  Also, I cannot prove this, but, it kind of looked like the 3 aircraft in pursuit of the white light were staging themselves in position to visually observe the white object.  That is just my appreciation of what I saw, and how the 4 objects were traveling in relation to one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This did not appear to be a satellite, and it certainly was not a planet or a star!  The entire time I observed the white light, and the 3 aircraft following (or chasing it), was about 90 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting ended when the lights went behinds a light cloud haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded and eloquent.

After a minute she called for both my father and I to come outside.  We came outside and in the sky were two bright lights in the sky coming from the west over the houses across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two lights kept perfect distance from one another and proceeded to come east so they would be located above our house.   One light was leading and the other was right behind it and slightly offset.  They moved at a steady pace that was not very fast but it wasn&#39;t slow either.  The lights stayed the same very bright deep orange, there was no trail or blinking as they moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the lights got to the point where they were right above our section of the street the light that was in front completely stopped.  The light that was trailing behind it continued to move until it was almost next to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point in time a cloud blew in and obstructed our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed to see if the lights were there after the cloud passed but they! were gone.<n>

He picked me up and we got on I-10 to see if we could see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted them about 3 miles outside of Marana heading north.  We pulled off the road.  They had disappeared at that point.  We waited about 10 minutes and then they appeared again.  They appeared and disappeared one at a time. We do not know how many there were.  This lasted for probably 20 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited again for about half an hour and they appeared again off in the distance.  They had moved quite a ways west but it is difficult to say how far.<n>
10/30/12 20:15|Sims|AR|Unknown|5-10 minutes|Flashing white lights on a craft appearing in the east and heading west, appearing to be of a circular shape, silent, slow, diagonal.|11/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93978.html|25|ndxe201210| Flashing white lights on a craft appearing in the east and heading west, appearing to be of a circular shape, silent, slow, diagonal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:15 me, my husband, my sister and my two children witnessed for the third time this year and the second time this month, 3-4 bright, whitish/blue lights flashing in a diagonal line across the horizon in the southeastern sky.  The lights appeared to be circulating around an object and kept perfect spacing between the lights at all times.  The object itself was not seen, though as in a previous sighting, the lights tilted from a horizontal line to a diagonal line while moving from the southwest toward the northeast.  The sightings have all been at nearly the same time of night and always witnessed moving basically from the west to the east.  The disappearance of the object/craft is always at the same point from our perspective, being nearly due east.  Only from the lights can it be assumed that the shape of the object must be somewhat circular, as when it tilts, more lights are visible, as if seeing lights on both &#34;sides&#34; of the craft.  It was slow moving, there was no sound, no vibration, and no visual disturbances or obstructions with the exception of a very few sparse, low lying clouds beneath a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the three adults in this group: we range in age from 60, 56, and 41.  None of us are any more or less than average citizens and none of us uses drugs or any kind of hallucinogens.  We are, quite simply, hard-working country folk who have, for several years, been observing strange, random sightings in the night and day skies.  To us all, it seems as though these occurrences have become much more frequent and with greater diversity in shapes, sizes, light colors and duration.   I will note in all seriousness however, that twice in the past few years I mistakenly asked my son to get a camera and  each time I did this, the objects disappeared and did not reappear for many months.  I will let those of a more evolved intelligence deliberate on why this happens.  However, I will not make that mistake again; as in to attempt to document on film such an object and simply enjoy it for the show it provides us.<n>

I hollered for my husband, but before he got outside the object moved up and away quickly and vanished.  It was like nothing I had seen before.<n>

I once again looked at the screen and the objects were still moving around the &#34;rainbow.&#34;  I did this several times with the same result.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cleaned my lens, as well as checked my camera by taking photos of other things in the area.

My friend asked me what star it was.  I said it didnt look like a star let alone a planet.  So we kept watching for at least another min or two and realized the object was moving up at a fairly good pace.  No other objects were noticed in the sky at the time.  But as we watched my friend turned to me and said wouldnt that be weird if it just disappeared?  I said well yeah!.  Just then we look back and its gone and several planes were seen around the same area. We rushed inside to tell more people but no one wanted to go outside in the cold.  And as we got back, it reapeared and then again disappeared for a second time.  Planes were all over the place flying in different directions and sometimes in a pattern together.  And they all were flying very very slowly.  These planes didnt make hardly a sound though either until they! were right above your head.<n>

Before we turned south, we both looked up in the sky in front of us and saw a bright orange glowing object.  My dad was a pilot for years and I have always watched traffic in the skies but this was like nothing I’ve ever seen.  It made no noise and didn’t appear to be moving. I felt that it was relatively low in the sky which is what got my attention, if it had been a plane, I would think it would have been too low to be over the city. There were no other lights or colors, only the round bright glow of orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, immediately made a U-Turn on the road and parked so that we could get a better look. In most cases, if I see something he just keeps driving but this time his U-Turn was without hesitation. I immediately got out of the car and tried to take a picture with my cell phone but before I could get ready to take a picture, the bright orange glow disappeared, like a candle being put out… the light was gone, but we were both certain that we could still see a round shadow of the object. Within seconds of its light going out, we both watched it move straight up into the sky in a squiggly line until it disappeared, all in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us know that we saw something that was not human in any way. After searching on the internet for explanation, I’ve found other stories and some videos that describe the same thing we saw with pictures of exactly what we saw. I had no way to describe what we saw until I saw them described as orange orbs… I’ve never, in 50 some years, used the word ‘orb’ to describe something but it is the best word and the only way I can explain our event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fascinating:  I feel very lucky to have witnessed this and hope that someday I find out what it was.<n>

The speed seemed similar to jets I&#39;ve seen in the sky, and the altitude I would say was around 15-20,000 feet. It was much lower than a commercial craft, but still fairly high to my eye, and the elevation of the ground where I was lay around 4,000 feet above sea level.  I&#39;d never seen anything like it, and I was alone at the time in a remote area, with the nearest person many miles away. Naturally I was perplexed and a little frightened, but the day went on, and then today I found these two videos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked &amp;quot;contacted by investigator&amp;quot; only if you think it is useful.<n>

I decided to follow it, but it js zoomed off.  I came home and did some research to find that what I had seen others had seen as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, therefore I am convinced that I saw a UFO.<n>

It was somewhere between 1:40-1:45 am.  I was looking at the stars noticing that the sky was very clear.  I was looking at Orion&#39;s belt when a very subtle &amp;quot;shift&amp;quot; or motion near it. It was very subtle, but as I focused my attention on it, I noticed it was a perfect v-shape. My instant thought was that it was geese because of the shape, but as I watched I was thinking to myself &amp;quot;no way&amp;quot; because it was travelling too fast, and the shape was a PERFECT v with no fluctuation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be a solid V-shaped object, based on the subtle line of the edge I could distinguish. I could only for certain see the V edges, and not sure about a third edge. It appeared solid and uniform.  I also could not make out any individual birds or wings, nor was there any sound that you would hear when geese fly by overhead. There was no sound at all.  I have never seen a flock of geese fly so perfectly in a v formation and that quickly.  It was  black on black against the night sky. I could barely make it out and would have NEVER noticed if it hadn&#39;t come into a very small field of vision while I was looking at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even as I told myself it must be geese, something about it... I can&#39;t put into words ....made me feel like it definitely wasn&#39;t. It spooked me. In those few seconds my mind was racing to rationalize it. the V was, however, flying south-east, a direction I assume geese would fly this time of year. But it seemed to be a very large dark triangle/boomerang shaped object flying about the altitude of a regular plane and travelling quickly, maybe similar speed to some planes. I&#39;m not good at giving estimates on size, or even distance in the sky, so could be unreliable on measurements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only got about 4-5 seconds of being able to see it before it blended into the night sky/too far away.  If it were geese, it seems like they would have been low enough to hear AND see (full or nearly full moon), and the speed was too great. I&#39;ve never seen geese fly that perfectly in unison, either.  Maybe it was military aircraft??<n>

They would occasionally blink out, in random order, but were on more than off.  They never broke formation, never moved.  They glowed, but did not shine like a regular light, no light emmited from them, as in they did not light up the sky around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were positioned just above the mountains in a close enough formation for my fist held out in front of me would have covered it.

I emptied my pockets onto my desk and thought that I should go out side before my shower.  As this was the second time in a few minutes that I had thought about going outside, I stopped what I was doing, lit a smoke,  and walked to the back door, opened it, and walked onto the patio.  I noticed that there was a distant rumbling sound that seemed loud, loud  enough that I wondered why I had not heard it inside my house.  The sound was much like the sound of a jet engine, without the usual high pitched whine.  Just the low frequency component of the sound like an Atlas rocket at a distance, or maybe a Harrier jet.  I am a professional audio engineer, and have very good hearing. I&#39;ll also point out that I grew up in the Land Surveying business, working many years in that field before my mid 20&#39;s.  Since the security lighting had activated when I went onto the patio, I reached my hand back inside the door and turned off the light to get a better look at the sky.  Still hearing the rumble, I looked up to see what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above me about 60 degrees above the horizon, and due west, I saw an odd haze that would sparkle light, mostly white, with red and blue green. My first thought was that it was too low to be an airplane, and that it did not appear to be moving fast enough for flight.  The sound was incorrect for it to be a helicopter.  The lights seemed to twist and turn, with no discernible shape.  As the sky was otherwise clear, this confused me.  I noticed that there was an occasional brighter flash in red and then blue green.  The object continued to morph, and as I watched, it solidified into a shape.  It became an equilateral triangle with one end pointed directly south.  The object seemed dangerously close to the ground and just hanging there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With my right hand outstretched to 30 inches, the object was about 9 -12 inches on each side, and about ½ to ¾ inches thick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared along the perimeter of the two leading edges, with the brightest areas at the middle of each of those two edges.  I noticed that the southern most tip of the triangle had a soft white glow, and that the remainder of the bottom was a dull dark matt finish. The light area did not appear to be illuminated, only contrasted to the rest of the surface.   Much to my surprise, the bottom was not flat.  There appeared to be two large rectangular areas, one on each side of the center line, and while one was along the axis of (very slow) travel, the other was at 90 degrees to it.  The rectangular boxes had rounded edges.  I remember thinking, that this was not a good aerodynamic shape. Another incongruity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the position of the object stabilized, the lighted edges were barely visible from my perspective, but the occasional brightening of the nearest mid-side light was red.  I thought, maybe they were FAA lights, so I waited for the next flash.  The flashing did not have consistent timing.  The next time it was green, and still hazy in a digital sort of way.  Checking the far side lights, I realized that they were also inconsistently colored also..  It was more like the lights were displayed as camouflage, something that would appear correct to the casual observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wanting to take a photo, I realized that I did not have a camera on me, and that in order to get a photo I would have to get back into the studio, grab my phone off the desk and turn it on.  By this time, the object was already 45 degrees south of my position and I realized that I did not have time to get to the camera, and I decided to just continue watching.  The object continued south and within a few seconds had moved to the horizon, the sparkle growing ever smaller and less distinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have some surveillance cameras located around my house, and I later checked to footage.  I left the studio at 11:15 pm CDT to go outside, and the event lasted barely 2 minutes.  I saved the recordings from the system and looked at it later, hoping that some more information could come from it.  The studio camera has an audio channel, but the camera over the patio does not.  I could not detect any low frequency information from the sound track, as the noise floor on such systems is rather high.<n>

Next thing you know, one by one the dots flew away FAST.  They flew away like 5 seconds apart but when they did, the sky lit up.

Where I could see the fireworks, the object was to my back, in a total opposite direction.

Downtown Nashville TN. While stopped at a traffic light on the corner of 2nd ave.  And Korean veterans pkwy.  I saw a white light coming towards me traveling in a southwestern direction.  At first i thought it was an airplane but then i noticed it was lower than it seemed.  There was a tall building in front of me and i thought since it was of normal airplane altitude, it would go behind the building, but it went in front of the building. S o then i knew it was quite a bit lower than it seemed.  Maybe 100 feet off the ground.  I was able to get a pretty good look at it considering it was quite low.  It looked like a very small lunar lander, maybe 3 to 4 feet across.  It seemed to have very stable flight, very smooth.  Ruling out a flying toy or something like that.  It was traveling at about 30 to 40 MPH.  The street light turned green and i started moving while continuing to watch it as it moved passed me still traveling in a southwestern direction.   I then stopped at the next light and looked for it again and found it on the same path but climbing higher.<n>

I happened to look up at the sky and through a clearing in the clouds witnessed what appeared as two bright, orange glowing orbs flying in formation at a steady speed to the North-East. They did not make any sounds as attributed to regular aircraft.  There were no blinking lights as you would most likely see on regular aircraft.  I observed them for approximately 30 seconds moving through the clouds (the clouds would obscure them at times) until they started to move behind the buildings in the area and I lost sight of them.  As I tried to move to the other side of the street, I witnessed the third glowing orb flying the in the same direction, but far behind the other two bright glowing orbs.  At that point I called my brother in the Westchester Square area of the Bronx, and asked him to access the rooftop of his building to see see if he could observe what I was looking at.  He saw all three glowing orbs in the direction of Parchester as they flew in the same northeasterly direction, and continued to observe them until he lost visibility due to the cloud cover.  He also did not notice any blinking lights or sounds. I was a practicing amateur astronomer for several years, and I would not report this if I knew they were ordinary astronomical phenomena.  This was actually very unusual and I have never witnessed anything like this before.  Thank you.<n>

They appeared in groups of two to three.  The moon was bright and to the right of where the objects appeared.  They flew in the same path and were a pulsating red/orange color.  There was no noise with these objects.  They all followed the same direction and went directly over where we were standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the objects just seemed to disappear about the same location to the rear of our house. The objects seemed to move very fast with no noise and in the same direction.  I attempted to take pictures with digital camera but the quality is poor and does not show what i saw.<n>

This happen about 9pm. wish there would have been something on the news, i am so curious about what those lights were. A lot of people stopped to watch them.<n>

It was so quick I did not have much time to focus, there was no sound at all. There was a greenish/ white light at the beginning of it; and it kinda had a tail ,like a commit. It went in a straight line above the tree&#39;s rather close. All this leads me to believe it was not any aircraft, commit or meteor but I do not think anyone else saw this anomaly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft maintained an altitide of approx 500ft. I was able to observe the object closer (300 yds) with a handheld single lense binocular (type used at gun range), I saw the outline of small rectangular windows on the craft, the object also looked as it was slanted at an angle (front being lower than the back).  As a private pilot I can confirm this had no identifying features (tail, tail number, directionational lights (green/red, etc...), the blinking red lights were very bright and blinkined out of sequence.

It was much larger than any shooting star or meteor that I had ever seen.  There was no tail and no noise whatsoever.  It appeared to be somewhat low in the sky; the moon was out and visible, but it was cloudy and no stars could be seen.  This object was far below the cloud cover.  I half expected it to crash off to the west or hit the tree tops.  I ran to follow it as it moved, but my view was obscured by trees, and I lost sight of it.  There were no blinking lights and no real specific shape to it.  Any suggestions?<n>

The fireballs were in an inverted triangle.  Orange and round eminating brightly in a dark area over the park.  The lower single fireball accelerated away to the east first, with the top right departing second. This was in a northern aspect.  The third fireball remained constant and we even drove to a darker area in our car turned off our lights and watched it.  It then regressed north and then to the east as the other two had.  This happened over a five minute period.

Sky was clear with many stars of different brightness seen.  I saw two stars that were moving faster than the surrounding field of stars so I thought they were satellites in a tandem orbit coming from the horizon just over Anacapa Island from Ventura Pier.  I watched this formation of two objects spread about 5 degrees apart in the sky without any odd move ments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a flare came out of the top star and it moved quickly across and stopped with an opposite thrust.  Flares appeared to be larger that the light.  At first my girl friend could not see them but when it flashed again she said holy shit was is that?  They were amazing to see. They showed intelligent calculated movements. I was thinking it was the Dragon Spacex Moving away from the space station but with the naked eye seeing thrusters, no way.  I have seen the space station before while at the beach but it was muc! h brighter.  Any thoughts?  Total observation time about 25 mins before they disappeared at Zenith or straight up.<n>

I was scared to go in field?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone kind of just dismissed that I saw this redish orange fireball in the sky early saturday morning. I am not sure on the exact time, it was still dark out.  It was around 3am-6am, not sure-I did not write down anything about what I saw that morning?  I am sure someone people don&#39;t believe what we saw! I actually had a hard time processing it myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday I hardly remembered seeing it? Then I looked up in the sky and I could see it again run through my head!  I got online and realized more like myself have seen the same thing, Thank God-I am not alone! Makes you want to find more people that saw it too. Here is my sighting...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside on the back porch looking right in the direction of it!!! I witnessed it do something really strange! It was just going right through a couple of tree&#39;s. I immediately stood up and jumped on a chair to see it over the fence. Once standing I saw it going in a straight line, it had to be flying low because I could see it sitting down. I watched it go through the tree&#39;s then it made a very sharp turn up and back down-Almost like a 90 degree angle, then back down to the ground, field.  Then I did not see it anymore. My family thinks I saw a GOSH DARN-SHOOTING STAR, I can for certain tell you,  IT WAS NOT A FALLING STAR!!!!!!!!  Falling stars go down, and they’re white, blue, and do not defy gravity-this redish orange ball one did!!!   I ONLY SAW 1 fireball not 3 like most people. I STOOD ON A CHAIR AND I BELIEVE I SAW IT LAND.!!!! I have not gone out into the field to look if anything was their? I don&#39;t know why? I think I am still having a hard time believing wh! at I saw! I am scared to go look? I can&#39;t believe that I am writing to a ufo site? Never thought that would be me!!! I can tell you this much I have never seen anything like that in the sky, EVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!<n>

They kind of looked like flames, slowly moving across the sky. They did seem to flicker but remained relatively bright, until they disappeared in the sky, maybe in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was pretty much completely calm outside and there was no noise at all, no planes, just silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a clear view, we live on the side of a small mountain and we were on our deck, watching them in a clear expanse of sky. At the same time, we were able to see a nice bright ring around the moon, kind of in the partly cloudy sky I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very eerie in a sense and certainly, in my 44 years, have never seen anything like it.<n>

Star sized, clear night, 2 witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early in the morning of October 27 a friend and I had stayed up late and were preparing to go to bed when I noticed far out beyond the trees an object about the size of a star way out in the distance.  This object what flashing red, green, and yellow lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first i just assumed it was a plane as there are quite common in our area.  But after looking at it for some time and realizing it was not moving I decided to take a closer look.  We saw a triangular object some distance away beaming out lights of several colors.  Not consistently either like you would be on a plane.  And at times the object would almost seem to disappear but then would reappear always in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who was with me and been in the military for several years and we both agreed this was no plan or satellite as it had not moved what so ever.  We definitely new it wasn&#39;t a plane when a commercial jet proceed to fly underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the object for about 30 min before gro! wing tired and going to get.  It never moved besides disappear and reappearing in the same spot.  It was a totally clear night.  The object was very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could&#39;ve possibly been in outer space.  No photos were able to be taken<n>

When I first looked at it I thought it was the northern star because of how bright and big it was.  Then as I looked towards the right of the object I noticed a red pulsating light.  At first I thought it was just a plane going past, but then I realised that it wasnt moving.  My mom stopped the car and we just sat their in awe.  We were watching it for a good couple minutes and I decided to whip out my Ipod and film everything we were seeing. As the few minutes went by the bright light suddenly began to fade immensly. I screamed at my mom, &amp;quot;The lights going away, its dimming&amp;quot;!  And then it started to slowly move to the left. My mom and I began to follow it with our car.  All of a sudden it shot so fast behind a tree, that we had to speed up greatly to get in view of it again.  When it shot super f! ast it looked like a mdoern day deciption of a UFO. It was very slim and oval like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got in view of it again, on the other side of the tree, it was now giving off the very same bright light that it was giving off when we first saw it.  My mom decided to pull up in a little parking area and get closer to it. I on the other hand was freaking out.  I told her no. I was afraid of getting abducted because of all the stories I have read about things like that happening. But my mom was not scared, she was facinated and incomplete awe.  As we were wathching it she was telling me, &amp;quot;I have never seen anything like it.&amp;quot;  As we were sitting their, the UFO was going in all sorts of directions, kind of like it was scanning the are.  Then all of a sudden it stopped, and soon enough it started coming towards us. I was freaking out and telling my mom to &amp;quot;Go, get out of here! Go!&amp;quot;. I was literally crying tears of freight. But within a few minutes it began to turn around and slowly turn around and go the opposite direction. The white light began to immensly dim again but the red light was still pulsating through all of this. At one point when we were so close to it, it looked as thoughs omething was hanging down from it. My mom thinks that maybe it turned and as we could only see the red light, the white end light of it was hanging down as it turned. We really are not sure what it was hanging.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were sitting their watching all of this occur, I remeber telling my mom a few times &amp;quot;Look how big it is! it looks like a car&amp;quot;.  And let me tell you it was huge! I also remember a hearing it when we were very close to it. As it was coming closer I began to hear it even louder. It sounded like the noise a helicopter gives out. But the thing was..it was NOT a helicpoter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was going the other direction, my mom backed out of the parking space we were in and began to follow it. It was moving at a farily steady pace at this point. As we were on the street of our house already, my mom stopped the car at the side of the road and we just sat their watching it. The bright light began to dimmer again, and the red light went away. As we sat their I remember there was one point in which the light was gone completely and we couldnt see it anymore. But then it lit up again. We watched it as it went higher and higher up into the sky. It sat in the same exact spot for the rest of the night until we went to bed. If any other person didn&#39;t see what we saw and just looked up in the sky at the moment, they would have thought it was a little star because thats what it looked like. A little dim flickering star up in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience will stay with my mom and I for the rest of our lives. I have always believed in UFO&#39;s..but my mom on the other hand, has not. She doesnt believe in UFO&#39;s, ET&#39;s, or even the paranoraml. She is a &amp;quot;I&#39;ll believe it when I see it&amp;quot; type person. And after tonight..she whole heartedly believes that wer are not alone in this universe. A few times throughout the video we shot, you can clearly hear us saying, &amp;quot;Its just a helicopter&amp;quot;, then &amp;quot;No, its not&amp;quot;. We were in denial and didnt know what the heck the thing was. It was def not a plane or a helicopter. There were planes flying throughout the sky while we were watching the UFO. They looked NOTHING alike. All in all, my mom and I know what we saw last night..and no one can take away that experience form us.<n>

It came from a western direction and proceeded north.  The lights twinkled and (to the naked eye)there seemed to be a silvery ring around the outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first its flight seemed steady.  We then saw it stop or hover for 10-20 seconds, and then slowly the light disappeared as if it was vanishing or turning on an angle where the light could no longer be seen.   There was no sound.   Our neighbor was visiting with us on our westerly facing front porch when this occurred.  There were three witnesses in total.<n>

I posted this vid on youtube tonight, I&#39;ll describe it here (not monetizing it at youtube, nor anywhere, I am an enthusiast of ufology, I&#39;ve heard of you, I respect you.  And I am not drunk.  Yay!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just looked up the properties of the short vid, that&#39;s the time and date it gave me.  I thought it was November, apparently, twas October 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out my back door, I have a large yard with a woods edge at the rear, deer come each day, I think I was testing the zoom and focus.  Canon powershot 12 mega pix, not an expensive cam, the original on this computer is more striking that what appears in the youtube upload, don&#39;t know why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walked out the door, saw nothing, focused on rear clearing, stopped film.  When uploaded, saw this thing.  Looks like 2 birds mating, or 2 bees doing something.  But it is about 2 or 3 feet wide, gray top, lighter rear half, strange motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had opened a glass screen door, thought maybe it was a refraction.  Have glass windows on the left as I walk out, but I don&#39;t see a connection to my movement and the movement of this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tell ya, when I re-looked at it the other day on this machine, I said, &#34;Oh My God.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Hungarian GF was here, I showed it without comment twice.  She works in the garden over which it was, and she asked me, &#34;Do they live here?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange, a bit disturbing.

Whenever I saw the same color, same shape object the previous two times, it was somewhat steady like a plane, or stationary like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, this morning, the same orb shape twinkling orange object was flying (?) literally shore line between Oili and Jaws.  It bounced around sporadically, I really had to watch to make sure it wasnt a plane, but the flight pattern was only a few hundred feet above the cliff side the whole time.  Seemed like a really tiny green orb popped in there for a minute then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surprisingly it looked as if it was diving down into the water at Jaws because it descended below the tree line and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This definitely is not the first sighting here in Peah&#39;i, just a first for me.  Seems to happen very regularly in the evenings coming from a north-north east direction from Hookipa to Huelo, North Shore Maui.<n>

Appeared to be flying in some sort of formation, (not military like) all flying in the same direction.  Duration approx 3-4 minutes.  They appeared to rise from the treetops and were approx less than 10,000 ft in the air.  As they continued flying they rapidly went higher into the sky and one by one vanished…sort of scattered, no formation.  They were in the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw three or four orange globes fade in out of nowhere in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico while my husband was making a fire.  Each time I saw one I told my husband, but by the time it registered with him to look the globes had faded back into nothingness.  This phenomenon was not airplanes, lanterns, fireworks, flares or shooting stars.  We saw airplanes that evening and I would say the size of the globes appeared several times larger than any airplane lights we saw.  These lights faded in and out without sound in just a few seconds.  At about 21:30 we both saw a white light appear just as the orange ones had.  It came out of nowhere and looked like it was coming right at us getting larger and larger then fading back out.  It made no sound.  We tried to explain this to ourselves as a shooting star coming directly at our line of sight, but! does not seem likely. We could not tell the distance from the beach.  None of these were boat lights as they were too high over the water to be such.  The night was clear and the moon although not full lit up the beach very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just before a rain storm. I was standing at the top of my street since it has a pretty good view over Manchester Road and out West towards Weidman and Mason Road. Black clouds were gathering and so I was watching. Something caught my eye to the right and I focused on what it was. It appeared to be two black objects flying in a circular pattern, almost parallel to each other. It wasn’t birds, it wasn’t clouds and it wasn’t just something caught in the wind. At least one of them I could tell had a definitive disk shape. It was hard to keep a steady view of the objects because they were flying through the low lying storm clouds. Just before they disappeared completely from view, one of them peaked directly through the clouds and it was then I could see the disc shape. I did not notice any lights, I did not notice any type of rotation of the objects, only that they were flying in a circular pattern. Their movement wa! s fast, about the speed of a helicopter circling an area. It definitely was not something natural. Right after they disappeared from view the wind picked up and the rain started to fall. I tried to look further, but could not see anything any more. It was a very shocking experience. It only lasted 30 seconds to 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were headed in one direction; south. They were high in the air; if I had to guess I would say about 3000 feet. They were very reflective which is how I spotted them to begin with.  As they flew across the sky they were headed toward Lake Matthews. One split off from their formation and led the other two. About five seconds after that I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first UFO sighting and have heard of many that are not recorded.

I looked up toward the top of a tree that was changing colors in the autumn and noticed a fairly low flying silver object that I first took for an airplane, since it had the sleek, cigar shape of an airplane’s fuselage.  Normally I wouldn’t have even noticed it, because it made no noise at all. I had my glasses on, so I was able to see it well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as it soundlessly glided in a southern direction through the sky, and I tried to identify whether it was a larger jet that perhaps had taken off from the airport, or a smaller aircraft.  It had no contrail, so I looked for its wings and to my surprise it had none.  It either greatly sparkled in the sun, or was emitting fluctuating bright light. I saw no windows on the object.  Then, I got concerned thinking it might be either a large missile directed at some point in the USA or a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it headed out of sight, I began to experience a strong feeling of dizziness, unbalance, and a general feeling of malaise which passed in several minutes after coming indoors.<n>

It is a very bright light and low in the sky.  Through binoculars it is a bright glowing green color. It will move very slowly at times from side to side, up and down and back and forth. Sometimes it moves a little faster when moving.  The photographs I took show the object in colors of green, purple, pink and white and in different shapes. When I am outside it doesn&#39;t move as much. When I go inside and look at it from the window, it moves a lot more. This goes on for hours.<n>

I was hearing many dogs in the area barking. 10 to 12 I would say.  All around, they were not stopping at all.  My dogs were barking and they were inside the house.  In the western sky I witnessed a light appear.  It was red then white then a light color yellow. And it was rotating in that color scheme very fast.  Right after the light appeared the dogs were all very quiet.  This 1st event lasted 15 seconds.  The light then disappeared.  At first I thought it was a planet but it was not. After the light disappeared my dogs and the other dogs barking like before started up again. This time it seemed louder and more aggressive.  Then the light came back after  45 seconds after the 1st one went out.  All the dogs went very quiet.  This time for only 5 seconds the light was there.  Then it disappeared.  This time the dogs did not bark again and the area became very quiet and there was nothing making a sound.  The entire event was may be 3 m! in in length.  From the dogs barking to the lights coming  and going to the dogs not making a sound.<n>

They disappeared and reappeared seconds later, this time they looked organic like a fire light.  Again they disappeared and reappeared miles away in the south-eastern sky.  Again the fire looking light disappeared and reappeared in the north-eastern sky. Always they were a pair and moved in a pair.  I could hear a pin drop that clear night on October 24Th at apx 10PM.  I ran into the house and retrieved my camera only to miss a clear shot by seconds.  It could not have been a helicopter or airplane, I would have heard the engines.

All of a sudden, my friend said “Look at that UFO!” I of course laughed thinking he was joking and I looked up in the sky, Northwest of where we were standing.  That’s the direction he was pointing from where we were.  There was a figure, that seemed saucer shaped (it was hard to make it all out because of the clouds) and it was flying, back and forth, up and down, sideways, and even went in circles and upside down. It had no particular pattern to it.  It was a self-illuminating object, and it had a green tint around it.  The object seemed rather large and pretty low to the ground. It rose not too many miles above the trees, from what it appeared.  It wasn’t extremely high, but it wasn’t much higher than a low plane coming closer to the ground to land.  It seemed much larger than any airplane; probably five to ten times bigger. I couldn’t keep my eyes off o! f what we were seeing. The way it was flying was unlike anything we had ever seen. The color of the glow made it even weirder. We were baffled. There was no way it was a plane, helicopter, or anything like that. It wasn’t a shooting star or comet. It wasn’t a light shining from anywhere either. This lasted at least 3 hours that I am aware of. I watched it off and on for about an hour. I’d come outside every few minutes, and it was still in the same area, flying around pretty fast. We left his house to go somewhere. I got him back home close to 1am. The object was still flying around in the same big area! It remained in a pretty clouded area as well. No one else was outside this late at night, except cars passing down Rainbow Lake rd. So we had no one else to go tell.<n>

No illuminations, just simply hovering without a sound.  From the lights reflecting off the parking lot, me and two friends were able to identify there was something above the eparking lot.  The lights from the parking lot made it hard to see but I could only identify it to be about the size of an suv and hovering in our immediate location.  We marveled and went into the theater.  In duration; we watched it for about five minutes I walked closer and around to get a better view but could only see, effectively the underside of something.  It was stationary in the sky the whole time.  It was gone after the movie.<n>

Five lights came one one at a time in a perfectly straight horizontal line until they were all on, they stayed on for a second or two, then they all went out at the same time.  A couple of second later, another series of 5 lights came on in the same manner slightly higher and to the right of the first set of lights. These lights were orangish-yellow, with the look of a lantern, or firelight.  They were perfectly clylindrical, with no tails or streaks of any kind.   They were quite high in the sky, almost as high as the moon, which was directly above me at the time.  There are no hills or buildings that they could have been on.  They did not move or blink, they just turned on then they were off and gone.  I tried to get my camera on, but they didn&#39;t stay on long enough.   Less than a minute after I saw the first sets of lights, I saw them come on again in roughly th! e same area, but this time only two lights came on in the first, lower set and one in the higher, second set. I pulled my car off to the side of the road to get a better look, and try to get a pic, but once again I didn&#39;t have time.   I did get to take a better look at the sky and there were no aircraft of any kind to be seen, and not a cloud in the sky.  I consider myself a rational person, and not one to believe in aliens or anything of the sort.  I&#39;m am a college student who is soon to be a registered nurse.  This is the second time I have lights since I moved to the area 4 years ago, though the last time they weren&#39;t in the same formation.  It wasn&#39;t until I saw online that there were many reports of these kind of lights that I even considered reporting it anywhere.  I wish I could come up with a rational explanation, but there isn&#39;t any, I saw what I saw.<n>

I was concerned as I thought it was an airplane approaching our location directly instead of down the coast line to the airport.  The lights all went out as quickly as they arrived.   We thought perhaps it was a cloudy night however we can see the stars. The lights appeared again higher and much more to the right of our location and again went out.  Lights reappeared in the first location coming on one at a time.  They were bright enought to be reflected upon the ocean water.  We continued to watch for some time but did not see the same sort of light display.  It was definitely not a plane and we are at a loss to label exactly what we did see.<n>

I accessed this site several years ago to see if someone else has seen this phenomena.  Tonight was the first time we have seen these lights for several months,and no one we have spoken to has seen them. We spend a lot of time on our back porch which faces due East, and have been observing this &amp;quot;light show&amp;quot; for several years now. We have never heard any sound of overhead aircraft, seen strobe lights from aircraft, or any such visible or audial evidence of any terrestial craft involved with these sightings.  The duration of the &amp;quot;orange globes&amp;quot; is usually a matter of 1, 2 or 3 seconds, at most. Usually they appear in singular, but tonight we saw several &amp;quot;batches&amp;quot; of 3 to 4 at one time. As an addendum, last year about this time, we saw a series of these orbs passing from North to South, and then turning to the right, and headed West out of sight. These lights individually stayed visible for relatively longer periods of time than the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; sightings we&#39;ve had. In other words, they stayed visible for periods of up to 20 seconds, whereas the lights we usually have been observing last approximately 2 to 3 seconds, at most. We would be most appreciative if anyone could enlighten us at to the origin and substance of these lights, as they have been puzzling us for quite some time. Thank you very much.<n>

They each would stay one for about 3 seconds before the next one would light.  Then all of a sudden there were 4 or 5 in a diaganal line lighting up very fast and in the matter of 2 seconds they were all the way on the other side.  The did not move like a plane or a helocopter, they just seemed like they were hovering.  The lights from the distance we were from them were like big headlights from a car.  It has happened 3 nights now and we are ging to film it tonight. Please send someone to see this. IT IS NOT FLARES&amp;gt;<n>

Lasted about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright orange light appeared just above the horizon (12 o&#39;clock position), facing east, towards the ocean from Highway 17 Business in Restaurant Row.  It disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner than it disappeared, another bright orange light appeared (2 o&#39;clock position).  If this was a plane, there was no way it could have traveled across the sky to reach this new location in that short of a time span.  The 2nd orange light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few seconds another bright orange light appeared above the last position. I had to look up to see this third bright orange light.  No way for a helicopter or a plane to make such a vertical ascent in only a few short seconds.  This third light also vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time all 3 witnesses (myself and 2 co-workers) are watching this unfold.  After the third light vanished, in roughly the same position, 4 bright orange lights appeared in a perfectly straight horizontal line, side by side.  This lasted only a couple of seconds unti! l they slowly faded out, one at a time, from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We cannot explain this.  As far as all 3 witnesses are concerned, this was not any type of plane, helicopter, hot air balloon, or aerial vessel that we have ever seen.  There was no sound, nor did they move in any direction once the lights appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They simply appeared and then vanished, only to reappear in different spots, and then as a whole formation at the end.  This entire process lasted about 30 seconds.<n>

Orange balls of light would appear and disappear in the sky above the ocean.  Some orange balls of light would appear lined up side by side horizontally as many as 4.  Lights darted across the sky at quick speeds.  At the end of our observation, a series of twinkling white lights appeared as a large cluster and faded away.<n>

There would be from one to five lights within seconds of the first light.  The lights would last around three seconds each time.  They moved but very little.  Each time these lights were seen, it was just after spotting very faint white lights moving very high in the sky.  The white lights did not blink and moved across the sky over the ocean from east to west.  The moon was out and the weather was clear.  There were a few high clouds covering about 1/8 of the sky.  The temperature was about 65 degrees.  The winds were calm, the dew point was about 61 degrees and the humidity was about 96%.  The barometric pressure was 30.14 and falling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just shrugged it off like it was some kind of coast gaurd training thing perhaps. Well lastnight I was in the same place same time roughly and I seen the lights again this time it was 2 to 4 lights on the south end of the water followed by 3 lights in the middle going tto the east and then 4 to 6 lights to the north all making a triangular position.  As soon as I seen the first lights I hollered for my wife to bring the video camera.  I think we got about 50 seconds of the lights. They seemed to be lighting up off and on back an forth at each other. Then they moved closer to shore and they were so bright and low I could se! e the lights shining off the ocean. After that happened all at once it was gone and over. No noise no nothing. I tried ruling out that it was landing gear lights. Planes lights helicopter lights etc. But I know bwtter then that and I can tell the difference. My only conclusion is maybe the govt. Has some kind of noiseless cloaked airplane they were testing or it was indeed a ufo. Soon as I get home I will post tthe videos but if you type in google search &amp;quot;weird orange lights over myrtle beach&amp;quot; there are websites and videos dedicated to what we saw. We are leaving Saturday morning but I will be watching tonight and tomorrow night to see if I can get another view of this. There was no sound and the lights seemed like they were attached to some sort of craft but if that is so then the crafts were different in size because some had lights that lit up in a line that had 4 or 6 lights in a row.  When I get home I will submit the video, I can&#39;t here because all I have is! my iPad and I don&#39;t have a card reader for it.<n>

We dropped our gear to make a fire and surveyed the night sky.  To our surprise we saw some orange glowing globes floating in a fairly straight line down the coast.  They were approximately 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They disappeared so quickly that it did not register with us whether or not the globes were moving, just maybe fading in and out in their own space.   When some of them disappeared a flicker of bright white light flashed close to where they had been although no noise was heard at all.  These phenomena occurred within a short time with a total of about eight globes appearing and disappearing.  These globes were not airplanes, lanterns, fireworks, flares or shooting stars.  We saw airplanes and shooting stars during the evening which did not compare to the size of the globes.  The globes appeared to be! at least ten times larger than the shooting stars and had no tail.  They were several times larger than the lights of any of the airplanes we saw.   We could not tell the distance from the beach.  They were not boat lights as they were too high over the water to be such.  The night was clear and the moon although not full lit up the beach very well.<n>

As I came down two steps, I looked south beyond our neighbor&#39;s house and saw a disk-shaped object.  It looked like a big black oval in the failing evening light.  I did not see any lights on it.  It flew horizontally.  I only saw it for about 5 seconds before it disappeared into the tree line.  From our house, we can hear when the larger jets land and take off from Columbia Metropolitan Airport.  This object made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was at approximately mile post 28 near the Richmond Airport.  It was 4:14 pm.  A perfectly clear, sunny day with a gorgeous blue sky.   I assumed it was an airplane and turned for a quick look.  It is thrilling to watch the big jets cross over the highway.  Except this was not a jet.  It was round and silver/white like a perfect mylar balloon with absolutely no markings.  It was very large and was only about 200 feet above the ground.  I looked at the car next to me and as the driver passed me and saw it he pulled hard right across two lanes of traffic and stopped on the shoulder of the highway.  I slowed way down and watched as the circle dropped to about tree height and held position.  As I got closer I was anxious about driving by it but before I reached it, it pulled up a bit and quickly crossed the highway and dropped behind the trees quite rapi! dly.  The most disturbing vision was of the undeniably huge circular shadow it cast and watching that shadow move across the highway in front of me.  At least two other cars pulled over and watched.  I was too afraid to stop.  I have been trying to explain this away to myself and others since it happened but that shadow refuses to tuck itself away in my mind.<n>

It was stationary for 30 min. When a white cloud passed over it, it took on a dark color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on a bench at a bus stop on the corner of Palm Ave. and Saturn Blvd. by a gas station and a 99 cent store near Imperial Beach Ca.  I was facing south toward the Mexican border and saw a UFO up in the sky in a southeast direction.  It was Wed. Oct 24, 2012 at about 10:30 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four of us who saw it.  One was a Caucasian woman in her early 60’s, grey hair, somewhat over weight, casually dressed, wearing a hat and walking with a limp.  There was also a young African American male about 17 years old, and another young Caucasian man in his late 20’s or early 30’s waiting at the bus stop.  The latter stated that he had been studying UFO’s across the country and thought this might be a comet because the UFO appeared to consist of two parallel lines of light next to each other, connected to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The woman stated that it looked like a silvery color at one angle.  At first glance it looked like a speck of light, but upon further observation I saw that it was a solid object.  When it went behind a white cloud it took on a dark color.  It also appeared to be staying in the same place for about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both the man and the woman stated that they saw it move. If it did move, it appeared to move inland in a northeast direction, (more east than north) in a very slow way, measured as a couple inches from where I was standing.   I did see the two parallel lines of light. In fact all three of us agreed on that.  The young teenager thought it might be a balloon.  But in my experience this was no balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 58 yrs. old and this is the first time I’ve ever seen a UFO.<n>

I saw a shiny metallic object hovering over an undeveloped stretch of land southeast of my car and west of the Santa Rosa Indian Reservation.  It appeared to be about the size of a helicopter cabin, shaped a bit oblong and maybe 500 feet above ground.  I did not stop my car but slowed down to about 40 mph so I could study the object.  It was definitely not a helicopter as it had no rotors or tail.  A car came up behind me so I sped up as no turnouts were nearby and lost sight of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Still very dark and I had been driving for about a half hour, taking over for Don, my partner, who was asleep in the passenger seat.  The land is flat and I can see for miles ahead and behind as I drive on I-70 near Limon.  I come up behind an 18-wheeler truck still several car lengths ahead of me.  I look in the rear view mirror just to make sure there are no other cars coming as I prepared to pass the truck, (almost as an after thought because there have been no other cars for miles).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wow!  There must be a huge truck behind me all of a sudden. The two headlights are higher and wider apart than even most big trucks and very close to my car, as if they are sitting on my trunk.  And there are no other lights lining the cab or decorating the doors or bumpers like most big rigs.  No noise. It was there so suddenly. I thought, &#34;Well, he certainly wants to get around both me and the truck ahead of me, so I&#39;ll just let him pass,&#34;  but he didn&#39;t.  So, I get in the left hand lane and so do the two big lights behind me, simultaneously with my movement, keeping the same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pass the truck in front, move over to the right to let Mr. Big Lights by and there is nothing except the truck I passed and me for miles. No exits, nothing stopped on the side.  The lights just disappeared as they were behind me in the left lane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept blinking my eyes, looking in the rear view mirror...nothing.  I know it was real, but it was the most unreal experience I&#39;ve had in my life.<n>

We had been sitting in a car for about 5-10 minutes and after already appreciating 2 lower flying airplanes in the night sky, we didn&#39;t know what to take of the object we were about to see. It became visible once passing a tree line a little in front of us. A round, bright orange orb-like object slowly hovered across the sky.  Unlike any other aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen, the ONLY visible part of it was the one bright orange glow it gave off.  The light didn&#39;t flicker or dim, it was just a constant glow that moved eerily slow across the sky.  Even outside of the clouds in the clear sky it appeared only to be an orange glowing orb with a small trail kind of as if it was on fire.  As the object moved in the opposite direction of us it appeared to be losing most of its orangish glow and turning yellow/white and then disappeared very suddenly which also threw me! off.  Although I&#39;m a believer in ufos and extraterrestrial life, im not one to be easily convinced that something is extraterrestrial nor would I concider reporting anything, but this sighting was way too abnormal for me to convince myself otherwise.<n>

I checked on them from various windows in my house and they were the same from each one.  As I was watching them, they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I also had a similar sighting on Saturday (10-20-2012)evening.  We were sitting at the beach on the deck and looking south at the lightening storm.  Two flashing lights also appeared and did not seem to move as a plane lights would.  They also just vanished after about 5 minutes.<n>

A red light, moving straight but irregularly and not  fast. It was pinkish red and was pulsating and fading irregularly.  It got to a point where it stopped and hovered for about 30 seconds after having moved in a way at neither rotorcraft or fixed wing craft move.  It seemed to be just below the cloud cover which was high, and likely too high to Be anything radio controlled.  After hovering it moved due north and eventually faded out of sight. 5 or six people with me saw this, and were alarmed.  I got video but it&#39;s far off and not too stable.<n>

My Boyfriend was in a truck ahead of me.  Initially, I didn&#39;t pay attention to the lights because I must of thought it was a street lamp (there are no street lamps in the area, but i grew up in cities) or maybe I assumed it was an airplane, I just didn&#39;t think to look at it - it was dark so I concentrated on the rd.   After a minute maybe, I saw there were two lights, I&#39;m sure there had been all along, but I was now looking at it, trying to rationalize what it was -  At first I thought it was an airplane changing direction, then it looked like an airplane flying towards us.  I did not see an aircraft or other body, just the lights. As I was trying to figure out the direction (because if it was an airplane it would have to be a jet based on the distance between the lights) the left side dimmed, and one light was left. Then it came back after 2 or 3 seconds and the! right side dimmed. I can&#39;t remember if both came back on or what, but basically the lights disappeared off to the right (west north west)I assumed they went behind a cloud and I thought it was strange because they didn&#39;t reappear. I had slowed down from 55 mph to probably 30 mph or so, there was a car behind me so I didn&#39;t want to make them too angry. I just thought it was kind of a weird thing, but didn&#39;t think too much of it. I wondered if my boyfriend saw it in the car ahead of me, but thought probably not because he is one of the least observant people i know. Also his truck is in really rough shape and his headlights don&#39;t work well, so I assumed he would be watching the rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we pulled up to the driveway where we currently live about 10 minutes later, A good song was on the radio, so I turned it up, jumped out of the car and started dancing in the driveway...just to tease him a little.  He was exhausted. I forgot about the lights.  But as soon as he walked up to me, he said &amp;quot;did you see the UFO?&amp;quot; and I was like YES!!!!   So the actual event really only lasted a minute or two, with me paying attention to it for less than a minute before it disappeared.  We both saw the same thing in two separate vehicles.  Initally he said he thought it was the radio tower nearby. I never thought that because of the color and the position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were the color of dim headlights, or low burning embers from a fire. they were larger (and higher in the air) than any headlights would be from a car.  I have been searching for similar sightings since last night online. I have seen on your site alot of &#34;fireball&#34; type incidences - I dont know that it looked like something on fire, but it was definitely that kind of color/hue. the lights were a few inches apart (4 maybe?) in my line of vision but i don&#39;t have any good indication of distance or how far the object was away from us. my boyfriend said he was surprised the lights didn&#39;t show through the clouds or reappear like airplanes do, because the clouds were really more wispy and transparent than solid clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So neither of us really know what we saw.  Apparently after doing a web search though when we got home there had been a UFO siting during the day a few counties away in Northern KY (pike county) there was an image taken, but we have no idea if it wa! s the same thing or not.  Their siting was during the day and we saw no craft or whatever, just the lights.  Also had the radio on, so no idea about noise.<n>

They remained for what seemed to be minute then went out. There was no noise and the lights were very bright. They were too close together to be planes. These lights were closer than first ones and very well defined as round.  It was on and off. Not fading in and   I think the lights were slightly curved but only slightly. This was on a fishing pier in myrtle beach. The observers were retired couples fishing at night. It was in the SE sky at 8:00 - 9:00 pm.  There was  a waxing moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving from West to East, and then abruptly changed coursed and made a 90 degree turn towards the North.  I lost sight of the object, and then saw another object that looked the same as the first, far away and moving at a similar speed.  The second object was moving in the same Northward direction as the first object was going when I last saw it.  I am sure the objects were not planes, and have never seen anything like it before.<n>

It was very controlled and I was able to watch it for about 5 to 6 second before it disapeared.  Not enough time to really detail it, but enough time to know it was not a jet, plane or meteor.<n>

It is rare occasion. The object that I saw was very noticeable.  It looked shiny.  I could tell this wasn&#39;t an ordinary aircraft. It wasn&#39;t the sun hitting the object a certain way.  I know this because a plane was in the sky and nothing weird was about it.  The object was moving to quickly and too far in a direction for a helicopter or plane to do this.  The object would move up down, or in one direction, suddenly. It also would vanish into the air occasionally.  It was like looking at a line.  It has no exact shape. It was like looking at a reflective crystal object. It was bright and it had unusual patterns.  That is all I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
10/23/12 08:30|Fishers|IN|Light|45 minutes|Oval foggy orbs  2-4, going around in circle above houses, following me down the street.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising. lights?  PD))|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93850.html|169|ndxe201210| Oval foggy Orbs  2-4, going around in a circle above houses, following me down the street, in Fishers, IN<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, Oct. 23, 2012, my son and I walked out of the house to walk our dogs.  My son took one of the dog’s around the block and I took the older dog the other direction down the street.  We always meet up at the end of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So as I was walking down the driveway I noticed above my neighbors’ house across the street 4 roundish lights going around in a large circle.  The circle was about the size of the house.  They were not real bright, almost resembled a foggy, cloudy light, but they were very noticeable.  At first I thought someone had some strobe light, which I dismissed, because it was not how a strobe light would look. I will explain that in a minute.  So I’m standing out in front of my house and a neighbor walks by with her dog.  I asked her if she saw the same thing I was seeing and she said “yes.”  I then asked her what she thought the lights were from and she thought perhaps one of those big lights from a store.  Then as we both looked at the lights weaving in and out as though they were chasing each other, we decided that couldn’t be, since that would be obvious if it were one of those big lights.  Let me make this clear.  I’m 51, I’ve seen the store lights in the sky, I’ve seen strobe ! lights too.  These circling lights were something I have never seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They would go higher in the sky and then get lower.  At one point they were high enough to cross the path of a small plane going by.  It’s hard to estimate the distance of objects in the sky, so they may have been some distance from the airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s the weirdest part.  As I continued to walk my dog the lights followed me.  When I reached the last house, there were only 2 orb type circles.  Still they were going around like they were chasing each other.  My son, was walking from the field, and the first thing he said was “Aliens.”  And I’m like, “ are you seeing them too?”  He tells me that he would not have noticed, but our dog stopped and looked at the lights, which made him freak, because she always runs the whole walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, took off towards our house, leaving me with the lights and my slow dog.  I crossed the street and headed back home, aan of course the lights followed me.  I stopped several times just to study them.  When I reached my house, they were right above.  I took my dog into the house and grabbed my phone to videotape them.  As I taped them they were now high above in the middle of the street, and kept getting higher.  I’m not sure if I was able to capture them on my camera, but I haven’t checked. They finally disappeared   I have decided, without a doubt, they were either Spirits in the form of Orbs, or UFO’s of some sort.   I’m always going to believe something is manmade way before I conclude it is from a different source. But with this sighting, I see no other option, but to believe what I witnessed was from a supernatural origin, and they were studying me.  I also feel something big is about to take place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it dissappeared! I ran into the hotel lobby to tell my neice!  Then she followed me outside, so i could show her the place in the sky I had seen it!  Then we witnessed a lot of blinking lights that we thought were airplane, only they stayed in place.  As we continued to watch the bright lights appeared again but multiple, then vanished!  We continued to look and within minutes they appeared again but this time bright in a triangler formation! We saw a guy pass and asked him to look to see if we were crazy but he was amazed also!  They vanished again then appeared again.  Then we walked closer to the ocean! All of a sudden it looked like a sphere of lights hover the ocean and the sky!  Really creepy this couple was passing and wanted to know what all the fuss was about!  Of course it dissappeared when they looked but after a few mins they also witnessed a fo! rmation of lights going up like steps! Then they vanished and we saw the blinking plane like lights again moving east until we saw nothing! It was creepy yet exciting!<n>

Disappeared after that.  Looking towards the ocean (East) from Lynnhaven and Holland i could see a bright low spot of light.  Thought it was a planet but it appeared to have multi-colored lights and it appears to sort of &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot; around the sky.  Didnt move much but just enough to know it was not a star/planet.  Tried taking photos with my 400mm lens but came out blurry of course. But my photos showed just about every color in the spectrum.  Freaked me out.  Turned radio scanner to military base channels and didnt hear any talk about aircraft. Ill be looking tonight to see if its there again...<n>
10/23/12 01:30|Seminole|FL|Oval|>1 hour|Mid Pinellas County-moving lights in horizontal fashion, right to left, left to right: brilliant green, blue, purple, pink, red.|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93794.html|172|ndxe201210| MId Pinellas County-moving lights in horizontal fashion, right to left, left to right: brilliant green, blue, purple, pink, red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what looked like a flat horizontal array of lights with extremely vibrant colors: purple, deep purple, green, blues, pink, red, some white but not much, that motioned back and forth horizontally. The object stayed in the exact same position for over 5 minutes so I grabbed binoculars to look closer. I could see with the binoculars much better, and the light colors were primarily green flashing with intermittent colors already mentioned, but seemed to come back to green mainly.  Over the course of about one hour, the stars up in the sky (big dipper) moved some as usual over the course of one hour, but this object with the moving lights stayed in exact same position.  Then, I saw what I thought was an airplane moving through the sky below this object (lower in height and closer to earth) and I thought to myself “hmm, see that’s an airplane so this object is clearly higher than an airplane but MUCH lower than the stars”.  Then I realized the airplane was moving way too fast for an airplane and it was too low to not be heard in the sky, and then it disappeared.  Seconds later, I saw another lighted object much further away than the original one I’m seeing, but this second one is positioned in the sky at the same place where the plane disappeared.  The two are still sitting in the sky now (the two brilliantly lighted objects); one is much closer in proximity than the second one, but they are both emitting beautiful lights that move horizontally left to right and right to left, with primary colors of green and bright purple and also blue and pink occasionally.  I tried to take a picture using my iPhone and video with iPhone to no avail.  They’re too far away in the sky to capture with iPhone technology.  But, I know what Im seeing. Clearly, most definitely not man made and not stars either.  Amazing.  This has made a believer out of me.<n>

Just the other nigh 10/22/12... I finally was able to get a few up close photos. I t has never been within distance for my camera to pick up. I cannot get the camcorder to pick it up, buy as I said, we finally got some shots. It&#39;s usually between 10-1am we spot them.  We have seen as many as 3 at a time. What caught our eyes to eyes to begin with,  it&#39;s extremely bright so you can&#39;t miss it.  You then will notice either a green air blue light along with red &amp; orange only when it&#39;s bobbling then goeIs to the left then to the right then it will make a cone type shape with a bright white light then shoot strait up.It ill repeat the process .

At 7:32 PM a low flying and bright solid orb-like light which was completely silent, and seemingly intelligently controlled, as it flew on a steady path at the altitude of the commercial planes which were in the sky at the time ( there were several planes for comparison, and they all had different colored blinking lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was very brightly glowing solid white, and almost seemed to have a light blue tint or hue to it, much like a star.  It did not change in altitude or brightness.  It did not flash or flicker, or make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was slow moving and did not appear to be attached any craft, but instead seemed to be the craft in its entirety.   It traveled from the South West across the city toward the North Eastern sky, at which point a small plane flew directly under the orb/light.  After they cross paths the light dimmed itself quickly and it appeared to disappear.  It did not reappear in my view.<n>

The dots made the shape of a triangle, each representing a separate point, and within a few seconds the dots formed a straight line then individually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident took between 8 and 15 minutes.

It lost the tail rapidly and turned to a small tube shape within a minute.   The speed was amazing and the sky was bright and clear to witness this object.  There was not really any sound or smell in the air as it passed over my house.  The hunting dogs were watching it as well due to the brightness in the sky.  It was heading toward Canada.  Today was a sunny clear fall day.  Amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just so happen to look up in the sky and what I thought was 2 balloons floating up into the sky, were not balloons.  I realized that they were not balloons when they started to move in my direction. My friend and I were like what the heck is that? The 2 things were moving at a good rate of speed towards us.  They started to go over our building and we started to walk backwards to see if we could still see them.  The one on the left started to fade in and out.  It went from black in color to not being able to see it.  Both of these things were flying parallel with each other the whole time, they would dip down and rise together.  As we started to walk backwards and to the side of the building to see them better they were gone.  I have a small picture of what it looks like on my phone. In the picture I only got on and it’s really small but in person they were not that small!.  I need to zoom in on the phone to see it better.<n>
10/22/12 17:30|Batavia|OH|Sphere|20-60 seconds|Orange/Red Spheres seen by four people in Southwest Ohio|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93782.html|183|ndxe201210| Orange/Red Spheres seen by four people in Southwest Ohio<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday, 22 October 2012 at approximately 7:30pm EST I was standing out of doors with a group of three other people at 1131 Old. St. Rt. 74, Batavia, Ohio 45103, when two groups of bright orange/red lights caught my attention. The first group came from the east and traveled in a WNW direction. The second group came along about ten minutes later, appearing from a more southerly direction and traveling on a NNW line. If I were to draw a line on a map, the first group was heading towards Indianapolis and the second was headed towards Fort Wayne, Indiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to distinguish any physical form within the lights so it is hard to estimate their elevation, but they appeared to be very high... my guess would be approximately 10,000 feet. The lights also seemed to be traveling very, very fast. The first set of lights was visible for about twenty seconds, the second group I was able to track much longer... nearly a minute. If I am correct about the elevation of the lights, I would say their rate of travel was over twice that of any jetliner I have ever seen in the sky. It is worth noting that in both instances there was absolutely no sound apparent from the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were in a group of three that would coalesce into a single light, then split apart to three separate lights and then again regroup. This happened repeatedly with both groups of lights. The color of the light varied from a light orange, to orange to red. This coloring was also fluctuating. Estimating the size of the lights is again difficult as there was nothing concrete to offer comparison, but when asked how they looked in relation to a star or the moon it gave me an idea to perhaps explain it. If the moon were the size of a basketball then the lights would be about the size of an American fifty cent piece. Likewise, if a star were a dime, the lights would relationally be roughly the size of a basketball. So, they were much larger than a star, but much smaller than the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps.<n>

I was at the traffic light facing north and noticed the object which appeared to be a great enough distance above the tree line to make me wonder what exactly it was as it did not appear to be a tower, billboard, planet, etc.?  The object was stationary and almost looked like the silhouette of a really tiny planet but obviously within a few miles of my position and not in outer space, at least as far as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped a couple photo’s with my iphone before the light changed with the thought that I’d relook at the area at another time when it was lighter out and compare my photographs.  I retook the photo this morning (10-23-12) when the sun had started coming up (7:23 am).  I definitely could not see anything in my second photo that could have been the object in my first photo (btw, I am going to try and attach the photos to this word document).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In true “UFO Photo” fashion, the picture is grainy and the object looks far off.  For all I know this was some planet or something else obvious.  Either way, I found it interesting and wanted to share.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else in the Tucker/Decatur area see this thing?  The object I am referring to is the small dark gray circular object in between the two green lights just above where I put an arrow.  The other spots are just reflections on my windshield and stars.  And no, this was not a spot on my window.  I bothered to stick my head outside my window just to double check.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day photo.  I didn’t see anything that could have been the dark circular object.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Once more, please refer to the past Milford reports from this year for context on this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunday, Gulf Beach, only a mild -3mph breeze from the NNW.  Intermittent high clouds.  Sunset about 6:40 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First:  7:06 PM.  Through windshield of parked car noticed a very bright low flying object approaching from the west (265 degrees), just above the treeline and shoreline houses.  Because of its familiar color, lack of blinking port/starboard/tail lights and peculiar gliding movement I immediately attempted to video record this aircraft.  Moving away from street/car lights to get a better view of it, and to project a 5 mW green laser at it, this object soon displayed itself as a typically flame-like oval.  It traveled from the west  into the SE, gaining altitude as it diagonally crossed the gulf.  The laser&#39;s 2,000 ft effective range did not appear to paint it, nor did it respond to the flash.  Within 2.5 minutes it blinked out in the SE sky.  Estimated speed = 45 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second:  About 2 minutes after the disappearance of the first object another firey object suddenly popped up, either just between the trees exactly 270 degrees west - or possibly from the opposite beach itself!  This happened too rapidly for me to accurately judge its origination point.   As it moved towards me,  lower and more slowly than the previous UFO, I was able to aim the laser directly at it throughout its entire 2.5 minutes of travel in a trajectory similar to the previous UFO: upwards and into the SE sky.  No response, and nothing noticably reflected by the laser beam.  This object similarly blinked out about 120 degrees SE at 7:13 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Short MP4s recorded.<n>

Both were hovering up and down at a heavy speed and at times one moving away from one another.  I do not know exactly how long it lasted but I saw it for 30 minutes and then we drove away.  Since my partner was concentrating on the road, he did not see it.  No camera was on sight to take pictures/vidoes. But am sure there were other people who were walking on the street and who might have noticed it too.<n>

I took video with my camera phone, but the camera is only a 2.3 magapixel with no zoom, so the videos are of no use. I can send them if you think they may help?

It seemed to be mostly neon green colored and had a white hot glowing look to it.  It was moving north from the South and seemed to be falling out of the sky. It disappeared from view behind trees a few blocks ahead of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very curious about the object and wanted to drive through streets in my neighborhood to see if I could see where it might have landed or perhaps speak with someone else who might have seen it, but I didn’t do so as I had plans with my husband and went on home.  I told my husband about it and he asked me if it looked like some kind of a toy or firework someone shot up in the air.  It didn’t. It was unlike anything I’ve ever seen before and was fairly large.  The first thing I thought of was perhaps a meteorite because I had heard a day or two before that there had been meteor shower sightings in California.  I hadn’t thought about the meteor shower again until I saw this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected that I would hear more about the object from others seeing and reporting it, but I have not heard anything about it.  There weren’t many people out on the street since it was early Sunday morning, but there were a few other cars and I remember seeing someone walking East on the sidewalk I passed.  I contacted WFTV, a TV station out of Orlando, by e-mail and the response I received was that there had been no official sighting according to local authorities, though they had received some e-mails.  (I’m thinking that they meant they had received e-mails about the meteor shower).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 58 yr. old homemaker who had just dropped off family members at their homes after our regular walk at a local park. I saw the object on my way home. The sun was shining brightly at that time and there were no clouds in the sky. It was a beautiful clear morning.<n>

I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and she replied yes.  We both wondered what it might be.  It had no obvious light emitting from it, but was still visible as grey in the night sky.  We did not observe it from horizon to horizon, but watched it travel about 1/4 of the night sky.  The sky was clear in our location with some slight clouds low on our southerly horizon.<n>

10/21/12 04:00|Islamorada|NY|Chevron|15 seconds|Strange, gliding light formation/object on a beach in the Florida Keys|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93737.html|214|ndxe201210| Strange, gliding light formation/object on a beach in the Florida Keys<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us were sitting on the beach looking at the sky for about an hour.  Our eyes had been adjusted and we had seen various shooting stars fly overhead.  We were both facing South, and all of a sudden from the East a Chevron shaped object appears, almost looking like it was in a sharp decent.  The object continued to travel west at a very fast pace, and within 15 seconds, the object had either disappeared or had already traveled out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately as the object flew over ahead we both looked at each other and asked if the other had seen this object.  We had both initially thought it was an array of lights that resembled some sort of large, cartoon-esque bird/dragonfly.  In disbelief we realized that this could not have been the case due to how high and quickly the object travelled.  We then both thought that it was a hang glider, but then realized this was impossible due to the height and speed of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still in disbelief after running through every possibility we are cautiously thinking we saw a UFO of some sort.  The reason being as the lights were far brighter than the stars so we knew the object was closer, yet far enough away where it could not have been any sort of animal or man made flight object.  It made absolutely no noise and it&#39;s motion was still and consistent.  We also both realized that the space filled in between the lights, say where the body of the craft would be, was some what distorted from the rest of the starry sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As quickly as it appeared, it had disappeared.  As two people who took strong stances against the sighting and stories surrounding UFO&#39;s we can honestly say we are not trying to convince ourselves that we saw something for a story.  We both were on the same page with every detail and interpretation as described above.  It&#39;s to the point where we both wish that we had never seen it because we are that certain we saw something flying overhead and there is no available proof.  I hope that this helps and can say our minds our wandering to places and thinking of things we both never thought possible.  It was truly a beautiful, yet terrifying sight to see.<n>
10/21/12 03:40|Sarasota|FL|Cylinder|10 seconds|This object was extremely clear and easy to see, silent and the dim lights were fascinating to watch.|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93871.html|215|ndxe201210| This object was extremely clear and easy to see, silent and the dim lights were fascinating to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of October 21, 2012 at approximately 0330 hours I went outdoors to observe a meteor shower that supposedly originates in the area of Orion. My observation point was the lanai of a condo in Sarasota, Florida. I was on the top floor of the condo which would place me at approximately 50 feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was perfect with a clear sky, no moon, and a chilly breeze coming from the north.  The breeze was strong enough to move the tree limbs, slightly.  Orion was almost overhead, being 10 degrees south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the sky, not seeing one meteor, when I caught movement to my left. I then observed an object that was silently and steadily moving through the sky traveling East Southeast. It was going approximately 2 MPH and I observed this object for 10 seconds.  The body of the object, from my observation point, was dark and was approximately 14 inches long, 3 inches wide and was squared on the ends. At the side and coming off each corner was approximately 7 wavy lines, faint in brightness which gave off a glow similar to a dim florescent bulb.  These appeared to be fixed to a part of the object approximately 1 inch wide and 2 inches long.  Through these faint wavy lines a slightly brighter glow pulsed moving from the object outwards.  As I stated, this object made no sound. It was approximately 20 degrees below Orion. the object appeared as if it was only 30 feet or so above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object passed over the building and thus blocking my view of further observation, within another 30 seconds I observed a dark round object moving to the east. This object was moving at approximately 5 mph and had no lights or sound. The cause of the object to be noticed was the object was darker than the sky. It appeared to be higher in the sky and approximately the same angle from Orion as the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Lt. firefighter/paramedic with 27 years service and have not seen an object such as this.<n>

Ancient Aliens on the History Channel was the last show of this sort of interest that I remember watching around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. that night. I get exited about ufos and once it&#39;s is on the air of television I can&#39;t put my fork down. lol   I woke up out of a dream (can&#39;t really remember exactly what it pertained to but, I, at the time was really back infatuated with the paranormal events that were occuring accross America. I got off of my sofa and kept thinking about what it would be like walking on a battlefield where the U.S. would be in a sort of intense battle with E.T.s in spaceships you would see maybe in a dream or vision. I walked to the spacious ground area which was about 1 acre or so in length and 3/4 of a football field wide. My imagination is vivid and wide most of the time so I felt ok to see landed spaceships and pretend thing were flying in the night sky.  Don&#39;t know for sure if I really saw something around there but it definitly was capturing and frightening. I got a little too scared so I said I&#39;m going back inside. Didn&#39;t look back at all into the sky until I got up the stairs by my apartment and felt something in my atmosphere. [Thank God I just got an extension on this computer] I sort of felt curious so I.....started using suggestions...to see if I could get whatever I was sensing to reveal itself to me. I knew it wasn&#39;t a spirit so I&#39;m not sitting up in my little leaky, dark, and lonely apartment by myself without being sure I would be at least absolutely safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, the moment got intense and once again that definite....feeling of unsurety hit me. Harder than my first encounter. I looked at the dish network sattelite, looked behind it into the sky, something told me to turn my entire body to the right and look up above the apt. building accross from me and quietly; w/ a syncronized....effort we connected with one another. 3 ! immensely, sleek, yet most emormous...floating like...with no ! gravitat ional pull and it took so long to disappear I took a comfortable position of facing it just to see what it was doing or going to do. It was in a formation of three; two side by side in the front of the formation and in the middle between the front two yet behind. In formation like a Navy division in ranks marching.  The formation came up to a huge cloud big enough to cover all three objects. The front of the formation vanished behind the clouds like expected because I don&#39;t think ufos or extraterrestials want to...really be seen but expecting the unexpected the last one....IT NEVER DISAPPEARED. It&#39;s intense,.....BLINDING light shined through this dark gray early a.m. cloud like it never traveled behind anything and stayed there.  I was soooo scared to where I was gonna go inside at this point in time in fear of some sort of (God forgive me for saying) possible undetectable attack.  Still I waited. It sat behind the gray cloudfor about 30 seconds. And then it disappeared.  Like i! t was never there and all I could do is stand there in awe and fright. I got this ufo website out of Dr. Lynne D. Kitei&#39;s book &#34;The Phoenix Lights&#34; and used it in hopes of getting in contact with her or someone who is employed with connection to this website who is experienced with people have post effects from close encounters on any kind.

It was a very clear sky. As soon as  I commented that sometimes I see stars that move then fade, I speculated that probably they were satelites or the iss, my friend mike said there&#39;s one and pointed. I looked up and saw two lights, one bright like venus and another like a regular star.  They were moving slowly together. It looked like they could have been connected as if part of a craft as they seemed static to one another.  As they moved across the sky the brighter one dimmed until it was about the same size and brightness as the other. They slowly travelled across the sky until they dissapeared out of view.   As I said I have seen anomalies in the sky before which I assume are satelites and the like but this was different as two objects were travelling together, (as one?), and the sighting went on f! or approx 10 mins.  I have seen chinese lantens before but these didn&#39;t look like lanterns , they appeared too connected and when they first appeared the brighter one , which was travelling behind the front one was extremely bright. the lights did not flicker.<n>

I did then get a bit dizzy and get a bit of sinus pressure, the sighting is still going on as I write this.  Multiple about three or four times during the night there were a series of loud booms.<n>

I want to say it&#39;s a planet, but I&#39;ve been watching this thing weave back and forth and descending.  I won&#39;t claim it&#39;s anything unworldly and maybe being so close to the horizon the light had some drift causing this effect, but it was and is definitely new to me as an novice star gazer of over a decade...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked to my left (i  was on the balcony) the light was at my 10oclock.  It looked like a star at first, then i seen it drop down to the tree line, then shoot back up near the end of orions belt.  It would periodically shoot left and right, up and down and one time it did a circle formantion.  I watched this light for half an hour when i see a streak of light ( similar to lightning, the sky was clear) shoot across and disappear near the first light. at 3am i see another light, red only flash six times then it was gone. the first light stayed put for another half hour, then me and two others see a ( shadow of sorts) move along the grass and tree. it was quick but we seen it. it scared them enough to go back inside the house. i kept watching and at about 4am the light i first seen shot up and over to west faster than any plane ive ever seen and disappeared.<n>

At this time I winessed a triangle shaped object (Arrow shaped)with 1 light at the point and 2 lights on each side of the craft moving from almost due north at a very high rate of speed to south over Phoenix.  Approximately 1/3rd through the sighting, a gold colored orb approached from the east, approach the arrow shaped craft completing a circle around the craft, at which time neither slowed or changed course, after the circle was made the gold &amp;quot;Orb&amp;quot; contimued on west at a high rate of speed.  while the arrow shaped craft continued south. immediately after the orb started west I went for my binoculars inside, by the time i was entering the hounse the arrow went past horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Horizon to Horizon was approx 15-20 second.  The arrow craft appeared to be at an extreamely high altitude or was extremely fast as it only took 15-20 seconds to pass horizon to horizon.  I did not get any pictures of this, but I am a sky watcher and have pictures along with video of other sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Professional background ranges from military electronic systems, sales and development of guidance systems for programs such as Tomohawk, aim9x, sidewinder, tow,and the Phallanx program.

Come here, come here!” so I go down to the garage door where he was and then he points at this really bright orange thing in the sky changing from orange to pink and green, but mostly orange, with bright beams coming out of it. It was flying across the sky faster than a satellite and plane, but wasn&#39;t a meteor or star because it was moving fast and got from a point where we could see it and then in about 5 minutes, it went off in a different direction.  Couldn&#39;t really tell what the shape was, but it was clearly flying with beams coming out of it across the sky, and very big and bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are both professionals and I am also in college for Astrophysics. We were both completely sober and have no history of mental health issues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been there for about a half an hour it was then 11:00 pm and we had seen over 10 meters, a few satellites and of course some planes (the plane that flew the highest was still nowhere near the altitude of what I witnessed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both sitting in the truck and it was parked facing the Big Dipper. I was looking at the Big Dipper when I noticed a light (same light intensity and hue as the star) moving rapidly around. It was next to a star that is almost directly under the second from the last star making up the handle of the Big Dipper. It startled me because what I saw first was a light, the same size and brightness as the star, shot out to the right from in front or behind this star, then almost instantly two more (slightly smaller in size) lights came rushing towards the first light and stopping dead underneath it on either side making a triangle formation, this lasted just a second. The first light darted down several inches in the sky (this was at an extremely high altitude) the other two followed even faster circling and darting around it, crossing over it as it kept darting away from them. They seemed to get closer and further away all during this, at one point it was very hard to see the! m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 2 minutes in and we had gotten out of the truck to see better. Right as we stepped out my Fiance finally looked to where I was pointing just in time to see the first, slightly larger light dart straight down at an alarming rate, we lost sight of it for a second then saw it rush (again at a ridiculous speed) straight up again, this time a few inches to the right  from where we lost it. It seemed to have lost the other two lights (I’m assuming they’re the same ones) and then, again, out of nowhere, they appeared at either side of it and their interaction started again. They were darting all around the area of the big dipper, faster than anything my Fiance or I have ever seen. The smaller two kept darting away and then would bombard the first light for either side and cross over it, however, it was never the same move twice. It looked eerily like military tactics, however, it seemed to be outside or just inside of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it go on for over 20 minutes, it put both of us so on edge, mainly because, for the first time in both of our lives, we only had one explanation, and that is extraterrestrial crafts.  We finally had to stop looking and left shortly after. Neither of us could sleep that night and we aren&#39;t the kind of people to be “spooked” easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw is the kind of image that is seen in sci-fi movies, NOT real life, however, there is no denying the activity we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us are born and raised in Alaska and spent our entire lives looking up at night. Over the years we have seen many strange air crafts coming from Elmendorf air force base that we live near, and pride ourselves on being able to recognize terrestrial crafts and not jumping to conclusions. My Fiance has spent may years studying air crafts and is able to recognize them on sight, even the lesser known ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would never have believed it if we hadn&#39;t seen it. There is no possibility that it was some sort of advertising lights, I have never seen anything other than stars and satellites at that altitude, and satellites do NOT move like that, nor to meteors.  This was completely erratic and spontaneous movement but seemed very apparent what the craft was trying to do (get away from the other two). I know of only one other person besides my Fiance and I who saw this anomaly and that person has no relation to me and knew nothing of what we saw when she told me, her description is on point to what we saw, and I hope that she chooses to report her sighting as well. We tried to video tape it, however, we only had our phones and neither of them could zoom in close enough to see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was coming from the west heading east too slow for a meteor.  Then I noticed 3 to 4 more orange balls of light spaced evenly like a formation one after the other and thought they could be helocopters.  The Orange balls had no strobe, red or green &amp;quot;aircraft&amp;quot; lights and they were silent.  The objects flew in a straight line in front of me going from my right to my left.  The lead light seem to make a slight turn then dissapeared in open sky.  Then one by one as the other orange objects reached the exact location of the lead object dissapearence they too turned and vanished.<n>

She hurriedly came into the house to alert me.  I immediately grabbed the binoculars and went out to the deck and viewed the object which was about 11 miles away.  It was going very slow and was emitting a red and orange glow within this ball.  It appeared to be huge based on the distance from our view.  The orange glow seemed to be contained within the ball and there seemed to be some kind of a curved line on the outside going through the center of the ball separating the red from the orange.  There were no other distinct features outside of the ball that could be identified.  As I watched the ball going north on a horizontal line it suddenly stopped for approximately 5 seconds and then dropped straight down.  I fol! lowed the ball dropping until the trees obstructed my view.  The bright red/orange form did not change nor did it leave a heat trail upon its decent.  WOW!<n>

While I was sitting on the beach, just next to the dunes, looking south, I noticed three spherical red/orange lights hovering in the sky in a triangle formation, at what I guessed to be a distance of a mile south of me, about a hundred yards out over the ocean, in front of the Bethany Beach boardwalk.  The bottom of the ‘triangle’ was one red/orange light; the other two lights were higher.  If I held my arm straight out in front of me and made a fist, the lights were about the same size as my fist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed them because they were stationary at first, just hovering in place, and I wondered what kind of aircraft they were.  When they didn’t move for a while (a minute?), I started to pay closer attention to them.  They didn’t make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon they started slowly shifting their position vis-à-vis one another, so they created a kind of diagonal line, with respect to the horizon.  At that point I noticed a fourth sphere much closer to the ground, hovering just above the beach, much closer to me, at a distance of probably half a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t feel particularly afraid, or threatened, but I didn’t want to stick around there all alone, so I started walking fast, back to my house.  As I walked, I kept my eye on the lights, and noticed that they seemed to be moving away from me, too, at a very fast pace.  By the time I reached my house (about half a block from the dunes), the lights looked like four tiny red dots of light flying away, into space.  I quickly climbed up to my roof deck and watched them until they disappeared from view.<n>

I am in Gilbert Arizona and my crossroads are Recker and Guadualupe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that this was military aircraft doing something but it looked a little unusual.  The lights appeared as if they were moving north  (towards my house) and climbing to higher elevation.  4 more lights apeared and looked to be following the other group.  One lights in the first group moved toward anouther in a strait line and merged with anouther (the two becoming one light). anouther 2 groups of 2 appeared as the others hit the edge of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out my wife after a few started disapearing.  there were about 10 in the sky when she came out.  the lights slowly moved up until all of the lights disapeared in the clouds.

Objects appeared to be extremely bright stars. Brightness was pulsating. After approximately 90 seconds of observation the object that appeared to be on the bottom quickly moved to the north and then disappeared.   Approximately five minutes later the second object began to move north/northeast at a very slow velocity.  It appeared to zig zag slightly and then stopped momentarily.  Object 2 was almost directly overhead of our position and there was no noticeable sound.  Object 2 then began to quickly accelerate vertically and disappeared completely from sight within approximately 3 seconds. Witness I a private pilot with military background.<n>

They were too bright to judge distance accurately but i would estimate they were at least 10-20 miles from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group faded in brightness equally as they headed to the eastern lower sky and eventually disappeared before they reached the horizon - The sky is very clear and they were not obscured by clouds --this was very odd and nothing i have seen before happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had called my wife outside and she saw the first group just disappearing and then suddenly another group of 10-12 appeared in the exact same location above my neighbors house at the end of the block and moved in the same vertical/closer, then eastern direction ..very low near the horizon. They were about 3-4&amp;quot; if i measured with a ruler above the roof of my neighbors house when they appeared and stayed at the same altitude the entire flight - The house is nearly 1 block away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this second group disappeared a third group of around 4-5 more orange lights appeared and followed the exact same pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to capture pictures of these with my Cannon T2i 18mp camera.. had the lens at its full 275mm .. I did not have a tripod and took 2.5 second exposures steadying the camera against the house. The objects blur in a west to east direction in the photos and are bright reddish orange, much brighter in the center than the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both agreed this was, by far, the most strange thing we have seen in the sky at night and are still not sure what to make of what we saw tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contact me via e-mail and i will send the pictures i took with my cannon digital camera.<n>
10/20/12 19:30|Bunn|NC|Fireball|5 minutes|2 fireballs traveling across the sky|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93756.html|238|ndxe201210| 2 fireballs traveling across the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> While attending an outdoor movie, my son pointed out an Orange fireball shaped object moving across the sky.  As an aviation enthusiast, it looked like nothing I had ever seen.  It also moved far too slowly to be a shooting star, which I also happened to see as we watched the object.  It moved in a straight line in a southerly direction at a moderate rate of speed.  We watched as it moved out of site. Almost as soon as it disappeared, another identical object appeared traveling at the same speed in the same direction.  This second object travelled about 3/4 of the distance as the first then disappeared. It had no flashing lights or beacons. It was a clear night.  There were several aircraft at various altitudes and distances.  They were all easily identifiable as aircraft and in no way resembled these objects. As I stated, this was an outdoor movie.  The objects were seen by my wife and myself as well as the couple we were with and our 3 children. 2 nine year old bo! ys and a seven year old girl.  I am unaware if anyone else attending the movie noticed the objects or not.  We tried to take a photo but it was taken by the other couple.  I don&#39;t know about the image quality but will ask if it&#39;s deemed relevent.<n>

I saw three objects flying in the sky to east of Ottawa.  The angle between their position and the zenith was about 50º.  They came from south to north. The first one came around 19:15.  The second one came around 19:25 minutes later and the third one came around 19:28.  There was a very intense orange light that came from their bottom in an oval form.  Each one remained at the sky about 1-3 minutes.  I could not see when the first one had gone, but the second and the third ones went away as if they were getting more distant and their light was dying.  I’m not sure if there were others objects between the first and the second one because I didn’t keep looking at this time.<n>

He pointed at something in the sky. It was a fiery ball falling from the sky. We discussed how shooting stars aren&#39;t that slow and we watched it fall. Once it fell close to the surface it stopped moving and turned into a white light instead of flaming. It stayed in that position for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we started to exit 375 to get onto 601 we noticed 3-4 cars parked along the side of the road. People were outside of their cars pointing toward the mountain.  As my husband and I looked over we same the same fiery ball falling toward the mountain.  This time it split into 5 separate balls, each did the same thing as the first.  They fell until they were closer to the ground then hovered once they turned into a white light.  Stayed light that for a few seconds and then disappeared.<n>
10/20/12 19:15|Delhi|NY|Light|10 minutes|I witinessed orange objects flying in unusual patterns coming from the horizon as well a silent and gliding black craft.|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93779.html|241|ndxe201210| I witinessed orange objects flying in unusual patterns coming from the horizon as well a silent and gliding black craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of October 20th, 2012, I was driving southbound on Route 10 just north of Delhi, New York. In the car with me was a long time friend.  We are both currently residents in the town of Delhi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was mostly clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7:15 to 7:30 PM (last moments of twilight) we noticed a series of orange lights slowly flying toward us in an ascending manner.  These lights were not blinking, but steady in nature. Three of these lights were in the formation of a triangle.  The three lights together did not appear to be the edges of any solid object as the sky between them was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three in formation were the first in a series.  Behind them, was a steady stream of other orange lights following in more or less a straight line.  These straight-line lights were arising from behind the mountains in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mountains in the distance were probably about ten miles or so away.  In gauging the size of the lights, if I were to hold a dime at arms length, I would imagine they would have been difficult to see.  If I was holding a small dried chickpea, they may have illuminated the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the odd nature of these lights, we pulled the car over to the southbound shoulder just past Hoag Crossroad.  I know this was the exact location because when I got out to take photos, this is where my iPhone ‘geotagged’ the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this location, we had the view of an open valley ahead of us at approximately eleven o’clock in relation to Route Ten.  This is where the lights could be seen coming toward us and from the mountains in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got out of the car, I shut my lights in the hopes that it would not interfere with my intention of taking photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched and took photos, the three lights in triangular formation came to a stationary position for about twenty seconds.  They were still in the distance by a few miles and at least 45 degrees or more from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed that the lights in triangle formation begin to fade.  I could not ascertain whether they going away in the opposite direction or just fading.  Regardless, they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same began to happen with the straight-line lights.  One by one they just disappeared in generally the same location as the triangular ones had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was right around the time that the triangular lights were holding and fading when a woman driving a car also pulled over to see what was going on.  She then got out of her car to look as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we talked and watched the lights fading, I somehow noticed another object approaching us along Route 10.  It was coming from the same direction as the orange lights had been traveling. This object was not illuminated, but instead, barely visible because it was black and flying very low just above the tree-tops lining the road on our side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shouted about it and pointed.  My friend and the woman also confirmed it.  Since the object was black against a nearly black sky it wasn’t easy to see. Prior to getting closer to us, it was more like an ink blob. But the closer it got, the more revealing the shape. If I had to give it a shape it was something like an inverted spade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it was silent and steadily gliding. It’s speed wasn’t too fast.  I would judge it as 45 to 60 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s size was somewhat difficult to judge, but in relation to the size of the trees and it’s low flying nature above the trees, I would estimate it at approximately three medium car widths across at the widest point- therefore, about 25 feet across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it glided over our heads, I attempted to take a photo despite the near darkness.  To my surprise, the camera registered something because the focus indicator (a square box) zoomed in prior to releasing the shutter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After snapping the photo, the object seemed to descend into the trees just off to the side of us.  However, I am not sure if it descended or just kept flying out of site and away from us.  Both my friend and the woman quickly used their flashlight applications in their phones in an attempt to illuminate the wooded area off to our side, but nothing could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either way, at that point, it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then turned our attention back to the valley area where the orange lights were seen and saw the last of the lights fading.  The actual number of orange lights was not counted but I would say, before the black object diverted our sights, there were approximately eight to ten in total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the orange lights had faded, we talked about what we saw, and the woman’s daughter drove up to us because they had been communicating on the phone while some of this was happening.  Apparently, they didn’t live too far from this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter, we then noticed what were obviously a few military fighter planes now in the area where the orange lights had just been moments earlier.  I’m confident these were military fighter planes due to their main characteristics- fast nature and quick blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I distinctly remember those being the only kind of planes in the sky in the aftermath of 9-11.  Therefore, I’m quite familiar with them and know them as very different from commercial planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, the woman gave me her email and we drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of this writing, I have so far looked at the photos, including one video I shot and unfortunately, not much registered.  However, in playing with some settings, I have been able to pull something out of the one photo of the black object.  It is not too clear and seems to have much pixilation due to the low light level, but there is something distinctly outlined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I can flesh anything else out of the photos, I will send forward them.<n>

The moved - as if they floated through the night, then approx. 10-15 minutes later they faded out, at times, one by one – until the last one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very close together at times; they were not military craft - as two people including myself served in the military and we were very accustomed to known military craft.

Eclairé par en dessous par de pâles mini flash a intermittenc<n> <n><n> <n><n> Je m apprétais a reprendre mon velo lorsque j&#39;aperçoit environ à 45°, au dessus des ligne de metro aerien depuis mon point de vue (mais cela me semble être plus loin derrière, pas au dessus), ce qui me semble être un &amp;quot;objet&amp;quot; noir flotant dans le ciel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Je crois d&#39;abord voir un oiseau de type corneille, mais comme le mouvement n est pas celui d un oiseau je m arrête dessus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Après quelques courts instants où j&#39;essaye de l&#39;indentifier à quelque chose de &#34;possible&#34; un sac plastique, un tissu, des ballons... je reste perplexe à le regarder, surtout qu&#39;il me rappelle une video que j&#39;ai vu il y a environ 2 ans sur internet dans laquelle on voyais un truc semblable mais blanc ou clair, pas loin d&#39;un nuage, avec le meme genre de mouvement (je n ai pas réussi à la retrouver), et qui m avait retenu parceque je trouvait ça étrange et beau.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Etant assez stupéfait je demande confirmation à un homme derrière moi. Je lui demande si il sait ce que c&#39;est, il me dit &amp;quot;non, des ballons? -regarde mieux, sérieusement, on dirait des ballons ça? - non c&#39;est vrai... Je sais pas ce que c&#39;est...&amp;quot; et on est resté 10 minute à regarder sans trouver d explication, j ai essayé de filmer avec mon portable mais la qualité est trop mauvaise et il n arrivait pas à faire le point. Au bout d un moment il appelle une amie qui vient regarder aussi. A trois on regarde et je perçoit, tout en me disant &amp;quot;la c&#39;est trop fort&amp;quot; de la lumière au dessous de l&#39;ovni. Plus présisément l ovni était éclairé par en dessous par petites intermittences, comme des légers flashs blanc-jaune et orange-rouge, mais faibles, pâle (surtout qu il ne faisait pas encore sombre) et dans mon souvenir je n&#39;ai pas vu directement de lumière, mais l&#39;objet qui était éclairé par en dessous. Ca ma parut être quelque chose d&#39;électrique en tous cas. Je demand! e, sans y revenir, au 2 si il ont vu la lumière, il me confirment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> L&#39;ovni s&#39;éloignant petit a petit et allant vers l&#39;est, on se quitte (eux retourne à leur taf) en plaisantant a demi &amp;quot;on a vu un ovni!&amp;quot;, la fille ajoute en plaisantant &amp;quot;c &#39;est des extra-terrestres, c&#39;est les incas, on va tous mourir&amp;quot;...et moi je reprend mon velo et continu de le suivre jusqu à ce qu il disparaissent petit à petit. Le tout aura duré dans les 25 min selon mon ressenti. (10-15 avec les autres) 10-15min a le regarder s éloigner progressivement jusqu a disparaître.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pour revenir sur la description de l objet : il semblait être, de loin (pour le décrire en se ratachant à qlq chose que l&#39;ont connais), une sorte de tissu noir, déchiré, en lambeaux, et flottant, comme en apesanteur, en évolution continuelle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Je m&#39;explique: il bougeait lentement comme en apesanteur et donc semblait se transformer, des fois il disparaissait presque, d&#39;autre fois il semblait se déployer. J ai eu l impression que c&#39;était dû a un effet de perspective… J ai eu l impression qu il y avait 3 parties, mais pas vraiment distinctes. Comme 3 &amp;quot;morceaux de tissus&amp;quot; plus ou moins rectangulaires et vertical, connectés, effilochés ou en lambeaux (donc non vraiment rectangulaire). Les lambeaux étaient vaguement pointus, en longueur (difficile d expliquer avec des mots).<n> <n><n> <n><n> surtout, j avais l&#39;impression que c&#39;était flou tout en étant précis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> C&#39;est à dire, que 1. c&#39;était assez loin pour que je ne puisse pas identifier ce que c&#39;était ni la matière (si je tend ma main devant mes yeux, je crois que l &#39;objet n&#39;était pas plus gros qu&#39;un ongle) En même temps j&#39;avais l impression de le voir clairement, j&#39;ai une bonne vue, le ciel était sans nuage, il faisait encore bien jour...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Une vision un peu contradictoire donc, mais qui a renforcé mon intérêt pour ce que je regardais. J avais vraiment la sensation de n&#39;avoir jamais rien vu de tel, ça ne correspondait a rien de ce que je connaisse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> J&#39;aimerai bien trouver une video de ce truc ou un témoignage semblable...<n> <n><n> <n><n> forme un peu médusale concernant les lambeaux.

This was definitely not a plane and when I really looked I saw that it was a reflective spherical object moving horizontally south to north. I was reflective was glowing orange,but like it was silver and reflecting the sunset to the west.   After I watched it for a few seconds it disappeared- not suddenly, but almost as if it had gone into clouds, like it was fading out.  The only thing was there were no clouds, it was a completely clear sky.  I thought maybe it was a balloon that popped, but it didn&#39;t automatically disappear.  It was also close or large enough that I think the deflated balloon falling would have been visible.  This was over buildings in Brooklyn or the Brooklyn/Queens border.  I am not sure how long it was visible out my window, as when I looked! up I only observed it for 7-10 seconds before it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Light moves very swiftly from left to right, down then up in short quick movements. sun has yet to rise, I am facing east so no sun reflection on this. took out my telescope but was unable to focus on quick moving object.  No sounds on a very quiet morning. Was abole to view thru Binoculars and was amazed as it took such quick movements. at aprox. 6:41am, light uimmiediately went dark.  Sun has yet to rise, it is now 6:44am, light has reappeared briefly on a heading of aprox. 180 degrees due south and is now absent from visual sky.  There are no flashing light, just a suttle change in color with white being prominent with suttle flashes of red &amp; green.  I have seen this type of similar movement on eastern &amp; northern sky on headings of 030-090 degrees but never this close. what is so startling is the sudden and extremly quick moevements and sudden stops.

This happened on 10/20 at 6:45 at the end of Walls Rd. in Hermiston, OR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped to take pics of the feedlot and my husband saw the UFO&#39;s.  There were 2 in the sky.  They looked like fireballs to me. Positioned low on the horizon to the East.  They did not appear to move back, forth, up or down but were floating and definitely headed away from us. They slowly faded from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I caught on video matches my description but the still shots I got were completely different.  Once I zoomed in and got an up close look these UFO&#39;s looked like the number 7.  Perfectly printed # 7.  Also cloud like in color and consistency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We jumped in the truck to chase these things, hoping to see more and saw something totally different but just as strange.  We headed east down Holdman Road towards Pendleton. When my husband spotted something and said to pull over.  What I saw was what look to be a cylinder shaped cloud.  My husband had a powerful spotting scope and said the UFO had exhaust or smoke coming out of it.  This UFO was flying very fast from the left along the horizon into the rising sun in the East.  I did get some video that shows nothing and some pics that you can see it in the far distance. What I thought was strange was a military jet passed over us, flying towards the UFO.  I also got pics of the jet.  The sun rose that morning at 7:22 which ended our sightings for that day because the UFO disappeared into it.<n>

PD))|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93700.html|256|ndxe201210| Starlike colorful, red, blue, green, purple UFO that emerged from the other side of the hill<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and a friend were outside my home up in the hills near Glendale community college in Glendale, California, this has been happening all week starting on 10/13/12, when it gets dark and the stars come out, there is this bizzare starlike object, looks so different from all other stars in many ways: 1) its lower (closer to horizon) than all other stars, 2) its brighter and constantly changing colors randomly, red, green, blue, purple, 3) me and my friend were staring at it for a while, ten fifteen minutes straight and both came to the conclusion that it is not stationary, moving so slightly that u had to stare at it a while to notice the movement, goes left, stops, right, stops, towards us, stops, back, stops, all so slowly, always changing color. It basically moves but stays in the same general area, right where the star Sirius is supposed to be.  We pointed it out to a visitor arriving and he noticed movement as well. Just so bizzare, what is this please te! ll me? It has been eight nights in a row now. The most recent sighting was yesterday at 11:58PM we were looking at it to no avail when we finally see it emerge from behind the nearest hills visible from my balcony.  It moves slowly and to the right (we always see it when we are facing E/NE).  If u draw a line down towards the horizon starting from orions belt, its right along that line.  This had been going on all week, but last night, we saw it again, and this time, we saw it emerge from behind the hills, this eliminates any possibility that this starlike bright object is a planet or star.  I would go so far as to say that this object is in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.  When we saw it last night, and recorded video, ended up moving from just above the mountain range far upwards and to the right, unlike any of the six previous (of seven) nights I stayed awake to spot it.  I suspect since it didn&#39;t stay in the same general area as it usually did, that it is leaving, and I will no! t see it again tonight.  I will try to keep everyone updated. ! We were suspicious at first, thinking this was the star Capella, or more likely the star Sirius, b/c it is in that same position every night, but seeing it come UP from BEHIND the hillside shows that it is not a star nor a planet/asteroid, anything from space.  It is within the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.  I have posted the recordings we have made on my youtube channel billdaburgereater, these are the links to the second and most recent sighting videos.  Though I cannot say for sure what it is, having seen it emerge from behind the hills, I can conclusively say what it is not.  The video does not capture the UFO emerging from behind the hill b/c when it did at 11:58PM, my roommate who has the camera was not home.  The second she got home, she set up the camera on a stand and I have included the following links to this description:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29452Yl4kU4&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL (second sighting, not using camera stand 10/17/12)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyb8lce5qn0&amp;list=PLFE3F8777B0C557FD&amp;index=8&amp;feature=plpp_video (most recent sighting 10/19/12)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gabacCVbx1A&amp;feature=bf_next&amp;list=PLFE3F8777B0C557FD (better edited video w/commentary of the witnesses 10/19/12)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Capella?

This second time, the UFO was a little North of where it appeared the first time tonight.  As before, the UFO stopped in mid-air for some time and moved around slightly before performing an impossible 180 degree turn and quickly returning East from where it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to call nearby family this time, whereas last time they didn&#39;t pick up the phone in time. They were able to see the UFO before it left this time, so I increased the number of witnesses to three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you can gain access to any weather, visibility, &amp;quot;sunrise&amp;quot;, or traffic cameras that point toward the Superstition Mountains and look out across the reservation - you will find footage. It glowed brighter than any stars, and brighter than any aircraft. Specific times were 11:05pm and 11:25pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, the last plane to leave Sky Harbor International Airport in this direction was at 11:05pm.  The pilot, seemingly upon seeing the craft, executed a tight turn South. I did not see another plane or helicopter in the air until about 11:45pm.  Not even police, and not a single aircraft flew in from the area of the UFO - which was in a flight-lane used as an approach for Sky Harbor.<n>

I happened to look at the northern sky when suddenly this huge beautiful round craft appeared just about 500 yards infront of me, maybe 300 yards of the ground the size of a football field, maybe 3 stories high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen !!!  It was huge, round, with perfect straight outlines.  The whole craft lit up as bright as the sun in many fluorescent colors, mainly bright yellow and orange. It stood perfectly still in the air, about 300 yards of the ground and discharged large &#34;electrical flames&#34; out of the bottom, all the way around the craft. The &#34;flames&#34; were the same color of the ship and looked like a form of &#34;zig zack&#34; about 40-50 feet deep coming to a perfect point on the bottom.  Oh my God!  That thing was the most beautiful thing someone could ever imagine ! I could see the whole thing clear, no blurr...it  appeared to be hollow in the center, like a big &#34;ring&#34;, but because of the night, it could have been just a dark center. I never seen it fly up, it just suddenly appeared and made this spectacular light show, standing still in the air, for about one second, then the lights went out and after a blink of an ! eye, about 1/10 of a second, it dropped about 50 yards straight down and stood still and lit up again doing its light show, like yellow and orange colors going vertical around the  craft...the top half turning one way, the bottom half turning the other way, like against each other and at the same time discharging these long pointy electrical &#34;flames&#34; towards the bottom all the way around. It made no noise, it was totally silent. Then all lights went out again and for the 3rd time, after 1/10 of a second it appeared again another 50 yards deeper then before and lit up again . I am not talking about a craft with lights, I am talking about the whole ship looked like one big sparkling light, but yet with clear sharp outlines and perfect pointy flames shooting out of the bottom. The whole spectacle lasted only about 4 seconds and after the lights went out the 3rd time, it was gone. I never seen it fly up nor fly away.  Basically it just dropped out of the sky 3 times 50! yards and stopped in between as fast as your eye would blink!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After i t was all over, I could not believe what I saw for days, weeks and months...but I know what I saw was the most beautiful space ship ever and so close to me.  I had no camera, and even if I would have had one, there would have been not enough time to snap a picture.  Too bad, but I can make a drawing on request.<n>

I saw a red object leave the ground area aproxamatly 2-3 miles away it went upward in a semi circle motion then the light either stopped or fadded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple seconds passed when I started to think there was an airport over there, then I thought I never saw a motion or light so big from an air plane.  No sooner the light reappeared it went  left to right and up and down in a swooping motion more left to right then up and down.  I watched for 1-2 minutes while rubbing my eyes and trying to focus on other things to make sure this is  what it really is.  Then it confirmed all questions running through my mind I was originally looking west over the barnaget bay when first spotted now the red light traveled south and east in my  direction.  It only seemed to take 8-10 seconds to travel 2-3 miles the light was heading directly at me getting bigger and brighter slowly these straight red lines appeared from each side I can  only decribe them as laser pointers it was as if the light turned and tilted directly at me is when I saw these lines.  Without any thought I turned and ran behind me looking back here and there it was going back also towards the original location.  I quickly got my dad up who just laid down for bed, I yelled hurry up you have to come see this,  I looked back outside and don&#39;t see anything I yell again hurry up.  My dad put shorts and shoes on and ran out with me it was back and at its origanal location swooping left and right we both got to see it again for about 1 minute.  It was gone, I got a video camera out of the truck I was ready this time for some video. I spent the next hour and a half looking but nothing happened.  I have never seen anything strange in the sky before this, i am hoping I can find somebody else that saw it that night. I sure am glad that my dad got to see at least some of it, otherwise I would probably think I was absolutely crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed six to eight lights in the southern sky hovering over the Oklahoma City area.  At first, I thought the lights were in an unconventional pattern.  However, when I got home, I drew the pattern of lights on a sheet of paper, and I noticed the next day that the pattern of the lights is similar to the Big Dipper.   I got out of my car and took three pictures with my cell phone.  The pictures are dark, and I cannot see the lights on the photos.   I got back in my car and headed south on Kelly.  I continued to clearly see the lights that were hovering in the sky.  I then noticed that three to four of the lights had moved north and were suddenly very close to me in the Edmond area (just west of Kelly).  The objects flew right over my car (to the right/west), and I watched them as I continued to drive.  At first, I thought the objects were helicopters because they appeared to be moving fa! irly slowly.  As they came closer, I realized their shape was triangular.  As they flew over, they did not make any noise.  Each object had mostly white and some red lights on the bottom.  The lights were in rows and appeared to outline the entire bottom of the object.  They continued to move north out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I initially observed it out of the corner of my eye while looking northeast  and conversing with her. I pointed it out to her and we watched it until it disappeared. In the last 5 seconds of viewing it appeared to have folded its wings back in a similar manner to various military aircraft, although its speed was not affected by this maneuver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was triangular in shape, with the length (from nose to tail) of the craft being approximately 1/3 of the width (wingspan). Additionally, the main body appeared to be black with what seemed like a dozen or so orangish reflectors, or dimly lit lights, symmetrically dispersed on the underside of the body. While our depth perception was scewed due to the darkness, I would estimate it having been around 1,000 ft above ground level. From that  altitude, I would guess its wingspan to have been approximately 80ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew at a consistent speed, and we viewed it for around 15 to 20 seconds prior to it flying out of eyesight. Our approximate viewing area was a total of 115 degrees out of 180 (horizon to horizon). It is difficult to describe strictly in words, but it dissappeared from our eyesight prior to reaching an obstacle that would have naturally inhibited our viewing of the craft (i.e. it simply faded away as opposed to flying behind the adjacent house). The night here has been crystal clear and we have experienced very little wind that may have kicked up dust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our backyard and patio faces the east, with our two story house blocking any view of the west (including the moon at the time of viewing). We live in a typical Katy, Tx subdivision, so there is a certain amount of ambient light. However, we enjoy the relatively quiet evenings of the neighborhood on our patio with the lights off, which gives us as good of a view as we can get of the stars. I mention these facts only to emphasize that we had a clear view of the craft against a black sky background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as explinations, there is skydiving in our area but, as a skydiver, this was not a parachute. We have motorized paragliders in the area as well, but this was certainly not that either as there was no noise nor a parachute of any kind. We have a small airport near our house, but we watch those aircraft come and go everyday(and night), and this was neither on the proper heading, nor did it have the physical attributes of the planes that fly in and out of there. Hang gliding is highly unlikely as there are no elevated areas to start from, and the size of the craft and time of day would not make sense, in addition to the perceived speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not necessarily a believer in alien UFOs, however I cannot explain what we saw tonight. I pride myself on my logical way of thinking and having a healthy skeptisism of many things in life. I am a (former) Marine infantry squad leader who left the Corps about 4 years ago with an impeccable service record at the rank of Seargent (E-5), and have since had a solid professional career. My wife is a teacher working on her Masters degree with plans to persue a doctorate. I do not wear a tin foil hat. I have scoffed at many on the news and Discovery Channel for claiming to have experienced similar things. I am not overwhelmed by what I saw i am just simply trying to find an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I do not claim what we saw was was either extraterrestrial or governmental.  I only claim to have seen something over our house that neither my wife nor I can logically identify based on our own experiences and knowledge.  Take it as you will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were nearing the turn to our street travelling east when my husband, who was driving, alerted me to a round looking orange light to our right. My initial thought was that it was a light from the communication tower which was near our home, but upon studying it further, we could clearly see that it was nowhere close to the tower. We realized that it was moving, heading southeast, slowly and at about the altitude of a small plane or helicopter, but the light was burning steady, not blinking. By this point, all four of us in the car were watching it, and we had turned west onto the street to our home. We all agreed that it seemed to be “on fire”, or “burning”. My husband stopped the car and we opened windows to listen. None of us heard an engine or any sound from the object. It continued to travel in a southeast direction for another minute or so and then disappeared completely! .<n>

(1214 Hamilton, Lockport, IL)  We see an orange light coming from the south heading north. It appeared from behind a tree line. It was about 40d above the horizon. It looked like a ball of slowly pulsating orange light.  No blinking or flashing lights on it. It&#39;s speed was like that of a regular jet. - About two seconds later a second orange orb appears from behind the tree line and follows the same path heading north as the first one.  It&#39;s speed and color were the same as the first one. - About three or four seconds later, a third light appears out of the same spot and was heading in the same direction. This third one seemed to stop briefly and then continued north. My friend took a movie of it with his cell phone. - About 4 or 5 seconds later, a fourth orb appears from the same spot and heads north. I took a pic with my crappy cell phone camera. - ! About ten seconds after that, a fifth orange orb appears. It appeared from the same spot, heading north, traveling at the same speed as the others. This 5th orb suddenly doubles or triples it&#39;s speed. It shoots across the sky and catches up to the fourth orb. This fifth orb then abruptly slows down to the speed that the others seemed to be traveling at. - All five orbs were the same color; they all pulsated the same way; and they were completely silent. - My cell camera pic was of the fourth orb. This pic shows that the fourth orb was made up of four smaller orbs - a white orb followed by an orange orb followed by a yellowish gold orb followed by an orange orb. My eyes did NOT see these smaller four orbs - I only saw a larger orange orb. Additional Facts: - Practically every day the skies above lockport are filled with chemtrails that stretch from horizon to horizon and some times the chemtrails form a grid pattern in the sky. - The unmarked black helicopters are frequently! seen flying above us. - Lockport is located near the D.O.E.&#39;s!

It travelled slower than all other meteors that I have seen.  Approximately thirty degrees of sky were traveled in eight or ten seconds.  Toward the end of travel the object broke into three pieces of white light and extinguished.  Within a few seconds a light of magnitude -4 (like Venus) appeared in the vicinity of the extinguishing point of the meteor-like object and remained stationary.  This light disappeared after fifteen seconds or so and a flashing light of magnitude 2 (like Mercury) appeared five degrees above the brighter light location.  This light disappeared after ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having grown up in the Davenport, Washington area myself; High Five to Peter Davenport!<n>

Object was shiny silver and made no noise whatsoever.  The object did not have wings like jet planes that fly over and make noise.  It also let out 2 small puffs of white smoke or something like smoke.  I watched this object till it went out of sight and I did not see any more puffs of smoke.  This object was going about as fast as a jet would go and the sun reflecting off of it is what caught my eye.  I have never seen anything like this in my life(60 years).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Stuck in traffic near BWI, we saw three differently sized, very odd-shaped solid objects motionless in a clear blue sky several hundred feet above the ground roughly a mile east of Telegraph Road and Reece Road.  It was not smoke, balloons, a hang-glider or any known vehicle or object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought it was debris like a sheet of black plastic that had been carried into the sky but the three pieces stayed relatively motionless during the 3-5 minutes that I watched it.  I can only describe it as resembling a dark brown mold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an Air Force Academy grad with 30 years working in aerospace, I can safely say that it was not a conventional aerodynamic design of any kind and seemed unlikely to be debris.  I was totally freaked out and baffled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else report something strange like this?<n>

It seemed to stop once it was directly overhead of our house for about 20 or 30 seconds , then accelerated and disappear in a matter of seconds.  It was hard to judge its altitude it looked like the distance of a airliner possibly but with no sound.

I saw traveling in the sky from the northwest a small white ball.  It did not blink, like an aircraft, and there was no red or green blinking lights.  Just a small circle of light-- large enough to cast a shadow had it been lower in the sky.  It was moving quite fast, but not like a meteor that shoots across the sky.  Faster than a plane – like a meteor in slow motion.  I am fairly certain it was not an airplane.  I am a legal assistant and commute to Seattle every week day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was bright at first and dimmed to a dull red as the object approached , then it dimmed out as the diamond shaped object moved slowly overhead.  It appeared to be a light grey or dull white with no lights at all about 40 percent of the size of a full moon.  It continued to fly slowly and silently directly overhead toward the east-slightly southeast direction at a constant slow speed until it disappeared into the tree line.  There were no clouds, no wind ,it was an absolutely clear sky.<n>

At first they were stationary, but then they started moving back and forth and diagonal to each other, sometimes with great speed.  They appeared brighter than a star or planet. It  was very mesmerizing to watch, because we had never seen airplanes move that way.  Helicopters don&#39;t move that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We checked the UFO reporting site, and checked with friends.  One friend in Rumford, RI saw a stationary object brighter than a planet in the eastern sky, but nothing moving.  But she was driving and couldn&#39;t take her eyes off the road to get a good view of it.  She said points of light were coming off the object in two places, and it was brighter than a planet.<n>

I then saw red and blue lights seeming to circle it. It moved further east.  It hovered back and forth.  Bright light came back, it dimmed.  It headed to the airport and landed.  I&#39;ve been hearing helicopters since.<n>

Light stays on between flashes.  These three &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot;flew from south to north across me, this is as low as they got I seen, came from Dugway area assuming jet fighters high altitude. When I seen them they were as bright as Jupiter or something similar, while passing they split one stayed north course one went north north east then east.  They circled the sky, not to fast not to noticeable as I said bright as a star.  But went to a higher elevation to a star about medium brightness. So while driving watching these I noticed they are just going in circles or chasing eachother, getting more interested I pulled off to a rest stop.  Got out walked beyond the parking lot lights covered my eyes I see the! se what I thought were fighter jets &amp;quot;no sound either by the way&amp;quot; start to group up and head north. At this point there is about five - I could only see when I cup my eyes from external light. Going north I see what I assumed was an array of radio towers, well they had lights and were strobing as well but a little dimmer. When I first seen them they were stationary about 8-12 maybe 15 lights. But the lights moved west bound when these 5 fighter craft approached. As it looked the fighter craft was &amp;quot;bearding&amp;quot; these lights away from the Salt Lake City area. While staring at these lights the group of lights I noticed were one whole unit- that or made the the Blue Angels look like newbs. I can only assume this is a triangle everyone sees, but at the angle probably 15-25 degrees the lights looked clustered yet spread. Unfortunately I had to go deliver my load which was about 10 miles away. I parked in view of the area stayed the night in the darkest place and s! aw nothing but meteors from the meteor shower. No more dancing! lights or space ships etc. As a trucker I see alot of this stuff just never cared to share I guess because I&#39;am my own biggest skeptic til last night.<n>

It was a very good distance away, but I knew it was larger than the normal stars.  While I was trying to figure out what it was, the light split into two orange balls, and then vanished within a few seconds.  My girlfriend did not see it, but I made sure she didn’t think I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few miles down the road, she tells me that she can see it.  I look on the right hand side of the road, and approximately 500 yards away there are three orange balls in a horizontal line hovering probably 100-200 feet off the ground. We turn right on a road and can still see them through the trees.  I try to pull into a road to see them very close, and then it appeared to either take off really fast then disappear, or the lights just turned off one by one.  I believe that it started moving east at a high rate of speed, but she thinks that it just turned its lights off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a friend a few towns over who said he saw the same thing at 21:30, and he received a call from someone saying that they saw the craft being chased by a jet, but the jet could not catch it.  That happened at 21:45.<n>

At first I thought that it could be some sort of air balloon as they were not making any noise. They were traveling at a speed of approximately 2 times what I would expect from an aircraft traveling at the same height.  Then I looked up and there were two more, then two more then one more.  This continued for a total of 16 sightings. There may have been more prior to the first sighting. I waited several more minutes to see if there would be more but that was all there were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I saw it and so did two of my friends. The next day I heard that people who lived farther up wolfsville heard the same freight train sound that I did at about the same time  I would estimate it was the size of about one football field.

I was outdoors facing the northeast, watching the sky for meteors. First saw a normal airplane come over the horizon and travel across the sky. Next, I noticed an iridescent orange glow that I could not initially resolve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went to get my prescription glasses out of my car and it had moved further along. It was triangle shaped, and the color and light it seemed to be emitting was like fire.  As it passed directly overhead and moved off toward the western sky,  I noticed blinking lights on the rear of the object. Starting in the east, it did not move in a fixed path like an airplane would, but instead was moving off side to side slightly irregularly while heading east/west.  It then banked northwest slightly after passing overhead and appeared to be pitching side to side, making the triangle shape more obvious against the dark sky.  It was still fiery orange but almost appeared to ! be reflecting light while pitching rather than emitting.  The whole sighting lasted approximately five minutes total.  The object did not emit any sound, and was moving at approximately the same speed as an aircraft in the distance that had been spotted a moment earlier.  Horizon to horizon over a few minutes.  It did not appear to be a meteor or bolide, and did not break up or leave a trail behind.<n>

Less then 90mph I would say but of course this is a guess from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also they were below the overcast cloud line and I only say that because of how clearly visible they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the strange thing about this event is that there was a sighting yesterday 10/17/12 around dusk in an adjacent city...however there were 4 objects, oval, bright, orangey yellow in color also. A coworkers cousin snapped a photo of that sighting and showed it to me stunned after I told her what I just had witnessed.  There were also about 6-7 people that needed their vehicles jump started today that we knew of.  The 10:00 o clock news had reported meteor showers but had mentioned the conditions were poor to view and the Chicagoland area was not in the best viewing zone anyways.<n>

It was about 22.50 degrees above the horizon.  It was moving much slower then an airplane, and I thought it could be a blimp, but it moved faster than a blimp, and the ends were not rounded like a blimp.   A helicopter could move at that speed, but its shape in no way resembled a helicopter.<n>

Ironically, I believe the name of the trail we were hiking on was called Devil&#39;s Bridge Trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we finished our hike my girlfriend decided to lay down and rest for a while while I continued to walk around at the base of the trail by myself for a while.  The sky was completely blue with not even a single cloud in the sky.  I looked up and saw a jelly-bean or egg shaped object (orientated horizontally) in the sky.  The object had a smooth, mirror-like surface which completely covered the entire surface of the object.  I guesstimate the object to be approximately two to three thousand feet up in the air (I am from Chicago, IL, so I used the Sears tower height as reference).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not move at all, did not make any sound and left no vapor trail.  I stared and studied the object for about a minute or so trying to figure out what it was.  Using logic, I figured it either had to be an experimental military craft or a UFO.  At this point in time my girlfriend had started to walk over to where I was standing while I was observing the object. I had turned my head away for no more than five seconds to inform my girlfriend of what I had been observing for the past minute so she could see the same thing that I was looking at, when all of a sudden, IT VANISHED !!  Can&#39;t explain it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did some research online and found out there was another gentleman who actually filmed the same object I had seen in the sky around the same time (I think he filmed the object in November of 2012 in Sedona).  You can view his video on youtube.com.  The object that he filmed was the same object that I had seen with the only difference being its orientation (his object was orientated vertically as opposed to the object I saw which was orientated horizontally)  Any explanation about what I encountered would surely help satisfy my curiosity.  Thanx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I see on almost a weekly basis a starlike object floating across the sky at nearly double the speed of a 747 that comes from the northeast and travels south west and disslappears into space within a few seconds. I live near a major airport and know what a plane looks like at 35000 feet.  This is more like 30000 feet to disappearance in a few seconds.  Not sure what I&#39;m seeing but its not a plane.  Someone out there has the answers but I doubt I will find out in my lifetime.  Maybe I don&#39;t want to know.  I&#39;m jaded with the whole subject due to the misinformation and lies. We know something is going on but no one is ready to man up with the answers.<n>

I haven&#39;t been a skeptic, nor a believer entirely until now.  On both occasions there was only one UFO that I could tell.  It moves very rapidly back and forth, up and down, but mainly stays in the same spot.  They emanate a bright yellowish light and every few seconds a brighter more white light streams down from underneath of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I had spotted it about a month ago, I thought for sure that It must have been an hallucination, until I ran into the house to get my father who assured me it was no hallucination, that he could see it too!   Both nights that I have observed it, it was clear cool nights with no moon.  Both nights it acted the same way, but this time I&#39;m fairly certain that it was being attacked!!  Bright reddish flashes would go off from either side of the craft, like a force field was in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a few airplane lights sort of circling it. But the UFO in question still stayed in its spot for the most part. And I gave up watching it after an hour or so.<n>

I then turned left onto a side street where I recorded a short video on my phone.  Then I turned around and continued on Vulcan, north towards the object, where I stopped in the street and recorded it some more till a car was coming.  Next, I made a left turn into the train and bus parking lot where I tried recording from my car but the street lights prevented it from showing up on video. I sat and watched it hover over the home for about 5 minutes until it started to fly/hover in the direction that I was parked. This frightened me and I exited the parking lot on a side street where it then met the 101 coast highway where I turned left and looked up to try and find it while driving. I couldn&#39;t see it. I drove for about 5 minutes and then returned to the area where it was a! nd could not see it. I checked 30 minutes later to see if there was any trace of it and there wasn&#39;t.<n>

10/17/12 23:05|Dunedin|FL|||We saw 2 separate tight circles of exploding lights which eventually stopped and locked into a cluster formation..|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93659.html|297|ndxe201210| We saw 2 separate tight circles of exploding lights which eventually stopped and locked into a cluster formation..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 27 year old man and this is my first time posting anything like this, I hope that someone else saw this to, and if not this exact event possibly something similar.  Here is a detailed account of what me and my 68 year old mother saw on October 17th 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my front door to take my trash out at about 11:05 pm est and I saw what at first looked like a small,  very tight circle of 8 to 12 extremely bright, white, stationary stars due west of my location in Dunedin, Florida.  There seems to be 3-4 prominent lights that are much brighter then the others, then 7-8 or more smaller lights beaming out in all different directions.  I just stared at the cluster unable to look away for about 2 minutes.  I then began to notice a blurred halo/aura effect around the perimeter of the cluster.  At that point I yelled across the house for my Mother to come look and verify that she was seeing what I was seeing, and to bring me my digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was shocked when she saw the tight cluster of lights and started asking me what could possibly be making such a bright circle of dots in the sky, stating &amp;quot;it looked like a cluster of stars exploding&amp;quot;.  By this time it started to resemble an explosion in space to me as well, like there had been a central object and all the lights were shooting out slowly in all different directions from a central point and then just stopped in place.  Then the area in the center of the cluster of lights which had been dark, suddenly had several smaller lights appear and begin to twinkle and blink in and out in different areas in the center of the cluster.  I took my digital Sony Cyber-Shot 2.0 mega pixel camera and attempted to take some pictures, but as soon as I would turn it on it would blink low battery and turn off.  I had brand new batteries in my camera so I have no explanation for this.  I then took some batteries out of a remote control and tried again and I got the same res! ult.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this time some clouds moved out of the way to the south of the first circle of lights and a second circle became visible, although this circle was much dimmer then the first one.  Both circles seem to be remaining stationary as far as their position in the sky, while the lights in the center of the circles continued to twinkle/sparkle and change location inside the cluster.  I have never seen anything even close to this in my whole life, and neither had my Mother who is 68 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately started searching online to see if their was any celestial events visible from my location, and there was nothing listed for 10/17/12 at all.  I then began a search to try and identify what I was seeing and I couldn&#39;t find anything even close.  My search is what finally led me to this site, where I figured if I couldn&#39;t identify the cluster of lights in the sky I could at least share my experience with others, and maybe someone else had seen the same thing and could confirm it.<n>

We pulled over and took photographs of the object which just remained still and in the same place in the sky for the duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t flash or pulse, it was just a big light.  Quite eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A helicopter came from the east at approximately the same altitude as the UFO and flew directly towards the object, as if to investigate what it was.  The ball of light was about 3 times the size of the white light on the helicopter and they were both about 500 feet, approximately, in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the helicopter approached the ball of light and got within what looked like approximately 200-300 feet away from it, the ball of light just disappeared!  It was like somebody had just turned off a light. It was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did see a large ball of bright red light that was approximately 100 feet above the ground to the right of the Willington turn-off on the A38 Dual Carriageway in Derby, on the way to dog training at 6.50pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again this ball of bright red light was just hovering and did not move. We observed it whilst driving for approximately 4 minutes. It disappeared when we turned off at the Willington junction.  It was there and we could see it from the roundabout and it just disappeared! Conditions were good and dry.<n>

We noticed that it was flashing very bright and then all of a sudden it vanished.  We observed three flashing lights like planes, but seemed as if they were moving very fast.  Two of the lights seemed as if one was following the other, than the light stopped in mid air, and its like they came together and flew together.  The two lights flew towards us which seemed from our view point was a big plane.  Than the Lights flew in opposite directions.  It was very weird and I just don&#39;t know what I seen.<n>

I didn&#39;t think much about it, until I seen it start to move in an almost zig-zag motion.  It hovered about 60-100 meters above the houses for sometime, until it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it stopped, there was a flash that lit the sky, then it vanished.  There were no noises, from birds, dogs, anything up until there was no more light in the sky.<n>

Out the front window and slightly off to the right side  I noticed an extremely unusual light in the sky.  I commented immediately upon seeing the light, as it was so strange and moving so very fast that I exclaimed;  &amp;quot;WHATS THAT! &amp;quot;  while pointing to the moving light. My Assistant saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was not too far away as it was clear and crisp, there was no observable haze or diffused effects of atmosphere to give a sense of a greater depth or distance, the light was only about 2 or 3 miles away at the furthest I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the light was about 1400 feet off the ground when I first noticed it dropping into the top of my front window&#39;s field of view.  It was traveling at a very steep angle of attack ( it was diving towards the ground ) and diving at about a 45 degree angle downwards to the right.  It appeared to be dropping sideways to me, not coming towards or away from me but perpendicular to my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was traveling at an extremely fast rate of speed when we say it, It was traveling much much faster then even a commercial jet diving at full speed .  We lost sight of the object at about 200-300 feet off the ground or so as it disappeared behind a small rise of trees off to our right side of the freeway so we did not get to see how it bottomed out of it&#39;s trajectory.  It was traveling far too fast to &amp;quot;Pull Up&amp;quot; from the dive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we made the gradual turn around the bend of the freeway  8 seconds later and the horizon was revealed to us on the now slightly elevated portion of the freeway we expected to see a fire ball or smoke where the object must have impacted but there was nothing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total elapsed time of the streaking object must have been only 2.5 seconds total. (From about 1,400 feet elevation down to 200 feet elevation in 2.5 seconds is fast )<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like a jets landing lights when they are facing you.  Overly bright and it had an additional blue light on top and green accent light on the bottom, but all the time it was overly bright and cool white light looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also observed that it was not a warm light like a streaking meteor, or something burning up in the atmosphere, and there was no contrail  or derbies field in its wake, just a overly bright cool point of light in 3 colors.<n>

I have seen Meteor showers before in the mountains but this was far bigger It looked like I thought a comet would with a tail that went about two degrees long from where I was standing.  It was about 35 degrees up from where I was standing.  It was going from my left to right or South to North as I was facing West.  It was angling slightly downward then broke up into 3 pieces, all on fire, and began more of a arch going down then they burnt out.  This lasted about 3 seconds.  It may have been longer but I just saw it as I got out of my car and did not see when it started.  I hope it was not a airplane going down into the SF bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Union city is in a flight path for the Oakland, Hayward and San Francisco Airport, I can always see at least 4 or 5 planes somewhere in the air and would be surprised if one of them didn’t see it.<n>

It travelled downward at a perfect angle at a somewhat fast speed.  I lost visual of the object in the tree line.  I came home and got my sister to go driving with me to see if we could locate it again.  I was half expecting to see if there was a fire or at least some proof to disregard it as anything  other than a unidentified flying object, but we saw nothing.  On our way home we noticed several strange jet streams that did not look at all like they were in any normal flight pattern.  One was at a 95 degree angle downward that dissipated about 3/4 the way down from the horizon (similar to how you would see a tornado coming out of the clouds).  The second was at approximately the same angle as how I observed the object, but at a different location.  I cannot think of anything that would resemble ! this object, military, commercial, or otherwise. There was no sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I only saw the light for a couple of seconds because of the high speed of which it was moving and because there was only so much space between the top of my windshield and the top of the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was pretty far away, I am assuming, because it was only about half an inch long in the sky but still far too big for an airplane or a shooting star.  It was a very bright, shining, white oval-shaped light and right before it reached the top of the tree line there was a blue light that flashed right at the front portion of it.  It went from the top of my windshield to the tree line in about a second, maybe two.  It went down slightly horizontally but I could not tell if there was any other part of the structure, all I saw was the bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried so hard to debunk what I had seen, thinking maybe it was a reflection from my stereo or a street lamp or something but there are no street lamps on that portion of the road and the light was way to clear and bright to be a reflection.  Not sure exactly what it was, I cant find anything online about a plane crash or comet, etc.  This would be the first time I have every experienced anything close to maybe seeing a UFO.<n>

So, I spend a lot of time star gazing. I&#39;ve never before seen anything out of the ordinary. But the other night, while driving, something caught my eye. A stationary blinking light that appeared to just hover and blink. The road I was driving is quite curvy, so I slowed, and watched for about four seconds.  The blink then reappeared very far away toward the east, then once again, then I never saw another blink.  I did not mention this to anyone, my friends already ridicule my UFO enthusiasm enough.  But walking with a close friend, who absolutely does not believe in UFO&#39;s, she reported seeing something &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; in the sky around the same night of my encounter.  She proceeded to describe the exact same event.  I found out she, though in a different car, was on a nearby road, driving the same direction, at the same time.  She described all of this to me BEFORE I told her of my encounter.  Her description matched all of my details, incl! uding a stationary blinking white light, two blinks toward the east, then no more.  She, however, was not driving and had more time to really observe this object.  I find it most unusual she told me this, since she cringes every time I try to show her anything on UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I heard what I can best describe as a quiet, but umbling sound and looked up to see an enormous aircraft heading over the hill that I live on.  It was following Co. Rd. 86 in Wayne Co. Ohio (just west of Wooster) and it wasn&#39;t very high in the sky.  There were lights on the object and it was huge.  It appears to have square lights and the back end was squared.  I could not see the front end because it had already passed over me.  As I said, I live on a hill and have a garage that blocked my view of the front of the object because it was flying so low.  It did not make any type of &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; airplane sound and had no visible wings.  From my perspective, it looked square, but that was the back end.  It was not moving as fast as a normal airplane would move.  I do not -- did not believe in UFOs, but have no explanation for what I saw.  During the period of time that it was passing overhead, my wife reported! that the satellite TV picture was scrambled.  She was inside watching TV.  We live in a rural farm area.<n>

I thought maybe they could possibly be two hot air balloons, but it was 9pm and 30 degrees and rainy!!  Maybe paper lanterns????<n>

Maybe 15 mintues later I began detecting again and the tide was coming in and occasionally would send a surge of water rushing towards me, and as a surge came towards me i turned and ran away from it to keep my metal detector from getting wet and as i turned and stopped and noticed off to the Northwest 5 Giant white lights moving from left to right , THIS WAS A CRAFT!  From my vantage point i could tell the object was triangluar in shape, it was totally silent and for being atleast a mile away it stuck out like a sore thumb in the night sky! These lights like i described to the operator upon my oringal report to the UFO Reporting Center were smaller than a full moon but definately bigger than a star and venus!  As it conti! nued to move slowy from West to East it began to slowly make a 90 degree turn and started heading to the North and that was when I got my iphone out and attempted to get a video of it but my phone froze up, im not sure if it was because of the UFO or just my phone messing up but it has never done that before, i could see the object from the back and also the lights werent as bright as before because they werent directly in front of me, but the underside of the craft had a red pulsing light smaller than the white ones but not by much! The craft headed slowly towards the north and as it headed away from me the dunes from the beach blocked my view.  As i stood there i automaticly knew what i had witnessed! i started running to my car determined to get another look at the object and as i was running i heard a military helicopter coming from east along the shoreline and came directly over my head and turned and headed toward the north like it was chasing after the craft! The Helicopter had only its dull red lights on. I got to my car and sta! rted hea ding in the direction i last saw the object but i never saw it again after it last left my line of sight behind the dunes. I called my local poilce department and they said they will call air traffic control and report my statement to them!  This undeniably a legit UFO!!<n>

I saw 3 different type of craft. First I spotted a star-like object streak over from Joshua Tree National Park to the center between desert hot springs and palm springs and then it stopped suddenly and was hovering occasionally floating back and forth and side to side off and on. The. I observed a similar size craft to the one just mentioned that was also star like streak in over Joshua tree national park from the other side then  stopped and was behaving the same way. I also observed craft that seemed dimmer and smaller flying around in all sorts of directions above the 2 other craft. There was also a hovering craft that was changing colors that hoverd over the San bernadino mountain range west of Joshua tree national park, then that craft vanished around 9pm. And also! red/orange colored balls were also observed periodically when they would fly out of nowhere then disappear within seconds. At around 9:15 I observed a military jet fly right through the vicinity which this siting was taking place in. This was a fleet of multiple different UFO crafts and it has been going on every night since Thursday 10-11-12.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The living room windows give a full view of Nantucket Sound and the shores of Cape Cod in East Falmouth and Mashpee.  On Tuesday night I saw a very bright light with a circular shape descending until it came to a pause, hovering over Cape Cod.  During this time I grabbed my camera and photographed it. After just two shots it gradually began to hover and rise east.  Then it began to accelerate and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ball of light’s diameter was much larger than any spot lights I’ve ever seen.  When it moved, the light never lost its spherical shape.  Its motion seemed to defy the effects of momentum in a way nothing human made I know of could move.  Wind was not a possible explanation either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to adjust the shutter speed enough to get a better look at it (kind of like adjusting to get the structural details of a full moon in a photo).  The light was so bright in the night sky that my eyes couldn’t make out any structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur photographer but I’ve had practice with this sort of application snapping pictures of full moons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures reveal a well defined, circular shape with a strange red hued pink/purple center and orange outer ring.

That’s when I pulled out my iphone and started recording this video http:<n> <n><n> <n><n> //youtu.be/nyV_-5Y42qg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after I started recording this it was as if the plane had noticed it and took a hard right. When the plane made that turn that object started to follow behind it till it caught up to it.  Then the object proceeded to fly circles around it as if it was curious of what the plan was.  After a couple of circles around the plan the object flew off at a very high rate of speed.  When I was in the yard I was facing North NW, the plane was flying straight towards me and the object that was in the sky chased it was coming from  the south.<n>

But at the same time, it would brighten and dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on 119 South on the 4 lane heading to Belfry Middle School, my 6 year old daughter was in the back seat and asked, &#34;What is that thing in the sky?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were around Wendy&#39;s at that time.  I watched it for a minute while driving and said &amp;quot;I need to pull over and look at this thing&amp;quot; we pulled over at Moore&#39;s, just below Food City.  By this time, it was moving upward and farther away from us.  We watched it in the sky until somewhere around the Marathon Station, just below the Middle School, where we lost sight of it because of the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We dropped my older daughter off at the Middle School, headed back down the road and I told my 6 year old to change sides so she could look out the other side of the car, to see if she could find it in the sky again.  She somewhere around South Williamson she yelled, &amp;quot;There it is again!&amp;quot; So I pulled over just before the you get to ARH and we watched it and I tried to video tape it (but it was on my phone and didn&#39;t really show up because I couldn&#39;t zoom) I lice closae by so I decided to go back home, couldn&#39;t see it there, so I decided to ride back out to ARH and watch it some more but on my way out, my neighbor was standing there with binoculars and I asked him, &amp;quot;Are you seeing the mirror in the sky?&amp;quot; We watched it there for 20-30 minutes, it finally was lost begind the clouds.<n>

The autumn sky was a clear, bright blue with sunshine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first call came in from a railroad employee. He and several others saw it as they got off work around 3:00 p.m. Another call came in from a resident of West Williamson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Constructions workers at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College in the West End of town also sighted the object. Another woman from the South Williamson area also said she spotted the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A resident of the Valley View subdivision, which is south of Williamson, viewed the object through binoculars. She said the UFO appeared to be oblong and seemed to run vertical, rather than horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Employees of the Williamson Daily News and City Tire, which is right across the street from their offices, saw the object hovering for well over an hour. Customers of the automotive repair business also saw the UFO. Heads were turned skyward toward the object. At times it appeared to get brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several jets appeared to fly in the vicinity of the UFO.  Contrails could be seen zigzagging all around the object.  This made for much speculation by those who witnessed the strange, airborne object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reports from Pike County also said the UFO was spotted near Elkhorn City and Pikeville, Ky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Facebook was alive with people commenting on the pictures that were uploaded.

Occasionally, it would flash very brightly, like it was turning and reflecting the sunlight.  We got to our destination and pointed the object out to three other people.  Someone brought out a pair of binoculars but the object was so distant that they didn&#39;t reveal much.  It looked cylindrical.  As we were observing it, the object began to rise straight up and eventually disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Object appeared to stand still in the sky, and flash intermittently. I watched the object for approximately 45 seconds to try to determine what I was looking at.  I called my wife out of the house to check out whatever it was. We both watched the object remain completely unmoving in the clear, cloudless sky, for at least a minute.  Without a good reference to scale, the guess of altitude was maybe 10,000ft, and about 3 miles distant from our point of observation, towards the WNW.  I was interrupted by a cell phone call, during which, my wife retrieved a pair of binoculars for closer inspection.   She observed a silver, telephone pole shaped object that rotated slowly, with no other apparent movement, laterally or vertically.  The flash came from one side of the object reflecting the sun as it spun very slowly.  Shewatched the object for several minutes while I returned inside.  I finished my call and returned outside to find my wife clearly astonished by what we had both seen. She handed the binoculars to me, and when I turned to where the object had been, it was gone.  She was confident that it was not a mylar balloon, (too long, skinny), nor any aircraft that was easily recognizable (no wings, not moving, no rotor).  In that general direction lies the regional airport, and possibly even the approaches to Knoxville airport.  My only possible explanation was atmospheric distortion of a flight climbing out of Knoxville, or maybe a weather balloon.  I almost called the regional airport tower to see if they would confirm, but decided not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2 days, my wife and I are still talking about it, so anybody out there who may have seen it, or knows what it was, feel free to post.<n>

I stood up and turned facing west and was going to take pictures of fall trees when I observed a long circular white tube which had thin black segments at regular intervals extending from object in the sky that curved toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At end of tube appeared to be a dull metal shield which opened like your top eyelid revealing a man who appeared to be in early 30&#39;s with black curly hair w/beard and mustache dressed in white robe seated and appeared to be working controls.  The surface at end of tube appeared to be oval shaped and had black edges with amber color in middle but I could see man inside.  Man never looked at me but I felt like I was not supposed to observe.  I remember remarking &amp;quot;so that&#39;s how they do it&amp;quot; as the tube retracted back up to ufo and disappeared into bottom of object.  This took about 25 to 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound. There were no clouds in the sky to obstruct view of object.  There was no wind.  At first I thought it might be a satellite in the sky. I was kind of nervous and felt really strange about what I saw but nothing happened.  I questioned if I really saw what I did see.  I was not afraid of it or that it would harm me.  I just had a sense of curiosity.  I went back into my house for about 5 mins.  I came back out again to take more pics and to see if the object was still there. It was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided I would go to my back yard to take pics of more flowers and a crepe myrtle tree.  I then observed the object more nw as if it had moved to observe me.  I tried to take more pictures of the object as I could still see it with my naked eye but could not find it thru the lens of my camera.  I did observe a jet leaving a trail at the time the object was in the sky.  I tried to take several pics at different areas of where ufo was located to see if I could capture it again with my camera but to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I blew up the picture on my pc, there was a distinct glow of color around object.  There were no wings or obvious fuel tank, etc.  My daughter, who works in Johnson City for the local telephone company, along with fellow employees who were taking a break about 11:30 AM the same day, also saw the same object and many of them thought it was a satellite as well.  They did not observe the tube.  I was able to take 2 pics of ufo but quality was not the best as I had to zoom out my lens to get a picture and only limited zoom on my camera.<n>

10/16/12 05:35|Gunnison|CO|Flash|1-2 minutes|Strange lights observed at Castle Mountain area of Gunnison|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93605.html|343|ndxe201210| Strange lights observed at Castle Mountain area of Gunnison<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early this morning I experienced a strange occurrence at my home in the Castle Mountain area of Gunnison, Colorado.  My alarm went off at 5:33 AM. I was lying prostrate and opened my eyes.  At this time I saw an orange light illuminate my bedroom door.  The light was from the South and was very warm in color.  The duration was similar to that of a car driving by; however the road is on the West side of the building and head lights could not shine into my South facing windows.  My bedroom is on the North side of the house; the intensity of light was bright, especially since it came through the Southern bedroom window to illuminate the door to my bedroom.  My family has owned this home for over 30 years and I am very familiar with the typical patterns of light that shine through the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This strange light woke me up very quickly. I then saw another light pass by the exterior windows on the North side of the house.  This could have been more typical of headlights passing by the house.  At this time I got out of bed and went into my living room which has large picture windows to the North and South.  I did not see or hear any vehicles in the neighborhood – from my windows it would have been possible to see the vehicle that had passed by on the North side, but there was nothing.  I then looked out to the South and saw a very bright flash of light.  This appeared to be about ¼ of a mile away, only lasted for an instant, and was a bright white light.  I kept looking around and saw another light across the river to the Southeast; however I believe this really was a vehicle.  I observed the sky for a few more minutes, but did not see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe I have witnessed anything like this before – this is the first time I have reported a strange sighting.  My background is a professional lighting designer.  I have an exceptional skill at observing natural and artificial light and am also very perceptive about source intensity, direction, and color.  This was a very strange occurrence.<n>

10/16/12 03:00|Englewood|FL|Light|15 minutes|Slowly flashing white light in space or possibly low earth orbit.|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93626.html|345|ndxe201210| Slowly flashing white light in space or possibly low earth orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out onto my front deck to smoke at right around 3:00 Am.  We live on the Gulf of Mexico in a beachfront home so there is less light making the stars seem to stand out more than other cities I&#39;ve lived in, so when I smoke at night I always stare straight up at the stars.  Almost right away,  I noticed a bright, white light flash one time out of the corner of my eye. I tried to focus without blinking on the area that the flash seemed to originate from and waited.  Finally after what seemed like an eternity, I saw it again!  Only this time, I was looking right at it when it flashed.  The light was so far up, that it appeared to be a star.  It appeared to be stationery at first, and was located near the Southwest corner of the constellation Orion.  After the second flash, I pulled up the stop watch application on my smartphone and began to time the spacing between flashes.  To the best of my ability, I timed it to exactly 7 seconds between flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside quickly to ask my Fiancee if she would get out of bed and come outside to look at this light.  Luckily, she wasn&#39;t mad at me for waking her because we had seen the same sort of light last winter in the same exact location in the sky.  The only difference is the last time, the light flashed twice and was gone. The skies were completely clear, on both occasions, and the light  was so far away, the only way I can think to describe it is by comparing it to a star, that only shines for a half second every 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing that makes this worth reporting, is the incredible altitude at which it appeared to be coming from. I truly believe this object was in either low earth orbit, or in space. After watching the object and timing the frequency of the flashing for some time, I began to realize that it was actually moving, just very, very slow. After around 15 minutes, the object had moved a little less than the distance between the star furthest to the right of Orion&#39;s belt, and the center star in Orion&#39;s belt. Although it was actually located off of the Southwest corner of Orion, the distance between the stars in Orion&#39;s belt was the closest point of reference in determining the distance of travel. And given the very short distance the object travelled over a 15 minute period, this to me, has to be something other than an aircraft because I have never in my entire life seen an aircraft even half that high, and never have I seen an airplane that could fly that slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing that made me report this sighting, is the very slow, 7 second interval at which the light was flashing.  All the aircraft I have seen have marker lights and a strobe light. Whatever this was not only had no marker lights, but you could hardly consider this light a strobe purely because the period between flashes was so long, and the strangest fact of all, the fact that after about 15 minutes, it simply vanished and did not reappear.  And since the sky was perfectly clear and I could see every star and planet in the sky, the object could not have been obscured by a cloud.   I hope someone can look into this and check weather radar, air traffic radar, and find out if it could have been a satellite of some kind, or possibly even some military drone or experimental aircraft.<n>

It continued to move slowly, when in a split second, it veered east, then slowed back down again.  Even from the distance, and with it being slightly cloudy, I could see a definite shape..  Almost like a jet (nose facing straight up towards space), with the lower half angling out.  For about 20 minutes it hung in the same spot, constantly flashing.

Object appeared to Pulse at random intervals and with random lengths of duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was first thought to be stationary, but after approximately 2 minutes of observation, it changed position in the sky.  The object continued to appear around the area of Jupiter in the sky.   Moving in a random, yet semi-circular pattern, it remained in a relatively small area of view until approximately 11:15 PM. At this time the object appeared to move in a South Westerly direction, but at varying rates of speed and with multiple apparent sudden &#34;darting&#34; movements and course deviations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then appeared once again to stay in a relatively small area of the sky, but continued exhibiting sudden bursts of movements in random directions and often at near to absolute right angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch this object for approximately 55 minutes before it eventually seemed to either cease to emit light, or moved out of visual range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the entirety of this event, the pulse demonstrated no apparent pattern or rhythmic behavior as would a typical aircraft anti-collision light array. It was also not accompanied by the typical white and red lights of traditional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on my personal experiences as a pilot and lifelong aircraft enthusiast, with a profound understanding of aerodynamics and atmospheric phenomenon, I would estimate the object to be upper atmospheric or low space in altitude. There was no accompanying noise to indicate any type of typical aircraft propulsion and the ability to both “hover” and perform abrupt, high speed changes in direction as well as sudden bursts of acceleration run contrary to what is understood to be within the aerodynamic capabilities of winged or rotor aircraft. I.e. the altitude alone would prohibit sufficient lifting across a typical wing surface without the object having to move at a constant and extremely high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object also demonstrated none of the typical behaviors of satellites or other near earth orbiting objects, either Geo-stationary or Geo-synchronous.<n>

Two on top, one on the bottom.

Where I saw the UFO was in Normandy, TN, which is approximately 90 miles South of Nashville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was to the right of the sun about one quarter of a turn. The object was highly reflective especially on the top left and lower right corners.  I could not determine a color of this object because it was so reflective, it was the color of the sun.  I was not around a telescope so I had to use binoculars to observe this object.  I was only able to observe for a few minutes because I had to be somewhere else.  When I arrived at the place I had to go, approximately 30 minutes later (11:00 am), I could not find the object.  I don’t believe it was of alien origin, but by definition it is a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier in the morning, around 8:00 am, my grandfather also observed this object and he said it was lower in the sky than where I observed it at 10:30 am.  However, it was in the sky the entire duration from when ! he first saw it until when I saw it, but as far as I could tell, it disappeared around 11:00 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a beginning astronomer and a sophomore in college.  I am fascinated by space programs and alien shows, however, I do not believe this object was alien.  If anything, it was probably another government test of a new undercover aircraft.  I am submitting this not because I think it is alien, but because I want to know what it was.  I asked my astronomy professor if he saw this object and he said he did not, but a week or two after the sighting he did turn me onto a video on the internet about a man in KY that got footage of the UFO and was interviewed by CNN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO in that video is precisely what I saw, only I saw it on Oct. 15, 2012 and the man in the video saw it on Oct. 16, 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

There was no noticeable wind, the temperature was warm in the mid 70&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed the under side of a saucer shaped UFO, color white as the cloud, slowly emerged out of the cloud into the blue sky in a Northernly direction and hovered motionless for 10 seconds but maintained a close proximity to the cloud and then returned into the cloud, no longer visible.  After 1 minute the UFO emerged out of the cloud for another 10 seconds and once again returned into the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone, had no camera. I believed it to be a UFO saucer shaped aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One week prior to this, I witnessed in the early morning 6:00am, chem trails being laid down by a winged aircraft in the same area before it travelled far enough to lose sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They were moving slowly and there was no sound.  I jumped from my car and took a few pictures on my cell phone and then ran to a neighbors who also saw them.  He thought they must be hot air balloons but I knew they would not be out at this hour plus there was no sound at all.  I then went to my home where my 80 year old mother saw them before they were out of sight.  I have photos but have no idea how to send them.<n>

It would move across the sky while green, pause for seconds, change to white, start moving opposite direction as it started moving again it became red in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for ninety minutes.  Rarely changing height, barely above tree line across lake.  I used three different devices to record its movements and when I tried to look at the videos this morning, nothing was in the sky.  The house lights on overnight showed  on the video, but no lights moving in the sky.  Very puzzling to me.  The devices were working fine.  I heard no noise from the object, it just kept repeating this movement for the whole 90 minutes I was watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

We drove out of the city and off into a farm field where there were no lights around so we could see the stars clearly.  It was difficult at first to actually see the stars because it was a cloudy night and we were only 15 minutes away from the bright lights of the city.  As we searched for Andromeda, we all started commenting on the orange light that hung right above our horizon dew North.  The light appeared to be moving, but after a few minutes we agreed it was still and that it could possibly be a radio tower or fixated light of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to get a closer look with my telescope but all we could make out was a grainy, orange glow. (Definitely in the shape a circle- we were able to see the shape with our telescope set at 25x) I attempted to use my phone to zoom in on the object but it was still blurry so I just gave up.  In our opinion it was not a star because it was so close to our horizon and the brightness of the city wouldn’t have allowed us to see a star that low.  It was lower than any observable star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouds South of us were moving in so quickly that we could literally watch them roll over the horizon covering the stars.  We got distracted by this and turned around for a second, when we turned back around the object was completely gone.  We did see a plane flying through the sky (at about the same altitude) but it was definitely not the same object because it had a red blinking light and it was definitely a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we all realized that the object was gone we got such an eerie sensation that we just had to get out of there.  We decided to drive down the road a little bit to make sure it wasn’t a radio tower with an orange light on it- we drove a mile and realized there was no tower, still feeling afraid we turned around and booked it back to the city.  We want to go back to the farm field at some point this week to make sure there is not a radio tower there. We will keep you updated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately- I did not get the picture that I was ABOUT to take. UGH!<n>

I was in awe at how many stars were visible and how clear the skies seemed. I had been sitting in the car for approximately twenty minutes, enjoying the air and listening to music with my seat reclined while I looked at the sky when I saw a large black triangle glide over my home and car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle was large, black and isosceles triangular in shape. It had three lights; one on each point. The lights were white but not brilliant enough to illuminate the bottom of the triangle for a closer inspection as the triangle itself seemed very black, blacker than the sky. The entire event occurred so quickly and I was so startled that I cannot tell how far away the object seemed; I can only put it in perspective that it seemed much lower than a plane would fly. It was not flying as a plane would, either, since it was moving much slower and differently in the sense that when a plane moves across your field of vision, it does so in a linear fashion across the sky and this object&#39;s flight deviated in such a way that seemed unnatural and in-conducive to flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very startled and, quite frankly, afraid after it left my field of vision and quickly restarted my car and ran inside. I am still afraid and have looked up for twenty minutes how to report a sighting. I&#39;m not sure why I feel so compelled to tell someone about this and I feel quite foolish stating that I think I saw a UFO but I have no idea what I just saw. I am still quite shaken and will likely be up all night researching to see if anyone else has ever seen an odd black triangle in the Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As big as a bus.  It was bright white.  The shape was round in front and round in back.  The front was larger than the back.  I saw it for a second and it was gone.  The height of the object was 1/4 the size of it&#39;s length.  It had no tail.  There was no noise.  It was not burning red.  It was bright solid white.  It was a clear night with stars out.  My first reaction was,  what was that.  Maybe it was comet, or space junk.  But it only appeared as a quick flash.  I called the police department to see if anyone else might have reported it.  Can someone tell me what I saw?<n>

In the distance I saw three craft (unknown shape because of darkness and distance) they looked to me to be in the vicinity of 33 degrees 45&#39; 04.43&amp;quot; N by 117 degrees 19&#39; 40.97&amp;quot; W  Or W/NW of the North Gate of Canyon Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three &amp;quot;craft&amp;quot; had three lights each (varying colors but mainly white and blue)  We see planes all the time near here as we are under the approach pattern for MARB, mainly we see C-17&#39;s, KC-135&#39;s, C-130&#39;s, and the occasional F-16.....these objects I saw were out of that pattern and what I initially was going to dismiss as planes in the distance, started behaving differently than any plane I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects seemed to be &amp;quot;playing with each other&amp;quot; moving in a leap frog type pattern in ways planes cannot.  I also noticed string-like lights descending from the objects to the ground, as if they were dropping them in an organized fashion, every 10 seconds or so.  After 7-8 minutes one of them shot straight-up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  No I do not have video...I didn&#39;t think of it and I am mad at myself for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  I didn&#39;t report it to anyone because to be honest, I was scared by this event, and went and hid in my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. I am only reporting this, because I went to school this morning and my teacher said I should!<n>

It was headed downward toward ground at a 45 degree angle from the sky.It disappeared behind the trees, and I was unable to find it again. This would mean it had to either land or go into a body of water. It appeared controlled, and too slow to be falling or crashing. I was so excited that I called my husband, who was visiting his mother, in Whiting, NJ, about 25 miles west from where I was. Before I could say anything, he exclaimed he thought he just saw a UFO, and described exactly what I saw.He agreed that it was too slow to be a falling star or meteor.  We have a lot of military planes flying over our home because we are near the Lakehurst military base.  This object didn&#39;t resemble any of the planes we are used to seeing. It also was in the northeastern sky from where I was in Toms River, where as Lakehurst would have been west.<n>

Sometimes a white one shows up as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been seeing them every night for the last week but last night and tonight there was movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night about this time, there were four multi-colored lights and one bright solid white light hovering over north-east of Elmore City. (I live out in the boondocks and these lights were quite a ways away so I&#39;m having to use lights on the horizon line to determine where close they were located.)  The multi-colored lights stayed pretty stationary but the white light would slightly sway in position and ascend or descend minutely.  I got freaked out and went inside so I&#39;m not sure what happened later in the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight there is only 2 multi-colored lights and no solid white present. I went outside and sat on the porch to watch them and the multi-colored light more to the east of the other started a north by north-west path until I could no longer see it.  The other multi-colored stayed stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell exactly what shape the multi-colored lights are since they&#39;re at a higher elevation. All I see are lights that do not resemble any pattern of a jet or helicopter that I have seen.  The white one last night however had a triangular/arrow shape to it when it was ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night when I spotted the white object I checked my cellular phone and the service was gone. I usually have 3-4 bars of service in my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said I live out in the boondocks so I don&#39;t have street lights or cars running all over the place. I live on a small farm with animals and they are asleep for the night. There were no noise. We have a lot of cloud cover so there were no stars visible.<n>

As it approached I could make out two large orange lights on each side with a bright red light in the center.  It was moving at an even speed.  The lights were not blinking, and were extremely bright and colorful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I entered the house and got my wife, who witnessed it briefly from this angle as well.  It then went out of our range of vision due to our house.  We went inside and out the back door, bringing our daughter.  It was located again continuing toward the east until it was out of sight.<n>

I went inside and got my binoculars, and viewed the object. It seemed circular and the lights seemed to change color and were around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 20 minutes I went inside to see if anyone else had made a post about it on the internet. I went back outside and continued to watch it when it got very bright and shot sideways and just vanished. Normally we can hear the helicopters this was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very used to seeing night crop dusting planes and helicopters this was neither. It just stayed in one place until it moved and disappeared. It was between El Centro and Ocotillo over the mountain range. I almost thought it was a star for awhile but seemed way too low. Just when I had convinced myself it was a star because it was just hovering in one spot it got bright and sped to the right towards the airport. I would have seen it as if it were coming into the airport it would have gotten closer to me. Instead it just went straight in a line and vanished. I sure would like to know what this was.<n>

It was the brightest object in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspected it might be Venus, but couldn&#39;t explain the &#39;aura&#39;.

At first, I thought it was the lights from the radio antenna that is located on the top of the mountain, but then I saw the actual radio antenna and realized that that was not what I was seeing.  The first light passed over the car in the sky as we drove, moving southeast to northwest. As I said, it was reddish orange in color, and lacked the flickering nature of airplane lights but instead looked almost like a fireball, with a densely colored center and a lighter halo or corona. It would occasionally &#39;pulse&#39;, growing slightly dimmer and then growing brighter again, and eventually we lost sight of it because, while driving, it was unsafe to try and keep it in sight. We were on our way to pick up a pizza at a restaurant a mile or so n! orth of where we first saw the light, and when we pulled into the parking lot, we noticed there were two more lights moving from the southwest to the northeast. Just like the first one we saw, these two lights were orange in color with a weird pulsing effect. There was no noise, no erratic movement, just a leisurely uniform pace. At one point, they moved in almost parallel lines with one another. As those two moved over the horizon, we noticed again, from the same point of origin, another light. It followed the same track as the first two. We drove down to another parking lot to get a better point of view, and witnessed two more objects following the same course: as one would approach the horizon to the southeast, one would appear to the northwest. All of the objects were of the same color and brightness, with the same pulsing effect. Again, for clarity&#39;s sake, there was no flickering or flashing or strobing that is associated with airplane lights, just a slow occasional pu! lse. At one point, an airplane did cross paths with one, and t! he diffe rence between the lights of an airplane and the objects was apparent. To be fair, there is a small local airport nearby, but none of the objects were going anywhere near the airport and they did not resemble the lights of an airplane. I took several short videos with my phone, but unfortunately the quality does little justice to the incident.<n>

At 8:06 PM, while still on that freeway, I noticed three bright lights steady in the sky up ahead of me. I pointed them out to my boyfriend, who suggested that they were planes putting on a show or perhaps may have had something to do with the space shuttle Endeavor finally reaching its destination. As I was beginning to mention that Los Angeles was in the opposite direction, the lights began, in unison, to move in a non aggressive manner and seemed to &amp;quot;softly tumble&amp;quot; lower in the sky. It was then that the three lights stood out as not being three individual objects (which explains my confusion behind the number of air craft I had seen), but that the three lights may actually have been part of a large triangular shaped aircraft, because as it was rolling &amp;quot;out of the sky&amp;quot;, in the same fashion as something would when tumbling or falling into water.  I could almost see the outline of the craft, an accurate way to describe the actual view of it would be as if a triangle made entirely of glass with an LED light on each corner of its shape were dropped into water.  And finally, the person watching this occur is viewing it all from outside of the water, and from a much lower level, with only the lights actually visible in the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then spread out to form a horizontal line and with smooth effort, picked up  speed and glided quickly away as different helicopters and airplanes came nearer to. These lights continued to show up over the next hour or so, and I did not give them much thought until after my boyfriend and I were home and nothing about the incident was mentioned on the news or anywhere online for that matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am filling out this report with the hopes that an explanation exists somewhere that won&#39;t be along the lines of being a natural phenomena. The three lights in formation of a triangle craft was significantly larger than average passenger or commercial airplanes, I realized, after a helicopter passed my window and made its way toward the lights. Although the lights did not &amp;quot;allow&amp;quot; for any thing in the sky to approach it, it was very obvious that if it were one craft, it was similar to comparing the size of a cat to the size of an elephant.<n>

We were both lying face-up and talking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point, we noticed two intense pink-red light moving slowly across the sky towards the direction of Los Angeles (i.e., along the coast).  We thought, at first, that they were military aircraft because they seem to move in formation.  We both thought it was strange because it was a sunny day and all the other airplanes would have appeared white (instead of red).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A number of planes criss-crossed the skies at various altitudes but we could always make out the fact that they were planes because of the shape.  These other things were just...lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after about 5 minutes, these lights disappeared in the distance.  But here&#39;s the strange part - after a couple minutes (maybe 5) two pink-red lights appeared AGAIN!  They appeared in the same position and same &amp;quot;formation&amp;quot; (i.e., one was ahead of the other; the! trailing light to the left of the leading &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;) as before and moved in the same direction as before.  They seem to be very high up in the sky (as before) and left no trails and made no perceptible noise.<n>

My girlfriend says we were travelling East on Millbrook Road towards Millbrook Collection, which is a shopping center, located at the corner of Millbrook Rd./Atlantic Ave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was driving and since I&#39;m still quite new to the area, I was looking around and noticed, what I believed to be chem-trails, which were all intersecting in one spot in the sky, similar to the shape of an asterisk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just west of this formation, in the sky, was an airplane which left an extremely long plume of white vapor. In the same area as this plane, was a solid black object, sort of, cylindrical-shaped, with some kind of blurry feature on it. Both the plane and the black object appeared very high. I&#39;m guessing that that plane was at crusing altitude, so what&#39;s that, 30,000+ feet?  Well, it appeared that the black object was at least that high. At arms length, the object was about the size of a pencil&#39;s eraser. If this object was indeed around the same height as the plane, it must have been 1/4 size in comparison to it. The distance from the object to the plane appeared to be 300-400 yards.  The object made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a bird, but it didn&#39;t move. I observed this for at least a mile, still in the same spot. At some point, the trees got in my view and i was unable to see it. Once past the trees, I looked and the plane was still there but the black object was gone. I didn&#39;t see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve made several reports on this site over the years.  This is the first UFO I&#39;ve seen and reported in the Raleigh, NC area.  The others were all seen by me and other witnesses in and around the Charlotte, NC area.<n>

Weather condition was absolutely clear with blue skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notice the formation when tracking a plane flying roughly NorthWest.  The plane was a few thousand miles high above the San Gabriel Mountains at approximately at a 30-40 degree angle in the sky from my vantage point   At first I thought it was a flock of birds but realized they were further from me than the sighted plane and could not have been birds. My wife who was with me confirmed the sighting. Initially it formed a wavy chain formation and moved in a westerly direction across the sky.  The objects appeared to be reflective and seemed to move relative to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation stopped their movement when they were roughly due north from my line of sight and formed a circular cluster. Some of the objects in the middle of the cluster appeared to rotate and catch the light from the sun. It appears that the objects, because of this behavior, were faceted.  The reflected the light from the sun in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tracked the objects for about 3 mins. and at one point asked two women who were siting next to me to confirm that they could see the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation seemed to appear larger suggesting that they stopped moving in a westerly direction and started moving south.  I turned to the woman to ask her the time and when I turned back to see them, they objects had vanished from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects made no sound and appeared in my estimation to be several thousand feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious if anybody else had this sighting.<n>

I looked out the blinds and couldn&#39;t see where the glow was coming from at first because it was obscured by the house and tree next door. So I stood up on the bed to see if I could see it better out of the top of the blinds and I could then see what looked to me like a fuzzy bright orange ball which I thought at first was just hovering. It was about the size of a dime held at arms length and to my eyes had no defined edge. Just bright, fuzzy and it looked odd, not like a plane&#39;s landing lights, a satellite (too big) or the international space station (again too big).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed it was slowly moving from right to left.. I was trying to figure out what it might be. It moved in a very slow, deliberate and steady way. It was kind of windy out so I do not think it was a chinese lantern because it did not flicker and the light seemed almost directional in nature. like as if it were a bright orange spotlight. I watched it for about 10 minutes before I thought to go get my iPhone to take a picture of it. I held the iphone steady and snapped a photo. When I did it was a little disappointing as it didn&#39;t seem like much of anything  on the iPhone&#39;s screen. It just looked like an orange light in the sky. My iPhone is a 3g so its camera is not sensitive enough to pick up stars or bright planets even.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also as I stated, the object was moving, slowly right to left across my field of view and rose at a very shallow angle of maybe 15 to 20 degrees before it was obscured by the  trees in the yard  and out of my field of view. It was hard to tell at night but it did not seem to be coming towards me or moving away from me but rather kept a steady course about equally distant from me at all points. The light did not flicker, brighten or dim. It was constant. I watched for another 20 minutes to see if it returned or if anything else would appear before going to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My window looks South-East and the light was moving from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning when I looked at the photo on my computer I noticed that the camera captured it as egg shaped, though my eyes could not see a shape (it just looked like a bright fuzzy orange ball to my eyes). Also you can see the edge of the window to the left slightly being lit up by the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a very quiet neighborhood and can hear planes without my window open. I never hear planes at night and I opened the window and couldn&#39;t hear a sound shortly after a took the picture I&#39;ve attached to this report. All I could hear was the wind.<n>

I live next to a golf fairway and was test casting a new pole/rod on the fairway.  I had a totally clear wide open view.  The conditions were 100% clear, no clouds, no wind, all stars visible.  Totally clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two bright, really bright red lights/orbs fly or glide over the tree line and approach my location.  My best guess on altitude would be 500 - 1000 ft.   I had a bright orange streetlight as reference about 100yds from me and these lights were hundreds of times brighter and much more red in color.  The lights were flying South sort of in formation with one orb at the 12 o&#39;clock position and the other to the left at about 7 o&#39;clock position they flew with zero sound, noise and had no tails or trail of any kind.  I could hear and see another over head plane, but these lights flew silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had view of the lights for probably 2 minutes as they flew slowly towards me.  The lights seemed to momentarily stop and then change direction.  The lights started flying west, upward and much faster until they glittered out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was truly surreal.<n>

At first I thought it was a helicopter about 600-800 feet away but very soon realized that it was not making any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and walked a couple of hundred feet to the top of the hill to get a clear and unobstructed view.  It appeared small being approximately 10-20 feet across only based on the spacing of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving erratically both vertically and horizontally in very quick movements traveling generally due south over Hicks Creek at about 20 M.P.H.  Its altitude varied from 100 feet to 300 feet while traveling.  During its flight, it would appear to fly in reverse and then again go forward.  It would do this very quickly without making any kind of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this craft continue flying and changing altitude as it passed over the university campus south of my viewing location and continued in a southerly dir! ection until it was far enough away I could no longer see it which would have been several miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The light was cast between the branches of a Red Pine, and I couldn&#39;t help but to stare at it. The rays coming off the light made it look like a snowflake I first counted 7 rays beaming from it but as I continued to stare I was able to count 12.  I was fascinated alone with its brightness, but then it dissapeared; so I thought. I moved my head and was able to see it again from my new vantage point, and that&#39;s when it hit me... stars don&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I moved to the middle of my yard for a better view through the clear moonless sky, and I noticed there were more lights with the others much more distant.  As I gazed at the lights I could see they were subtly moving side to side, up and down and in small circles.  Usually the movements were slow which caused me to second guess whether or not they were actually moving but then the larger closer light moved erratically to the right and then up, before back down and left to its starting point.  I called my fiance to come outside and she saw it move as well, but wasn&#39;t as convinced as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend up and he couldn&#39;t see it from his place so he drove to my house and we watched it for a good 5-10 minutes before it made a large movement like previously described. He freaked out and drove home, this isn&#39;t anything either of us would have dreamed we would witness.  We were both hesitant to call it what we both thought it was, a ufo, but now I am convinced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also several &amp;quot;shooting stars&amp;quot; near these lights throughout the course of observation. I took video footage, but I don&#39;t know how well it is going to turn out with the simple quality of my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were directly east of my position at 47°54&amp;#8242;8&amp;#8243;N 91°51&amp;#8242;21&amp;#8243;W<n>

The balls appeared, dissapeared, reappeared and so on as the two triagles moved across the sky at a speed of probably 50mph.  Each ball seemed about a hundred yards apart.  Each triangle was several hundred yards high.  The height did not appear to change as the triangles traveled across the sky in a NE direction.  Of note, a college football game (lsu vs south carolina) is going on, 5 miles away, with the stadium lighing the night sky. There is a blimp above the stadium.

They were in somewhat of a group but seemed to be flying independently, not flying in a straight line or parallel, only in the same general direction: southwest to northeast.  We then realized there were more coming as we saw them through the trees. Once I realized how strange this all was, I was screaming to my husband who was coming out of the house to walk the dogs. He looked and was just as freaked out as my friend and me.  He ran to the back door and called to the kids and their friends as I ran to the neighbors&#39; house.  There were approximately 12 of us who witnessed the lights which seemed to be an extremely bright copper or a reddish hue, with an axis coming out of the bottom and top.  They weren&#39;t too slow, but were not going extremely fast and seemed to be perhaps only a few hundred feet up.  It was completely cloudy out so they couldn&#39;t have b! een that high.  They were definitely going  in the same direction as if following each other.  The first few seemed to slow down a bit until the others caught up a bit more.  Cannot find any news about it or anything else.  My husband walked the dogs afterwards and saw two different groups of two people walking.  When he asked them if they saw the lights, they said YES and were really freaked out as well.  The objects did NOT make any sounds.  All I got on my phone camera was a very bright light.<n>

I looked out my window to see what was going on.  About South East from my location coming from Long Island sound over swamp land I saw five orange circle shape lights moving in the same direction in a direct line(top to bottom) moving in a North West trajectory.  The objects were moving very fast.  I ran outside to get a better look, the lights stayed in the same line keeping the same equal distance apart top to bottom however 2 of the lights appeared to slow down and were moving further apart side to side. The 2 lights that were moving further apart side to were lights 2 and 4 counting down.  Then the lights that were further ahead(1,3,&amp;5) stopped in the air and waited lights 2 and 4 to catch up.  Then all the lights changed direction and headed NNE. Then four more orange cirlce lights came out however it was only one at a time following the same path as the previous five.  Once one left my view another came out. It should be noted that after I saw the group of 5 I ran to find video camera which was dead and could not be worked by plugging into a wall outlet.  Only had a charger for battery older camera.  I did video one orange light with my video on my cellphone which is near impossible to tell unless it can be blown up.<n>

When I noticed the sky had a purple blue tint and there was a faint dull silver-green luminous object flying from the lower end of my backyard crossing over the Connecticut River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a helicopter or a stealth jet or a light beacon due to the air base being near by or a looping shooting star or meteor.  But there was no sound emitting ,nor was there a streamed light source connecting to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circling in clockwise rotation it reached a full circle in every 3-4 in a half seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The phenomena lasted for roughly 15-20 mins begining from 8:26pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made roughly 60-70 rotations.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (Please refer to previous sightings from Milford since 06/06/12) Again, from Gulf Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday evening, cold, overcast, and steady wind 10mph+ from SSW, which after sunset shifted to SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maintaining watch over previous NW and N positions for possible reoccurance when, at 8:22 PM, surprised to notice a large cluster of what appeared to be sky lanterns or balloons  slowly rising above the treeline in the NE (15 degrees), at what initially appeared to be 2 + miles distance.  Immediately started video recording with Lumix ZS15 superzoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Original cluster composed of over 20 objects, all slowly drifting upwards, while changing positions and forming an X shaped plume.  These floating objects, for the most part, did not appear to be moving into the NE, as they ought to have been by the steady wind at my back.  There was a continuous release of other lit objects beneath those that had already risen up into the sky, eventually fading from sight.  (The treeline peaks at about 4 degrees, the maximum elevation any of the lit objects attained was about 25 degrees - that appeared to be their ceiling.)  None of these lit objects appeared to be drifting steadily into the NE, though that could simply have been the result of their angle of movement to my angle of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these lights continued to emerge above the treeline, the newest/lowest ones were brighter, more prominent, and definitely appeared to be moving against the wind&#39;s direction, sometimes in pairs. Some of the final objects looked very much as if they were moving towards the Gulf.  Likewise, there seemed to be a grouping of some of these objects as they ascended, as if they were maintaining a set space between each other.  Possibly distance illusions?  Close scrutiny of the 3 minute HD video might clarify this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incrementing cluster of lit objects gradually diminished after 15 minutes, the final object fading away by 8:37 PM.  Total estimate = 40 - 55 sky lanterns/balloons/kites, what-have-you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very brief follow up:  At 9:15 PM, after waiting for any reoccurance, I drove to  Milford&#39;s Westfield Shopping Center, which is near the line of sight these objects had appeared in, in order to find out if there had been some local event that would explain such a release.  None known of.  No one else had seen anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that evening, and over most of the next week, after dozens of inquiries throughout the area, including checking every regional and local  newspaper&#39;s recent and current issue, as well as talking with police and fire officials, I have finally been able to triangulate the area these lit objects emerged from:  The western portion of Stubby Plain in Milford.  Google maps reveals this particular area to be marshland immediately surrounded by forest.  It is about 6,000 feet to the NE of the Gulf Beach bridge, where I was recording from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visiting this area confirms that it is almost impossible to enter into the plain itself through the swampy woods that surround it.  There is one large fenced off parking area adjacent.  I should add that not a single remnant of any kite or balloon or lantern has been found, even though their supposed plume of movement was mostly over a heavily populated area.<n>

The craft was silent and moved at a constant pace at low altitude, i know this because it flew below the cloud cover. we were stunned for a moment absorbing this event and my friend pulled out his phone to catch the event on video. as he raised the camera and it was like who ever was piloting this craft was watching us because it dimmed to nothing and vanished before we could catch it on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was able to get off the road at 52nd and get out of my car and just watch it.  I saw what looked like a big black wall....flying.  When reality hit me and I remembered there&#39;s nothing aerodynamic about a wall I just stared at the thing all the time looking for a witness, but there was no traffic on an ordinarily busy street.  Finally a young Hispanic girl with braces came along but was late to work and I couldn&#39;t even get her to look at the object.  It continued flying in a southeasterly direction and about 15 minutes later out of sight.  Important to note that it flew across Interstate 70 approaching Interstate 270 at right around 2:40PM and anybody looking up should have seen it.  The most disturbing thing is I had a good cellphone with a decent camera but I didn&#39;t even think about it and i! t remained in it&#39;s holster.  As I was watching it from behind there was at least one column like looking thing attached to the rear so ultimately I would say it was like a flying box with a propulsion mechanism attached.  It also appeared to fly over Interstate 225 a few minutes later and not far from Buckley AFB.  No noise heard during the entire encounter and as close as it was, there should have been something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we turned the corner it seems they just disappeared through the trees although that was strange as it is a very clear night outside.  We are near BWI airport but there isn&#39;t any way these were airplanes.  There were planes departing and arriving and these were not airplanes.<n>

I sat down in my tree stand which is roughly 16 feet in the tree.  On my way into the woods I had noticed some eyes and deer.  Once sitting in my stand I started to use my flashlight to see where the deer had went as it was still dark out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At roughly 530am I saw what I thought was a plane or a helicopter go straight up into the sky.  I did not think anything of it however I then watched it come back down to about eye level with the tree line.  Whatever it was it was right through the trees as I could make out pulsating white lights.  All the while the object never made a sound.   As I was watching this happen the lights moved to my left, then to my right.  Once it moved to the right I could clearly see 3 pulsating lights.  Yellow, Red, Yellow.  I was extremely scared at this point as I actually felt as if we were both looking and checking each other out.  It should be noted that I am an avid outdoorsman and leave for my hunting trips when it is dark out.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and I hope I never do so again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lowered my equipment out of my tree stand and left the woods heading back for camp.  I get the sense that my wife doesn’t believe me and my friends think I am crazy!  The whole thing that I cant grasp is the way that it moved, and the lack of any noise.  I hope that there are others out there that have seen something like this!<n>

There are more than one, but they are randomly placed through out the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right now it is a little after 4am est here and it was a few hours ago that they were first seen by three people.  Then later on, another person came home (that would be me) from shopping and was told about it.  I, of course, thought they were losing their minds, but sure enough I have seen it with my own eyes.  One of the witnesses said that the one they were watching earlier seemed to disappear and then when I got home it was back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the constellation Orion, so I went and stared at it and the star that is his left hand didn&#39;t move or spark or anything.... so I used it like a control group so that to me shows that I am not losing my mind too.  It can&#39;t be mass hallucination.....since it occurred at different times.  At first I thought that it was just my eyes playing tricks on me.... but I went out and looked multiple times..... not staring for a long time (which can distort your vision).  I would just look for 30 seconds or so and it would dart to the right....then the left...then it would make like a loop....then these little sparks.... and it happened multiple times....<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continue to watch them as it is now almost 4:30 am est they are still there but changing their main position slightly.  For the most part when they dart to the left or right or up and down and do the loop they always seem to come back to the point where they started.  Out of curiosity we looked around in the sky and have found at least 4 at this point, but it is cold out there and we (or at least I) do not want to keep looking...  We are freaked out enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses are as follows : a 13 year old girl, a 46 year old woman, and two younger women ages 28 year old and a 38 year old.  The 13 year old is still in school, the 46 year old graduated high school, the 28 year old has her GED and the 38 year old went to 1 year of college.  The 46 year old is the mother of the 28 year old and she is currently on DSS. 38 year old is a stay at home mom. and the 28 year old is too.   Well, that is all I can think of..... I do have one last thing to say and that is.... I know I saw what I saw....and It really makes me feel uneasy.  Thank you for your time. (I also called and left a msg on the hotline.)<n>

I recorded this 10 minute video using my Sony Cyber Shot H70 Digital Video Camera using the best possible quality at 720p with Bionz technology and zoomed in as close as possible using 10X optical zoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THIS IS NOT A HOAX, nor is it ANY kind of crappy CGI effects either.  This footage is 100% authentic and i have the original film still on my 4GB TDK SD memory card which is now kept in a safe and secret location.  This is the best sighting and footage captured of a UFO in the year 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What makes this event unique and special is that the space ship craft appears to be morphing, changing size and shape as the lights in the video appear to be all over the place from one to another,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ALSO changing colors from standard white to BLUE and possible other colors too.  The object appeared to be moving at a steady speed before vanishing behin! d a tall apartment tower block next to some mountains...

Intrigued…and the wind was VERY strong due to an &amp;quot;incoming&amp;quot; storm from Ohio…..I began truing to arrange some things on my patio to keep them safe from the wind and there was this HUGE flash of light above me that literally gave me enough light to see what I was doing in almost pitch black…when I looked up, it had fizzled but it was a very true meteorite like tail as in when you see a shower, but this was much more powerful that all the stars I have seen do that. I am sad I did not see the actual beginning of it, and am curious to know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I was looking in the sky a very bright light appeared from the area left of me behind the houses in my development.  The object was an orb or ball shape about 1 or 2 miles away but in my line of sight and flying very low about the same height as a commercial jet would fly when traveling over city/populated region or en route to airport.  The ball moved at a rate that no aircraft would possibly be able to travel, as I watched it for about 5-8 seconds it was extremely bright.  The orb left no trail behind it nor did it disappear back into the atmosphere as a shooting star would.  If I had a clear line of sight on the objects trajectory I would have been able to see its further path as the object vanished over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not jump to conclusions as to report UFO sighting right away, I have researched for the past 2 hours the meteor shower calendar and iridium flares, and I have discovered that the most recent shower was October 7 and 8th, also I considered the possibility of an Iridium flare from a satellite but after looking up the next scheduled flare, the time was yesterday October 12th at 8:30 pm for my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OBJECT DESCRIPTION Shape:   Circle/Orb  Color:  White/Similar to star but slightly whiter  Speed:    Not sure exactly but was much faster than any jet, helicopter, or manmade aircraft.  Speed/Altitude ratio of the object could not be matched by any aircraft built by man in present day; I would know my family has many ex air force  Trajectory:    Somewhat diagonal but straight path, no evidence of slowed speed, constant path  Environment:      Clear sky, quiet no sound around me or from the object itself, I was able to see other stars in the sky as well and the North Star also,<n>

It wasn&#39;t something far away in the distance, but an up close visual display perhaps 100m from the middle of the river, but the lights were about 2 stories high, 10 metres in height, very large &#39;object&#39; something like this [1] it was more rectangular than cubed, so it seemed like a vehicle of sorts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This varanasi picture [2] shows you the spatial dimensions, us up on one of the highest hotels overlooking the river, and the UFO/Object around where the boat is, but about 6 or 7 times as large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a set of about 50 individual points of light all moving and shifting and transforming into different geometric shapes like a hologram as it moved along faster than any man-made object could possibly move. At one stage they expanded out into a kind of circular peacock tail like this [3] and then contracted and transformed into a various geoemetric cubes all attached and moving and forming a larger overall shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour earlier I had seen lights in the sky: It all began as I was set to walk back to my hotel for the 30 minutes trip when the power went out in a 10km radius in the city, the atmosphere became very &#39;wild&#39; as if i had been transported a few hundred years into the medieval past into a lawless vibrantly alive place full of horses, dogs etc,  As I was walking I noticed a golden orb flash in the sky for micro-second, I thought it was odd and kept walking whereupon i came to the main market and saw a UFO hovering around like a conventional UFO sighting, flashing rapidly in various different points in the sky for around 20 seconds in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back to my hotel and on top of the roof and went and stood on the balcony next to a korean man whom i had met a few weeks earlier. We both stood there looking at the river, i told him what i had just seen, and then he went on to tell me he had seen UFO&#39;s in Australia a year or so ago. As we were having this conversation I had turned my head to the side and all of a sudden he shouted &#39;LOOK&#39; and pointed to a shape in the middle of the river and it was incredibly distinct, some kind of ghostship-like shape was materializing for 2 seconds and a few split seconds after we had noticed it become more clear and spread out into lots of individual points of light rapidly changing shapes as it moved along the river until it disappeared on the right side of our field of vision about 5km down the river in 5 or 6 seconds  Lots of Wows! and Whoa&#39;s! were had and then we both went back to our rooms, we had seen something incredible, but so surreal that it didn&#39;t really make much of a dent, i mean, the implications are enormous and yet it doesn&#39;t change every day life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The feeling was very supernatural, like every-day life had been punctured by some unknown force and humanity would reach some kind of singularity experience if this type of thing occurred more often than not, it was around december 10 last year, so the dec 21st 2012 hype was in the air and I didn&#39;t know what to make of it all, only that an alien contact with humanity seemed a possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was extremely happy and life was a mythical type adventure at that current time so I feel that has something to do with the sighting, not the &#34;every day reality&#34; of suburban monotony I&#39;m currently living in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hasn&#39;t really changed me much, what are you meant to do with the experience? All I know was, what we experienced was really fucking bizarre, far more bizarre than a conventional UFO sighting, it was more like a 10 second holographic light display from some kind of &#34;interdimensional&#34; object and has added weight to the idea of a really bizarre quantum universe operating across all levels simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone can recommend a good book regarding more hypothetical theorizing and experience stories of an intense type of contact with possible &#34;inter-dimensional objects&#34; and the primacy of consciousness and awareness, that would be ace.<n>

The light was out so that no one could see through the window and I had a clear view of the dark, night sky. I saw a a bright, blue, blinking light, whose lights were oriented like an airplane&#39;s.  It did not slowly descend from the sky like a landing airplane, but quickly shot down at a sharp angle from the sky and seemed to land, although I did not see it land. But it did not shoot straight across the sky. It wasn&#39;t abnormally fast, but it was FAR faster than an airplane or helicopter. It was like a blue glowing jet fell from the sky into the ground. A real airplane followed the path of the object but did not descend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Two of our friends had arrived earlier in the day to get the woodstoves started to warm up the cabins.  The sun was disappearing fast and the clear skies were already showing the first stars.  After saying our hellos and grabbing a quick bit to eat (approx. 8:45 pm EST), my brother headed out to the car to start unpacking.  I went out about a minute later and he was leaning into the back seat gathering his things.  I can’t remember why but I turned around to head back into the cabin and a large, very bright white light caught my eye.  The light was traveling at a steady clip, totally silent, heading from west to east over the top of the cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled at my brother to look and also ran to the cabin door to call to our friends.  I didn’t know it but one of our friends was up in a tree house talking to his girlfriend.  The other friend came running out of the cabin and he and my brother and I stood looking up in amazement.    As I stated above, the large spherical intense white light floated silently over the cabin.  It traveled about as fast as a Cessna, absolutely silent.  After a minute or so it all of a sudden changed color from intense bright white to an intense bright orange.  It stayed this intense orange for a few seconds and then it seemed to vanish into thin air.  My friend looked over at me and said, “Wow, that’s one for the UFO files!” As we all stood around and recounted what we saw, my bother reported seeing the object “Softly Zig Zag” across the sky.  I personally did not see that phenomenon, but one of my friends later agreed with him.  A few minutes later our other friend came down from the tree house, which was approximately 150 - 200 ft. away from where we were all standing.  The first words out of his mouth were, “Did you guys see the UFO?”  He reported seeing the exact same thing; only he was a little more freaked out because he was out away from the cabin by himself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took some of our things into the cabin, stood inside and talked for a few minutes and then I headed back out to the car to get more stuff.  Once I grabbed my stuff and turned to walk back to the cabin (facing northeast) there above one of the other bunk houses was the intense bright white light again…only this time it was floating from north to south.  I ran to the main cabin door and yelled at everyone to come out and look, but by the time they got outside it was gone.<n>

She came out and looked at it and agreed it was not a plane.It was traveling along side the plane probably 1000 ft or more apart and it disappeared.

Just the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in one of the last houses in the narrows.  My window faces south south east and can see the ridge on other side of the narrows. The opposite ridge line is only about 100 to 200 above the railroad tracks. Very low for something to be floating or flying.  Only birds.  On the moments before I seen the unknown a flash got my attention to the window which offers a wide view to other side of the narrows. My living room lights were off and was watching t v.   As I was staring out to direction of bright flash a large white- bluish light appeared. My first thought was.  That&#39;s not normal.  The bright &amp;quot;0rb&amp;quot; seemed to come to edge of ridge line from my point of view.  It then stayed stationary briefly.  Long enough to throw my senses off.  The light or orb moved slightly to the left.  Stopped.  Then moved to left again.  Stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time it was blocked slightly by trees on the alley I live on.  But was still visible and bright.it had stopped again.  No plane does! this.i served in air force in viet man and have a great understanding of flight characteristics of both military and commercial craft.  This in a matter of mere seconds had me shocked. At the last moment of getting up and straining to look out window the light turned from more of a bright white off blue too a all blue light.  It then vanished.  I was shocked because for a second I thought the light was from landing lights on a approaching aircraft.  And was coming straight toward me.after the event I thought to myself. The light was too bright to have been landing lights!!!!  I also tryed to tell myself it is explainable.  I have no idea as to what it was. And I was thinking. Somebody else had to see this.  I decided not to call police. Now a few days after experience I went on the net to see about weird sights in Maryland sky&#39;s. Was shocked to see that other reports and the same sounding object I had witnessed. That is how I found this web site to report this. Did not know one ! could do that. What are the odds of seeing something like this! outside my window. Scary. This did happen. I hope someone reads this and can interpret what I saw. And why?!!<n>

It was the brightest object in the sky and wondering what it was and if it was moving, we stopped the car and both got out to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not flashing at all; it was just a bright white light.  The object was ascending very slowly and lightly dancing back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes, it instantly dimmed some, but was still clearly visible and continuing to ascend.

On our descent, I saw out of the corner of my eye a bight flash, and I dismissed it as lightning. Ten to 20 seconds later, I looked left, and due West, I saw a fireball in the sky.  Not a small meteor with a smoke trail (I&#39;ve seen those too) -  This was fully on fire, and huge, much like a movie set. Once it hit the clouds, it blinked out.  Three seconds later, two very bright and disticnt orbs started free falling to earth from the spot that the metoer dissapeared, only not straight down.  It took 4 mins for them to reach the surface, after going this way and that, pausing, and circling down to the ground.  It was like the two orbs were dancing with each other on the way down. I&#39;ve seen some pretty weird things in my life, but this was the most life-changing event of them all.<n>

Observed for about 5 minutes, with several witnesses stopping their vehicles and confirming what I was seeing.  Continued driving west to Dover, TN and could still see object clearly from HWY 79 5-6 miles further away, it did not appear to have changed position. Initial assumption was that I had observed a weather balloon, but the size of the object was much too large.

When I woke up, I noticed a third &#34;planet.&#34; I thought it could’ve been Jupiter, but then realized it wasn’t located at that point at that time I rested for a few minutes then checked on the third lighted object again (still in the same place). This was in the eastern sky. I got out the binoculars and looked at the third &#34;planet,&#34; which turned out to be an aircraft. Just in the sky, motionless. Then it flew south maybe around 4:18-4:20am. There were two-three circular lights on the bottom of the aircraft (white lights) and a sky-blue blinking light toward the back of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to, now, observe the sky with the binoculars and noticed multiple flying objects (which appeared very small) with red and white blinking lights). They might have been commercial flights but seemed to be moving slowly and not so steadily like a commercial flight would. They seemed to also slow down and &#34;sit&#34; behind some of the cloud coverage on an otherwise clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, there were probably about 10-12 flying objects (but 5 or so could’ve been commercial/international flights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out at the lake now, and in Chicago there are water sanitization stations in the middle of the lake. I noticed two-three objects around one of the stations (through binoculars). The lights did not look like boats (they were not red/green) they were white flashing lights and one had three lights that would light up and down (not as a boat would), and were small. They were out there “surrounding” the water filtration station for 2 hours (until 6am). After that, I don’t know, because I went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, the large brightly lit object (that I had first thought to be a planet) came back, this time from the north. It stayed in the sky and hovered for a couple minutes, then came over my head (I was located in a tall building). It was brightly lit, lights were under the object – so hard to make out the shape (it seemed to have maybe 5-6 circular white lights on the bottom and a sky-blue flashing light too). However, there was no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background includes growing up in Chicago, where I attended good schools. I work about every day, so my sleep schedule is sometimes off. I’ve always loved looking at planets through binoculars and have a natural curiosity toward the solar system (even though that is not my career focus).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was about as bright as say, maybe 1/5th of a full Moon-or brighter than any star in the Big or Little Dipper, say. It made a semicircle almost overhead, then went SE towards the City of Tempe, then vanished in the clouds. It would make 3 graduatingly brighter flashes, then dim-down again, while in flight.  I did attempt to photograph it, but my celphone couldn&#39;t catch it due to the general lighting of the area.  I am a trained observer.  I&#39;ve been a security officer, at least P/T for almost 34 years.  I also have a Bachelor&#39;s in Geoscience from UNLV, as well.<n>

I got out of my car and just stared at it, it was moving just very slowly. It was very bright at some points you could see a halo form around it.  So I just watched it for 10 minutes straight it would move a little bit then suddenly dip down quickly, move a little bit then dip.  Maybe 4 times. I followed it across the sky trying to figure out what it was, there wasn&#39;t any noise. I heard a low flying airliner coming in from the distance it was probably landing at our international airport 20 miles away, it flew over the light I was following.

When I returned to my room, I looked out the window as I have always been interested  in astronomy.   I saw what looked like a planet, because it looked closer and more orange.  It start kind of bobbling up and down and I didn’t think  much of it, probably just optical illusion that happens with these things.  The next thing I know made yell at the top of my lungs waking my parents at 2:45 in the morning.  The object was  clearly moving in circles.  Then would stop and make extremely fast movements to the right or left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object continued to move in many directions and always came back the original area.  I then noticed, through a sparsely leaved  tree in our yard, another object colored green with rays emerging from all sides, kind of like the sun, but less blurred and more singular defined green rays. And this object was green as green gets.  This one did not move as much but did come closer and further. Probably bet! ween a mile away and  a mile and half away as a rough approximation.  I thought I might have seen a form of a craft but I can’t be sure.  I also thought i saw a light emerge from the green one, but again,not sure.  But I am absolutely certain what I saw was not a plane, a star or planet, not a light show,a prob, nothing I can think of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I call it the most bizzare thing my life.  I sat on my knees watching out the window for the entire 1 hour 20 mins. Please let me know of any questions. I showed my mom for about a minute and agreed that she had no explanations for it.<n>

Huge square engines on back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pulled in my driveway and seen faint light coming toward out house.  I also what looked like a small faint red light looked like it was below the white light and thought it was a helicopter with cable down a few hundred feet.  The red light was at an angle and that is when I noticed it was not helicopter but a huge cigar shaped craft flying about 800 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so blown away by the size that I ran into house and grabbed binoculars to see up close and fell on the way out the back down because I was so anxious of what I had just seen.  I got out side just a s it crossed my house and it was huge maybe 800-1000 feet in length and 100 feet across. It was shiny metallic with what looked like faint row of windows at top running front to back. The most amazing thing was the rear end that had a square like structure that had the red lights reflecting through some sort of engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The square engine was huge as tall a my house which is 2 story and double the width. I ! looked a engine with binoculars and I was amazed again as this square structure appeared to be a structure that had a grilled surface or you could see through this open vertical lines going up and down as this was a vented power source.  The red light I had seen was lots of red protruding through these open grills.  The reason I had thought it was something hanging down earlier is because this light was reflecting out and I was seeing object from a horizontal view coming toward me and it was turning toward me. I am still blown away by what I saw . I researched online but did not seen any other reports except Nashville a couple days earlier. Maybe local newspapers Morristown or Granger county had something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I forgot that I heard a low humming sound as maybe a powerful electrical power source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, after this passed through the area about 12 planes came from 3 different directions as if they were following it.<n>

Then they all turned north, and started moving towards Seattle.  One by one, the blinked out.  After all the red lights blinked out, there was a craft with two amber lights and a flashing red light in the middle moving in the same direction as the red fleet was headed.  I started filming, and the batteries went dead.  When I replaced the batteries, I captured a portion of the event, and a few pictures.

No such lights have ever been present in this neighborhood as I work in a business only six blocks from where I saw these lights.  The lights from a distant seemed stranded together but upon arriving for a view under each light each object was separate from the others. Each shape (kind of oval) was uniformed throughout.  Each had a different altitude(some higher some lower)from one another. And each craft had two oscilating, dull lights on the their underside.  To be honest, they looked like candles flickering and masked inside a pumpkin except that there were no openings but rather light that was diffused as being filtered/masked as if inside a lamp shade or parachute material.  Never have seen such a spectacle in the sky like this.  Thought I heard a jet engine but the traffic was heavy and! I couldn&#39;t be certain given the roar of the street traffic. Were residents spoofed for a Halloween trick here in Phoenix?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t found any information on this loose formation of lights that flew through Phoenix tonight.  The event was just bizzar.<n>

My friend and her 3 1/2 year old daughter walked me to her front door when she noticed all of these strange lights in the sky and remarked on it.  She at first thought they weren&#39;t moving, but I was trying to determine whether they were moving or not.  In about a minute I figured out that they were moving, but very slowly, almost like they were floating.  We kept staring at them trying to figure out what they were.  She also eventually realized for herself that they were actually moving a little.  We kept staring at this strange phenomenon, but I was feeling cold on the front porch and wanted to get going.  I had the strange feeling that they would go away when I started to leave and that is exactly what they did.  It appeared as if the lights were going out a few at a time.  I realize that the timing was probably coincidental, but it was funny how I felt so strongly that was what was going to happen at least a mi! nute before I actually left.  I had been hoping to be able to keep watching them, while driving home, but when I began to walk off the porch the lights began to disappear at a faster rate.  They had begun to disappear a little before that, very slowly, I think when I began making a move to go prior to actually leaving the porch.  I remember seeing strange lights in the sky once before, maybe around 15 years ago, give or take a few years, but they were more off in the distance and they continued for quite some time.  I don&#39;t remember much about them, except that I was having a hard time determining if the lights were weather-related or some kind of flying crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a single light on each point and it stayed slowly hovering in place over the corner of the small town.  I was driving in my car when I saw this and I wasn’t sure what it could be so I turned towards it.   After slowing down to a stop directly underneath it I was able to see the solid black body. This was 150 m off of Mount Albert road and highway 48.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the phone with my dad at the time and was shocked in what I saw.  I immediately let him go but was unable to get a picture with my phone.  The triangle began to move away slowly, I had my window down and it made no noise and no sound at all.  I began to follow it but it increased in speed and then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for roughly about 30 seconds one thing I know for sure is that it was NOT an airplane and it was NOT a helicopter.<n>

It seemed to be North of my buiding about 300&#39; up. we saw two lights on the bottom rotating concentrically.  The inner light was faster than the outer; in would lap the outer one (catch up to it).  Each light orbited at its own steady rate of speed.

Michigan<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a security guard and while driving South on Schoenherr towards 14 mile rd. in Stering Hts. Michigan on Wed. 10/10/12 at 7:09pm I saw a craft in the sky that I couldn&#39;t identify.  The shape of the craft was hard to identify because it had 2 bright white lights on the front of it.  The best description I can give is a black oval or rectangular shaped craft (20&#39;x10&#39;) with 2 bright white lights on the front of it like headlights on a car.  The craft was moving to slow to be a plane almost like it was hovering, but it was too high to be a helicopter.  I pulled over into the center turn lane just South of Moravian and took a picture of the craft.  After I took a picture of the craft using my cell phone (HTC EVO), I switched my phone over to video mode then began to record it as it moved through the sky now with no lights on/visible.  After recording it for approx. 16 seconds I switched my phone back to picture mode and when I went to take another picture the ! craft was gone.  Even though I was still in the turn lane, I got out of my truck and looked everywhere for the craft but it was gone.  I got back into my truck and called the UFO Hotline to report the sighting as I drove to the place where I was headed to before the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/10/12 18:56|San Diego|CA|Sphere|4 minutes|Single white light or craft passed over and very close to a commercial jet.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the ISS?

I was viewing this sighting from about one mile north of the San Diego International airport. There were some clouds, but I still could see about 70 percent of the sky.  This single white or slightly blue-white light was traveling slowly SW to NE; slower than the commercial jet.  I first saw this single light south of me and it flew almost directly overhead, but slightly east of me and then continued in a straight line NE till I could not see it any longer. It was traveling just above the lowest fluffy clouds.  After it passed me, while heading NE, it went just above a small cloud at the same time that a commercial jet which was traveling through the same cloud. The jet was flying west to east preparing to turn around east of the San Diego Airport and then land. They were not very far apart; but I don&#39;t know how far! apart.  They basically were in the same cloud. I could easily see the front white light of the commercial jet as well as the wing lights and collision lights before it went into the cloud.  The single light had no collision lights.  At this time of night, the sky was not black, but a blue black. Not only could I see the lights on the commercial jet, but I could still see the outline of the wings, the body of the jet and the tail section.  The single light did not have any wings or anything visible other than the light itself. I am sure I would have been able to see wings if this single light or craft had wings.  The single light was less than a quarter the size as the outline of the jet.  Again, the single light or craft passed just above the cloud and the commercial jet went through the cloud.  They crossed paths at that time. I did see both crafts continue on their paths after they crossed.  The single light or craft made no noise. I could hear the jet.  The single light was clos! er to me than the jet.<n>

One appeared to be chasing the other for about a hour.  I didn&#39;t hear any aircraft sound and they were rapidly changing direction, so that was kind of unusual in itself.  I decided to stay outside and watch them when I noticed traveling from the south a triangle shaped aircraft without position lights or anti-collision lights, but what appeared to be landing lights in all 3 corners.  I couldn&#39;t see the body of this aircraft as it was dark outside.  the lights turned and headed east and faded into the darkness.  I&#39;m not saying that it is of alien origin, but that it is an unexplained unidentified flying object.  I would like to know if some special aircraft was being tested in this area.

It appeared to be a celestial object until we brought out the binoculars for better viewing.   We were able to observe the craft for over an hour. It appeared to maintain its height and distance during the entire viewing.  Through the binoculars it appeared to be the shape of a clear plastic weather balloon with two bright lights inside.  The lights allowed us to watch it until late sun down when they dimmed to a soft red and eventually faded from view.  Due to distance and the power of our binoculars we could not confirm exactly what it was.  We never did see it descend or gain altitude.<n>

I was viewing this sighting from about one mile north of the San Diego International airport. There were considerable clouds at that time; so I could only see about 30 percent of the sky.  The clouds were broken and irregularly spaced. The first sighting was at 7:35pm and it was of a single light.  The second sighting was only 12 minutes later at 7:47pm and it contained 2 lights or crafts.  The second, or later sighting, was much closer and was at the same level as the low clouds.  These 2 lights or crafts had just passed over my house, or I assume they had passed over my house; but anyway, they were already a little north and a little east of my house, almost overhead and traveling NNE.  These 2 crafts were close to each other. If I stuck my hand out in front of me, 3 fingers would represent the distance between the crafts! .  One craft or light was ahead of the other one and it was brighter.  They were traveling faster than the jets do in this area. I saw them for 10 seconds before they went into the clouds.  They were traveling NNE, which would make them cross the normal jet traffic which goes west to east before turning around to come back to the San Diego Airport to land. I did not see any commercial aircraft in the area during this second sighting. The first sighting was a single light almost overhead, but a little east. This light or craft was very high. It could have been mistaken for a satellite, but it was not a satellite. It was traveling too fast to be a satellite. I saw this sighting for about 10 seconds also before it was hidden by cloud cover. I did not hear any noise from any of the crafts. I should have heard noise from the second sighting since they was so close; almost directly overhead when I first saw them.<n>

We laid down in bed but he wouldn’t be comforted so I sat up with him facing the window. It was dark outside and there I saw a craft flying slowly, what seemed like just beyond and above the treetops.  The trees are about 20-25 meters high and the craft was at about 30 degree angle off the ground.  I would estimate it to have been at an altitude of about 50-250 meters depending on the distance which was about 200-500 meters away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to see but I think the physical craft was triangular in shape, solid body, having a single steady white light on each point in the triangle.  One flashing light was in the middle, don’t remember the color, and yet another flashing light. The craft flew eastward and I viewed it south of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s hard to estimate the size of the craft as I’m not sure exactly how far away it was, if it indeed was 200 meters away then I would say about 5-10 meters on each triangle side. If it was 500 meters away then it would be much bigger of course. The sighting duration was about 3-5 seconds after which it was behind trees and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 yo was still crying so it was hard to hear if there was any sound, I couldn’t hear any, even as the boy took new breaths during which he wasn’t crying.<n>

The light blinked on and off at eight to nine second intervals.  After approximately 10 -12 flashes, the light started moving slightly.  When the light would blink on, still at the same intervals, it was in a slightly different location, in the same area of the sky.  The light was bright and appeared to be very far away.  After about five minutes, the light turned off and never appeared again to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was standing in our driveway stargazing as I often do. The sky was mostly clear. We&#39;re 4 miles south of Long Beach Airport, and the sky was busy as usual with air traffic. One plane caught my attention as it flew south toward the general area of downtown Long Beach about 3 or 4 miles to my west. The only light I could make out was a bright white headlight that flashed every second-and-a-half to 2 seconds. When it reached my latitude, it banked east toward me. Now I could make out 2 white headlights which continued flashing in unison at the same interval. No green lights. No red lights. No other lights. Just 2 flashing white headlights.  It was much higher than the altitude police helicopters fly. The 2 lights were about a pinky width at arm&#39;s length apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was figuring that it was a plane, and that there was a logical explanation for the missing identification lights. So I took a look at it through my binoculars, and I could make out 2 lights, but before I could bring it in focus it vanished. So then I looked without my binoculars, and after about 4 seconds it flashed once or twice more and then it vanished altogether.  The sky was clear. I watched for about 10 seconds.  By this time there was a tree blocking my view of where it would be if the plane reappeared, but I was satisfied at that point that it was gone, and that it was a plane with malfunctioning lights or maybe something else.  As for its sound, there were several planes in the area at the time and to tell you the truth I wasn’t even focusing on its sound, but I don’t remember any sound coming from it. So I’m not 100% sure. If it made a sound, it didn’t stand out.  So I spent the next 15 seconds watching planes, just kind of looking around, and then ! I surveyed the area right above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay, now here’s where it gets weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane reappears flying the opposite direction. At least I assume it was the same plane. Same size, same 2 flashing white headlights.  I had never seen a plane with that light configuration (I’m 56), so logic told me it was the same aircraft. Then about 2 flash sequences later, when it was directly overhead, poof! Gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all my years of stargazing, I’ve never seen a plane make a 180 degree turn in 15 seconds and then disappear.  So I thought that was a little strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the next hour, I saw 2 unusual aircraft, or maybe it was the same aircraft, in the north sky from around Cassiopeia westward.  The first of these 2 sightings began as a flash of white light, like a star, in the constellation Cassiopeia. I could make out a dark object either losing altitude or flying NE which flashed again about 3 seconds after the first flash. Then about 3 seconds later it flashed again, and then I lost it behind trees.  It travelled about a width of my fist at arm length between flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 15 minutes later, an aircraft with the same description appeared in the NW flying south about 2 miles to my west.  It flashed twice, about a 3 second interval, and sometime before the third flash it turned east and flashed about 2 or 3 more times at 3 second intervals and then it vanished. As for sounds, again there were planes in the area but I can’t remember any sound coming from them. So if they made a noise, it didn’t stand out.  When it was flying east to west, it looked to be about a mile to my north.  Neither of the aircraft appeared to be much more than a thousand feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sightings happened 5 nights ago. I’ve been watching the skies almost every night since and I haven’t seen anything out of the ordinary, just the usual planes and helicopters.  And I had never seen anything like that in my life prior to that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aircraft with white flashing headlights, no other lights, no discernible sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a correction to the report I submitted Sunday, October 14, 2012 at 00:51:43  Near the end of my report, it should read:  When it was flying west to east, it looked to be about a mile to my north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

Another object moved acroos the sky as well that appeared to have no connection to the display of the northern lights.  It was a large orb, light yellow in colour, that moved across the sky from northeast to southwest.  The object was moving at a steady pace but appeared to stand still from time to to time.  It was also sighted in several towns in other parts of northern Ontario such as Kirkland Lake, Chapleau and Sudbury.<n>

I was observing the Plaiedes to the East  when I noticed a bright white star-like object just to the left of them.  When looking at the star-like object through my binoculars, I could see it blinked rapidly with red and green lights.  It stayed stationary in the sky and did not appear to be coming towards me, as an aircraft would.    I moved my location to the front yard and observed it from a slightly different angle.  It was the same.  The object was spherical, however it seemed to have a faint tail-like point at the bottom.  The object was still blinking red and green, very rapidly.  I called my son out into the front yard to observe it through the binoculars  and asked him to describe to me what he was seeing.  He described it exactly as I did - a spherical object with red and green blinking lights.  I asked him if, in his opinion the object was moving and he said no, it was not.<n>

I got to afraid to move to far from the  house to see over my roof. at this time I yelled for my other neighbor across the street. but he didnt hear me. an by the time i got to his house it was over. but my neighbor next door which was a woman asked me what was that. and i told her I wasnt sure&amp;quot;  but they were big orbs!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the size of the orbs where as big as a commercial plane emitting red/orange in color. from where i was looking they were bigger then the 3 star in the sky at that time of 8:15 pm in the North west direction.  they emitted no sound an traveled quickly.  I would say the big orb was about maybe 3 miles or so a way in the North area the big one was about the size of our water tower in size of looking at the water tower close.<n>

Killeen, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Large, flat, bright, auras that moved about slowly. Directly over Fort Hood, Texas.  There were several very long jet vapor trails in the sky which provided great differentiation.  These trails seemed to be all around the craft and moved up and down with it.  The trails were bright and distinct. One went up slightly then light and trail just vanished.  The other 7 disappeared behind trees.  A jet flew around our location about a mile from us just over the trees and the jet made no sound at all.<n>

The color being a orange aura with a yellow center that made us think it was the sun reflecting off of clouds in the distance even though there were no others at the time.  The objects seemed to be moving in a horizontal fashion very slowly.  This went on for about two to three minutes until 3 of the objects faded to nothing while the other two faded to what appeared to be flat almost cylindrical black shapes with no aura.  These seemed to stay right in place until they started to move back towards the horizon and out of sight.<n>

It started with seeing what I thought were stars start appearing that weren&#39;t normally there and they&#39;d slowly move away but I never really thought much of it.  It wasn&#39;t till early October that I saw them getting waaaay closer (orange fireball-esk balls flying around, flickering on and off, etc.) to the point where they appear at tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have yet to see the crafts themselves but these lights are typically orange but change to a deep red and also light up to a blinding white. Another thing I&#39;ve noticed is that you&#39;ll see 1 of the lights sitting there and then another one will appear out of nowhere, fly towards the other light and combine with it.  Also, I&#39;ve seen every once in a while you&#39;ll see one of the main lights(I say main light because it&#39;s lit up from sunset till when I wake up in the morning) move a little bit and all of these different lights will suddenly light up around the main light and be several different colors(red, white, and orange, all shimmering) and in the blink of an eye will just disappear.  I have no idea what&#39;s going on but it&#39;s very interesting to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: Tonight(11/20/12) I saw several of the crafts were changing to there deep red hue(possibly signalling to each other?) and then two more crafts appeared, one being a bright light and the other being 3 white lights in a row, both of which slowly descending.  They moved over toward where most of the other light/crafts/whatever are at and disappeared.  I should add that all of this is occuring in a several different locations in rural parts of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This is not the first time that I have witnessed this phenomena.  However, I had never noticed this sort of thing until I moved to this part of California about 20 years ago.  On prior occasions, I have witnessed multiple examples of this phenomena within time frames of several minutes,or so.  Also, approximately three months ago; at approx. 8:00AM one morning,I observed what appeared to be a shiny, silver ball which appeared to be the approximate size of a small civilian aircraft; which was completely stationary in the sky in a south-easterly direction of Susanville,Ca, in the vicinty of a mountain named Thompson Peak, at an estimated altitude of approx. 10,000ft.  I, unfortunately; was only able to observe it for about five minutes, and then was forced to leave my location.  What really w! as fascinating to me about this event,is that I subsequently found out the next day,from a news report; that there had been an meteor, or comet which had entered the atmosphere in this vicinity of the state, and that many people had reported what they thought to be an earthquake or loud explosion, at virtually the exact time that I had observed this silvery object.  However, I didn&#39;t hear or feel anything unusal, myself.<n>

10/7/12 21:05|Columbus|OH|Formation|2 minutes|Four orange/red lights in changing formation viewed from the Short North|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93405.html|527|ndxe201210| Four orange/red lights in changing formation viewed from the Short North<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening I witnessed something out of the ordinary:  I came out of my back door and saw four bright orange-red objects in the sky, moving from the west to the east.  One was clearly in the lead, the other three lights moved behind at some distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be moving directly over the flight path for the Columbus (CMH) airport&#39;s approach, however, they stayed at the same height.  As the moved across the sky, the three that trailed the leader moved in different formations.  At first they had no distinct pattern.  Then they drifted to align in a straght line eventually forming a near perfect triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Winds were from the west at 5 miles per hour, these were traversing the sky at a much faster rate - totally silent, not quite the speed of the many jets I see and hear taking off and landing each day. The lights did not flash or flicker, akin to the &amp;quot;chinese lantern&amp;quot; effect I&#39;ve seen described in other reports.  Quite bright, as if drifting across the sky (except for the various formations of the trailing three) until they faded into a hazy cloud layer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the police, the dispatcher had no other reports of the sighting roughly ten minutes later.  The lights left no trail but were very unique. I&#39;m a fairly sane individual who enjoys watching the skies for meteors and space station sightings and can name several of the galaxies formations and objects upon sight.  This was unlike any of those.  They did not reflect, but produced their own light in a shade similar to sodium street lights with a bit more red, somewhat pinkish tint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes, I could hear a jet approaching the airport. It was a quiet evening for this part of town.<n>

We decided to take a stroll on the beach before going up to the room for the night.  We were standing out by the pool of our hotel watching the ocean.  There was a mild breeze and we had just looked at the phone clock it was 9:02 pm.  I pointed to my husband at a strange orange light ball in the sky. It was moving south to north in a slow straight pattern.  It looked like a fireball and lit the sky up.  It made no sound.We watched it move horizontally for 30 seconds and then it just disappear.<n>

Night sky Illuminated by city lights.  I saw what looked similar to a airplane gliding from north to south.  It was very hard to make out as it seemed translucent and made no sound as it faded into the night sky.  I thought maybe 3 large birds flying in formation as there was some lighter coloring at the center and on the outer tips.  But looked more like a triangle glider with no lights and cloaking ability.  To be honest it left me with an uneasy feeling.  I scanned the city lit sky for the object but it never came into view again. Also note that there was a high presence of military air traffic.<n>

10/7/12 12:15|Glendale|AZ|Sphere|20 minutes|This object was awesome yet very creepy and spooky. It shined like the shiniest chrome ever. It was completely quiet.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94680.html|535|ndxe201210| On October 7th 2012, 12:15 in the afternoon. I was on the tennis court, practicing my serve.  When I tossed the ball in the air I saw a flash almost directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a plane but quickly realized that it wasn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared as a long rectangle, like a steel beam used to build sky scrapers. It’s hard to know the exact length but I would guess 25 to 35 feet.  It was shiny silver in color. When I first noticed the object it was around 1000 feet and by the time the object had descended to 200/300 feet it had moved much closer in my direction.  Then the object stopped moving and just hung there.  I began back stepping and briefly looked to the ground and by the time I looked up again to the object it had changed form to a machine looking object made of silver balls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drew a diagram of the flight pattern from when I spotted the object and I drew two different angles of the object.  The drawings are drawn from the best of my memory and resemble the object very well.....but not exactly. I had binoculars in my car and was able to see the object up close. I did take 3 pictures with my close to useless camera on my cell phone.  The pictures don’t show the object very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awe struck viewing through the binoculars and by the time I had thought of taking pictures the object had traveled a good distance from me.  There are other reasons why I couldn’t take pictures earlier but it doesn’t matter. It is what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You have to zoom in on the photos and the object will come into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was awesome yet very creepy and spooky. It shined like the shiniest chrome ever. It was completely quiet. There was a black mist or haze surrounding the object that was not highly visible. I’m guessing that the haze served as camouflage, blocking some of the shine from the object. Traveling speed was 10 to 15 mph. The object would move a few hundred feet to the north and stop for a few minutes. Then move west a few hundred feet then stop. Then north, then south and so on. Until it disappeared in the western sky. Total viewing time of sighting was 15 to 20 minutes.<n>

Once it got to about tree line it simply disappeared.  Afterwards I saw something big and kind of oval shape with lots of white and red lights.  I was so amazed that I rushed home to wake up my husband and daughter to have one of them drive back to the area with me to see if anything else strange was going on. Drove back to area but did see anything else but did notice 1 strange thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live very close to an airport that always as a lot of activity.

When I was almost at my doorway, I was distracted by a light in the sky.  It was a circular hazy yellow light.  It was cloudy and at first looked like it could be light emitted by a plane above the clouds, but it was too large.  I then noticed that the light moved in a circular pattern and quickly.  It was almost like a hawk circling above.  I stood and watched this occur for about 5-10 minutes.  Usually, there are people in and out of my apartment complex and I so badly wanted someone else out there to see the sight but no one came.  I then decided it wasn’t the safest thing for me to be standing outside at midnight by myself in the city with my attention solely on the sky, so I went inside.  I have no idea how long it was occurring prior to me noticing the light or how long it lasted after I went inside.  About 5-10 minutes after I went inside I realized I should have been able ! to see the exact same spot in the sky from my one window, but saw nothing when I looked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

(Sounds like from the movie &amp;quot;The Fourth Kind&amp;quot;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then tried making a 3 way call to my husband, hoping he would hear it(Thank goodness he did!).  As the noise continued, both ends of the phone lines weren&#39;t able to hang up.  Both heard the noises that were on the phone. When it all stopped, the heat in the vehicle turned cold. Kept driving. Pulled into the driveway, rolled down the window to let my husband know that there was only cold air coming out of the vents. (controls were turn! ed on all the way to heat setting). I then turned off the vehicle, took the keys out, stepped out, only to hear the motor still running, sounds of fluid pouring out.  Opened the hood to find out everything was OK. No spills on ground or inside the hood.  Motor stopped.<n>

Sometimes I saw 1 or  2 lights flying away into the east sky. The lights seemed chevron-shaped, and moved very quickly.  They described smooth circles/paths, and did not change direction quickly or dart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very cloudy.  There was no beam(s) of light coming from the ground and shining ONTO the clouds, so I don&#39;t think they were advertising spotlights.  These lights were shining THROUGH the clouds.<n>

We pulled over &amp; got out to see.  They appeared to be flying at about 1,000 feet, in single file about 100 yards apart, moving over the water from Pigeon Cove towards Bearskin Neck.  There was NO noise &amp; No wind. Planes on approach to Logan airport were visible at a much higher altitude in the distance with flashing lights.  There were other people out walking their dogs that stopped too.  No clue what they were, but not helicopters and not airplanes.<n>

They had no line or order like some constellation and were stationery and appeared to be abot 15-20k ft up.  Then when I came to a point with full view I saw another 7 lights in a line, not moving very much. They were lined up traveling south in a traffic path used for jets going to O&#39;hare that rhe jets usually vere east over St. Charles Il.   The planes in line were closer the commercial jets would ever be and even though they looked to be in the O&#39;hare flight path they looked higher then inbound jets would be.  Bright red lights, no blue or green.  Almost through they were helicopters, but there were no flashing lights.  All I could think is that they were military aircraft gaurding Obama while he is campaigning.  Really strong show of force whatever it was.<n>

It was approximately 9:40 p.m.  I noticed a large, still, white spotlight about 20 feet over a farmhouse which has a barn with cattle beside it.  It was about the same size as a large water search spotlight.  I watched it for about 5 seconds as I drove down the road towards it.  There is an outside streetlamp on this property attached to a hydro pole; the light above the house was a much, much brighter light.  I glanced down at the road and then back up to see something directly on the other side.  (The spotlight was not over the house anymore.)  Just above the tree line almost directly on the other side of the road was a triangular shape hovering at the top of the tree line.  I had four lights only on the left side.  The first light was green.  The next three were white.  They were in a straight line.  The light’s colours looked man made, and not otherworldly.! I watched the triangular, soundless, shape lower down into the tree line for about 5 seconds.  Not wanting to know what exactly it was, I sped up and high-tailed it around the corner to my home.  The last thing I was about to do was stop and take a picture, so sorry about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Orangey-red dots in the sky almost motionless but moving none the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However this time they were travelling from a different direction from what we saw on 30/09/2012 and not the 29/09/2012 as it was after midnight as I stated my apologies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway last time they were coming from a northeast direction travelling eastward this time however they were travelling from a southwest travelling northeast wards.  It was estimated that there were about 20 visible dots at different times.  Some  of the dots ascending for about 2-3 seconds before disappearing completely.  The others intermittently disappeared and then re-appeared before disappearing altogether after observing them for about 2-4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amazing thing is we searched just like we did last week to see if anyone else had reported seeing any sightings.  And just like we found the images of the sightings posted from Holland and Britain last week which was almost identical to what we saw.  The photos we have of the sightings on Saturday 06/10/2012 are once again almost identical to the image of the photo taken in Holland and Britain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Going to upload our pictures so you can make of them what you want.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were 2 orange lights flying in the sky, they looked like a soft serve ice cream at first and then went to a roundish shape. They glided thru the sky right in front of my house. They would fly together very close and then separate. One was flying up and down and the other followed the flight pattern. They proceed past the house then were gone. Approximately a minute went by and they came back from the same location, almost like they circled but they disappeared so I didn&#39;t see them circle. And again they acted as if they were playing tag if you will with each other. Then like the first time the disappeared. Then the next time it was more like 3 minutes had passed and only one appeared again from the same direction. It was moving slower then the first two passes and hovered right in front of th! e house for what seemed a while but actually was no more then a minute, then shot off straight up and was gone. The orange was luminating, like a fire crystal, which would take a hue or red but stayed this orange color. I grabbed my phone and took 3 pictures, 2 pictures are of each craft and one picture is of both of them. The pictures aren&#39;t detailed because of the phone but you can make out they aren&#39;t aircraft. There was also no noise, nothing, no humming, no motor. The other person that was here with me is my children&#39;s step father who was working out in the other room when I called him in to watch them with me.i am 45 yrs old and he is 36. We are average people that have 4 kids together and feel what we saw was UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I were waiting to park in our garage.  One of our kids had parked blocking our entrance.   As we waited our car faced South-East so that we could pull in as soon as the other car was moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time we waited, we noticed two orange orbs in the night sky facing us that looked to be roughly 10 miles off toward downtown Indianapolis.  The orbs were initially horizontal to one another, and had a slight shimmer.  At first we thought these might be helicopters or a military operation but the orbs were not moving any closer. Rather as we continued observation for the next minute or so, we saw the orb on the right make a sudden dip to a vertical formation.  The orb on top did not change position.  The orb on the bottom switched back to the horizontal formation and the vertical a couple more times. These were fast sharp movements that did not resemble a helicopter.  The orb that moved started to get closed to the other orb and was started to move behind the other orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, our daughter signaled us and moved her car.  We pulled into the garage, all the while keeping an eye on the orbs until we crossed the threshold into the garage. In the span of maybe 10 seconds that it took for us to park, and walk back out to the driveway the orbs has vanished.   I would not expect a helicopter or other conventional craft to simply vanish.<n>

I looked over at the passenger seat where I was trying to keep a flower arrangement steady and when I looked forward again, I notice in the upper left quadrant of my vision, a light suspended  across from and above the hospital (which is 8 stories tall) and at first I thought it might be a sodium lamp suspended from a crane atop a building.  Then it occurred to me that there were no other tall buildings in the area. I pulled to the side of the street in someone&#39;s driveway so I could let the traffic go around me while I observed the light.  I thought about using my Blackberry to photograph the light, but the Blackberry has terrible low light capabilities.  The light was now to my left and above, at about a 70 degree angle. I was trying to gage its motion to determine what t! he rate of speed might be.  Fort Lauderdale Airport is not far from this location and I thought this might be an aircraft.  However, the light was mor or less drifting and the speed would not have been enough to produce lift for even the smallest aircraft. Upon further observation the light was actually more like a torch, flame colored but fairly steady in intensity.  It did not flicker but the light had the quality of a flame.  I observed the light for about 2 minutes before it rose into the cloud cover and faded.  I immediately called 911 and informed them that I had seen a flame in the sky and they took my contact information.<n>

They just kept coming.  Then they slowing started ascending in the sky at about a 40 degree angle. As they ascended they disappeared.

The sky was bright blue with a few wispy clouds. While talking casually with the driver, I noticed something very high up in the sky, and probably 30-40 miles away (but extremely large if it was that far away).  I immediately told the driver to look, but as he did, the road we were on dipped and the object disappeared beyond trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was pennant shaped (almost like a triangle, but with very acute, elongated sides)  Very large, and it appeared to almost be the same color of the sky/clouds, however, I could tell it was an actual object because even from the distance I could make out the solid sides to it.  It was as if it was sitting in the wispy clouds.  It had no lights, but did seem to &#34;blend&#34; into the sky, however, it had solid sides and was extremely large from my view point. It was almost as if it created a shadow in the sky around it. It did not move, but looked like it was stationary and just sitting there, not necessarily hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we kept driving, I was able to pick up on it again, but very slightly, since now we were on a very low road and could barely make it out behind trees. We went to eat, and took the same way home about an hour later, but it was gone by the time we got back to the original spot I first saw it. Looked online and in the news and was shocked no one else mentioned! it. Was going to try to videotape it but only had my cell phone and did not think it would capture it well. Way too high to be a balloon. (a hot air balloon business is near me and we see them all the time. This object was at a height that I’ve only seen planes at, and it was way too big to be any type of plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking desperately online now trying to find any similar pictures or video that match what I saw.<n>

I sit out every night till about 2pm facing the south.  I saw  a large round orange ball, like a pumpkin on fire (fuzzy edges) appearing in the western sky and proceeding to the east.  It was very large about the size of a distant full moon while coming towards me getting increasingly smaller as it moved away.  Flight was controlled and horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It finally disapeared over a house to the east, over narragansett bay.  No sound, no variation in flight pattern.  Quite amazing.  In August of &#39;09 I saw a black triangle moving much faster under a cloud bank back lite by a full moon..  At the time I had never heard of such.  In December of that year I googled it and learned that many others has seen the same thing.  I reported to mufon.  ((name deleted))<n>

Then all of a sudden I hear a whoosh of air heading my way with some speed it reminded me of the mlrs rockets I have witnessed before but with no engine sound.  I look up to try and locate the air rushes source and I see a large boomerang shaped cloud moving very low and very very very fast but the only sound that was heard was the wind rushing over it looked like a flock of geese flying in a v shape over head moving at 2000+ mph I kid you not. It was so incredible I never knew such a thing existed however I know now that this is real.  I could not believe when I typed into google search UFO sightings in Dallas that the first description I read matched my sighting to the t, that really reinforced exactly what I just saw 20 min ago.  I believe we have a new technology out there gentleman. One that is not &amp;quot;out of this world&amp;quot;.

Clear night, just a few scattered clouds, but otherwise starry.  Looked up. Saw a stealth bomber shaped object coming my direction from the northeast and flying southwest.  It appeared to be flying really low, maybe 300-500 ft.  It appeared to be probably 15-25 ft or maybe a little larger wing tip to wing tip. It was COMPLETELY silent. Black or dark grey in color. The strangest thing was that around its edges it appeared to reflect some sort of light, but didn&#39;t look to be emitting light itself, at least not like a plane does.  Then just OFF the edge of the craft the sky seemed to &amp;quot;distort&amp;quot; a little like sound waves. This distortion was odd, sort of like it was bad special effects for &amp;quot;cloaking&amp;quot; that looked like sound waves.  The distortion was just around the edges of the object but not on the object itself.  On the edge of the object itself, right around the edges of the whole obj! ect, it seemed to reflect light, if that makes sense, but not emit light.  Odd. When I saw it I was shocked, I felt compelled to blink and shake my head a little to make sure I was actually seeing what I was seeing, which I was.  It was flying maybe 60 miles an hour or something like that, again absolutely quiet and in a straight line.  It flew out of site because of the tree line and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it wasn&#39;t a bird or anything else. It was a craft of some sort. I&#39;m thinking it was a military drone or other stealth aircraft from the government. I live in a populated area. The East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area, so I know other people had to have seen it also.<n>

I was told it was place where high income people shopped.  I was driving on a 4 lane road, with two lanes on either side and grassy area in the middle with trees on either side of the road.  i know i was near a large shopping/metropolitan area.  i was the driver of the car.  It was a clear warm night, with no cloud cover. it was dark clear sky when the first 2 different UFO’s where seen, there was almost no street lights to inter fear with my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving coming from the right hand top corner of my vision coming from i saw a blue round fire ball like object that appeared to be fall from the sky, moving out from the right upper corner to left lower corner of my vision, this lasted in my sight for about 6-8 seconds.  its size was about 2-3 inches around from where i was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a clearly defined edges and appeared out have an outer shell of some short, which dark blue or black areas the outside.  This dark outer layer did not fully coat the object but move around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The inside was what i could only describe as blue lighting inside, it appeared to be rotating or moving very rapidly inside. there where different shades of darker blue closer to the “shell” and lighter blue into the center.  This thing fell very quickly and i heard no noise or any other lights. there appeared to be no tail or trail in the sky behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 1-2 minutes after seeing this thing fall from the sky,  two white solid lights appeared in the sky one about a hands length above the other, the higher one trailed behind the lower one, about what appeared to be a hand length away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While moving to the across the sky from left to right side of view i was positioned behind these objects, for they where moving away from me, there was no other lights around these things, they where solid white balls of light these 2 objects, no wing lights or nothing things else around them. they then where gone from my sight and never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5 minutes later, i arrived in the shopping/metropolitan area, while still continuing to look up to the sky,  there was about 6-8 small air crafts in the air flying around the general area. these where definitely planes for they had the correct wing lights in place. they appeared to be flying in pairs. i was able to stop at a traffic light and clearly see these planes searching for something. they where gone from the area after about 12-18 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything in my life like this, besides the normal air crafts.<n>

The sky was mostly cloudless and black.  The orange orbs were between 10-30 kilometers away.  Four orange orbs rose into the night sky from a northerly direction.  They were each about the size of a pinhead.  They flew in an italicized N-formation.  They rose for several kilometers into the night sky, then moved south a few kilometers, then paused and began to fade until they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible that they disappeared because they were moving away from us, or that could be how my mind is trying to explain the phenomenon. They could have just winked-out.  Who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no wing-lights (as on commercial aircraft), and they were silent.  Koh Samui is a popular island destination, and as a result there are quite a few aircraft flying in and out of the island.  Shortly after the orange orbs disappeared, we could hear a commercial plane flying overhead, coming in for a landing. This plane, which came from a southern direction, was noisy with wing-lights.  So it was easy to contrast the two airborne crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen a similar event on October 2nd, Tuesday, 2012, on Koh Samui as well.  This time I was walking with my girlfriend down Chaweng Beach.  She didn&#39;t see it, and I took notice of it (I keep my eye on the skies), but thought that they could be a natural phenomenon.  I filed this event into the &amp;quot;remember this&amp;quot; part of my brain.  There were 3 craft. All were orange orbs.  They formed in a triangular pattern and then faded away as before.  These craft came from the same northerly direction, moved south, then paused and faded-out in the same area in the sky as above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an English teacher in Japan.

As they climbed off shore they increased altitude until they were out of sight. It was a clear night with the moon clearly visible approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.

Sunset at 7:10PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting, observed a couple nearby light and release a pale blue/green Chinese wind lantern . Tracked with binoculars as it drifted to NNE.  Completely dissimilar to the following:  Start:  9:17PM, @8 degrees above Fort Trumbull (about half a mile away at 300 degrees NW) The first hazy orange light emerged, appearing to swerve abruptly from a SE to a NE course, (wind at this time had shifted to the SE).  Floating steadily, it gradually rose to @ 35 degree elevation (below 1,000 feet altitude), then maintained constant speed and altitude as it continued into the NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appearance was a quasi Kong Ming “Hero” Chinese sky lantern.  Much larger in size than such lanterns normally are (Corrected estimate from previous one = 10-25 ft diameter) , this cone shaped red/yellow/orange light’s top-most funnel shaped portion shifted erratically from side to side as if buffeted by wind, even though the object’s transit was a smooth, steady floating speed of 45 – 75 mph.  I must emphasize that the wind was blowing from the NW directly into my face.  After 3 minutes this orange oval began to flicker, then winked out at 20 degrees NE (about 3.5 miles away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using a Lumix SZ15 I tried to zoom in and take burst photos and HD video.  Simultaneously, I attempted to paint the UFO with a green laser, while also observing it through 7X35 binoculars – an obviously frustrating experience.  No apparent response to laser, though all objects remained – for the first time since June – out of the laser’s 2,500 ft range, therefore I was also unable to “paint” any of them.  Some useful photos and video obtained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO was followed by four subsequent UFOs, each appearing from the same location and each transiting almost identically from the NW to the NE.  Each UFO in this sequence appeared only after the previous one had drifted completely away and finally winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final UFO blinked out at 9:35PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peculiar note:  This was my fifth sighting at this location, taking place on the fifth of the month and, for the very first time, involving five objects.<n>

The sightings have been ongoing, as recently as within the past week.  In an effort to witness these anomalous events, the author went to the area in question to observe on October 5, 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two witnesses observed two instances of some anomalous aereal objects, and hereby submit this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses conducted a field observation between dusk (approximately 7:30pm) and 10:30pm.  Subsequent to the sightings the witnesses did not discuss what they saw in any detail, preferring to prevent contamination of their individual accounts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather/visibility conditions  Clear until 9:30pm, then scattered altocumulus at 10,000&#39; until 10:15pm, then clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Temperature 77 degrees, Barometric pressure 29.95 in/Hg, Winds South at 12kt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Average amount of haze and ground lights, restricted observation of stars to 4th magnitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting 1:  Time – 8:35pm Duration of sighting: ~30 seconds Distance from observer:  Unknown Elevation above MSL:  Unknown Heading arc of object:  ~8 to ~10 degrees Azimuth of object:  ~ 15 degrees above horizon constant  Witness 1 Narrative:  I was sitting in a chair on the beach facing east.  I was watching the sky to the south, and turned towards the north and saw a bright reddish-orange light in the sky, with a magnitude of approximately -4.   I alerted Witness 2 to the object, who also observed it.  It traveled from left to right at the same elevation, and after about 15 seconds faded to a small pinpoint of light, with a magnitude of approximately 0.  It traveled toward the right (northeast) and gradually faded away to invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am well versed in astronomical, meteorological, and aviation disciplines, and while the course taken by the object first appeared to be that of a conventional aircraft, I have never seen a configuration of lights of the sort.  There were no strobes (red/white), nor wingtip lights (red/green), and the object simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting 2:  Time – 8:42pm Duration of sighting: ~60 seconds Distance from observer:  Unknown Elevation above MSL:  Unknown Heading arc of object:  ~15 to ~20 degrees Azimuth of object:  From  ~ 8 to ~12 degrees above horizon  Witness 1 Narrative:  Alerted to the activity reported in Sighting 1, I concentrated my subsequent observation on the same area.  Seven minutes after the first sighting, I observed a very bright reddish-orange light very low to the horizon, estimate about 8 degrees, low enough to be partially obscured by the roofs of the nearby beach houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I again alerted Witness 2 to the object, who also observed it.  The object was rising in elevation to a maximum of approximately 12 degrees above the horizon, in clear view.  It was traveling from right to left, and was observed for approximately one full minute, traversing approximately 20 degree range of heading, and exhibiting similar flight and behavioral characteristics:  very bright, in the order of magnitude of estimated -4 to -6 for the majority of the time of observance, then fading to a clear white pinpoint of light with an estimated magnitude of 0 or 1, and finally disappearing altogether.  While the course taken by the object first appeared to be! that of a conventional aircraft, the lighting presentation was unconventional.  There were no strobes (red/white), nor wingtip lights (red/green), and the object simply disappeared.<n>
10/5/12 20:08|Tulsa|OK|Formation||Armada of Star-like Objects Moving Across Oklahoma Night Sky|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93343.html|582|ndxe201210| Armada of Star-like Objects Moving Across Oklahoma Night Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:08 central time, my son and I were sitting in our van at the intersection of 129th and 71st in the Broken Arrow, Tulsa area waiting for the light to change.  I was driving and we were facing west in the left hand through lane.  There was a moderate cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting at the stop light my son, who is 17, said something to the effect of, &#34;Dad, what the heck is that/are those?&#34;   After a few seconds of confusion in trying to locate what he was looking at in the night sky, I observed what he saw.   With due west as the 12 o’clock position, I estimate that a group of objects were at about the 2 o’clock position about 55 to 65 degrees in elevation from the horizon moving from north to south.  Speed was difficult to assess because we didn’t know how far away the objects were - although while I was sitting at the light which couldn’t have been more than 20 seconds, they had traversed from the 2 o’clock position to about the 11 o’clock position in the sky as observed through my windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first observed the objects I thought they might be fireworks because they seemed to be flickering or pulsing - but then I noted they were moving in unison - although not in a regular formation in the sky.  Then I thought maybe they were lighted, radio-controlled aircraft that I had observed in the past in a field near our home.  But since I knew these planes  moved in a bobbing, irregular manner that did not explain these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were at the 11 o’clock position I started counting them before the light changed to green.  My recollection was I got up to about a dozen - but my perception was there were even more present - though they were faint.  I think they were at least 15 objects and maybe even up to 30 in the position we were observing them.  The sky was literally peppered with them in portions of that area of the sky.   I perceived the lights to be about the size and brightness of an easily visible star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amount of sky they occupied would be approximately equivalent to both of one’s hands - or maybe closer to a hand and a half - covering such a section.  The length of the loose formation was greater than its width from what I could see.  I perceived the color of the lights to be a light green - although  my son thought they were more like neon purple.  I thought they were pulsing or blinking in unison at a what I think was a rate of 2-3 pulses per second.  Aaron thought this effect was from them passing in and out of the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light turned green I caught glimpses of the lights again - although it was difficult to focus on them because I was driving.  Aaron saw them more clearly but we were moving so visual confirmation was difficult to maintain for him as well.  Light pollution didn’t help either.  About a quarter of mile down the road, we turned in behind a school to see if we could still observe the phenomenon but they had apparently disappeared behind the cloud cover or moved too far distant for us to observe them further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the total time of the incident to be about one to two minutes from beginning to end of the observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son is a student at the local high school and an interested skeptic in such phenomenon.  I am a 49 year old  27 year teacher who has an admittedly avid interest in the topic of UFOs and although I’ve seen some unusual lights in the sky?  None I can’t explain as conventional artificial, meteorological, biological, or astronomical objects - until now.  The only conventional explanation I can think of for these object would be a formation of military helicopters.  They were definitely not airplanes or jets (moving too slowly), birds (unless pigeons have suddenly evolved luminescence in Oklahoma!), balloons, or meteors.<n>

It was around 8:00 pm when my husband looked out our back slider into the sky thinking he was seeing some sort of fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We scrambled out onto our deck to watch however it was clearly not fireworks.  It was a fairly clear sky. We were looking toward the east/southeast.  These lights were quite visible to each of us.  They were a bright orange in color, sort of oval in shape.  There were approximately 10 to 12 of them in sort of a formation.  They seemed to just hover in the sky, with no sound.  It lasted for around 5-7 minutes then they just seemed to evaporate.  We did call our local police department and reported the strange incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This fireball went out and then then appeared to be just plane lights, with a red light and a white strobe, just like any other plane at light.  Something then dropped from this object, whatever it was had a white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we believed it was a plane burning up with a piece that fell off, but whatever it was appeared have a small white light on it, not like a burning object falling.  That object did not appear to fall as fast as something falling to earth.  It could have been something dropped with a parachute with a light attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it with appeared to be plane lights which then appeared to fly in a circle for about a couple of minutes.   Then it straightened out and headed in the direction of Sky Harbor airport in Phx, descending as would a normal plane coming in for a landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole time we believed it might be a plane with some serious mechanical problems, but whatever it dropped was out of the ordinary and we couldn’t find any mention of any unusual occurrences on any news reports.<n>

I noticed it was no balloon it moved closer towards me and there was no sound at all.a small plane flew rite over it, so i knew it wasn&#39;t no plane, i could here the plane clearly,so i called my neighbor out to see it.  As it passed behind the trees it started moving at a faster pace as we watched it move faster it started to lose its flame like glow then it just disappeared into thin air,  it was just about dark out so i can see a little daylight in background and there was nothing it just vanished!<n>

As military jets flew in each of there direction they began to move in opposite directions, the 1st began flying back eastward on the same line it had just moved westward to avoid the first jet, and the second object moved further southwestward.  Losing sight of the second object I fixed my eyes on the first object which at this time had moved far from where it had settle in the sky flying eastward as if it was going to fly directly above me, and after about two minutes before it was directly above me it started fading from sight eventually dissapearing.  I&#39;m sure that these were ufo&#39;s because of the amount of other air crafts that were in the air soon after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also there is a military air force base &amp; a loca! l airport here, as well as an industrial park where helicopters, drones, and other aircraft vehicles are manufactured, and being well versed on what type of air crafts are being manufactured in those buildings,  I can bare witness that what I saw did not match any aircraft or object being manufactured in any of these locations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another note to be taken, is that an excessive amount of birds were flying chaotically at the time of the spotting!<n>

I could not accurately determine its size or height without anything around it to use for comparison.  It was slightly windy blowing toward the north and the object was moving southeast which rules out a balloon.  There was no wobbling or weaving, it moved eerily straight as it drifted over.<n>

I lost sight when it hit the earth due to the roof tops of houses.  The interesting thing about this light and tail was it did not appear falling from outer space as though it was coming through the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only seemed to leave a tail in the lower half of the sky.  Normally when an object falls from space you see a tail in the top half of the sky which burns out in the lower half.  This was opposite, the tail dropped from half-way up in the sky into the earth horizon of Mt umunhum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidentally about an half-hour later I was walking and noticed two lights flying low over the Mt umunhum mountain range.  At first look it seemed like one object, but later after they turned south I noticed the lights were independent.  It was two separate objects, presenting a flight path similar to a military excerise flying over mountains.  Very unusual to see in a very populated San Jose Bay Area.  They were not flying the usual flight paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fascinating thing about the ojects was that they had a glow of green-yellow-white lights similar to the object that fell vertical out of the sky about 30 minutes eariler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are just two of the six incidents of UFO objects I have seen around Mt umunhum in the past 6 weeks.  These objects or events seem to occur around 8:15 to 9:30 pm when I noticed them...just after dark.<n>

THIS IS NOT A HOAX!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay so today is October 4, 2012. Roughly around 8:30 pm tonight my friend and I were driving home. I was in the driver’s seat, and my friend in the passengers.  He notified me of an object that looked like a plane about to land off in the distance and I looked up and saw what he was talking about.  As we got further down the road, going straight toward the object, I noticed what I thought at the time was a satellite in front of the plane.  The satellite looking object was a little above the plane object and looked orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer I slowed down almost to a stop. It looked as if the plane was flipped on its side and could see a metal/light color filling in between the lights that were following behind the orange light.  We got almost right under the object so I turned the music completely off to see if I could hear anything.  Didn’t hear a thing!!  The objects were flying as low as military cargo planes and I couldn’t hear a single thing!!  The orangish light was a slight bit higher and out in front of the other object. They never got farther apart, higher or lower or anything.  These objects traveled what looked like together, never moving any different from each other, and at the same exact speed.  The other object that my friend and I thought was a plane at first was a lot different as it got closer. It started out looking like a normal low flying plane, than when it was close we noticed the lights were upright.  The lights on the plane object were all red, there were about four or five t! ops and they were not flashing, pulsing, or anything.  It almost looked as if it was a plane flipped on its side, kind of strait up and down but a little slanted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we stopped the car I looked around the sky and spotted planes flying and as soon as I saw one, counted it out because it was nowhere near what we had just witnessed.  We saw this UFO looking object for about 30 or so seconds.  I completely ruled out a satellite, blimp, plane, anything. We saw the object for a good half minute or so and were close enough to it that if it had been a plane or blimp we would have easily heard it.  It was so strange because the objects never moved away from each other, they were moving all as one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, one orange glowing light/orb in front and a slight bit higher, with four or five red solid lights cockeyed trailing somewhat close behind it across the sky.  Sorry that this is so long and specific but I have never seen anything like this in my entire life and neither has my friend.  We both spent all night trying to think of excuses and have no idea.  While I was looking at this object I got chills going up and down my neck and back  I was so freaked out and still am. I even grabbed a pen afterward and wrote down before and after what the objects looked like on a napkin in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PLEASE if anyone important who can cover what I saw or thinks they know what I saw let me know because I’m at a loss for words.  THIS IS NOT A HOAX.  I am a normal nineteen year old boy, I go to college, have played sports, no health problems, don’t do drugs or drink, have tons of friends, don’t believe in conspiracy theories, etc.  I can email a drawn picture of what the object looked like even. Ever since I saw what I did I cannot stop thinking about it.  In a way I hope I see whatever I did again sometime, I’ll be looking up at the sky every night from now on.  Thank you for reading.<n>
10/4/12 20:30|Dayton|OH|Light|1 hour|Multiple high speed, high altitude lights over Dayton, Ohio.|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93326.html|610|ndxe201210| Multiple high speed, high altitude lights over Dayton, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 20:30 EST, my sister called me to see if I had seen any lights outside.  She and my parents had been standing outside since 20:00 watching dozens of lights moving from south to north over Dayton, Ohio.  I went outside and immediately spotted on of the lights. I went inside and grabbed my wife, who also saw.  She proceeded to call her parents and brother, who also all saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were extremely high in altitude, very fast, and ranged in colors of white, blue, and red. Several of them flickered.  I think the color difference could be explained by differences in altitude. After roughly 15 minutes of watching, I saw three all moving at the same speed in a staggered triangle formation.  Already in amazement by what I was seeing, a much larger, deep red light followed those three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I was waiting to see if they would fade from view at about 30 degrees as most satellites I have seen do.  The only time the lights faded was when they were so distant I could no longer see them, but never did they flicker out like satellites.  Living near Wright-Patterson, I am not entirely surprised to see things like this, but they were definitely not aircraft that the public knows about.  None of the lights changed direction, seemingly all having a set destination or orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Silent too.  No vapor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good Morning Mr Davenport,  I always enjoy when you are a guest on Coast 2 Coast, but I have a question.  On October 4, 2012 at about 6:45 AM in Bakersfield where I live I happened to be outside in my backyard and I saw way up high a ufo coming from the LA area headed north.  It looked just like a huge &#39;white &#39; PCP pipe (no protrusions like wings or nothing and flat in front and back) and it was just gliding along in a straight line.  I did not hear a noise but I estimate it&#39;s size, if it was on the ground, to be as big as a 747.  Well, I just stared at it until it was out of sight and then I went back in my house for a few minutes and went back outside in the backyard and here comes another one headed in the same direction, and then here comes another one headed south and they pass each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I have been outside in the mornings many time since and then about two months ago I happened to see another one coming from the west and zipping through the clouds sort of south easterly direction but it was moving many times faster than the three I saw that day.  I just saw the last one for just an instant but it was the same as the others.  Haven&#39;t seen any since.  I was just wondering Mr Davenport, have you ever heard from anyone that said they saw that kind? Well, thank you for you time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  Cheryl Allen  ps.  I sent you an e-mail Mr. Davenport a long time ago but neglected to give this report until today.  Have not seen anymore.  Wish I would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I had the window rolled down and looked to my right, when i saw this big green ball of light falling straight down.  I didn&#39;t think it was a meteor or a comet, due to the light not having a tail or traveling semi-horizontally.  It lasted about 5 to 10 seconds dropping behind trees and apartment complexes 2 to 3 stories high.   It looked similar to roman candle flare but bigger and consistent and did not fade out, like a fire cracker would.  It was much too high in the air to be from a fire cracker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 30 seconds after, a helicopter came flying from the south as we were pulling into my neighborhood.  It circled my neighborhood about and passed my street, about 2 more streets down flying pretty low.  Then i saw it go straight to the neighborhood where I saw the green ball of light fall.  Then i! t left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the local news the next afternoon to inquire if anyone has reported anything.  It&#39;s been 3 days and I haven&#39;t gotten a response.<n>

There altitude seemed to be between 10,000 to 15,00 feet.  They flew in formation from the northeast to the southwest makeing a slight direction change to fly directly to the west. they were flying very close to eachother one right behind the other, both roughly the same sphere shape and slightly diffrent colors of a greenish orange.  I cant extimate their speed since i didnt have a referance point but they seemed to be going very fast covering the length of the sky in about 15 seconds.<n>

This light did not appear to move.  We walked into the backyard to get a better view, to see if a spotlight was causing it, but we couldn&#39;t find anything.  At that point the lights seemed to be slowly spreading apart and you could tell there were at least 9 separate lights to make up this shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us kept watching for a little while longer and decided to run inside to get our three next door neighbors to make sure we weren&#39;t crazy.  After only a few minutes of our neighbors joining us a plane started flying toward the cloudy looking lights.  The plane passed underneath the formation and the lights separated into different directions, kind of changing the shape and getting dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two out our three neighbors agreed the lights were strange.  Our age ranges are from 26-50.<n>

The objects were low (about 100feet) and appeared to be hovering just above the large hill up from English street.  She saw them from a distance of about a mile (from city hall) and watched them for about two minutes from inside a vehicle before going inside.  She reported there was a group of three that formed a perfect triangle.  This triangle was hovering just above the largest oak tree at the top of hill.  It appeared to her that the light from the craft was illuminating the tree line at the top of the hill.  She also stated there were about four other craft the same while color but not as bright in the same area but perhaps a little further away.  Most of her attention was on the three large in the triangle formation.  I called the local police and they did not have any reports for this incident.  I pretty sure other people must have seen it, ! as there are houses very close to the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week prior my buddy’s wife saw a UFO near the power sub-station on Stony Point road in the daylight.  This sighting was followed by two helicopters and a jet apparently pursuing the craft.  She described one helicopter as black and the other as camouflage.  She did not give a description of the jet.  The UFO appeared to resemble a meteorite from the cell phone picture she took (sorry I cannot up load the photo).  This object was seen near Meacham Rd and stony point.<n>

They are the lights emanating from the Mystic Lake Casino in Prior Lake, MN, located an estimated twelve miles from the sighting location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The skylights are stationary, are ten in number, and are extremely visible during nights of low cloud cover.  From a certain range, the lights are also visible during clear nights.  I would just like to point this out.  I am a resident of Farmington, MN, a Minneapolis/St. Paul suburb 17 miles east of Prior Lake.  These lights are visible even here and are observable on most nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The military craft fly over south-west San Jose at about 30-40000 feet, nightly every 15 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed this object-light was different so I ran in the house to get a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the 15 or 20 seconds of getting the camera and getting back outside, the object-light was gone...I could not believe it.  I know spaceships exist, and have no doubt, so I started looking for it directly above the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behold, about 30 to 40,000 feet I saw a saucer shaped object flying over ahead continuing toward San Francisco. I was facinated on how fast this object was able to vertically rise from about 5500 feet to 30-40,000 feet in about 15 to 20 seconds.  Unfortunately I was not able to see the vertical rise while I was getting the camera.<n>

Another couple stopped their car to watch.  There were aircraft that seemed to be circling the object; they moved out of sight when it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband observed the same object on the 6th of October just north of our home outside the city limits.  This follows sightings of glowing orbs darting above our treeline and through our property during the months of August and September.

The whole thing only last about 3 or 4 seconds but it had a green trail behind it.<n>

The standard lights held steady while the orange lights flew in all different directions in the sky.  It looked as one orange craft was heading right in my direction, while all orange lights faded out of view.  This lasted under 2 minutes.  As I was watching the sky, I saw 2 military officers in full uniform heading in the direction of Slim&#39;s night club on 11th.<n>

They would appear then quickly fade back out, looked something like the famous Arizona sighting.  They were orange balls of light that would appear for a few seconds then disappear.  At one point I saw them in a really tight cluster moving horizontally to the ground way up in the sky.  It was almost as if they were flares being dropped by airplanes because there was a lot of aircraft activity going in the sky as well.  Apparently this has been going on for the past couple of days now, can anyone see if the military is dropping flares or something?<n>

It didn&#39;t go very far before it took off but when it did, the sky around it lit up for a minute.  It looked like a plane, only black and a lot bigger. And even though it was big, it shot off fast.  I only saw it for a few seconds after it took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was facing approximately 162° SE at around 10:50 PM, deep into the text message I was sending on my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I sent the text. I looked up and was about to retrieve my laptop, when something bright caught my in the corner of my eye.  I then turned my head slightly to the right, to see a large bright orange colored fireball in the sky.  It looked like a star, only several times brighter and very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its exact location from where I was sitting is 200°S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a street light that I had not noticed before.  I just moved into these apartments yesterday. (Cedar Groove in Shepherdsville KY)   As I watched it I thought “Maybe it is a plane. I am close to the airport. It has to be a plane.”  I watched it hover, unmoving, unwavering, shimmering like a large bright star / fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it would at least move and so I could see the lights of an airplane.  It’s often common to see a light, and then realize it’s a plane simply preparing for landing as they turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, it did not do anything.  I sat there watching it hover for at least 30 seconds until it started to quickly fade. It was almost like it was a burnt out ball of fire.  The last thing I could see of it was a tiny red/orange dot, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no noises.  In fact, there were no airplanes for a while until afterwards the airport seemed to make the path go through the exact same area where I saw the UFO, and back towards me heading west.  That was not until around 11:20 when I started to see airplanes in the skies from the nearby center of UPS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oddest part about this is I have not seen a UFO for years.  I lived in Reno Nevada ans used to see flying UFO’s quite a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of those objects moved in strange patterns, and I saw most of them during the day.  I have NEVER seen anything like this in all of my 31 years.  I will be simply amazed if I was the only person to have seen this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no denying how big and bright it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The lights made up the entire object.  It was pretty far off but with binoculars we could tell that the lights resembled the color of cop car lights but in the air.  They did not move at all for the course of time we saw them besides the flicker of the lights together.  The blue and red are the ones that seemed to flash, the white didn&#39;t that we know of.<n>

I ran back to get keys to drive to a closer spot without street lights and try to photo with phone camera and they were fading out of sight as I was driving and within 7 minutes the had all faded away. I don&#39;t believe in little green men but I was mesmerized by this sight and at one point at a stop sign, they seem to be moving slowly to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The family member who called had their neighbors watching it as well.  We assumed they were planes until we realized they made no sound, and instead of heading in a certain direction, they continued to fly back and forth continuously.  One of them flashed a white light erratically, while the tho others had three lights, the front two flashing white and the back one flashing red.  After a while, one the unidentified objects began to come closer and the crafts moved farther away from each other.  We don&#39;t know anything about aircrafts, but it would be bizarre if planes mere moving back and forth from left to right, being that size without sound.  It was also extremely bizarre that nearly an hour away in Salisbury, our two family members could see the same exact sight.  A few minutes after the craft disappeared, a large red and green, triangular craft was in the area that was not there before, but we could hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I heard the helicopter and saw its navigation lights quite clearly (it was dark and no moonlight, breezy, but no clouds), and noted it was on a heading of about 196 degrees True (checked with my compass), therefore flying towards Butte, MT.  I could not make out any identification numbers (too dark). Leading in front of the helicopter was a fairly bright red light, about the size of a dime from my vantage point, which was leading the helicopter by 100-200 yards.  This was a single red light, constant, not strobing, and without accompanying green or white lights - just a solitary red light moving in unison with the helicopter.  At the time I felt that I could see both objects quite clearly. I believe I heard only one helicopter fly over.  After perhaps 10 seconds, both disappeared into the distance. Both were perhaps 1000 -1500 feet in altitude above my position.!  What I saw immediately struck me as an odd scene, and one that I could not readily explain.  It just did not appear to be another helicopter leading the one which I could see very clearly.<n>

It was 7:50pm.  I heard a very low rumbling noise (not unlike airplanes at extreme altitude), looked up and noticed two craft moving from the Southwest to the Northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too dark to see any shape.  They were two chevron or triangle-shaped craft with white lights on each point and a red light just aft of the leading white light.  The white lights were constant while the red light would blink very, very slowly (maybe once every 5 seconds or so).<n> <n><n> <n><n> If they were silent I would have absolutely ran inside to get my camera but the noise led me to believe military craft of some sort, maybe B-2 Spirits.  (Someone who worked on the B-2 for eleven years told me that is not the navigational lighting pattern of the B-2).<n> <n><n> <n><n> One was directly in front of the other.  The total sighting from above my house until they were past the tree line to my north was approximately two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure it was military of some sort but I am an aviation fan and this isn&#39;t any navigation lighting configuration I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

(It is difficult to gauge distance in the desert in the dark.)  I was waiting for an explosion noise, but there was only silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not war games at the 29 Palms Marine Base, which is more than 20 miles away.  We are star and sky watchers and I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidentally, there was unusual animal behavior today.  We feed and water the wild birds and today less than ¼ of the usual number of mourning doves and 1/10 of the usual number of Gamble’s Quail showed up at the normal feeding times.

10/2/12 13:20|Taylorsville|UT|Circle|10 minutes|Silver orb moving over the Salt Lake valley from north to south and then from south to east.|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93263.html|649|ndxe201210| Silver orb moving over the Salt Lake valley from north to south and then from south to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:20 p.m. I spotted a rounded silver object hovering over the northern portions of the Salt Lake Valley from the vantage point of 4700 south and 2700 west.  The object was first spotted moving Easterly in direction and when an approaching jet liner (based off of the markings of the jet it was a Delta jet) the object changed direction to a more Southerly route at which point I entered the house and called another individual out to see the object that I could not identify to see if they could make out what the object might have been. The object proceeded to move slowly in the southerly direction towards the middle of the valley (taking approximately 3 or so minutes to reach the middle area, approximating its location in the sky in correlation to the ground I would say the object was hovering high above 2100 south and 1300 west) at which point the object began to at a much more rapid pace move in a more Easterly direction towards the Wasatch mou! ntains. Along with the other individual we continued to watch the object move towards (and what looked like eventually OVER the mountains) until we could no longer make out the object in the sky.  We both observed the object with binoculars and with our naked eyes and all we could make out with the binoculars was the fact that the object was silver and definitely metallic in appearance (as it was shimmering like a star at night would) and that it was rounded like an orb.  We both continued to observe the object for as long as we could make out the object and keep track of its direction, it continued to move east at what seemed like a much quicker speed than it did when it was heading in the southerly direction.  We continued to observe the object for approximately another 2 or 3 minutes or until about 1:30 p.m. at which point the object was no longer discernible from the crisp blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How I first came to notice the object is while I was watching the aforementioned commercial jet flying through the sky leaving a small vapor trail behind it. As the jet flew across the northern sky from east to west I noticed something shimmering in the sky moving opposite of the jet (again the markings on the plane were clearly Delta in origin) from west to east. When the object and the jet were about equidistant apart (from the ground perspective anyway) the object changed direction and headed from north to south eventually changing direction again and heading east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first sight of the object and after initial observation and skepticism about what this could be I ran into the house and called another individual out to see the object as well.  We both went back outside to the same spot I first noticed the object in and with the binoculars we both took turns observing the object.  Neither of us could see any markings or indicators that it was just a jet high up in the atmosphere only that the object was just a small, semi-rounded, silver and metallic in appearance object leading us to question if the object was an unidentified flying object or not.<n>

Something caught my eye in the sky.  I noticed 10 white oval objects, which I first thought were balloons.  I watched them as they moved quickly from west to east towards the Riverside city area.  I thought they were being blown by the wind, but then I watched them all line up in one line, then scatter, but still staying in the same area together.  Also, it is 100 degrees today, and there is no wind,. I continued to watch and could see them approximately 1/2 mile away, what appeared to be movement, some type of back and forth maneuvers, left to right.  There were no lights on these objects and I could not hear any sound. I have two pilots in my family, one is a captain.  I have experienced many aircraft and I do not live far from the Ontario International Airport.  I see commercial jets fly over my home everyday, this was not like anything I have ever seen.  I am hoping someone else saw these objects ! and reported these to your site.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Video)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog was kind of acting up, and she had done so a few nights before.  She seemed anxious, and seemed to want me to take her out. She had done this a few nights before, and I had taken her out.  When I went outside I remember hearing a loud sound, of what seemed like horns, or trumpets from all around.  I remember it being very early in the morning, maybe two am, and thinking, why isn&#39;t anyone else waking to this sound. I thought about it later, and thought maybe my dog had heard the sound, and that is why she wanted to go out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So On October 2nd, when my dog did this again I was much quicker to go outside. Again I heard the horn/trumpet sound, though this time it seemed a bit muted, almost like I was hearing it in a vacuum, similar to hearing the ocean in a seashell.  I looked over the horizon and saw nothing, then from overhead noticed what appeared to be a triangle of lights, with what appeared to be randomly moving lights running between each of the triangle points.  It was very large, and all I could really see were the lights, and definitive darker, more shadowed area within the confines of the lights on the corners.  It continued to move away from me in a Southern direction, and reached a point on the horizon where is seemed to remain still, or in a relatively central location for a few minutes.  I was able to get 31 seconds of video with my cell phone, and then the battery died.  The video was shot prior to it reaching the location on the horizon where it hovered,and I opted to stay and watch it, as opposed to trying to go in and get a quick charge on my phone to record more video (Which is what I did after watching it hover for a few minutes on the horizon, when I returned to try to record more, it was gone.) I have seen a lot of unusual air traffic, late night, early morning in this area.  I am very close to a small airport, but the planes that fly in, both day and night are distinctly different than what I heard or saw on the 2nd. and on the previous night.  I will keep looking, and hopefully get more video, should it occur again.<n>

It was a clear night with a full moon.  When I turned I looked up at the moon and noticed a pulsating orange orb/fireball but it wasn&#39;t fire that I was seeing.  If you were facing south the moon was probably 70degrees in the sky from the horizon.  If you were looking at the moon and imagined it was a clock it would have been at about 4:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now keep in mind this was a full moon, and it was bright enough to really stand out considering it was close to the moon.  It was stationary I live exactly 3 blocks from the road that I had turned off of.  I was driving fast because I wanted my mom to see it, it took me prob 30 seconds to get to my house.   I told my mom to come see it the object started moving in a southwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now by the time we went outside in back yard it had accelerated extremely fast in a matter of about 25 seconds it was onl! y about 15 to 20 degrees above the southwest horizon!  It had to have accelerated to a very high speed and was out of eye sight within 15seconds of coming outside to the backyard!  I am not sure of the altitude but it seemed like at least 15 or 20 thousand feet because a plane came into view that was not to far away from the object, and then it was out of sight!  It made no sound, but since I didn&#39;t know its height it may have just been to high to hear it.  I couldn&#39;t make an educated guess on its size.  It looked like a ball of orange pulsating energy, I believe that it was not a part of a nuts and bolts craft I cant say for 100% certainty but that&#39;s what it seemed to be!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I watch them for about an other 20 minutes and then they just disappeared. How weird?<n>

We were startled when we saw a bright red light that suddenly appeared in the sky.  Initially, the light seemed to be quite a distance away and relatively high in the sky (it was to the right of the moon from our vantage point at that time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best description we can give of the object is that it seemed similar to the shape of torch and the red color was extremely bright.  What struck us as most peculiar was that the object was ascending rapidly, practically straight up.  Then it suddenly and rapidly moved right, almost at a right angle.  Then it began moving toward us and its flight appeared to take more of a horizontal course.  Without taking our eyes from the object, we moved our position on the ground to maintain an unobstructed view of its course.  The object continued to fly horizontally and then it disappeared before our eyes.  We remained in the same position for several minutes but the object did not reappear.  The skies are clear so we feel relatively certain that the object did not simply disappear behind a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never before witnessed a similar phenomenon in the sky and we weren’t sure how or where to report this experience.  We found your website after conducting a Google search.  We are curious to learn if anyone else in the area witnessed a similar object in the sky.<n>

NOT GOING ANYWHERE!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend had been telling me ,a couple days before this ,that she had seen a UFO in the sky ,to the east of our house ,above the tree line.I did not pay too much attention to her ,until monday October 1st,2012 when i was watching tv and randomly looked out the window . I saw a light that caught my attention because it looked like an airplane but was not moving. I went outside on my deck and looked closer at this . It was a light that looked like a star ,but brighter,and seemed to have flickering red and green lights on it that told me it was a plane, but it was not moving anywhere.  I had a view of this between 2 trees and could tell it was not going anywhere,this light was west of my house above the treeline. As I am watching this light with my son ( 16 yrs .old ) ,  my girlfriend yelled at me that she can see another one on the other side of the house , to the east.We live outside Eugene, Oregon ,on a mountain, where there are no lights from the city ,m! aking the stars stand out with great brightness. We watched both of these lights for a while and only saw them move slightly up and down ,and side to side once in a while .  I got out my binoculars and could definately see flashing green and red lights and once in a while there was a dark ,almost purple blue light that was not constant, seemed to be random...... When I was watching the on to the west, I saw a bright flash of light close to the others that looked like maybe if you shined a realy bright light at something chrome or a mirror or something . This light never flashed again , that I saw . Ya know ,it was more like a flash of a camera, times 1000 !!!So that kinda weirded me out , but then last night Oct.2nd , we were at King Estates Winery for my birthday dinner,15 miles from our house and again on a mountain with no city lights, and there they were , in the same place as the night before !!!!!!!  This is realy tripping me out !!!! tonight my brother is bringing over! a camcorder to see if we can capture this on film, if they ar! e still there, wich i am sure they will be since they have been there for a week almost!  Somebody REALY NEEDS TO GET AHOLD OF ME !!!!!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We strongly suspect a sighting of a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.  PD))<n>

Then leaving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were driving now a dirt road.  There was a corn field on both sides of us. No houses were near by.  As we kept driving, my friend, pointed out something coming up from out of the field to on our right hand side.  I looked out the window and didn&#39;t see anything. He told me to look up in the sky. I looked up into the sky and saw lights.  I yelled and told him to stop the car now.  He stopped the car and I got out as fast as I could.  I started recording the object. It was roughly about 50 feet in the air and increasing height.  It seemed to be hovering up slowly (2mph+). I got my iPod out and started to record it.  From what I saw it had a circular shape, with blackness around it, and lights around the blackness. It had bright red and yellow/white lights.  It started to hover over us and go south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We jumped in the car and started to follow it.  Once we started to follow it the object started to speed up gradually.  As we got a mile down the road the object was no where in sight.  I then checked my iPod to watch the recording.  My iPod had some sort of malfunction and shut off while I was recording. It would not turn on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later my iPod rebooted and the video was not there.  My friend and I freaked out and did not know what to do. We kept going towards are desination despite of what we saw. When we reached the nearby town we noticed flashing lights.  We investigated the town and found that a house in town was caught up in flames.  The fire department was trying to put it out.  I do not know exactly what it was, but I know for a fact that it was a flying object with lights and it was something I have never seen in my life.  I have never seen a flying object fly the way that did that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It|8/29/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/112/S112992.html|667|ndxe201210| UFO Sightings in Ojai Valley, California  First Sighting Date: I am sorry to have not recalled the specific date of this occurrence. It was roughly between August 2012 – November 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: Approximately between 12noon-3pm<n> <n><n> Duration of Sighting (Before my departure): 4-6 minutes<n> <n><n> Shape: Metallic Oval-disc<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location started at the east end of downtown Ojai.  There were no visual obstructions in my view. I am a person with 20/20 vision.  Approximate location of UFO was above and possibly slightly behind a mountain ridge of North-east Ojai valley.  The distance between the object and myself, judging east downtown Ojai to the mountain ridge it hovered above, is approximately 2 to 2.5 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects size from my perspective could have been from 100 ft long and 20 ft tall to 300 ft long and 60ft tall.  It appeared to hover above, either directly above or back and above, the mountain ridge.  There was a very slight distance between the object and the mountain ridge at about a 16th of an inch, if I were to hold my forefinger and thumb to measure from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear sunny day without a cloud in the sky. I was walking down the sidewalk looking at the scenery along the Ojai valley mountain range.  My first observance was spotting something metallic, noticing sun reflection on its surface.  My first impression was that is was either an airplane or a satellite dish.  There are airplanes in flight traffic pattern in the east end sky of Ojai valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as I noticed it was not moving along the mountain ridge or diminishing or growing in size, I knew it could not be an airplane.  I then, thought maybe it’s a Blimp, but again, it was not moving in any direction, just fixed.  Also, the shape was very much more oval or disc shaped to be a blimp.  So, then I presumed it to be a Satellite Dish I hadn’t noticed before.  I did think it seemed much too large to be a satellite dish atop a mountain ridge at that distance.  I simply came to the conclusion that that is what it must be, a Satellite dish.  So, then I got to my car, proceeding to drive in the opposite direction, still observing it and wondering about it, since it had such a mysterious and odd looking presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I was in the same area, I remembered where I had seen the supposed Satellite Dish.  I kept looking and looking along the mountain ridges.  It wasn’t there anymore. I thought “No way, it couldn’t be what I think it is.”  I have been going over and over in my mind about this sighting.  I tend to take a scientific approach to things.  I thought, there can’t be any denying it, it has to have been a UFO.  I have heard from others in the Ojai Valley that they had had some experiences of the UFO or extraterrestrial kind, though not sounding as clear and present as my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never had an encounter of this sort before.  Even though I knew it was possible, I thought it had to be impossible to happen to me.  I do believe there are other technologically advanced life forms in our universe.  The age of the Universe and the time it has taken for us, alone, to develop to what we are today and know what we can be capable of, is a good enough ratio of time for others to have developed far and beyond what we have accomplished or can imagine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a chance for me to add to the plethora of genuine and growing evidence out there.  I wanted to finally share this to help to bring awareness that there are other beings and forces out there and around us.  I believe that there are those that would harm us, but also those that wish to aid us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully someday we will all be able to witness and know the Truth that has been so well kept through deception and secrecy.  As for my account you can take it or leave it.  I simply would like to add my observance to the collective.  I hope that this will help for further investigation or for confirmation of other eyewitness accounts in this area and beyond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peace be with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
