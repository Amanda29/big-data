My friend and I were on Cambridge st. at Somerset when we heard a loud distant boom high up. Almost as a sonic boom with no echo. At which point, I looked up to the sky and notice a light brighter than a flare but heavier with a much larger volume shining at a point (similar to magnesium oxide strips) with a huge trail of smoke billowing and gathering in huge amounts above it. It seemed like an object moving at a phenomenal rate of speed towards our general area. Probably far from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it long enough to determine it&#39;s size and speed as being quite extraordinary. I looked around neightbouring areas in the sky, noticing multiple trails of smoke starting from a center in a bike wheel pattern. The center moved away from where I had spotted the bright light. I looked back at where I saw the object and it was gone. The centerpoint pattern continued for some time until it dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s what my friend has to say.: Ok let me start of by saying I did not see the part of the event as aforementioned by my friend, but we both heard the loud bang, I thought something very large had exploded. When I looked up to the sky I saw what looked like a hole in the atmosphere, a huge round circle in the sky, bright green and possibly blue in colour patterned like the lines of an iris as in the coloured part of the human eye. It was as if there was a puncture in the sky. All I know is It felt out of place and completely unatural. Hope we aren&#39;t alone in seeing this event, Loosely speaking we are uncertain if this happened in the fall of 2001-2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The color and glow of the lights were odd.I watched them thinking they were just planes. but the longer I watched the stanger they seemed.  They didn&#39;t seem to move in a constant path and the light were red and orange but not like any plane light I have ever seen.  They seemed to disappear only to reappear in a different spot.  I was trying to figure out what the hell they were. as we traveled farther down about ten min I saw another light to the west and then I really started trippin, at the same time my friend mentioned that she to had seen the strange lights up the road but didn,t say anything as well.  We then saw another to the east and noticed the car next to us pointing to the sky as if they to were seeing the same thing. the first thing that came to mind because of the recent world events was that they were military crafts or that we were being invaded I know it sounds funny but they were that strange, and my friend and I are MAJOR skeptics I really got scared because it seemed 2 more were coming from the east. They had some strange red cross like lights on the bottom not all of them but at least 3. We were traveling and could no longer see them but as we reached salinas about 7 or 8 miles down or more I saw another to the east which then disappeared and then reappeared to the west of me and it had the strange red lights to. I don&#39;t know what they were but they were very strange and scared me to death I&#39;m very curious to know if anyone else witnessed these strange lights?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

It caught our attention because it was raining and of course cloudy and we knew it could have not been a star or the moon. When we first sighted it this bright light seemed to be about 2 miles West of us.  As we got closer to it, it seemed to be like the U.F.O. that we always see in the movies, disc like and with many very bright lights around it.  When we finally reached it we passed right under it and seemed to almost look like an airplane except the bottom of the 2 wings each had 3 square windows with very very bright lights.  At first we were joking in the car &#34;oh look that looks like an U.F.O.&#34; and we laughed.  After we passed this object (which was still stationary) about 1/2 mile, we see this object make a semi-circle turn faster than anything I ever seen fly.  All of the sudden this object is again in front of us.  Now we are getting a little scared because this object kept following us.  Every time we made a turn and or passed trees, we would think that we would lose it, or IT lose us and the object again would speed up and catch up to us.  Now we are really scared so we used our cell phone to call the relatives whose home we had just left in Holmdel.  But could you imagine calling your brother-in-law and telling him &#34;we think we are being followed by an U.F.O, please stay on the line until we get home&#34;.  We lost connection but then we called our relatives back and they stayed on the line until we got home.  As soon as we pulled into our driveway in our home in Manalapan this object disappeared and we didn&#39;t see it again.  After 45 mins. of contemplating whether to report this to the police or not, because of course they are going to think that I&#39;m crazy, I finally called the police and they said &#34;we have so many air force activity right now that it was probably something related with the air force.  I&#39;m not an U.F.O. believer nor d! isbeliev er, never cared, I&#39;m a woman with no interest in science or science fiction.  I just want to know what the heck was that?.  Can someone please tell me.<n>

I was on my way back from the gas station when I noticed a spotlight hitting the ground next to my van, wile I was driving. Were I live, they have a lot of police helicopters patrolling the area at night, so I didn&#39;t pay any attention. The light hit my van and as it did I rolled down the window and waved above my van. Even though I could not see what I though might be a police helicopter. I realized something was wrong. I couldn&#39;t here any helicopter blade noise! It was at that time I also noticed that the car behind me had slammed on it breaks and was stopped in the middle of the road a ways back. Also as I passed the intersection I noticed the person stopped at the light had his head hanging out the window and was staring at my van, as I drove bye. By that time the spotlight went out. I looked out my side window and that&#39;s when I saw the dam thing. It couldn&#39;t have been more then 40 feet above my van. It was the size of my van looked spherical. The thing was blinking rapidly about 3 to 4 blinks a sec. a red orange color. But the bottom of it was a real bright greenish blue. The whole thing was lit up. There was a fool moon out that night with a few clouds and you could see this thing as bright as the moon it self! About a sec. After I first saw this thing, it shot out in front of me. I hit the gas and followed it. I was doing about 60 chasing it, when we got to a park that was in that area. It suddenly went right, towards the park and stopped for a minute, above a big tree. I turned in to the parking lot almost flipping my van and grabbed my video camera from under the seat. I started filming! Thank God I had my camera in the car. It slowly drifted southeast. No sound what so ever. There were times it would just shoot off at real high speed and I would have to find it again with my camera. I drove to the end of the parking lot and got some more good footage. When I got there I noticed there were a! lot of people there watching this thing to. They started coming towards me.  I found out they were there in the park for a late birthday party. To my surprise they also had cameras! ! ! We all watched it dart around and accelerate away right in to a cloud. As weird as it sounds, when it did there would be lightning flashes but no thunder!?!? It did this a few times. We could see it go in (flash) then it would come back out for a few minutes. Then it would do it again, then (flash) but still no thunder. Then it just went away. I got every one on video and we all exchanged numbers. I know there were more people that saw this when I while driving, but they drove away in a hurry!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and we find him, and the other co-witnesses to be credible.

After a moment we heard the girls yealling &#34;aliens, Ufo,aliens!&#34; as parents we were listening but thought that the kids were just playing untill the screams got louder.  I walked out from under the yawning to look up and see a object about 1/2 mile above me.  The object that I at first thought was a air ballon was red,blue and yellow with a strobing light inside and was moving very slowly.  I called to the others to come and look.  We all just stood there with our mouths wide open and amazed with the colorful, lighted object. As the object was headed east and now about 1 mile away it begain to move at a 70 degree angle towards the clouds with no smoke or sounds.  At this time my sister remined me that I had a video camra and that I should be recording this. When the object became nothing but what appered to be a flashing plane light it went quickly to the east then immediately to the west heading into the cloud we watched for about a minute or two untill we no longer saw anything.  The storm cloud which it entered then began a strobing type lighting for about one minute then all was clear.  We exchanged info with another gentleman who had also been following this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found her to be a seemingly quite reliable observer.

It was pulsing rapidely It seemed to have a blue or green light on the bottom I could not believe my eyes As I watched the van go through the light it looked to me as if this thing was fallowing the van. What happened next was astounding In fact scared me to the point of panicking I tried to put my car in reverse I could not find the gear. I watched this thing explode a beam of light on to the ground next to the van then the light swept through the van not around it but through it as if it was cutting right in to the metal All I could think of was getting out of there I never drove so fast in my life.

We presume he means September 30.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday, January 30th ((sic??)), 2001, approximate time - 7:15PM The sun had set with only the slightest pale blue afterglow in the West horizon. The sky was perfectly clear with many stars visible. I was out on my back deck with 2 friends having dinner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaning back in my chair admiring the clear night sky when I saw an extremely bright white falling star streak across the Eastern horizon moving incredibly fast toward the south. It was literally only visible for 1 second, but left a long streak across my retina. I remarked excitedly for my 2 friends to look, but it was already too late. It was only because of the falling star that we saw what happened next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next minute we all stood there craning our necks staring at the sky. At this time, there appeared a passenger plane at cruising altitude over to the east, moving slowly towards the NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Literally less than a minute passed before the friend to my immediate left said &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; and pointed straight up. I had been looking toward the East where I saw the shooting star, but I looked straight up and saw what she was talking about. The third person with us never saw anything, because the event was over in just a few seconds, and she never locked on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically, this is what we saw: Directly overhead there was a formation of very pale greenish dots. They appeared to be very high, but immediately looked very strange and unlike anything I had seen before. The lights didn&#39;t appear to be navigation lights, as they weren&#39;t points of light, like on a plane, but actual round shapes. Also, the light itself was very strange, because unlike stars, especially falling stars, and/or lights from a plane, they were very pale against the black sky - almost stealthy. It was as if the objects themselves were glowing, and giving off an eerie glow or haze immediately around each shape, as opposed to having lights on the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shapes were arranged in a wedge formation, with a point craft, and 3 more falling back on the right side at a 45 degree angle, and 1 off the point on the left side at a matching opposed angle. 5 objects total. They were close together, and looked like a formation that fighter jets might have flown in, but nothing (in my opinion) man-made could possibly move that fast, and there was no sonic boom or any other noise from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew in a perfectly straight line heading north. They were moving so fast that they literally flew across the whole sky and out of our sight in less than 4 seconds! It was amazing! To give you a reference, the commercial aircraft literally had moved maybe 3 inches across the sky from our perspective in the time it took these objects to span the entire expanse of the open sky and disappear into the horizon, and it was visible to us for several minutes after the formation vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, we started yelling &#34;Oh my God - did you see that???&#34; and the like, and found out that unfortunately only 2 of us had seen them. We compared what we saw, and every last detail, including the arrangement and color of the objects was identical. I racked my brain to try to figure out what it could have been, but couldn&#39;t think of anything that made sense. If a shooting star hit the atmosphere and broke apart, it is highly unlikely that the peices would have formed a perfectly spaced formation, and would have been bright white in color, like a magnesium fire, not pale green. If it was a missile, again, why the formation and the color? I am sure it wasn&#39;t a plane because of the impossible velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very curious to see if anyone else saw these objects, as it was a warm night and I&#39;m sure there were thousands of people like us out enjoying the weather. Also, the passenger plane was in the vicinity, and flying in a trajectory that would have eventually intersected with the path the formation had flown, so I wondered if they could have seen them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so strange and awesome that I literally was beside myself for a few minutes, but now I am stuck in a rut where I want to tell people that I am pretty sure I saw something unnatural, but am afraid of being ridiculed. I would love to find out what it was if there is an explanation! So there you have it.<n>

At first we thought it was something from the aircraft, but the aircraft veered demonstratably to the northwest while object maintained alitutde and continued in a southwesterly direction.  As we were driving, we commented about stopping to photograph it...we didn&#39;t.  Thought it was something from the plane.  About 5 minutes later, we saw a second object more overhead coming into view...it too was a spherical light with no apparent vapor trail, but was moving to the southwest.  They were not losing nor gaining alititude at this point in time.  Then after about 4 minutes, a third object appeared and was beginging the same southwesterly heading.  Then, a fourth light appeared and the third object changed direction and headed directly for the fourth object.  The closure speed was tremendous and they passed each other closely.  Once passed, the third object ascended vertically at a tremendous rate given the altitude and distance from us.  We continued to observe these until we lost sight of them around 1725 hours.<n>

I told my daughters and wife to come look at the large balloons floating away.  Upon closer inspection,  I noticed that they didn&#39;t look like balloons but rather a bright triangular shaped object with rounded areas on each angle rotating on an axis.  I watched the object for half an hour before it was out of my view.  The course it took was from my East to what appeared to be above the oregon coast at West where it separated into 2 objects and then the 2 objects turned North then Northeast and kept getting a little higher and farther as they disappeared from my view probably above central Washington state.<n>

The location was in south Cypress, Ca.just east of Los Alamitos Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking my dog near the Navy golf course. It was sunny out and the sky was mostly clear except for some cirrus clouds overhead. While my dog was sniffing around a gopher hole in the field, I looked up in the sky directly above me to look at the clouds,when I noticed a bright object that looked like a star sitting there among the clouds.  It was in blue, slightly hazy sky.  It actually was a little larger in appearance than a star. More like a small silvery disk. The pecular thing about it was that it was not moving at all.!!  Yet the cirrus clouds were moving to the east, they were drifting past the object while it remained in its exact spot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch the object,it occurred to me that it was too late in the morning for a star to be visible in the sky. Stars disappear shortly after sunrise. Thi object looked slightly larger than the star Sirius, but more like a metal disk than an actual star.  It looked silver in color.  It would brighten somewhat then dim in a regular pattern, about every few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this object for around 15 to 20 minutes.It did not move that entire time.My dog was getting impatient so I started walking while still looking up to watch the object.  All the time I watched it, it did not move from its location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An occasional cirrus cloud would drift over it, sometimes obscurring it from view. This gave me the impression that the object was at least 40,000 feet high,since I think that is about how high cirrus clouds occur at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I stood in the field,the object was overhead at about 70-80 degrees elevation  and at a direction of approximately 10-20 degrees east of true north.  Finally, it was obscurred completely by thicker clouds and that was the last that I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Baloon would have drifted with the clouds. This object remained in that spot.  It definately looked metalic, though very far away.There was no sound that I could discern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the terrorist event of 911 just having occurred a few weeks before this sighting,my mind was not preparred to deal with this wierd event, so I put it in the  back of my mind.  Recently I was reading reports on your website and this experience of mine jumped back to my remembrance. I hope this is of interest!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We watched outside the back of my parents house these lights flashing white at first, then blueish green, then it started to flash red.  At that point it moved up and down in the sky and from side to side.  We foundly made our way outside to get a better look at the object.  Well at that point it had moved it location from the back of the house to the front over to a field.  Then it was about 8 to 10 miles up in the sky so it was very close for us to see.  We stood and watched this object for over a half hour or so.  It still seemed to move from place to place but kept in the same location this time with the flashing light still going on.  Then a white beam seemed to come out of the top of the craft in a searching formation at that time the object got very bright white in color.  It was very quiet what ever it was there was no sound at all from this craft.  Also when it was in the back of the house it had little red flashing light flying up to the object craft very fast there was about 6 flashing small light that seemed to be very close to the craft in the back of the house floating up inside maybe?  It was a very clear night and we can see all the stars what I found the most unsual about it was it was it was between Orions Belt and also Sirus.  As it was sitting from these two star consolations it was in the shape of a triangle the object being the center of the triangle.<n>

I was toweling off when a fast moving &#39;golden flash&#39; caught my eye.  I looked up and saw two extremely fast moving objects flying through the sky coming towards my North Phoenix home (trajectory was southwest headed northeast). However, the objects flew on a heading to the northwest. As the objects flew past my home, I saw a third light (object?), also golden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects resembled chaffe or flares, but they were not falling.  They were moving horizontally and at an extremely fast clip..  They appeared to be flying in a very tight bunch. I expected the objects to fall towards the earth, but they elevated at that time.  I then went inside to see if any explosions had been reported in the area.  I checked the net &amp; televised news.  Nothing at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediate thoughts: Shooting stars (much too close to the ground), asteroids/space debris...errant missles from an F-16 (Luke Air Force Base is located in the direction that the objects came from, approx. 15 miles from my home). I must point out that I&#39;ve seen F-16&#39;s at night and during the day. A friend used to work on them at Luke. The objects were in no way near the size of an F-16.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did I see traditional form to the matter that passed by. No wings, smoke or trailing airstreams. However, the objects were moving so fast that the gold color trailed. One other peculiarity, there was no sound at all. I live in a sleepy residential area and at 1:05 AM, I should have heard something from objects so close to the ground. Believe me, I am 42 and have never seen anything like this.  I have never seen a UFO, nor do I feel that I saw one (classical sense) tonight.  What I did see was something extraordinary.<n>

Then we noticed flashing lights; red, green and white (or yellow).  Object was stationary for about 45 minutes and then seemed to slowly drop slightly in the sky and then again become stationary.  Through binoculars we could see the lights clearly flashing in a clockwise pattern, and at times seem to speed or slow up.  Object also seemed to turn to face different directions, at least it appeared to as it looked like the lights sometimes were aimed in different directions.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the sighting is not inconsistent with the many reports we receive of celestial bodies, principally &#34;twinkling&#34; stars.  However, a celestial body in the northeast sky would not descent, it would appear to rise and move to the right slowly, as the Earth rotates.  Without triangulation, or a star chart, however, this is only a guess.  PD))<n>

The time was 20:10 local, 01:10 Z. I was driving, my wife was in the passenger&#39;s seat. The night was crystal clear and there were many planes in the landing pattern for Houston Intercontintal (IAH) which was about 7 miles to the  due East.  My wife observed the object 30 degrees above the horizon to the NNW first going level and then instantly changing course downward at a 30 degree angle until it disappeared at the tree line.  I saw the object (apparently) after the course change, and it took a couple of seconds to go from an elevation of 30 degrees to the tree line.  My wife describes the object as a &#34;yellow orange glowing object.&#34;  My description is of a sliver, not bright, yellow orange, which was sort of pinched at either end.  Frankly, it looked a little like the illuminated passenger cabin of an airliner.  However, at the angle and location in question, and considering the high speed of the object, it was not an airliner unless it crashed.  I opened the sunroof and listened for sirens---nothing.  As a VN veteran with many thousands of aircraft seen in the dark in the Tonkin Gulf, I understand strange stuff in the air at night.  This was not a plane unless it crashed just north of Houston tonight.<n>
9/29/01 19:00|Las Vegas|NV|Other|20 min.|Black triangular shape object tracking stealy across the sky.|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19692.html|26|ndxe200109| Black triangular shape object tracking stealy across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday September 29, 2001 I was in my back yard looking at the few stars in the early night sky in Las Vegas Nevada. As I was looking toward the south I saw what appeared to be a grouping of helium balloons that some child must have lost. However, as I began to track this object across the sky it became apparent that my first impression was wrong. The object definitely appeared to be at a higher altitude than any normal helium balloon that a child would have released might be. At this point I brought this object to the attention of my father who it an experienced meteorological technician. He has worked for the Department of Commerce as part of the National Weather Service for almost 40 years. He tracks weather balloons almost every day. Taking that into consideration I assumed that he would have a theory as to what this object might be. We retrieved binoculars from our house so we could take a closer look at this object. On closer inspection of the object it appeared to have balloons at the top supporting a black triangular shape at the bottom. The balloons also seemed to be illuminated by a very dim light. The strange thing about this object was the balloons did not appear to be big enough or strong enough to support such a large object. We also confirmed that this was not a weather balloon. As I mentioned previously my father, who is an experienced weather observer, observed this object as I did and he was absolutely positive that it was not a weather balloon. We watched this object track to the southwest at a steady pace at about 20-30 knots. It appeared to be at an altitude of 10 to 15 thousand feet. It did not appear to descend or climb at all during the 20 min. we observed this object. We were both very perplexed and had no theory as to what this object might have been. After my father, a person who has observed the skies for 40 years, had no theory as to what this object might have been I considered worth reporting.<n>

Toward hwy 33 in Ventura. I noticed a light in the ski that wasnt moving. It was long and streght like a bar. It stayed there without moving. I could not tell the size but it had to be very large comparing the distance it was away from me. I called my daughter out to look at it as well just to conferm that i was not just seeing things. She saw it also. I then started to slowly get smaller and smaller still in the same spot then it disapered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to work on the following Monday and told a co-worker of my experiance and she said she saw it also on Wed. 26, 2001 while she was laying on the beach sometime mid-day. She said it was over the Ventura Mountain Range. I was the same shape, a light in the shape of a long bar.<n>

What&#39;s that! Look!!&#34;  I looked up to where he was pointing and it was obviously some shaped like a disk (saucer), we saw the curve to it perfectly, and it had a series of six or seven red lights on it. It was flying through the sky somewhat slowly, but we had to run to keep up with it so we wouldn&#39;t loose it behind some trees. There were NO clouds out except for a few that were obvious to the eye, but there were none around the object. We couldnt hear anything that would have made it an airplane and it was moving too flawlessly to be an airplane. We watched it for nearly a minute, and then it just dissappeared. It was so beautiful!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may mean approximately midnight on the evening of 28SE01.  We have changed the time here.

This sighting took place on Friday night September 28, 2001.   I might also add that one of the friends with me was an active FBI agent and also the driver of the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were coming out of Richmond, Virginia at approximately 11:00 PM on the above date when we approached exit 58 on the southbound side of Interstate 95. On one side to the west is state route 150 with high tension electrical lines on the east running parallel to I-95 and (under construction at the time) to the west is  Interstate 895 overpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sighted a very odd flying object going from west to east.  What was strange about this is that the object had come in UNDER the electrical lines and was lit up in very bright white lights. The shape was that of a sailor’s cap. This object couldn’t have been 75 feet overhead. The vehicle was maybe 25 feet square and10-12 feet tall.  We had pulled onto the side of the road to watch this spectacle which had also attracted the attention of several vehicles on the northbound side of I-95.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered over the roadway’s columns for a few minutes and then very slowly headed east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen pictures of lots of different shapes of UFOs, but I have never seen or heard of anything like this. Do you have any ideas? We didn’t have a camera or video camera to take pictures of this. All three of us have discussed this several times and agree to what we saw.<n>

If others have information about this sighting report, we urge them to contact Mr. Sheets directly at the e-address, &lt;mufonofga1@yahoo.com&gt;.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> On 15Feb02, this SD was contacted by a witness known to the writer.  He stated that an incident had occurred the previous year in his home and that he had been trying to determine exactly what it involved, but to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In response to his request, an on-site inspection, an interview and an investigation was began on 11March02.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness is a 20+ year veteran police officer employed by a major South Fulton County  police agency and has been professionally known to this writer for at least 15 years.  The witness is a former nuclear submariner for the U.S. Navy with all of the attendant training, qualifications, clearances and certifications.  After his naval service, the witness served as a Georgia State Trooper until he decided on municipal police work in order to be able to reside and work in one particular place i.e. no moving around in a far flung region of the state.  This witness spent many years of his municipal career in a particularly dangerous aspect of law enforcement.  His hobbies include traveling the USA with his wife to visit our numerous national parks and photographing other scenic outdoor resorts and vistas, and working with his PC.  The witness lives in a nice middle class neighborhood a few minutes drive south of Hartsfield International Airport.  During the years of this writer&#39;s professional association with the witness, he was observed under pressure and in emergency situations on many occasions.  The witness was never known to over-react, loose his professional demeanor or demonstrate any type of improper conduct when dealing with the public or criminal suspects who were often violent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event site is his home, a well-kept split (tri) level, 3 bedroom house with a substantial wire fenced backyard, the home facing west on a generally N-S suburban street.  The rear fencing is extensive, with the backyard enclosed by four foot wire fence, with numerous wire sub-fencing within in order to make a dog run, and divide off areas for plants and patio-type yard fixtures.  Numerous large boulders outcrop the soil in the rear, and this is evident in other nearby yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interview was conducted on 11March02 in the witness&#39; living room.  He was calm and related the experience in a clear and concise manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He stated that on 28Sept01, between 9:30 and 10:00PM, he had turned in and was going to sleep as he had to work the next day.  He and his wife sleep in separate bedrooms due to their sometime conflicting work schedules, furthermore that she was downstairs watching TV.  Their cat was laying on the foot of the bed as is normal.  He heard the cat make a growling sound, which was unusual, so he rolled over to see what that was all about.  He then observed a (very) white in color rectangular light hovering over his bed, but a few feet up towards the ceiling and ceiling fan (fan was not in operation).  Witness indicated this light put him to mind of a shoebox-top in shape, perhaps 6&#34;x12&#34;, and appeared like a silent white window just hanging there above the bed, but not giving off any light that would illuminate the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He sat up and reached out to touch it, but it moved away slightly, but maintaining a general position of about 1/2 of the way between the bed and ceiling. He continued to watch it, then reached over to turn on the night table lamp immediately next to the bed (see photos), but could not find it, as if the table and lamp were gone.  He then reached out for the chest of drawers and did not feel that either. After a bit of reaching around, the lamp was found and turned on.  The rectangular light promptly vanished.  Witness said it seemed like there was absolutely nothing in the room during the few moments he was groping around for the lamp, and this was quite disconcerting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Sidebar:  In previous months this officer had been working at night and sleeping in the daytime, so he had covered every square inch of each bedroom window with tin foil so he could day-sleep in total darkness.  This window covering was left completely intact when he had changed shifts and remained so on the night of this event. He double checked this, thinking that perhaps errant light was leaking from an outside source, but his coverings were still intact i.e. no leaking light incoming).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the lamp was on and the rectangle had vanished, he got up and went downstairs and related the experience to his wife, and they talked for about 30 minutes.  He then returned to bed and after turning out the light, the white rectangle made a reappearance in the same location.  Witness then sat up and was able on this occasion to stick his finger through the light, learning that it had no heat, no apparent depth, only height and width.  He then moved his hand around the light to double check for an outside light leak, and discovering none, put his finger into the light again.  At that point the light seemed to break into &#34;a million small specks&#34; and quickly vanished and did not return.  He added that during the time of the event, he was not ill, had not been taking medication of any sort and was in as generally good health as a moderate smoker could be. He did note that within a few days of this occurrence, he had 3 fluorescent lights to burn out on the same day and thought this to be unusual.  No other unusual electrical problems had  been noted in the home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During additional conversation, the witness said his only contact with anything odd, or seemingly anomalous, was during some photo taking in an underground cave in New Mexico.  When their photos were developed, they noticed some floating semi-transparent &#39;orbs&#39; on the photos.  We discussed the fact that some researchers, including our paranormal associates in Georgia, had determined these &#39;orbs&#39; most likely were caused by particles of dust, debris, pollen, or moisture floating in close proximity to the camera and were out of focus, then highly illuminated by the flash unit.  Witness said he&#39;d heard that discussed on TV documentaries.  This writer offered up another opinion regarding the fact that some persons were just more &#39;sensitive&#39; regarding various paranormal phenomena, which seemed to occur in and around them more often than others.  The witness has an interest in such matters, and has read extensively in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness prepared a sketch of the rectangular light using computer graphics and forwarded recently taken photographs of his home and property .  He also completed and signed a MUFON Form #1.  This writer took additional photos of the bedroom and it&#39;s contents, as well as the yard.  These will be electronically added to the CMS Form at a later date.  The wife of witness did not observe the above described phenomenon, but in essence recalled the same scenario i.e. being downstairs watching TV, her husband coming down and speaking with her about the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness did state that there had been a severe lightning strike to the fence in back on an earlier date some years before.  The lightning bolt running through all of the fencing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ASD Ralph Howard, a professional geologist and Georgia&#39;s science officer, was contacted and made aware of this investigation.  He scheduled a geological survey of the witness property due to the large amount of rock structure that appears to be just under the surface soil.  (See this geology report to be added to the FIs CMS report in the near future).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In checking sources for similar events, this writer reviewed William R. Corliss&#39; &#39;Remarkable Luminous Phenomena In Nature-Catalog of Geophysical Anomalies&#39;.  While his descriptions of some forms of ball lightning, luminous aerial bubbles, and low-level nocturnal lights might be slightly similar to this matter, nothing described therein possesses the perfect geometric rectangular form as illustrated and described by the witness.  Of course ball lightning has reportedly been observed to enter an enclosure or dwelling, but it&#39;s conduct in doing so is radically different from what was observed in this case, and not geometrically perfect in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While there were no instruments available on the day of this writer&#39;s on-scene examination, there would certainly be the possibility of an electro-magnetic field in the vicinity of the bedroom ceiling due to the ceiling fan&#39;s electric motor and built-in three bulb lighting fixture, however the fan and light WAS NOT in operation at time of the event.  As stated, the witness noticed no abnormal electrical problems in the home except for the previously mentioned burn-out of three fluorescent bulbs in various rooms on the same day, a few days later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the witness was in overall good health, the &#39;Electric Power Research Institute&#39; and &#39;International Association of Certified Home Inspectors&#39; describe certain health issues sometime associated with EM fields in the home.  One being Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity that could manifest in allergy-like conditions, or else a physiological disorder which might include neurological symptoms.  The witness did confirm that he also spent a moderate amount of time working with his computers, being something of an amateur computer bug. He described no type of personal condition that would lead one to suspect he suffered from such EM Hypersensitivity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Sidebar:  Information from the above two professional organizations regarding ceiling fans and other small appliances.......that the EM field RAPIDLY becomes weaker with distance from the source........gaging ceiling fans on a strength scale.....at 1 foot--a rating of 50; at 2 feet--a rating of 6; at 4 feet--a rating of 1.  According to this scale, the strength of the EM field does in fact drop off RAPIDLY as the distance is increased).<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the course of this investigation in the early spring of 2002, physicist Dr. Eric Davis of NIDS became aware of this inquiry via our thumbnail posting in Filer&#39;s Files.  He contacted this writer due to his work in quantum teleportation and researching traversable wormholes in the form of a &#39;Stargate&#39;.  This writer forwarded certain information to Dr. Davis regarding this event and Davis asked that the witness also provide him with an account via the NIDS citizen reporting form.  The witness agreed and prepared his account for submission.  He had extreme difficulty getting the NIDS data base to accept his account and finally gave up in frustration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, we did not know that NIDS was downsizing and Bob Bigelow preparing to close down NIDS and pursue aerospace operations.  Dr. Davis, along with his colleagues, was released from service at NIDS.  Davis then contracted as an adviser to the USAF Research Lab&#39;s Advanced Concept Office, later forming his own company &#39;Warp Drive Metrics&#39;.  We were unable to reach Dr. Davis after that, and NIDS was out of business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer has rejected the possibility that the witness experienced a hallucination or entered a spontaneous altered state of consciousness or underwent a mystical episode in the &#39;Alpha State&#39; that precedes sleep i.e rejected because the phenomenon was observed twice, about 30 minutes between each event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on all of the above, and this investigator&#39;s knowledge of the witness&#39; personality, integrity and seriousness, this event is classified as an &#39;Unknown-Other&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom Sheets, Chief of Police (Retired), State Director-MUFON of Georgia Ralph Howard, P.G., ASD MUFON of Georgia<n>

I got my binnoculars to get a better look, and it looked as if it were something coming through and burning in the atmosphere.  I could vaguely make out a small dark spot at the front core, but the rest of it looked like a huge fireball with &#34;tails&#34; or &#34;trails&#34; coming from either side.  I watched it continue to travel to the east until it went behind the clouds.  I am not saying it was a flying saucer, because it didn&#39;t look like one... no metal object, just a huge fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just curious as to what it was, if anyone has information.<n>

We were sitting at a bon fire I got up to go to the bathroom. I was looking up into the sky and I noticed a lite out of the corner of my eye. The light wasn&#39;t moving it was just sitting in the woods. I thought it was just another house. Then it flickered bright lights at even intervals. I called to my other two friends and to show them what was in the woods.  The owner of the farm said that their wasn&#39;t another house for about 3 miles. We decided to check it out. The lights were about 300 yards away.  We walked for a while as we got to 100 yards the lights started to flicker at different intervals. Some red flashes came about every 15 seconds.  As we got closer we could see that it was some sort of object. It was Long and cigar shaped it looked as if it was made out of stainless steel. Their were no markings or windows. there wasn&#39;t even any noise.As we got within 50 yards it started to move forward. As we followed it the object started to raise up into the air as it hit the top of the tree line the lights shut off. It still had a faint luminus glow. Then it accelerated beyond our view in a southwest direction.<n>

Noticed a very rapidly moving light traveling southeast. At first thought it might be a meteor, but when it did not burn up, I jumped out of my chair and watched it disappear into the moonlight.  A few minutes later, saw another light traveling southeast. No sounds heard. Estimate altitude at perhaps hundreds to several thousand feet.  I have seen sattelites before but these lights traveled at a much greater speed.  We watched at least 20 of these pass by traveling in various directions over the course of an hour until we went to bed. They would change directions abruptly making very sharp turns and appearing to slow down and speed up as well. Also saw one light travel south to north overhead at about double the speed of the other objects.   We had a pair of binoculars and were able to follow some of the objects but could not gain any clearer resolution. There were no flashing lights or colors.  We would see only 1 light at a time, never in pairs or groups like you would expect with birds. We would see several objects per minute and other times would see no objects for 5 or so minutes.  The size of the objects I would have to estimate as being anywhere from the size of a star to the size a planet looks like in the night sky.  This is at least my third sighting of unknown objects in my 36 years.  I have also seen previously, triangle shaped craft. Will be looking again tonight<n>

As i was pullinginto the driveway I noticed a glowing ball falling toward the ground about 100 ft in the distance. That area happens to be an open field set aside as a future transportation corridor. I watched as the object slowly descended into the field and out of sight. I exited the car and heard a dog start barking off in the distance in that area. The color was a yellowish-green as I recall. It was not a roman candle or other fireworks display as best I could tell. There was no one else present as far as I could tell.<n>

The photo was taken at Arches National Park at around 7:30 or 8:00 pm (not completely dark yet) when I stopped the car to take a picture of a beautiful rock formation with the almost full moon in the sky.  I only noticed the object after the film from the vacation was developed, and even then, it took about 3 or 4 times looking at the photos to even spot it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is only one object in the photo.  It is positioned in the upper left-hand corner of the picture of rock formations and the almost full moon.  It appears to be  disk shape with the faint appearance of a dome.  It appears to be gray or silver in color.  It appears to have some type of illumuniation around the circumference.  There were no sounds that caught my attention while taking the photo.  The sky was very clear, without any clouds, and it was nearly dark.  The weather was warm and comfortable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the photo.  PD))<n>

It was a few degrees brighter than Venus when I first noticed it.  Moving diagonally downward toward the west, it began to lose intensity.  I thought it was a shooting star at first, but then before it lost all of its light, it curved upwards and diminished.  I put the hose down and kept my eyes on the spot from which I had last seen it.  Then, approximately 5 seconds later, it reappeared as a faded point and increased in brightness until it was again the intensity I had first seen.  Its path was again in the shape of an &#39;S&#39; lying on its side.  As it curved upward and began to lose its brightness, I noticed a halo around the dimming spot.  It almost looked like an object at this point, (as opposed to a star radiating light). It then disappeared and I saw nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observe the sky a lot, and I don&#39;t have an explainaion for it.  I told a friend on Saturday about what I had seen, and he mentioned hearing of a reported sighting on the Thursday night 10:00 local news.  I didn&#39;t see the report myself, so I&#39;m afraid the only facts I have are listed above.  If there is any information on this event, I would like to find out more.<n>

Every six seconds they would pulse to form one light in the middle and then go back to their four positions (square shape.) They seemed very low in the sky or else they were extremely large. I caught some interesting pictures. The lightning was flashing horizontally in the far background, the lights were directly over my yard and the neighbor&#39;s yard, when the lightning reached out like a pitchfork twice straight towards my window and these 4 objects.  It was like something out of a movie! I have been wondering about what the heck this was for a year now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I know it was not a single triangular craft, since they did not blot out the background stars. The formation was an almost perfect &#34;V&#34;, two of the lights were slightly out of line with the rest. They did not make a sound, nor did they seem to affect my visibility of the stars they passed. The lights were pale and steady and did not blink or change color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to guesstimate the altitude, but I&#39;ll say perhaps 25,000 feet. They moved fast, the formation entered my vision near Monoceros, went through outer Orion and faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aircraft schedules have become a bit strange since the WTC incident. We are in the LAX flight path here. Of course I understand these may have just been fighter jets heading for March or El Toro/San Diego.<n>

I guess it would have been about 10-15 degree south, south east of the zenith of the sky. The flashes were about 5 minutes apart.  This would have happened about 21:45 hours.  The moon was slightly obscured by scattered clouds, but there seemed to be a straight line of clouds just above the moon, and than above that open sky.  I just happened to look away and than look back at the moon.  5 or 6 lights, dots, red bluish, whites light in the form of a boomerang, or wing, with what appeared to be 3 or 4 dots/lights on one side (east) and 1, possibly 2 on the right hand side (west side).  What I thought odd was how fast, smooth and how they moved without loosing their altitude or grouping.   The dots did not disappear behind the cloud; rather they disappeared into the sky. My watch read 22:00hrs MST. I am not much of a stargazer, but this did catch my attention.  The dots seemed to come from the north or above me very quickly, but clearly, very clearly.<n>

Came to a &#34;T&#34; in the road by church/cemetery.  Thats when I looked up and noticed a triangular aircraft hovering at about as high as a telephone pole.  There was a light at each corner.  Not bright lights.  One was red, one was blue, one was yellow - the primary colors.  The craft zigged and stopped at an awkward angle at a higher altitude.  This happened one more time, then it just sorta faded away - disappeared.  It didnt shoot off, it faded like pulled a cloak over itself.  I tried chasing it, but, it didnt work.  I noticed some bright lights in the distance, East I believe.  I went to check them out and got as close as I could (in my car) and saw that they were six apache helicopters.  I know they were apache helicopters because of my military training.  The choppers wouldnt let me get close, they would veer away.  As I watched, they seemed to be searching the fields for something.  Earlier that night I was in the country looking at the sky and noticed what looked like stars zigging and zagging about the sky.  Definitely not any sort of commercial aircraft.  I have some friends who have also witnessed such a craft, but, had never told anyone until I told what happened to me.  They too said it had first been noticed at the graveyard.  Human or extraterrestrial I do not know.  What I do know is that this is real.  The triangle, the apache&#39;s, the zig zagging stars - Oh and I almost forgot, my kick ass car stereo all of the sudden wouldnt pick up any stations, are all real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

I was in the north wing (radiology dept.) at Sunbury community hospital (Snyder county (central) Pennsylvania) where I work. I am an avid &#34;skyfisher&#34; with my camcorder and enjoy sky watching. I was looking (as i do throughout the day) for &#34;odd&#34;/chemtrail activity but instead saw two unusual objects. The more stationary of the two was larger and seemed  to exhibit no anomalous motion. approximate range seemed to be about at least 2-4 miles. Clear blue skys (for once ;). The smaller object appeared to be moving southeast at about double the speed of the first. The larger object appeard brighter than the smaller, mobile object. My impression was that of two mylar ballons catching the sun, but why at that range would one move consistantly away from the other at twice the speed, while the other remained relatively motionless? Since it&#39;s been 19 years since i last saw a &#34;UFO&#34; i called two associates who saw the same thing. Since one is a smoker and was going out for a smoke break i asked her to look for them from outside, to no avail.

Hope to correlate potential sighting with other PA skywatchers during this time.  Somewhat skeptical of actual saucer since no overt contraindiction of modern Physics was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peace!   ((e-address deleted))  Are you going?<n>

9/25/01 04:20|Fountain Hills|AZ|Triangle|10=15 seconds|Dark unlit aircraft passes at low altitude|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19670.html|53|ndxe200109| Dark unlit aircraft passes at low altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the patio of my apartment enjoying the quiet of the early morning, the sky and the stars.  Suddenly a small cloud appeared directly to my north.  I thought where did that come from since it was a cloudless night.  Then I noticed it was moving and realized it couldn&#39;t be a cloud.  As I followed the movement it became black against the dark sky moving south directly toward me.  There were no lights visible on the aircraft.  It was moving in a direct flight path.  As it passed overhead at an altitude of not more than 1,000 feet, I leaned over the wall of my patio to see the reflection of the lights in our parking lot hit the bottom of the aircraft.  It refkected a dark gray metal and v-shaped.  I cannot positively say it was triangular.  There was absolutely no sound as it passed overhead nor afterward.  My thoughts were &#34;What the hell was that thing?&#34; As I sat contemplating what I had so quickly witnessed, I thougt at first it might be a glider plane. In the wake of recent events, I thought maybe the terrorists are going to use gliders next.  But even gliders make a noise as they swish by!  Then I thought of how the object must have appeared as a cloud at first.  Our town has no street lights.  It is relatively dark.  One half mile away there is a small plaza with a lit parking area amd a senior apartment complex with a lit parking area.  This craft must have reflected those lights as it passed over. When it passed over the empty lot across the street was when it beame black on black.  I did not report this to anyone as I was waiting to here of another siting by someone. But this has been preying on my mind all week.  I don&#39;t think a military craft would be permitted to fly so low with no lights over a populated area.  I don&#39;t even know if we have silent aircraft.  That is what I question most of all was the silence and no lighting.<n>

I didn&#39;t hear a noise, there wasn&#39;t much traffic but I could hear no noise from the sky. My girlfriend ((name deleted)) saw it too, we watched it and was thinking what is it? Is it a helicopter, like the police helicopter, but ti wasn&#39;t, was it a radio controlled toy or something? I don&#39;t think so, it looked too big.<n>

They could not clearly see what it was, but first they thought it was a helicopter. The UFO came in very low from the south. The police still considers it as a UFO as they so far hasn’t been able to find any other explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Scared The witnesses explained that the object or part of the object rotated around its own axes. They went out of the car to have a better view, but jumped back inside as it looked like the object was going to crash in the midtown. They experienced the situation as threatening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound. What originally looked like a helicopter was completely silent. After looking like it would crash it changed direction and flew out the Vefsn fjord and disappeared. As the witnesses thought it had crashed in the fjord they went to the police to report an accident. They could see the object as long as a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the police got the report they immediately sent policemen out to find the area of ”the crash”, and prepared to send out ambulances and medical personnel. “Hovedredningssentralen i Bodø” which is the offical headquarter for accidents at sea were, were alarmed and preparing for action. Forces were out in boats and walking the shores to look for debris. Nothing was found and the search ended at 04.00 am. Search was started again Monday morning (24th).

We were 10 minutes West of Junction, TX. I was watching the sky and saw a black craft flying high above. I tried viewing it with a 7x35 binoculors but could not get a detailed image, it was blurry and the thing was moving fast. I could only view for around 7 seconds. It wasn&#39;t up as high as jetliners normally fly, and was definately moving quick. It seemed to have picked up speed as I watched it. Was definately very black in color. Was up above some of the fluffy clouds in the sky. It was a very nice, sunny day. I was headed East, it was moving West. I was sitting in the passenger seat of the car. We were travelling 70 mph. Looked oval/round in shape.<n>

The size of one of the ships would be relevent to the distance of your index finger and your middle finger spread out.  Though the sun was very bright, and we could only see the two objects in the shade, they seemed to be very high up in the atmosphere.  But what puzzles me, is that the objects nevertheless took an half an hour to leave sight, but they didn&#39;t leave any after burn trail at all like our aircrafts do.  On the two objects the lights seem to be a very bright color, not determined because of the brightness of the day, but they seemed to be a bright white, all six in unison.  That is all I saw, then went back to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar report from co-worker in Bothell, WA, who saw the same formation.

Because we work in a shoping complex we have other stores to our right and left. When my coworker went out back a cavilian who was using the laundry mat next door and came out back to take a break. The cavilian noticed the formation and pointed them out to my coworker who promptly came to tell me and my other coworker. We all went out back to check this out because the sun is blocked by the buildings. We (12 of us because some more people came to see what the commotion was about) looked up and origonaly saw nothing untill we squinted and saw three lights in triangle formation. We then looked just barely south of it and saw three more lights in the same formation (a triangle formation). Both crafts were moving from South to North. It was hard to see because of the smog and dust from the local freeway, but no doubt this was the reall stuff. In all there was about 12 of us because more people came out to see what was going on. Hey, if you&#39;ve seen something like this post a messege. This is cool and creapy at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the correct time of the sighting is 5:30 p.m..

Your explanation of these objects was that they were balloons. I live in Woodinville (a mere 3 miles away from Bothell) and balloons go over my house about every other day. These balloons frequently fly above my house at a very low altitude (somewhere in the margin of 250 feet) and there is usually 1 at a time in the sky, and they never fly in the full darkness, so i find it hard to belive that those objects could be the balloons.

They were located between Stone Mountain and Snellville, GA at that time. The object had a forked white tail that resembled that of a comet. The head of the object was pencil point size and the forked tail about 2 inches long and the width of a pencil at arm&#39;s length. It appeared to traveling downward and took approximately 30 seconds to pass from overhead to below the horizon. They didn&#39;t hear any noise.<n>

A group of six of us were gathered after church at one of their homes.  Four of us had stepped out into the back yard to smoke (cigarettes).  I was watching an airliner fly through the sky about 1000 Ft or more in altitude and noticed a bright/shiney round object sitting what appeared to be stationary well above and N.W. of the passenger jet.  I asked the others what they thought it could be and asked for some binoculars to view it better.  Most said that it must be a balloon.  It was to hard to see clearly what it was even through the binoculars.  It did look circular in shape.  Several of us took turns with the binocs. to see if we could make out what it was.  It remained stationary the whole time we watched it, not moving up, down or horizontally.  As one of the others was looking through the binocs. I began to scan the sky and saw another airliner heading North at what appeared to be a normal flying altitude of maybe 2000 Ft. plus.  Then all of a sudden I noticed a formation of seven Bright/shiney oval objects as large as the airliner, flying South far above the airliner.  These objects had a bright sheen to them, almost like a &#34;halo&#34; around them.  Again I brought this to everyones attention and most dismissed these as military aircraft doing manuvers, geese or something else.  The odd thing about this formation was it looked like a lower case &#34;y&#34; flying sideways, tail first and that at the altitude these were flying they were still as large as the airliner.  Also noteably peculiar was that three of these craft rotated/changed positions in the formation with relative ease.  That is to say that they dropped out of formation, dropped back behind the others, then moved to their new position with ease.  Very fluid and quick  movements, which seems a strange ability considering their size.  Their rate of speed was no faster than normal airliners as a formation.  After the formation left our view I returned my attention to the area where we ob! served t he &#34;balloon&#34; and it was no longer in view.  The whole time this transpired was no more than 10 minutes.  Our group consisted of various ages and backgrounds.  As for me, I am prior military, 44 years old, and definately keeping a closer watch on our skys.  These are not the first peculiar aircraft I have sighted or reported.  I am one that tends not to speculate to much as to where these unusual craft come from.  I believe they are made by &#34;man&#34; until proven otherwise.  Just seems strange that with all these different objects flying around, how is it that the &#34;men&#34; who makes them or flys them hasn&#39;t bragged about it or &#34;let the cat out of the bag&#34; so to speak?<n>

I was focusing on Mars when she said &#34;hey look at that star&#34;, &#34;it moved&#34;. I looked over to the West and saw a very bright star like object fall roughly 1/2 mile to the tree line and go exactly back up to the same spot. I said &#34;did you see that?&#34; my wife said &#34;good, you saw it too!&#34; I put my telescope on it to see the object better. It looked like a yellow orange sphere that pulsated with a bright white light almost like a heart beat. There was a extemely bright band of moving full spectrum rainbow light which encompassed the object and flopped around like a Lazurus sign wave, the &#34;O&#34; shape. After watching for a few minutes we noticed a jet moving towards it from the NorthEast, then we noticed another jet coming from the SouthWest. At this time the object moved straight up about a mile and the jets passed under it. Then another jet passed under coming from the North. Then the object flew further West and it was a much smaller dot in the sky. I then remembered I had a video camera in the camp trailer. I did video tape it but it didn,t show up very well with the digital zoom so I tried focusing thru the eyepiece of the telescope. Due to some more movement by the object and myself shivering from the cold night air I didn&#39;t get much good footage, but there is about 1-3 seconds where you can see the image fairly good. Your can definately tell that the object is pulsating in multiple colors. We watched do manuevers from the same distance off and on until 11:30pm (23:50)We had to go inside our trailer to warm up about 1/2 hour of each hour. The manuevers were geometric patterns like squares and triangles and some occasional full circles. About 11:15pm I saw it perform a loop type of manuever and then another bright object came from the South and did a loop and stopped very close to the other one. They then flew futher North West looking like one bright object. I did notice jets going by a few more times (atleast 3 times but only 1 or 2 at a time) during the rest of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hesitated to report this until I read that other people in Colorado saw the same object that night. I mean we hardly believe it and we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a upside down black pyramid shaped UFO in 1982 and reported on this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can send a video copy and drawing.<n>

I went back to bed. Just as I pulled the sheets up, I heard a second, same kind of noise. To be descriptive, it sounded as if someone has put a tupperware container in a microwave oven and left the lid on which caused a plastic sounding explosion/bang, but ten times the noise. I covered my ears after each explosion it was so loud. My cat was obviously distrubed and immediately headed for the basement. After the second explosion I looked out front and saw most of the nieghbors in the area turning on their porch lights and looking around outside.

It’s about 25 miles south of Denver Colorado with a great view. I had just turned on to the rode that took you up to the park and had been on it for about 5 minutes when I noticed the surrounding area around my car blinking red. I knew that this light was not coming from my car so I looked up and that is when I saw it was about 20 feet across like a sphere and blinked rapidly faster then a plain would blink and was the prettiest red orange color and it seemed to fallow my van. I had a video camera that I keep with me, and I got some shots off. What happened next surprised even me. There were a lot of people up at this night watch. Watching as the thing followed my van and flew right over everyone.

I turned around and suddenly noticed a multi colored red, orange and yellow glowing and strobing orb float by, going east to west. Right over everyone that was standing there. I said, “ WHAT THE HELL IS THAT”! One of my friends responded with, “I DON’T KNOW”! At that point I pulled some blue lights out of my pocket that were attached to a key chain, turned them on and started swinging them over my head hoping to get the orb’s attention. When I did so it seemed to move up and away from me. By that point the other members of the group started to chase after me saying “stop that” we don’t want that thing coming here. Then my friend ((name deleted)) (Stan’s ((deleted))) said I’m surprised Stan isn’t here there always around where he is! Right at that moment Stan walked up. I asked ((name deleted)) are friend if he could get it in his telescope. He quickly changed lenses and we watched it for a fair amount of time. After that Stan said he caught some of it on camcorder. Also we noticed a car parked in the parking lot, but it was not until others started showing up that we decided to talk to the people in the parked car. Two of the people that showed up later went and talked to the people in the car and were told that they watched this thing fallowing Stan’s van up the road and when Stan got to the parking lot the Orb abruptly turned West right over them and an out house not fare from where we all were. The people in the car drove off. It  was after that time I decided we needed to get witnesses interviews on tape, so I did<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Mr. Stan Romanek, witness to this event, for arranging to have this witness submit his written report.

There was a nice light breeze and thin clouds with spaces between them were continuously rolling over the mountain range out to the east. The moon was approx 1/4 and out to the south west about 30-40 degrees, with clouds obscuring it sometimes. Observer 1 noticed an object directly upward which at first glance could be mistaken for a bright star, only he said it was moving. He pointed it out to us, and myself(observer 2) and observer 3 also could see it moving, almost fluttering around much like a bee, kind of bouncing ever so slightly. We kept watching it and started noticing there were many more overhead that were moving around too. They all appeared as stars at first, some more intense in light than the others. The light was constant, not blinking, but fading in and out. Observer 3 said he saw a blue light coming from one of them, changing back and forth from blue to white occasionaly. I personally noticed about 3 or 4 of these things moving, dancing on the edges of the clouds, almost trying to hide themselves with the moving clouds. They never went too far from their apparent location in the sky, but appeared to all of us that they were rapidly changing up and down in altitude at times, the light would sometimes be diffused by the clouds. We called my mom out, observer 4 to take a look. She said she could see them moving around too. Remember, this is just my account of this eyewitness, and I may have forgotten a few things, as I am writing this 24 hours after the sighting. Nevertheless, it is still very freshly ingrained in my mind. I am going to encourage the others to post their accounts of this on this website too. Just after observer 4 saw these objects, observer 3 decided to go home. Us 3 kept watching the skies, and woke my dad up to come see at approx 9:30. He looked for a just a few minutes and didn&#39;t seem to interested or convinced and went back inside and went to ! bed. Us 3 kept watching, myself and observer 3 lied down on the benches on the deck so we could see straight up. There seemed to be more and more of them appearing out of nowhere, fluttering around the clouds, which were diminishing and the skies gradually getting clearer. When all of a sudden, 2 seconds of sheer terror and astonishment at the same time. A triangular shaped, HUGE OBJECT, darts across the sky, seeming to be relatively low in elevation, and MASSIVE in size. It was almost like a shadow, an ominous bird taking up a good portion of our view. It could have been a very tight formation of several craft, or just one HUGE one. I thought I saw maybe nine arrow like faint lights or reflections of city lights below all pointing forward, almost like a formation jets fly in. We yelled out because this thing was flat out the fastest thing I have ever seen in my life. It covered the portion of the sky visible to us in those one to at most two seconds we saw it. Not only that but perhaps the biggest thing too. It was probably only in view for only 1-2 seconds. All of us saw it, and realized we had shrieked out in amazement, saying what the hell was that!!!!!!!!!! I can&#39;t begin to tell you what kind of feeling came across me, and us. Goosebumps and heart racing. It was so stealthy, appearing kind of neutral in color, not dark and not light, almost transparent, but blocking the background above it. It was going due South, DIRECTLY over us. Observer 3 said it reminded her of a huge Thunderbird. It appeared to be about only a couple thousand feet up, and about as big as my hand when held as far away as possible. As we gathered ourselves and asked eachother about it, while still looking up, another one flew over, maybe 5 or 10 minutes after the first one. We all briefly screamed again, because we were excited about seeing the first one, and something that moves that fast is supposed to scare you!! We are ALL CERTAIN we saw the same thing. This one didn&#39;t appear as large, but going just as fast, who could estimate the ! speed of these things, but I would say several thousand miles an hour, that fast!!!!!!!! IMPRESSIVE.... At this point we were wonderin what the hell was going on, almost like being in a dream, where you can&#39;t believe your eyes. But it&#39;s real and you know it. We live on the outskirts of town where many people have animals, and we heard dogs barking, horses and donkeys beying, pet geese making all kinds of noise. The second (relative to the size) also appeared to be flying low, maybe half as large as the first one that flew directly overhead, north to south just as the first. They made NO noise whatsoever, and left no trails, only in view for an instant. They appeared to be going straight and at a constant velocity, real damn fast. How could this be happening? Are they ours? I don&#39;t see how they could be, given the apparent size and speed. But you never know. All the while, these star looking lights, that were moving around, almost confined to an area, started to have more activity. We witnessed several of them shoot across the sky over the next hour or so, almost like meteor trals, but the trails much much longer then a meteorite&#39;s, but not seeing that ominous &#34;big bird&#34; again. Observer 1 was freaking out a little, and decided to go inside to sleep. Myself and observer 3 stayed outside, waiting and watching when whizzzzzzzzz Two light colored objects about 70 degrees up to the east of us, coming out of the North again, going south, were two light colored Diamand shaped craft, resembling big planes with only wings and no tail or fuseloge, whizzed across the sky with the same breakneck speed, then the were gone, disappearing as quickly as they appeared. Where are they going? Back to Nevada or New Mexico? Or better question, where are the coming from? We might never know. But we have to believe, anyone looking in the Pueblo skies that night HAD to have seen it too, just too much activity, too many things moving, and the flyovers, those were enormous crafts, too big to miss, but maybe too fast for someone to see if n! ot looki ng up at all times. This had started at about 9:00 pm and at midnight, still happening. I think I had seen some sort of UFO sighting about 12 years ago, but it was nothing as convincing and REAL and fast and awesome as this. So us two keep looking at the skies and noticed a formation of flickering lights off to the east about 30-40 degrees up. It looked like a mini little dipper constellation, only the objects were dancing around this look alike formation, way to small to be the little dipper. We kept watching this because it seems to have appeared out of nowhere. The objects seemed to be about 2-3 times the width in length, appeared bluish white in light, and danced and tumbled around almost like a school of fish. We were getting tired and weary and decided to go to sleep. That&#39;s it. Hope to see them again, next time I will have my camcorder on a tripod, recording constantly looking straight up. I didn&#39;t have it at the time of the sighting and no pictures were taken. This eyewitness was just too eery and too scary not to report, I&#39;m sure some people will think I&#39;m crazy, but 4 people can&#39;t see the same thing and it not be real. Besides, I&#39;m almost certain that other people in the Pueblo area had to see it and will hopefully report this as well.<n>

On the night of 22, Sept., 2001, a couple who had been parked in the parking lot at the overlook in Daniel’s Park, south of Denver, Colorado, told me They had observed a large red sphere about 40 ft. up in the air, following Stan Romanek’s van as it was coming up the dirt road from highway 85. They further stated that the red object had a type of pattern to it that seemed to be made of lines of bright light resembling laser light. The couple also stated a red glow was being reflected off the ground under the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The couple also stated the red glowing orb stopped briefly as the van stopped. The globe of red light then seemed to turn south as it started moving, then turned west and with a seeming constant velocity, tracked a straight line westward until it disappeared over the foothills of the Rockies.  According to them no noise was heard from the red sphere during this encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The couple surmised the red globe appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was their wish to remain anonymous and I respect that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Mr. Stan Romanek, witness to this event, for arranging to have this witness submit his written report.

9/22/01 20:00|Saskatoon (Canada)|SA|Chevron|5 - 7 seconds|Wedge or chevron shaped object passed in front of crescent moon.|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19629.html|71|ndxe200109| Wedge or chevron shaped object passed in front of crescent moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out our living room window at the crescent moon, when I suddenly saw an object pass in front of the moon. The object appeared wedge-shaped, but was notched or open at the back (giving it a bit of a chevron shape). It passed the tip of the crescent moon travelling west to east and was as tall as about 1/8 to 1/6 of the moon&#39;s diameter. The moon was surrounded by a halo that was about three times the moon&#39;s diameter, and the object was silhouetted by the moon and surrounding halo, giving me about 5 - 7 seconds to watch it. It was moving faster than a jet would appear to move at high altitude, but perhaps as fast as a jet appears to move at a lower altitude. Since it was silhouetted by the moon&#39;s halo, it must have been travelling below the high level cloud that created the halo. It may well have been an aircraft, especially since aircraft regularly travel east and west in this portion of the sky, but I was struck by the apparent lack of a fuselage. As soon as I saw it, I ran to the window and cupped my hands against the glass to block out any extraneous light and watched the sky for signs that it might have been an aircraft. I was unable to see any moving lights in the sky near the approximate path the object was travelling. My wife and I were waiting for a television program to start, so I am positive of the time (a few seconds before 8:00 pm CST). Unfortunately, I was unable to draw my wife&#39;s attention to the object fast enough.<n>

A commercial passenger jet passed over my view of it, so its altitude was much higher than that of a commercial jet.  Its movement was very slow. It slowly moved South then stopped for a few minutes. It resumed changing its direction to the East then stopped again for a few minutes. Then it changed its direction to Southwest and moved slowly in that direction. Then it disappeared.  Seemed to stretch into a oval when initiating movement after being stationary; then once moving it returns into a sphere.<n>

I was standing not to far away from one of the other witnesses, when I heard my friend Mark scream LOOK! I looked up. There was an object the size of a van. It was not quite spherical. Its distance from us was near tree top level or higher. It was so close you could see detail in or around the object like laser beams that created a lattes work design. It was close enough that it lit up the ground below it with the light it gave off. It was very beautiful, amazing and very strange. The other people in the group were in shock as it flew past. What was weird, after we saw the object, jokingly I told my friend Mark, my brother is probably not far behind, they seem to like him. Shortly after I said that, my brother showed up. He told us that the object had fallowed him up the road. Other witnesses verified this; especially the ones in a parked car watched it fallow my brother. It looked to me as if it was showing off<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Mr. Stan Romanek, witness to this event, for submitting not only this report, but several other reports from other witnesses to this same event.

It was just dark; I could easily see all major stars, (ie Vega, Arcturus, etc.). We were facing south, with Denver to the northeast. I had my telescope setup (8” reflector) and I was observing Mars at the time, with my high power eyepiece. Then our organizer said, “What is that?” As we followed his hand, we saw to the left and down range a strobing sphere, about the size of a mini-van. I don’t dare estimate its altitude or distance from us. There were no reference points to compare to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its heading was northwest and speed was faster then a small plane and slower then a jet. It didn’t change heading or speed for the entire time that we observed it. As it reached its closest point to us, I could observe the following:  It was a sphere, it strobed at 6 cycles per sec. (approximately), It made no sound, It was red-orange in color I was able to exchange eyepieces to my low power one and target three places before I saw it in my telescope. It looked no different than when it was closer. I was not able to see any more detail. Immediately after our sighting, Stan Romanek drove up in his van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the witness, and to Stan Romanek for arranging to have this report submitted.  Mr. Romanek experienced two dramatic sightings in Colorado on September 22 and 30, 2001, and his reports appear in this database for those dates.  NUFORC has viewed video of the September 30 event, and it is impressive, and unexplained, we feel, by any type of conventional aircraft that we are aware of.  PD))<n>

Tøgersen says several more people have come forward after news reports carried the account of three people in the town of Mosjøen who dove for cover when they saw a low-flying, whirling object hurtle through the night skies On September 23.  &#34;We also have several other witness observations of the same phenomenon in the same time frame on Sunday,&#34; Tøgersen said.  Other people have reported sightings of additional UFOs that apparently resemble small, brightly lit balls.  While the larger object over Mosjøen emitted no noise whatsoever, Tøgersen says the smaller objects are reported to have made a hissing sound.  But the most remarkable reports came from the northern city of Bodø.  There, a woman went out of her house and a flying object landed on her lawn, stoo!<n> <n><n> d there awhile, and then lifted off and flew away.  Two other separate individuals reported the same sighting, at the same time, on Saturday evening.  One of the two was driving his car when he spotted it flying over Vefsnfjorden, while another saw it while out on a veranda.  Both reported that it was brightly lit.

9/21/01 23:00|Las Vegas|NV|Fireball|2 and half seconds|bright blue fire ball falling down in the North Las Vegas area by Nells AFB.|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19658.html|76|ndxe200109| bright blue fire ball falling down in the North Las Vegas area by Nells AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving in my car, turning down and traveling east on Katie St. just off Maryland Prkwy. by Boulevard Mall. Just above the mall looking north, I couldn&#39;t help not to have seen, what took my attention by the extreme brightness of intensity. My estimation is that this would have been located more directly above the Nellis Airforce Base by my judging it. Looked very simular to a satellite burning upon hitting the atmosphere but like i said, brightly burning with a blue color and tail. Happened very fast and there was no sound or smoke. Never heard any reports or news as well. My reason to report this is the variation of how this burning object was unlike other types of instances I have seen from meteors, burning satellites, and comets encountered. Possible that the close proximity was a factor but where did it hit? Never heard news of it since? while I am here I would like to mention that Las Vegas, NV is the brightest city seen on the planet earth and looks as though where a star on the planets surface. If our telescopes where to see a star on the the surface of Mars, it would be a phenomena of amazing proportion. IS LAS VEGAS SOME TYPE OF BEACON TO THE SKY??? TRY TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS.  thanks<n>

They were close together and seemed to be coming from one source.  These lights would all disappear and then reappear again in a different location, moving to the north and west.  We observed this 5 times before the lights disappeared.  These lights seemed quite low to the horizon and yet we could hear no noise such as you might from a plane.  The other odd thing was that during this time we noticed a very strong and overwhelming manure type odor.  Since this area is near a cattle farm that would not be unusual, except there was no breeze that night and this odor appeared very suddenly, lasted several minutes and then just went away.<n>

We were s|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19666.html|79|ndxe200109| A couple of friends, my wife and I were staying in Albuquerque (87104) at the Sheraton Old Town hotel on September 21, 2001.  We were sitting by the outdoor pool chatting, between 20:00 - 20:30.  We all saw bright chrome like, circular (somewhat elongated in direction or flight) object pass overhead at a high rate of speed.  There was no sound or sonic blast, so we assume it was traveling slower than the speed of sound.  Since it did not pass through any clouds, we assumed that it was below them, perhaps a few thousand feet above us.  It had no lights, although it changed colors from red to lavender to silver as it streaked across the sky.  It appeared like the sunset was reflecting off of it, but sun had set around 19:00.  There was no visible exhaust, flames, or vapor trail.  We first observed it almost directly overhead.  It was moving in a WWN (290 degrees) direction.  It was only visible for a few seconds, since it was traveling at a high rate of speed; much faster than a commercial airline.  Its relative size would be equivalent to looking at an object the size of a dime held at arms length over ones head.  Since we had no explanation for what we saw, we assumed it would be explained as a weather balloon. However it did not look anything like a weather balloon and it traveled in a straight line and did not appear to gain altitude.  I am a retired automotive executive with a master&#39;s degree in engineering. My wife and I have been married for 39 years and have never seen anything like this before. Our friends have been married for 40 years and he is also a retired engineer. In addition, I am an amateur astronomer, so I have some knowledge in identifying objects in the sky, such as meteors.  Can you help explain what we saw?<n>

I looked at the clock and it said 7:30pm I told her I would be there in about 20 minutes( I was running late for my husbands birthday dinner.) All of a sudden I felt some sort of magnitism drawing my attention. I looked up in the sky and saw a oval shaped object sitting still in the sky. It was beautiful,it looked like an eferdescent opal color. It had a bright neon purple tail that went all the way to the ground. For some reason I pulled my car off to the side of the road and I locked my car and suddenly I was inside the object. the inside was a clean,sterile,cool room made of stainless steel. It had cabinets on the wall and it looked immaculate. There were two beings. they had big white heads and black eyes. They were actually tall and were both male and had on long white lab coats. I remember I was laying on a stainles steel table and they were examining my body. They took body fluids,blood,urine,saliva among other things. The next thing I really remember is walking back to my car with a splitting headache. I looked at the clock and it said 8:30pm  my daughter had left several messages checking on me. When I arrived at the restaurant I was still shaken and felt weak. I didnt want to say what had happened to me. but I wanted to know what had really happened. I saw one of the area firefighers and I ask him if anything had been reported in the sky. He said no. I called the sheriffs dept and kep getting the same answers..nothing unusual had been reported.  When i got up the next morning I went to my neighbors house and before I could tell her what happened she told me she had seen a flying saucer and it scared her really bad.  She described it to a t. The lady is now deceased. Many people heard the story and I had reported it on the internet somewhere the next couple of days. This was truly a real true and non fictional happening.<n>

I thought it was an aircraft, such as a civillian aircraft that was crome ie &#34;American Airlines&#34;, on approach to Epply Air Field but the object was not moving on a normal approach.  As I pulled into a parking lot, the object appeared to be hovering. This peaking my curosity, I decided to watch this event from a higher elevation in town.  As I was driving closer this object it descended and disappeared from my view, I waited and watched for minutes in a near by park but, never seen a trace, or have a clue of where it went.  I don&#39;t believe it was a normal jet aircraft, even a Harrier aircraft does not begin a descent from that altitude.<n>

Then suddenly just above the tree tops we saw a small dark triagle shaped object(about the size of a compact car) traveling at a extreme rate of speed.  It was not making any noise just the sound of it breaking through the wind.  This was like no other object we have ever seen before.  We were very upset over this sighting due to all the terrorist activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source remains anonymous.  PD))<n>

And as I got off my van, I happened to glance up at the sky, right over my neighbors house. At that moment I saw about seven to nine lights shoot across the sky. The lights were amber in color and they weren&#39;t blinking, the lights were steady. They looked a little bigger than the brightest star. They seemed disk shaped. They were in a formation, two lines parallel to each other, but one line was one disk ahead of the other. About four or five seconds into the sighting, the last disk maneuvered its way to the front in what seemed a split second. I ran to the left side of my house as they dissapeared over my house. I caught sight of them again on the other side of my house, but only for a couple of seconds, then they disapeared behind some trees.<n>

Suddenly top of our heads flew, infact it flew quite low and it was huge and big, it was too big to be an airplane and planes don&#39;t fly so low and it can not be an satellite. I couldn&#39;t feel nothing during that time. It had very strange shape, there was many tinny lights and lights were some strange order, it remainds just like flock of birds in plow.it flew from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> in Finland i heard stories about UFOs in Lapland. They have said that there is something going on in Iso-Syöte, there have happen lots of things that you can not explain them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For three consecutive years, in the late 1990s/early 2000s, I worked the fall cranberry harvest at the Oceanspray fruit-receiving plant in Middleboro, MA, in the Cape Cod region.  The plant is in a remote area amongst historic cranberry bogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In late September of 2001, I was working through a second shift break on the outside of the large facility. I never talked about this with anyone at the plant, but it is likely that I was the only person working outside at that time. I looked up to see a craft passing over the factory. Briefly, I thought it might be a stealth airplane or some military craft related to 9/11. However, there were details of my sighting that make the craft I witnessed irreconcilable with known crafts of human origin. It was so low and large that it filled the sky to all horizons/tree lines(the factory was surrounded by pine forest). It was completel! y silent, and this was disorienting. It kept going and going and going. The bottom of the craft did look like something humans could make. There were panels, and it bore a slight resemblance to the bottom of the millennium falcon/starship enterprise. The colors were dark like a stealth bomber and it had the same smooth flat texture. I saw one red light on the end of a stem-like apparatus descending from the craft. It took about 60 seconds from the time I became aware of the object passing overhead to when it disappeared behind the tree line north of the plant. Generally, I would say that its shape was rectangular. More specifically, I would describe its shape as two large rectangular shapes joined in the middle but slightly offset, each the size of an extra-large football stadium. However, the size is difficult to estimate because it was a disorienting experience, but I would guess that it was 400 yards long and 300 yards wide. I couldn&#39;t determine any depth or height. That! is not to say that it was flat, but its width and length were! of a much larger scale then its height. I estimate that its speed was 30mph. When it happened, I said to myself that I was going to keep this to myself and that it was my special weird moment. I don&#39;t know why I had this psychological reaction. It was somewhat traumatic, and the memory came back to me a time after the event. I can&#39;t explain this, but I did feel that the craft was affecting my brain/thought process in some way that encouraged my disbelief. Was the craft silent or is there a superior technology that can make crafts inaudible to our brains etc.? I didn&#39;t tell this story to anyone until this thanksgiving and I am going to try and track down people from my shift at the plant at that time. Subjective speculations I have now about what it might have been are: secret human technology cargo ship, alien ship, alien slave ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Unfortunately I can’t remember the date, but I believe it was in 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on Maple Valley Highway near Jones Rd going west, at about 10:30 or 11:0p.m.  The sky was clear, and stars were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something in my peripheral  in the upper right hand corner of the windshield.  It was some sort of light that moved strangely in the sky.  I glanced up and the moment that I did, I saw a bright egg shaped light that flashed and grew smaller within a fraction of a second.  It was like when you turn off an old TV and the light goes to the center of the screen, or a Sci-Fi movie where a spaceship zooms away at light speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I distinctly got the impression that it had moved away at an incredible speed.  This would have been over Renton or 405 depending on the distance.  It happened so fast that I wouldn’t be able to judge its exact location or distance, but I believe it was at least a hundred feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was such a bright white that it left an imprint in my vision like when you stare at a light source for too long and you see a pink or green blob when you turn away.  I would have dismissed this whole event, had it not been for the fact that I could still see that imprint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a strong impulse to pull over and look in the sky in the direction it had gone, but there wasn’t a convenient place, as that stretch of road has no shoulder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was as bright as sirius when it flashed and moved rather slowly.  It flashed about once a second reguarly, there was no sound.  I was slightly surprised but I have seen tumbling satellites b4 and also the NOSS triplet so I assume that it was a tumbling piece of debris.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only strange thing was the colour and the fact that the photo I have shows it turned slightly, but I put this down to atmospheric refraction.  I have never seen an orange satellite but it could be that this object was reflecting a space sunset?  It also faded away which I assume was it entering the earth&#39;s penumbra.  Each flash has left a white dot on the orange line of its exposed (30sec) trail so you can work out how fast it was going plus picture gives direction against stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe other people have seen this and we can clear this mystery up.<n>

We went out to look and noticed a red, rapidly blinking object hovering approximately 500 yards up. It was approx. 40 feet in diameter and it made no noise. We watched it for a few minutes; it looked like a big red blinking soccer ball. The light looked like it was coming from within the object, but seemed to crawl around the outside of it somehow. The UFO returned about 20 minutes later.  I was driving home from work and it followed me to my apartment complex.  I ran into my apartment to grab my video camera, but the object was too high up in the sky by the time I returned to get any clear video, and then it was gone.<n>

I was sitting on my couch one day, watching TV, and happened to look out my window. From my window I can see the East side of Manhatten, I am directly across from the United Nations building. In any case I saw what appeared to me at first to be birds flying. Like seagulls, when they just kind of float in the air. Their movement was like that two objects just kind of circling each other ove and over. It occured to me after a few seconds how high they were in the air. I got up to get a closer look, and sure enough they were not birds. My second though was military planes, like an F-14. This was in and around the time they were still patrolling over the City. But because of the movement, I would have to rule that one out too. They managed to saty there for about 10 minutes appearing and disappearing, reflecting light of some type of metallic surface. They were so far up it was hard to get a good read on its surface properties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A vehicle streaming two contrails from the direction of 335-345 degrees true overflew Seattle/Issaquah, WA area.  Made a high speed, 180 U-turn directly overhead and departed area at very high speed.  Estimate altitude at 35,000 feet.  Diameter of turn estimated at 2.5 miles.  Time from directly overhead to beyond visible horizon heading toward NWest approximately 25 seconds.  Vehicle was audible entire time, but shape of vehicle could not be discerned due to altitude.  Sun still up, but dusk approaching.  Very loud noise consistent with un-hushed military jet engines.  No doubt of military origin, but speed, altitude and flight path (plus solo operation) tend to rule out air cap flight due to recent events.  Sure you&#39;ll get other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is the second reported sighting that we have received over the last ten days of what the witnesses presumed were  &#34;Aurora&#34; aircraft.

At first they were all in one row, then they went to a box formation and then to a triangle.   They reverted back and forth between the box and triangle.  When in the triangle formation, the fourth object was off to the right of the triangle.Then the fourth came from the west to the east at a tremendous speed without sound and disappeared out of sight. Now there were three left. About five min later one more flew by in the same manner.  When we looked back to the triangle, one was at 12:00 and the other was at 6:00 and at this time the third one also went from the east to the west at a speed I did not know existed. It stopped and went north the other two just stayed in the same place except they slowly gained altitude till they were out of sight. It appeared that the objects were yellow/orange in color though that may have been a reflection of the sun. They were too far away to determine any shape.  I am a devotee of aircraft; historic and modern.  One of the persons with me is a pilot and could not understand what was happening. Another was a schoolteacher, and two are neighbors.  I called SFO airport,the FAA and channel 7 news. No one knew anything. This is the first time that I have seen anything like that. I am happy that there were other people there so I knew it was not a figment of imagination.<n>

As I watched, it stopped in mid-air without slowing, stopped, turned invisible to my eyes, anyhow, and went back west at an incredible rate of speed. As I watched, it stopped in midair again, and dropped straight down towards the ground and became invisible before landing, or going wherever it went. Maybe five minutes afterwards, there was an incredibily loud sonic boom. A few minutes later, there were two more sonic booms.

It suddenly grew in brilliance/size, a orange/bronze color, faded slightly, then grew again. It did not change location. Although their were military jets in the vicinity early in the day because of 9/11, being ex-military, I know what we saw was not afterburners or military style anti heat-seeking missile flares.

When I got home I found I had forgotten to leave a set of keys to the drug cabinet, that were in my pocket.  I changed clothes and headed back to the hospital.  As I was merging onto I-17 frwy, there were at least 3 to 5 other vehicles in close proximity to mine. When all of a sudden from the north west corner of the sky a bright green circular object quickly passed overhead in front of me headed towards the southeast. Being exactly one week from the 9/11 event, when this object first caught my attention, I thought that maybe it was a missile attack being directed at the city.  Apparently, the other drivers that saw it did too, because we all slammed on our brakes.  What I thought was strange about this thing was that it&#39;s color never changed in intensity, or faded like you might see with a meteor coming through the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This circle split up into 3 other circles of approximately the same size as the original circle, and proceded to move outward at rapid speed in a clockwise direction, merging into one circle again at points equidistant from each other.  After merging, the 3 circles appeared as one circle again and paused in this location for perhaps 1/2 second before repeating the same splitting up into a 3 circle pattern. This whole process took approximately 2 or 3 seconds for each repitative pattern.  This pattern was repeated over and over again for 45 minutes and then suddenly disappeared.The light pattern remained in the same location in the sky, that is to say, in the northeast about 45 degrees above the horizon.

The moon was almost setting.  My son pointed out a bright light in the sky. It looked like an airplane at first; a very bright one. Then we saw an airplane pass under; two very different things. I thought it might be a satellite burning out through the atmosphere. It had a tail with a bright end.  It sloped up from bottom left to top right. As dusk came closer, the tail continued to grow.  It kept the same position in the sky; left and right, that is.  The tail then split into two distinct trails. The only way to attempt to describe the length was if you extend your arm all the way; the tail was about one inch long; way up in the sky.  Other cars were watching the same thing.  We could see them looking up, too.  As night fell, it disappeared.  I am not into UFOs or anything.  This was either a rocket going up, a satellite burning through, or an UFO.<n>

I walked up to the building where a few coworkers were standing having one last cig befor work. I didnt feel too social this mornning due to the topic of conversation! I set down my lunch box and water bottle leaned up aginst a pole pulled out a cig and fired it up. I noticed the sky was really clear probably due to a small cold front. I was looking south up at some stars when they started moving. I could not see the body of the craft due to the darkness but there were lights on the thing witch twinkled like stars in the shape of a V . I couldnt believe what i was seeing i took a few steps forward or tord the craft whitch was about 100yrds away the craft was moving south not too fast at first then the next thing i know the lights on the craft kinda fade out leaving behind it the blackness of the night sky!<n>

They appeared to be in a fixed position, perhaps a bit lower than the stars. Their movement was slow, just like the stars, indicating the objects&#39; perceived movement was actually due to the Earth&#39;s rotation. The base of the Y-shape was the brightest, looking somewhat like a cluster of three adjacent stars. The angles at the top of the Y were like lighted lines, not as bright as the base. On some nights we have seen a short line extending downward from the middle of the base of the Y. We have since seen these objects moving from west to east between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. every night when the skies have been clear. They are probably visible much later into the night, but we haven&#39;t stayed up later. Our suspicion is that these are U.S. spy satellites grouped in position for sightings of overseas locations as part of the War on Terrorism, but attempts to confirm this have failed. We have been told the spy satellites are too high in the sky and to small to be visible without powerful telescopes, but we have also read that newer, and perhaps bigger, spy satellites have been in development for some time. Some other people in our area have also seen these Y-shaped objects in the sky. Has anyone else in other parts of the USA or in other nations seen these objects and/or have an explantion of what they are?<n>

We finally decided to pack up and leave and see if we could get some sanity back into our lives by going to Acadia anyhow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived late in the day a couple of days later (I don&#39;t remember the exact day). After setting up camp, we drove to the Ocean Drive near Sand Beach and walked the walkway in the dark. After walking awhile we went out on the shoreline rocks to just watch the surf and stars and listen to the ocean. It was a nice clear night without any moon at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The planes had been flying for a couple of days again, and there is a path they tend to use over the Bar Harbor area that is directly overhead and runs in a SW to NE direction.  As I was watching the planes, and looking over the stars, I noticed a satellite moving across the sky from W to E in a line that was slightly off perpendicular to the route of the planes - still some distance from the exact route the planes were taking.  Looking further west I saw another satellite.  I pointed them out to my wife.  They were average star brightness and appeared just as I&#39;ve seen many satellites moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching as the &#39;satellite&#39; moved closer to the path of the planes (no planes nearby at the moment). As some more planes flew overhead (they sometimes flew 3 or 4 at once) from the south and came near to the path of the &#39;satellite&#39;, the first &#39;satellite&#39; stopped dead still in the sky - as still as a star. Once the planes went by, the &#39;satellite&#39; started moving again - at the same speed it had been - without any apparent acceleration time - and then suddenly made a right angle turn moving ahead in the new direction at the same speed it had been using before. There was no apparent loss of speed as it made the right angle turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did this several more times - in different directions. Each turn appeared as an exact 90 degree turn - and then it moved in that direction for a few seconds before making another right angle turn again. Anytime a plane came near to the location of the &#39;satellite&#39;, the &#39;satellite&#39; stopped dead still in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other &#39;satellite&#39; as it came closer did exactly the same thing in relation to the planes!! We were just blown away and I couldn&#39;t imagine any spacecraft or plane that I know of that could manuever and hover so abruptly. Once past the lane the planes used, they continued on until they grew fainter in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my wife and I are 50 years old (47 at the time of the &#39;incident&#39;), with college education.

I felt like something was behind me so I turned to look at the sky just behind me maybe to the north. I am horrible with direction. There was a very bright light that at first I thought was a star but, it seemed too bright and too close to be a star. I have seen this before in our places but on this night it scared me a bit. When I saw it I had just enough time to think to myself that that was too big and bright to be a star and it very quickly faded as if it went straight up in the sky. There was no other motion or sound from that direction but, a minute latter a plain did fly over near where the light was. The light itself was a very white , star like light that faded very fast as if it went straight up. It was about twice the size of normal stars and the sky around was clearer than normal with more than normal amounts of stars visible. I could not make out any movement after the light faded and there were on visible egdes of any kind that I could see around the object. I have always watched the skies to see stars and lived where a lot of plains and stuff can be seen. (Huntsville , AL) so I know what is normal aircraft and have seen copter lights a lot. I am also a critical reader of UFO information though, I do keep up on the topic. I have no idea what this was but, I would like to know if anyone else saw it in more detail.<n>

I&#39;m not a 100% believer, but simply that it&#39;s possible.  Now that I&#39;ve qualified myself so you all don&#39;t think I&#39;m a nut.;) On the evening of Sunday, 9/16 at about 6pm I was on my back patio picking up messages from my cell phone.  As I was listening to messages I heard planes going overhead, the planes caught my attention considering the WTC bombing occurred earlier in the week and I was surprised to hear the planes in the air.  As I was watching a plane go over I noticed an object far beyond/above the plane that caught my eye.  The object was a little South East of me.  I live about 10 miles from NYC and I would guess the object was in that area.  I watched the object for about 5 minutes, it didn&#39;t move. I then pointed it out to my 60 yr old neighbor; he went inside to get a pair of binoculars.  I focused on the object for a few short minutes:  it was a soft tri-angle shape, almost a teardrop shape, and it was metallic in color.  As I was watching the object it disappeared.  I asked my neighbor if he saw that and he said it shot/flashed to the north...it was a streak/zip that left a short blurred trail behind it .  We discussed what we saw and thought it was maybe a weather balloon, but thinking more on it we didn&#39;t think it could be because it remained in one place for at least 10-15 minutes, and then it shot quickly in the opposite direction that the wind blew.  Further, the shape wasn&#39;t right either.  It looked like the shape of an upside-down balloon, but a little sharper on the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous, but he describes himself as someone with a strong technical background.

With commercial air traffic stopped for 3 days, the skys were sadly quite. I do not wish to add to the current state of confussion, but feel I must note any strangness in the skys around NYC. On this day Sunday Sept 16 2001 at 3:30 pm in sunny warm cloudless skies I saw what I thought could be a Mylar balloon or satelite at high alttitude. The size of the object when first sighted was 1/2 to 1/4 the size of a marbel held at arms lenght. The strange aspect of this object was it appeared rock steady showing no movement. It also showed no dissernable shape, and seemed highly reflective of the bright sunlite. Because size was hard to determine, I would guestimate an altitude of 20,000 feet( a full size commercial jet appeared in the sky but not near the object) the jet appeared as large as a marbel at arms lenght but at only 1/2 the objects altitude. At the time of the sighting I was sitting on the stairs of the Garden City Long Island railroad station, facing due east. The LIRR runs east to west for easy referance. As I had 2 young children in my care at the time, and because of close proximity to the train tracks, I could not study the object to closely. I decided to walk the children 3 blocks to there home. In the 15 to 20 min walk home the object did not move at all. Once home I ran into the house for a pair of Busnell 10 x 50 binoculars. The object appeared to be over central Nassau county in the area of Mithcel Feild/ Uniondale.( a side note this object would have had a clear line of sight view of the World Trade Center 22 miles away) If I were to point at the object my arm would be at about 60 degrees. SMy freind also looked at the object through the binoculars, we both feel this object did not look--- and more immportanly act like a balloon. I ran into the house and went online for an AOL weather report for our zip code, here is the live weather for the sighting. Clear sunny skies temp 70 degrees--winds south at 8 mph---humidity 49%--barometer 30.07 . I next ran to the local grocery store and brought 3 crome look mylar balloons. Since the object was to my east one would excpect when I released the mylar balloon it would follow on that path ( if the object was also a balloon too). The balloons when released acted like what I  would excpect a balloon to act like, and followed the winds to the south, 45% away from the object I first viewed 39 min earlier. I should also note the balloons had nowhere near the same reflectivity as they twisted and turned on thier accent, with an occassional flash of sunlite, simular to a cameras flashbulb. Also the balloons I released stayed low in the horizion, and went no higher than 25%, but that could be attributed to the amount of helium in the balloon. It was futher determined, that infact the object did raise up in altitude, or reduced in size slowly through out the sighting untill it was no longer visible. I feel confident this was no balloon or satelite and will be even more vigilant of our great cities skies.<n>

I expressly looked for any type of wings to determine if it was a plane, but there wasn&#39;t any.  I drove my vehicle over to the nearest gas station and got out.

Immediately, I went inside to get my highest powered binoculars, told my wife I had seen a high flying bird, I assumed since there is little to no mechanical air traffic over US and the &#34;bird was hovering&#34;. When I looked through the eyepiece, instantly I became excited and called upon my wife to join me in my joy of the object. Brilliant copper gleaming definitely metalic large oval sphere, like a egg but with short midway wing flanges. Size perhaps like small fighter jet, but way up in sky. After hovering, object took off high speed across to the Southern horizon away from me, no smoke trail or other exhaust, no noise at any time, no wobble. moved like a balloon, but with apparent hover and direction. Perhaps a new prototype our government is employing in our war on terrorism. Perhaps an alien craft, from a mother ship sent down to NE seaboard to investigate the recent occurence and the lack of air travel in our country. Either way, I enjoyed the emotion I was feeling. Perhaps I&#39;ll never know what it was but it does make me feel good, in my unrelentless search of the heavens.<n>

There were a few clouds, but I could still see the bright outline of the moon&#39;s reflecting light at the lower left portion of the moon.  The light reflecting off of the moon was sufficiently bright that I could see the outline fo the moon very clearly.  All of a sudden, a very large black square shape, about 25% larger than the moon itself passed in front of the moon (horizontally, as if a shade had been drawn), totally eclipsing the moon.  It was not only black, but it also seemed to have somewhat of a sheen, and it was much blacker than any other part of the night sky.  At first I thought it might be clouds, except I&#39;ve never seen a black square cloud, nor have I ever seen an aircraft that was square, or of that size.  Further, in order for it to have been a satellite, it would have to have been of tremendous size.  I have no idea of what I saw, and will not try to suggest any possiblilities.  Any feedback, or confirmations on what it was, or might have been would be appreciated.<n>

I was about ten miles out of Lafayette In. traveling twords my exit. I noticed an object in the sky at this point to my left. The highway is very dark, it was nine at night, and there are NO street lights lining the road. I first noticed the red &#34;globe&#34; of light in the middle of the object as I approached it. The object was floating VERY close to the road and quite low. It was on the other side, (North bound lanes) of traffic so I had to look across to see it. At this point I am still approaching it and think it is a red light on a tower of somesort, then I start to become horizontally in line with it as I pass, I look ,and as soon as I saw the 5 or so red flashing lights on the bottom of the craft that were flashing on and off slowly I knew what I thought I was seeing. I had a very good view of the object At this point, and so did others in the northbound lanes because I remember every car that approached the scene started braking. The object itself was about 2 to 3 hundred feet in the air and I just stared in awe. What I saw was a craft that was very dome like in appearence, the thing that was most odd was how this dome that made up 80% of the object was transparant this is how I could see the red light that never flashed in the middle. The red lights around the bottom were the same size as the one in the middle, and they appered to be attached to the saucer bottom part of the craft that the dome sat on. These lights flashed in unison at intervals of about 2 seconds. It was just like I saw on tv, it was like a movie was being played in front of me in the sky, I couldn&#39;t believe how fictonally sterotipical this UFO looked. I passed the object, kept staring and followed it until I was out of sight of it. I never saw the object zoom off, it really just hovered slightly as I was passing it anyway, no supersonic blastaways. I rac! ed to ca tch up to my girlfreind who was in my truck who was about 1/2 a mile in front of me, all she had noticed was the people braking, not the object though. I am most curious to see if anyone else that night has seen this. SOMEONE had to have, it was right by the road, I mean right next to it over the bean field. It was a very clear night I noticed the stars as I looked into the sky all the way home.<n>

The cross had 4 orange shaded lights equidisant from each other &amp; had a green light moving from left to right and back again on top of cross. This object was moving from the east to the west at the zenith with incredible speed.I saw it with my eyes and had my binoculars in hand, as I looked with the binoculars I could not make out any distinguisable surface details. The lights were not blinking but were steady. This was no plane or satellite.

I am a private pilot of small aircraft out of NJ as well as a military aircraft buff. I am highly familiar with the NYC sky, aircraft, military aircraft and flight patterns. Now that I have given you my credentials I will explain what we saw while sailing 4 miles south of the Verazzano bridge just 4 days after the WTC disaster. You could document my being there because besides the coast guard there couldn&#39;t have been more than a handful of boats in the entire area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what we observed: From my positions sailing from the Naval ships docked at Earle to Keyport NJ (east to west) we saw a perfectly shaped reflective &#34;pill&#34; shaped object that was positioned like a blimp standing on its end. The sky was perfectly clear with a light North to Northwest breeze blowing. The object was absolutely stationary, seemed to be at an altitude of 10K to 15K feet and the approximate size of a blimp. However it looked nothing like a blimp acted nothing like a blimp and I am very familiar with the many blimps in our area. We were extremely upset that entire sailing trip seeing first hand the devistation that had taken place with our own eyes and smelling the acrid smoldering of the WTC all day. We were a bit shocked so the sighting didn&#39;t seem as spectacular as it might have at another time. So, after observing this thing for some 45 min plus the sun lowering seemed to illuminate or reflect twilight making it more and more visible. It then did something that really amazed me. It started to move slowly (relatively slowly depending on its actual size and elevation) and smoothly across the manhattan skyline and straight up the Hudson river (North) at the same altitude until it dissappeared. This thing didn&#39;t move an inch and then she just moved with utter perfection directly AGAINST THE WIND. Not a sound and defied everything I knew about aircraft and proposed military aircraft. I know that the military was flying high altitude CAP at that very time and did not seem to be at all interested in this giant thing hanging over NYC.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like two yellowish spheres which were interconnected by unvisible bonds. I immediately woke up my wife screeming &#34;Look UFO!&#34; And she sow this thing also.She was shocked. I jumped out of my bed and rushed for video camera.I was concerned about the  time and therefore worked quickly . It was pretty cold outside and grass was very wet, inspite I was bearfeeted and shaking I was able to locate the object and pointed the camera on it. Unfortunately comcorder screen blinked once and that showed low battery indicator.I was so upset.Soon object vanished soundless  and I returned back home.Couple days before I was recording my kids on camera and comletely forgot to charge the battery.

I came along the stretch of Highway right before Gladstone where you travel along lake Michigan for about a mile or so and happened to look up at the sky over the bay.  What I saw has changed my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw three very bright lights. I would describe them as being as bright as the brightest stars in the night sky. But these were not stars, satellites, meteors, planes, jets, ball lightning, etc. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of these lights were traveling very fast and turning around each other in a very erratic manner. They would come close to each other and twist around each other making 90 degree turns without slowing down or touching.  These strange maneuvers lasted about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all three lights spread out along the horizon, stopped, and then streaked north simultaneously at a fantastic rate of speed.  Now I have watched the sky for years and have never seen anything like this.  These could not have had human pilots as they should not be able to withstand the forces involved in making 90 degree turns without slowing down (from what I have read the laws of physics would have some problems with this also)or traveling at the speeds I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also seen plenty of aircraft over the years from the KI Sawyer Air Force base north of here when it was still operational and this was nothing like any of those. (It closed in the1990s)   When I had seen this I had thought that this was a once in a lifetime experience but I was wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later as a friend and I walked out of my house at around 2am we both happened to look up and saw one of those same lights speed above us, stop, and then streak north just like the last time except I was below them this time.  I was happy that someone else had seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I don&#39;t know what these lights were but every possible conclusion I come up ! with is somewhat troubling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

She was the witness of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 1 am in the morning. I&#39;m not sure of the exact date, I was sleeping over at my girlfriends house. We had been watching some boxing matches that night and after they had finished we started getting ready for bed. I went on the computer to do some stuff and my girlfriend went outside for a cigarette. We are on the second story of a 4 unit apartment and she went outside on the balcony. The balcony faces in a north-west direction. Her apartment is within one block of the detroit river that seperates windsor and detroit. Let me just say that I have been studying UFO&#39;s for a very long time and in the back of my mind I feel I may have been abducted at about 7 or 8 years  old. But everytime I talk aout UFO&#39;s or the X-files or anyother conspiracy theories she gets upset and tells me to keep it to myself because she didn&#39;t believe any of it and nothing I said could change her mind. Well we&#39;ve been together for 3 years now and I havn&#39;t convinced her of my views one bit and up until the moment she saw the ufo she was in total disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well my girlfriend was sitting out on the balcony for about 2 minutes when I heard her call my name. I didn&#39;t think anything of it and brushed it off. She than called my name again and I thought maybe it would be something going on so just as I was getting up my girlfriend came in the door and told me to come outside. She seemed pretty excited to I rushed right out. When I got out, she was looking up at the sky. As I walked up to her and started looking up she told me that she had seen a black object moving in the sky. Like I said I have followed ufo&#39;s for a long time now so I believed her and started looking for the object. I didnt&#39; see anything in the sky so I went around back and looked around but still didn&#39;t see anything. I looked in every direction but it was gone. When we got back in the apartment she told me that what she saw was a totally black object with no lights at all. She could not describe the shape of it but because of the shape of it she could tell that it was not a plane. It was a very clear night and she said the object wasn&#39;t very high off the ground. So it would easily be below 10,000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we settled down a bit and got back into the house I called the local pigs, whoops, I mean Police. and tried to make a report. I had no Idea who else to call. When I told her that I wanted to report a ufo she started laughing and ridiculing me asking me if I had seen anyone aboard it or anything. I got very offended  and told her that it was a brainwashed responce to ridicule people that witness ufos and laughter and ridicule are the reasons people do not come out with their encounters to the public and than I hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont&#39; know what else to tell you. From the time my girlfriend called my name to the time I got outside was only about 30 seconds to a minute so this wasn&#39;t much of an encounter, but my girlfriend said the object wasn&#39;t moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and if you have any questions please feel free to email me or even call me at 519-((number deleted)). I will get my girlfriend and myself to answer any questions you may have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. In writing this report I hope that you are not connected to the governement in anyway and will just use my stroy in helping with the cover up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are not connected with any government.

I&#39;ve studied botany, zoology, geology, meteorology, astronomy, chemistry and physics, i. e. I have a solid background in the natural sciences. I currently work as a fisheries observer collecting scientific data for the state of Alaska and the federal (US) government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never before seen or reported a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of 9/14/01, while doing a tour of Canada by car, I decided to camp just N of km 85 on the Trans Labrador Hwy (provincial road 389)in the province of Quebec. The nearest town was Baie-Comeau at the beginning of the highway and my campsite was miles from any human habitation in the Laurentian Mountains. I was utterly alone in the Canadian bush and I don&#39;t recall one vehicle passing on the road after about 20:00 hours. My campsite was off a small dirt driveway leading to some high tension power lines about 300 meters to the east (the  driveway was blocked about 10 meters west of my campsite) and about 50 meters off the main paved highway. I was invisible from the road. Directly across the main road was another dirt driveway, very overgrown and rarely used. I walked about one km down this road the next morning looking for signs of human use but saw only one set of very old tire tracks. Clearly no one lived nearby. About 100 meters to the south of my campsite was an intersection with a paved road leading to a hydroelectric project. The road was a T junction and traveled west away from my location. I drove for a mile the next morning on this road and saw no one or any sign of human habitation. The weather was cold with a hard frost occurring on the morning of the 15th. There was not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind. There was complete silence without even the rustle of leaves. After setting up my tent around 20:00, I sat in my car reading under the dome light until right around 22:00 hours. I looked at my watch and decided it was time to turn in. I often admire the skies at night and stood outside doing just that for a few minutes before retiring. A brighter than average yellow &#34;star&#34; just above the horizon (there was a low ridge to the east of me)caught my eye but my first thought was that it was probably Venus. As I watched it, I thought I could see the vague shimmer of green and red lights, obviously a plane in the distance or so I thought. That didn&#39;t explain the yellow light but I didn! &#39;t think of that until later. The odd thing about it was that it wasn&#39;t moving. Planes always move somewhere. This really aroused my curiousity and I grabbed my Minolta 7 x 50 binoculars to get a better look. The object was bright yellow with a pulsating green light on one side and red on the other but completely stationary. As reference points were three pine trees which I thought were near the top of the ridge to the west; since these were in my field of vision with the object I could gauge any movement. The next day I discovered that one of the trees was actually on the roadside about 75 meters from me; the other two were near the top of the ridge. As I studied this thing it began to move very slowly and I then observed a white beam of light (it had almost a bluish tint to it) aimed toward the ground appearing much like a searchlight from a helicopter. I could not see any evidence that it reached the ground. As it moved it moved behind the nearest tree and I expected it to disappear but then it passed in front of this tree which I&#39;d estimated to be about 300 meters away, much closer than I&#39;d imagined. The next morning I discovered that this tree was only about 75 meters from me. I continued to watch it through my binoculars and observed a pair of beams of light shine out from the main orb. Again, they did not appear to reach the ground that I could see and emanated about one diameter from the object before dispersing. The object itself appeared to be between 30 and 45cm (12 to 18 inches) in diameter. When the beams disappeared, a blue light remained in the center of the red and green lights with about an equal intensity. Next the lights quickly faded to a red point of light not more than a couple of inches (5cm) in diameter much like the light of a laser pointer and it began to move like in a laser light show in an erratic fashion like an insect around a night light. The odd thing was that it never moved outside of the silhoette of the tall and narrow pine. After one or two minutes of this unusual behavior, the red l ight changed back to the larger yellow (no other colors reappeared) which slowly moved down and to the north. It slowly disappeared, obscured by the undergrowth, to the roadbed. I only realized the next morning that it was on the road although even when I thought it was 300 meters away, the hair on the back of my neck was standing and I thought of abandoning my tent and coming back in the morning. I doubt if I&#39;d have had the courage to get a closer look. The next morning I thoroughly checked out the entire area looking for any evidence of anything unusual. If one were to do this for Hollywood, how would it be done? The hovering lights could be done by a remote controlled device, possibly an electric motor, but not a sound was heard all night. Nothing and it was dead calm. As for the laser light, there was only one point because of the undergrowth and the height of the sighting where it would have been possible (it was not possible from the road) and that was about 10 meters from my tent surrounded by undergrowth making it impossible to move in complete silence. Also there was no signs of disturbed ground debris or soil, no footprints, no evidence whatsoever. No vehicles passed until early the next morning and I heard no sounds whatsoever so I have to conclude that due to the remoteness of the site and the results of my investigation that the chance of this being an elaborate prank is extremely slim although not impossible. Why would someone go through the trouble? I really don&#39;t think so but if it wasn&#39;t a prank, what the hell was this thing that I studied for 20 minutes with binoculars? I know of nothing in the natural world that would fit the discription of this thing and have no answers.<n>

At the top I stopped at the stop sign and looking west over the tree line I could see bright lights coming in rather low.  My first impression is that it&#39;s an airliner coming in to Cherrry Capital Airport.  It did although seem rather bright and quite low.  I then took a right hand turn, a left onto Harris and then another left onto Cedar Run.  After about 2 miles I came to the top of a hill that overlooks the Cedar Run Golf Course.  At the top of the hill looking towards the southwest I could see a very bright airborne object.  This object was very large and emitted brilliant white light. As I traveled down the hill towards the object in my mind I tried to figure out what it could be.  I knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane because it was not moving, this object was just hovering above the golf course.  I knew it was not a helicopter because it was to large, about the size of a 747.  At the bottom of the hill and coming up next to the golf course I slowed down and rolled down the window.  I could not hear a sound and this is when I started to get scared because I did not know what it was and I had my four year old son in the van with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was just over full grown sugar or red maple trees about 250 feet off the ground. The object was 150 to 200 feet long, 20 to 30 feet tall and probably within 600 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued west on Cedar Run over a hill and 2 people were standing outside looking in the direction of the craft.  I didn&#39;t want to stop because it was still to close and I was afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have stopped at 3 houses since the episode and no one could recall the event.  The people at the house that were looking towards the golf course have since moved.

We were standing on my private road in a dark section of my property, and kind-of pointing out various constellations. I live in a rural section of the mountain/desert areas north of L.A. It was a totally clear night, maybe one or two extremely small bits of cirrostratus cloud, hardly bigger than your finger on an extented arm. There was a small amount of scattered light from the urban areas to the south, but not too much. There was no moon, and the air was pleasant, about 70 degrees. I, and the others, happened to be looking over the mountains to the SE (Mt. Gleason) and there we saw what appeared to be a comet, low on the horizon. I was watching it for about 5-10 seconds, and I said to Anthony, &#34;Is that the comet you&#39;re gonna look at when you set your scope up?&#34; He was looking, too, and he said, &#34;There&#39;s no comet supposed to be there this early in the year,&#34; Well, as we look at it, it gets MUCH brighter, and suddenly seems to surge toward us, passing either into or behind a small cirrostratus wisp of cloud, which lit-up interactively. It continued in a NW direction, very quick, accelerating much faster and glowing much brighter than any plane or chopper. It now appeared to be much lower and closer, maybe 20,000-40,000 feet altitude, somewhere over the San Gabriel Valley. It was approxamately 40 degrees above the horizon. Suddenly it came to an abrupt stop, and just as suddenly shot off to the north for about 2 seconds, it&#39;s sky track paralleling the horizon and covering about the width of your hand with your arm extended out front. Another sudden stop. Another abrupt course shift, back toward us, heading NW. No regular aircraft could withstand the G-force required of such instantaneous manuevers. It then shot hard to the west for another 2 seconds, stopped instantly, glowed incredibly bright, and shot straight up, fading to nothing in about 1.5 seconds. I remember saying, &#34;It&#39;s clearly exhibiting some non-ballistic movements.&#34; It was quite evident this was a strange craft. It glowed like a bright star, with a hint of changing color around the edges. It really didn&#39;t have a shape, per se, but for a star, it did appear... thick, or fat. The star&#39;s disk was bigger than Jupiter on a good night. It also appeared to briefly leave a very faint trail, which disappeared within1/4 second from being laid down, almost making it&#39;s movements look the way pionts of light used to look as seen by old Vidicon tube video cameras with their slight, brief trails.<n>

It was travelling fast and seemed to be blinking or revolving with the sun shining on it. We passed some trees and parked but the object was out of sight.

The sky was clear, and since the sun had not risen yet there were still plenty of stars out. I would bet money that what I saw was actually a meteorites but it seemed very low and it streaked across the sky at a horizontal attitude. My first thought is that if was a UFO, it was over the hood canal or Jefferson County, not more than 10 miles away. It looked just like a star. If it really was 10 miles away, then I would estimate its speed at several thousand miles per hour. It was below the tree line, and visible for not more than one second due to the trees. There was an optical/visual streak effect, because it was going so fast. It was different looking than the average shooting star effect -It was not leaving a dust trail in its wake. I know that sometimes meteorites are much much farther away than they look, which could explain why this one was visible to me going across the sky on a horizontal path. It was going South to North. I&#39;m only reporting this because I&#39;m hoping somebody on Whidbey Island or Vancouver BC saw the same thing come their way and maybe saw more than one seconds&#39; worth of it. I&#39;ve seen a lot of shooting stars before, but never any running parallel to the earth, you know? I dunno, I suppose it could happen - let me know what you think.<n>

I noticed a red flickering light and asked my husband if it was a planet. He said no and we both assumed it was an airplane. The weird thing was that it wasn&#39;t moving and it definately had a strange light pattern. My husband brought out his telescope and managed to get it in the sights. There was a bright white light and seemingly colored lights (red, blue, green) appeared to swirl around the white light. The craft was completely stationary from what we could tell.  It did eventually move further west very very gradually. An airplane of some sort (seemed like a commercial airliner) did fly from east to west directly over the craft.  The reason my interest was piqued at all was that a friend told me she saw a ufo the night before in the Duvall sky so I was keeping an eye out for anything unusual.  My husband, who&#39;s very skeptical, even seemed to think that the craft was something highly unusual. Not your normal airplane definately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to know whether the object disappeared from sight after the 15 minutes of observation indicated by the witness.

Previous to then the sky was pretty busy since we live under flight paths for the Oakland airport. I live near town about .2 mi. from dowtown lights, so the sky is not extremely black. I noticed a line of different colored lights, one white, one red, and one amber. As I watched them float across my path at approx 60-70 degrees line of sight angle, from where I was standing, I realized that the lights were disappearing as it was approaching directly overhead and that a section of the sky and stars were being blocked out immediately behind the line of lights, It was as if the original lights I saw were on the top and front of some solid object and when it floated by my view of the lights was obstructed as well as the sky. The patch of darkness behind this line of lights was approx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4&#34; x 4&#34; at arm&#39;s length. I could not really discern any specific shape but I want to say triangle. There was absolutely no sound even though it appeared to be quite close and it gave the impression it was floating. Since I don&#39;t know how far away it actually was I don&#39;t know how fast it was going but it travelled across approx. 110 degrees of arc above me until I lost the blackness in the night sky. I kept looking for flashing strobes or red and green wing lights but to no avail. I had wondered if stealth fighters were flying around patrolling the skies around us after such an event on 9/11, but unless they had all their traditional  flying lights off and they can fly without sound, I don&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a very objective, aware and observant 53 yr old electrical design engineer.

The craft was about 20 miles away above a Air Force called Wright Patterson AFB. The craft was really just a very bright light, thats why I said the shape was unknown. I said there were possibly 2 because the craft moved around for about 30 seconds and then it disappered, and then re-appeared, so I don&#39;t know if this was the same craft or a second. I believe if you check under September 13, 2000 in this database you will find a report of a UFO over Wright Patterson sighted at 9:00 p.m.<n>

I turned toward the source and was amazed to see what appeared to be a pulsating golden &#39;coil&#39; or &#39;spring&#39; - it was a big coil perhaps three to four feet in height - it was less than 90&#39; away and was at a height of approximately 25-30 feet.  It appeared to be floating very slowly down.  This coil was a golden colored and oulsed coils from a &#39;cats eye color&#39; to a brighjt bright gold.  There may have been a diaphanous film around the coil - it all happened so fast Unfortunetly when I gave it my full attention - attempting to focus on it - it disappeared or more appropriately evaported like a mirage. This phenomena appeaed in a southwesterly direction and was quite close to me.  It could only have been at most three to four seconds from the time I saw the flash until the time the coil disappeared.<n>

It began to move west as I approached the intersection of Routes 7 and 164. It was at this point that I got a good look at it. In the middle of the thing was a sunset-orange, horizontally oriented rectangular light. It shone relatively brightly and had a solar quality, like the sun in its setting position. Set directly above and below the orange light were 2 smaller horizontal rectangles, powder blue in color and dimmer in comparison to the middle of the object. On the top and bottom object were singular, whitish lights blinking on and off about twice a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it closely for around a minute, it began to head directly towards the west, kind of quickly in my opinion, and hung frozen on the distant horizon. Eventaully, I lost sight of it because of the terrain of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first night planes were allowed back in the sky since the attacks on 9/11, so I was shocked to see such a unconventional thing in the sky sharing airspace with several other visible, normal looking aircraft. I thought perhaps it was a blimp, but have seen them at night before, and this object looked quite dissimilar. Plus it moved way too fast for such a thing. I then thought it was military, but if it was, taxpayers should be mad because this thing looked functionless and of the dumbest design compared to any other military craft I have ever seen. I doubt it was a helicopter since I could see no solid outline anywhere and the object was void of any kind of noise that I could here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an experienced television director so I am used to making quick, detailed observations. I just want to say that the object I saw could have a conventional explanation, but none that I could come up with.<n>

I immediately noticed a really bright &amp; large silver object with two really bright spotlight looking white circle lights side by side, it was hovering in the lower horizon straight N. It looked like it had an erie glow all around it, it was huge. I watched it for 2 mins. It just hovered in same spot. I kept turning around looking for coworkers to come out &amp; everytime I looked at it—it had not moved. Then finally a coworker came out &amp; he finally saw it &amp; not long after that it took off almost streight up to a very steep climb to the West &amp; was gone really quick. (It was a really high climb &amp; a steep angle climb for a usual airplane to make). It also left a contrail at about a 60° angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living &amp; working close to the airport I am used to seeing airplanes at all altitudes &amp; all kinds. That WAS NO AIRPLANE.

It was dark &amp; he said he noticed something in sky really bright with lights similar to an airplane but knew it was no airplane &amp; kept watching it—it also seemed to hover &amp; flying erraticaly Going N then S then suddenly making really strange turns that a normal  airplane could not make. He pulled off road &amp; got out of car looking at it &amp; it took off really quick. (I would guess he saw same thing only 2 hours later in the dark)<n>

I was waiting for the bus when this occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was two days after 9/11 and there was a no-fly zone over the entire country.  I was looking up thinking that this may be the only time in my life that I might see the sky with no aircraft in it at all.  I noticed a metallic looking sphere(ish) object sort of darting around very high up.  It was so small that I could barely see it.  It was moving about in sort of a random pattern much likr a bird might, not taking up too much of the sky in its movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw another and another until there were maybe 5-7 up there.  They appeared to be maybe chasing each other.  It really could have been birds by their movements but I couldn&#39;t see any wings and they were so small that, if they were birds, they would have been very high.  And, if they were birds and very far away (to appear so small) then they would have been moving really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man that I did not know was next to me and noticed me looking up.  He saw it also.  The bus came and after I got out I could not see them again.

I know this because the plane flew behind the object. As the plane was moving the object was not. MY first reaction was disbelief. I did not take my eyes off the object. It was cigar shaped, silver.It engulfed the airplane as the airplane flew behind the object. It did not move. It seemed the sun was shinning on it but the shape was very defined. The plane kept moving and the object was still.I counted 11 as I was thinking this has to be real because the airport has just opened, no blimps, no small aircraft, no helicopters were allowed.Then as I blinked it was gone. I stood there thinking no one will believe me. And, I have not told anyone except my husband until now.<n>

The sky was clear and there was little or no wind.  Another item worth noting is that because of the World Trade Building attack there was no air traffic.  This item was north west of me and looked to be a mile away.  The item was silver in color and seemed to be disc shaped.  I watched this item for about five minutes.  During this time the item would fly level and then turn on edge.  It did this many times.  When it would turn on edge the sun would shine off of it and I could tell that it was disc shaped.  I could hear no sound.  For a while it looked like the item was not moving but finally it moved off in a north west direction.<n>

It was raining and cloudy, so the craft was reasonably low (less than 1000 feet I would guess). It moved relatively slow (compared to a commercial jet).  It made no sound.  I was biking to work and noticed it in the sky.  I stopped to watch it, and heard nothing (even after it had disappeared from sight behind buildings).  Plus, there were no commercial aircraft permitted to fly yesterday morning, because of the terrorist attacks in the US. The two things that seemed strange to me, was the fact that there was no sound (and it wasn&#39;t as if there was a lot of traffic on the roads to drown it out), and the pattern of the lights.<n>

They caught my eye because there were no planes flying at that time due to the terrorist attacks.  I went outside to get a better look.  They were far brighter than any of the surrounding stars.  They were aligned at the same latitude, about 40 degrees up.  The one on the right was blinking, the one on the left was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were stationary for the most part, however the one on the right seemed to &#34;jiggle&#34;.  I grabbed my Sony 8mm video camera from inside and went back out and started filming.  I tried several times to zoom in on the one on the right which was more active, but the digital zoom had difficulty focusing on it.  However, the video does show some interesting things.  First, when I zoomed in on the object on the right it is blurry but you can clearly see the changing colors - white, red, green, gold changing very rapidly.  Second, there is a point when the object on the right can clearly be seen moving quickly from left to right, then stopping and remaining stationary.   Several people have watched the video and agree that it does not look or behave like stars, planets, orbiting satellites, or aircraft.  I went back to bed with the objects still up there, so I do not know how long they remained.  Have not seen them since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the objects are not inconsistent with celestial bodies, perhaps &#34;twinkling&#34; stars.  PD))<n>

After not seeing anything on the night of 9/11/02.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped over a friends house the following evening (9/12/02) and after talking about it we headed outside at approximately 20:00 to 20:10 hours the skies were completely clear with quite a few stars and by luck within a few minutes of heading outside we both at the same time sighted (2) two lights moving in tandem with the southern light trailing the northern light at a distance of about one inch in relation to a thumb and forefinger of an out-stretched hand, I approximated them to be at orbital heights and speeds moving from East to West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediatley considered them to be satellites due to their speed and brightness but thought it was odd that they were traveling in such close proximity to each other and at that instance the trailing southern light grew much brighter almost blueish in intensity than the northern light and suddenly burst ahead of the northern light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following this, the northern light also grew brighter and jumped ahead of the southern light,this occured at about the 1 o&#39;clock position and as they crossed to about the 2 o&#39;clock position they both began a counter clockwise spiral rotation around each other as if they were playing follow the leader.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We first picked up the objects up at approximately the 11 o&#39;clock position and followed them through to just past the 2 o&#39;clock position before loosing them in the light pollution of our city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time my friend and I were calling out to each other verifying what we each were seeing to be sure we were really seeing these objects and I specifically recall the excitment from both of us when the spiral maneuvers began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an aircraft mechanic and a longtime aerospace/aircraft buff and have been employed by NASA since the mid 1990&#39;s, so I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable regarding aircraft/aerospace and I have on many occasions located, tracked and viewed various satellites and the Intermational Space Station this is why I had determined the objects to be of a orbital height and speed in relation to the time it was taking them to cross the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the entire duration of this event there was no detectable noise and at the estimated heights it was impossible to determine if there was any type of shape associated with the two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I remember the exact date of this because it happened the day after the tragedy of September 11th, when all the planes were still grounded--well, I should say they were supposed to be grounded.  My wife had went two houses down to visit some of my relatives and I can see the house from my house.  We had been having a problem with some drug addicts that were living down the street breaking into peoples cars at night and since this was around 10pm, I didnt want her to walk up on them by herself so I was sitting outside waiting for her in case she ran into any trouble.  I am an amateur astronomer and as any of us can tell you, a &#34;no fly&#34; zone is a dream come true.  So I am outside with all my lights turned out and I am sitting at the end of my deck facing that house my wife went to thats maybe 300 yards away and I just happen to look up and sitting there over my head, maybe 3000 or 4000 feet up (hard to tell because it was night) was this light, just sitting there.  It was a good size, maybe 1/15 the visual size of the full moon.  No sound, no movement, just stillness, and like a small breeze blowing through the trees suddenly.  I could tell it wasnt a planet or star, it was definantly something in our atomosphere.  As I looked at it, the light drew up--like the way the cornea of you eye draws up when you walk from a dark room to the outside on a sunny day.  It was still barely there, you almost had to not look at it to see it, it was so dim.  Then the dim light took off towards the southeast at an AMAZING speed--it had to be going faster than the speed of sound, but there was no sonic boom.  I have never saw anything move like this. I dont know of any military craft that could go from a hovering position to the speed of sound OR MORE within a second.  I am wondering if anyone else saw this craft around that date.

It danced around and moved up and down in a triangle patern extremly fast. we watched it till 1am. When I arrived home in Henryville, IN. It was probably around a quarter til 2. My boyfriend and I went to the state forestry down the street. We took a telescope and binoculars. There we witnessed a least seven of these objects dance around and flash lights like they were talking to each other. They seemed to stay in star formations. Anytime a plane would go over they would move towards it as if watching the plane. We saw several military planes go over us. One made no noise at all. These things had flashing lights all around them almost as if they were planes. They would get bright and then dim and occasionaly move together at same speeds and movements. They made sharp turns and triangle patterns they were definately trying to stay in formation at all times. We watched two appear out of nowhere. There was a larger ship that showed up later and they all went crazy moving and flashing. There were so many someone must have seen something. We also video taped part of the experience in Louisville.<n>

We went to Wal-Mart to get some stuff that we needed, and to stimulate the economy in any small way we could.  When we were driving back, and neared our home, at McGuire Air Force Base, we saw three, black, triangular shaped ufo&#39;s. Now, remember, all air traffic was shut down at that time.  So, we were confused to see aircraft flying so low and close to the road.  They were about 100 yards from the road, or less.  There were three aircraft, just above the tree line.  All three ufo&#39;s had round, very bright lights at all three points.  They were moving very slowly, and rotated circularly at the same time.  There was no noise being generated, it was completely quiet.  I pulled the car over, got out, walked around the car and into the field.  It was awesome, I was so happy to see them.  I wanted to run out into the field to get a better look, but my wife started panicing, telling me to get back in the car or she was going to leave without me, now I wish I would have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later we found out that the flight line at McGuire AFB was shut down at the same time we saw the ufo&#39;s, and F-16 fighters were sent out to investigate, freaky!  Talk about an awesome experience, great!  My wife and I both think it is obvious that they were observing what was going on, with the events of 911, and our sudden stop of daily routines.  Keep looking up in the sky, you never when you might see a ufo, awesome!<n>

I went out side and noticed what looked to be a slow blinking light and assumed it was a radio tower. Then I realized  there was no radio towers in the direction I was looking,  I also realized the object was way to high for a radio tower.  It had the brightness of a white strobe, with the exception that it blinked on and off at a much slower rate, more of a fast fadeing glow on and off, at it&#39;s full size it was the size of a large house.The time was late afternoon, but still clear enough to see that there was nothing visible at all when the white light blinked or glowed off. It was staying in the same spot so I decided to run as close as I cloud to see it better, after about a mile I cloud see that there was a large grey cloud it was sitting in and as the object pulsed off and on I noticed a strange purple static energy that seemed to be directly around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now things get interesting.....  As I&#39;m standing there I hear a loud roar and I look up and I&#39;m astonished to see a US Coast Guard Falcon jet flying as fast as It can right over my head and I mean right over me VERY low and hauling tail toward the object. I jumped and yelled &#34;yeah! go get&#39;em!&#34;  as astonished and excited as anyone cloud imagine. As the Falcon reached the object, the glowing object rapidly went out and was gone, the Falcon jet made a number of slower circles around where the object had been and then left the area in the opposite direction that it came from originally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you didn&#39;t know the Coast Guard Falcon is more of a recon aircraft, it has no weapons, I&#39;m sure it was there to try and identify the object and attempt to get it to land if possible. Again this took place during the time period where there were no civilian aircraft flying due to the 9/11 no-flying restriction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This event triggered my curiosity as to seeing if I could spot any other aircraft overhead as time working in the yard passed by. At approximately 2:15pm I noticed a shimmering object in the sky and instinctively went for my binoculars thinking I would see another airliner. What I focused in on was not in my opinion an airliner. It changed shape and color,and disappeared/reappeared frequently.I have no idea what its altitude was,but it was close enough to distinguish shapes and colors in the binoculars.For approx. 15 min it did not change in size or position, so it was obviously stationary.It changed from glowing metallic to a blood red fireball every 2-3 seconds, then disappeared and reappeared in its same position every 5-10 seconds.When it changed to the fireball, it seemed to look as if the fireball was surrounded by a black ring.(I know it sounds like an afterburner from an f-15 but jet fighters move quickly and this stayed in place for 15 min. with no change in size or position.)No audible sound was heard. In the process of setting up a telescope to get a closer look, I asked my wife if she would keep an eye on it but it disappeared before I could get a focus on it with the telescope. My connection at Newark Airport informed me there were no other flights in the area at that time. If anyone else saw a similar event at or near this time, please post it. I know I&#39;m not the only one who has been looking up since 9/11/01.<n>

I felt compeled to look directly up and noticed a kids round mylar(bluish)balloon drifting by at about 15 mph @ 150&#39; and rising while it was heading to the head of the bay.While I was watching the ballon I noticed directly the right of the ballon a most peculiar shape that seemed to defy description.It was pacing the balloon as it went along about 40&#39; -50&#39; away from it.It appeared to be 30&#39;- 40&#39;circular.....damn hard to describe.I&#39;ll have to use an analogy.Take a frisbee, construct it out of cellaphane. Remove the top centre flat portion leaving just the edge.This transparent circular thing was becoming more visable in someplaces and hardly visable in others about it&#39;s circumference.It was kind of like the edge was rolling up and then unrolling as it paced the kids balloon.As the balloon slowly stalled and just floated higher the circular phenomenon&#39;s visability just tapered off to nothing.It was truly spooky,I would have photographed it had I the chance. P.S. when I first noticed the kids ballon I was wishing that the poor souls and victims of the hijackings in the U.S. could find some solace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I believe we spoke with this witness, and we found him to be quite sincere and seemingly credible.

We saw about six UFOs that looked like stars high in the sky coming from opposite directions meeting together above us.  They came together and made shapes then the shapes would spin and they would all take off back from were they came from.  They repeated this process over and over again for about an hour.  There were a few air planes that passed by way closer to the ground than the UFOs in that time.  You could tell the UFOs were going 100 times faster.

And at that time is when the object was moving slowly and moved and the sun light move off of it and thats when their it was a sauser disk spening and wobbling over my neiborhood.And i know i could not have been the only one to see this but never heard anyone else that day on TV or radio mention the incedent.  And it was not a plane because all planes were grounded for days,so i know it was not that.Also i! was not that far from it I mean it was right their clear as day showing it self to me and how ever else may have seen it.  So why do you think they showed their self the day after 9/11.  I think it was to say we did this, and were in charge and thers nothing us humans can do. P.S SACTOWN...<n>

Within 15 minutes I saw three aircraft.  Two looked the same, very far away or high up and blinking in the same manner; I assume those are the F16s patroling Colorado airspace tonight. (Due to the terrorist attacks). But the third one was strange!!  I first noticed it at the same time I saw the second F16. They were both flying in the same direction- west - nice and horizontally. The F16 was ahead.  Then all of a sudden the third craft made an abrupt upward turn and flew in a very straight line directly upwards. After about 7 to 10 seconds, it made another sharp turn eastward.  And it continued eastward until it was out of my view (about 7 seconds or so) WHATWUZZIT??!! It had a red flash of color in it but basically was just a regular white light like a plane or a star. It, too, seemed very very far away or high up, just a very small dot. I&#39;ve seen falling and shooting stars, and meteors. It wasn&#39;t either of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness means 12SE01.  We have amended the date.  PD))<n>

I am not much of a sky watcher so I just thought I had never noticed this before. As I was looking at them one of them suddenly shot across the sky it looked like a white tear drop, then it was gone. This was too large to be a shooting star.what I had thought was a star I was looking at before I saw the white tear drop was then gone. There was no sound and no colored lights.

I might not have taken notice of this except there were no planes supposed to be in the sky after the events of the day.  We initally noticed one light that was white and small, at first glance it looked like a star. It was due west. It was flashing not twinlking, one single white light then we could see three vertical lights, two white and the one in the center was red, the lights were in a row vertically.  It appeared to drop very quickly from what I assume to be a very high altitude and moved from side to side, almost insect like in it&#39;s movements. This is what raised the hairs on our necks, it was not swamp gas, a harrier jet or military planes, it&#39;s movements were like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen. Ever. It continued to come down all the while flashing it&#39;s red light every so often. Finally it got to be too low in the tree line to see. Then after watching it for so long I noticed movement in the sky to the northwest, my husband and I identified this second object same as the first, it was moving in sequence with another light and another.  We made out three triangular formations in the sky comming from the north and going west. Each point of the triangle was a seperate moving and flashing entity.  Then it started to change into a circular pattern and the second light began the same descent pattern as the first.  This one appeared to be larger than the first, there was a quick white flash from it that went towards the other lights, we could tell they were headed away from us (west).  Eventually they became to small to watch and were gone.  There was no sound. Just as an after thought, at one point while watching the first light it became three lights and moved as if it went upside and back, more than once.  It was just the way it moved that set it apart from anything logical and reasonable.  My husband and I are not the type of people who go looking for this or frequent UFO websites but this was real and not of us.<n>

I live in Colon, MI. (85.19deg west, 41.57deg north). The time was about 22:10 when he reported to me that he saw a plane in the sky. I went to his room to see, thinking this odd as all of the airports had been shut down. I have seen airplane lights before, they strobe a a regular, even rate and have a red light on one wing, a blue light on the other and a white light amid-ship somewhere. What I saw was a slow moving craft with randomly flashing blue, red, and white lights all along the edge of the craft. We then ran outside to get a better view. It was moving due west from a point south east of my position. As it came parallel to our position I did a angle check by hand (a trick I learned in astronomy class) I found that it was about 30 degrees above the horizon over due south. I could not judge its distance as I realized that I was not dealing with just any standard aircraft, and these things could really be any size. I could not detect any sound coming from the craft. But, as I said, I have no idea how far the craft was from my position. As it neared the western horizon I noticed that the only steady lights on the craft were two white rear lights. One on each rear point. I don&#39;t know if there have been any other reports of the sighting, but I offer mine as more proof that this type of craft exists. My theory is that they may have been interested as to why there were no other aircraft in the air over one of the busiest air traffic continents on this planet.<n>

I called the police dept. and they told me people had been calling it in.  I told him I saw 2 jets fly above and beneath it.  He said they were X-16&#39;s out of a nearby military base.  They also sent out several small planes to investigate it.  At 12:30 am the sirens went off in Arlington Center 3 times.  Around 1:00 am I noticed there were no more colors coming off of them, then they were gone.  I heard the planes a few times while I lay in bed trying to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the description of the object is not inconsistent with that of a celestial body, probably a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.

I saw a bright round light high in the sky above me.  I thought it was a meteor at first.  It was speeding in my direction when it stopped above me still high in the sky &amp; hung there for a second then sped off to the south.  I have seen many meteors &amp; it was the same brightness.

We saw two Air Force Jets in single file heading toward Otis Air Force Base in Cape Cod. They were fairly close together and in quite a hurry. Approxamatly one minute after these jets flew out of sight, my friend pointed out a circular object orange in color moving at an enormous rate of speed across the open sky. It seemed to zigzag and dance across the sky as if it was intelligent, and then disapeared behind some trees. Ive never seen anything as fast as this in mid air. About ten min past and we kept looking in amazment for anything else when the same object came across the sky again from the east to south west with the same speed and spiratic movement, and again disapeared behind some trees. This is what we seen and Im sticking to it.<n>

We observed them through bionoculars and saw 9 objects that hovered, pulsated with light ranging from green to red light. These were not commercial craft...because all planes were grounded on this day 9/11/2001. They seemed not to move, perhaps only slightly...appearing to get smaller or larger in size, only slightly. The light changed in a free flow manner from one color to another. They all appeared to be the same size, with the exception of one, which was larger, bright yellow light. There was some &#39;hazing&#39; around some of these objects. One object was much larger in the southern sky...it was light colored. The others with the colored lights hovered in the westerly and northern sky areas. These sightenings occured after the tradgey in NYC...that same night. They hovered over 9/12/01 as well...the next evening in approx the same positions by 5 different people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous, save for an e-mail contact.  PD))<n>

From about 2100 hours we watched a tight group (seemingly on a single object) of three colored lights remain roughly stationary for about 3 hours (when we stopped checking) in the sky (about 10 oclock high) to the North-East (visible from SE Seattle, from ridge above south end of Lk. Washington). The colors were a distinct green, red and white.  They moved just slightly, relative to each other, indicating some small movement, but over the period of viewing, the object stayed basically stationary in what was seemingly a hover pattern from our distance (up close, maybe a tight circle?).  We were interested in particular due to the total grounding of all civilian aircraft that night.  The size of the lights and intensity was about right for a planet, but the lack of move over time ended that thought for us (as well as the sharply varying colors). I would be very interested to find out what this was...I ended up guessing a military object of some kind doing some sort of surveillance in light of the NY City attack...but, the stationary nature of the object and duration of presence confounded me.  Can anyone help with ideas here?<n>

Within a few minutes of observation the lights dissappeared. Within a minute or two the lights began flashing again a far distance from where they were 1st seen. The flashing lights were traveling North to South then they would turn around and travel South to North. At one point the lights stopped flashing however I was still able to make out a faded red glow from what ever it was traveling across the sky. This has gone on for over 1 hour when I seen a steady red light traveling West to East at a very fast speed, much faster than any jet at that hight, any jet I am familiar with that is. Within minutes I seen a steady white light traveling in the East from NorthWest to SouthEast. My wife 2 children, neighbor and wife and his 2 children all witnessed this. I even recorded this on my video recorder. The reason we were outside is we lost power from around 6:30 to around 8:30 or so. My family and neighbors were all outside with flashlights, that is why so many people witnessed this. I went outside and the lights are still circling above turning on and off several times...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The lights may have been navigation lights on military aircraft patrolling the skies over the U.

On 9/11/2001 at approximately 20:30 I was walking my two dogs.  There were no airplanes flying this day because of the terrorist attack, except for military jets from Luke Air Force base.  I just came around the corner and between two homes I saw a bright light coming toward the homes in front of me.  I thought it was the police helicopter flying with their search light on.  I watched the light get closer to me and there it was just hovering over the neighborhood homes.  It was just there, no sound coming from it at all.  The two dogs never reacted to this object.  It hovered for just a few minutes and then it took off, straight up and the started to head west.  This is exactly what I had seen in the sky two days earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most interesting thing was the lack of noise or any sound coming from this object.

We went outside, the sky was so clear, and to the west was a white streak of light, similiar to a contrail, but not dissipating as they do.  It was visible for about 15 minutes and just disappeared gradually. I saw that Bolingbrook also lost their power which is about 35 miles from me.  I never found out what caused the power outage. but it was light outside and power was back on by 8 or 8:30. There was nothing about the outage in the local papers either.

It has taken me some time to actually believe what I have seen with my own eyes. On the day of the WTC attack, I went to spend some time with a cousin of mine and my wife at my cousin&#39;s residence in Bradley Beach, NJ. We could see the smoke from the fires in Manhatten and were all looking up at the sky, as most people were that day. We were astounded when we saw what first appeared to be an airliner in the sky, but our moods quickly switched when we realized that what we were looking at was much larger than a commercial aircraft. It was somewhat cigar/diamond/elongated shaped and appeared to be rotating like a football in flight. It was not anything that I had ever seen before, or since. The object was also moving at a tremendous amount of speed and I cannot say for sure if it was changing colors or if the rotation was causing the sun to reflect off of the hull in a brilliant white light. The object, from my best guess, had to be approximately 35 to 50 thousand feet up, and once it started to move southward, it moved with a speed I have never witnessed before. There was no sound, and I quickly lost sight of it. We had all thought that maybe it was some kind of military aircraft, but none like any of us had ever seen. And I have yet to see the military design an aircraft that large or that fast.<n>

When we were running we could tell by how our shadows had shifted and moved to in front of us (rather than to the left) that they were following us.  We ran and ran as they stayed aproximatly the same distance behind us when we then hid in a cave that was along the side of the rood.  The next day those of us who lived nearby woke up to go to work and found that we must have walked in our sleep and hurt our noses (our pillows had a little blood on them) which we think must have been a psychological effect from taking in the fearsome sight of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Nothing more was said but the last two days (Oct. 8 and 9th) in Las Vegas, NV while viewing Telemundo, a major Spanish speaking channel, there has been much airing of the footage, actually extended over what what shown during the day of the event.  This time it was being commented on in Spanish and shown on the screen was the object, a disk shaped, silverish object, quite large, seemingly the size of a couple of busses seen to be hovering between the towers, after the first airplane hit, but before the first tower collapsed and before the second airplane crashed.  The footage was being shot from a close by helicopter and narrated in English by a female newscaster. She pointed out the object to the cameraman with a startled &#34;look over there, what is that&#34;.  The cameraman&#39;s comment was much more graphic, such as &#34;what the **** is that?!&#34;  He filmed it for a few seconds and then the disk shot out from between the buildings and directly towards them.  The woman sounds like she is exclaiming, screaming slightly and the camera guy says something and actually leans back and films from a reclining angle as the object careens rapidly up and past them.  This footage has been aired several times and each time seeing it it&#39;s quite startling.  My original comment to the kids before seeing it was that it must be some kind of secret surveillance craft that we have and don&#39;t want anyone to know about but upon viewing it, one just can&#39;t believe that we have such a capacity.  I&#39;ve seen the comments from around the world of people who viewed something like this and would like to have this investigated.  Is there some sort of news blackout that has prevented this particular shot from being re-aired in the U.S.  Interestingly today it was announced that Sony is buying this network.  Maybe the type of freely decided upon ! news for mat will be curtailed.  Hope not, because this is really happening and people deserve to have some sort of explanation - if only to be told that the government is aware of, or acknowledging this as &#34;real&#34;. We typically don&#39;t watch this channel, but our son does at times. We&#39;ve had the video tape in since then, to record this footage if it airs again, but it must be public record somewhere that your agency can investigate.  My husband even advised me not to write because it was so frightening.  Any comments?<n>

It looked like a light from a jet plane. The light appeared over the Ocean north, north-east and was very low over the water. There were no other boats or planes in the area that I could see, but it was still dark at this time in the morning. I immediately got a bad feeling about the light when it did not move like an aircraft it hovered over the ocean. I wanted to think it was a hellicopter, but the light was so big, so bright and low to the water. I have seen several hellicopters from the medical flight copters, life guard, coast guard to some aircraft choppers that come out of Jacksonville Navy base, and this was like none I had ever seen. I know there is a military copter that can hover but it has a forceful airflow beneath it and it makes a great deal of noise. I believe if it was that type of aircraft, I could of heard the sound or seen water being forced up from the ocean, but it did neither. When I made a turn off A1A onto state road 100 (going west) the light moved over the ocean to the side of my car just above the tree line and stayed directly to the side of my car past I-95 through the city of Bunnell about ten miles from where I turned off A1A. In Bunnell state road 100 turns to the north north-west and when I made this turn it again aligned up with the right side of my car, and fallowed me again. I lost sight of it behind some trees about 3 miles after the turn. Given the events of that day I did nothing to follow up on it. But, about three weeks later while driving home I heard the Rush Limbaugh show and he mentioned seeing a huge bright light in the sky about 1/2 hour after I first seen the light. He, I believe, lives about 6 hours by car south of where I live. I wrote into his show, but never got a reply. And, until I found the UFO reporting center, I never mentioned it to anyone else, but would love to know what it was I saw and if anyone else seen the same light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happen to live close to Whiteman AFB. Ever since Sept. 11, the B-2 has been flying non-stop around the skys. When the FAA grounded all planes, military planes flew around all the time. The B-2 flys over my house all the time, but does at 2 and 3am every single morning. I have noticed that the B-2 does weird stuff like hovers in the air and flys with out making a sound sometimes. I live outside of town, so I see a lot more stuff than some people see. I have also seen a lot of aircraft that I couldn&#39;t reconize. I know almost every single jet the US flys, but some of the ones I&#39;ve seen lately are different from anything I&#39;ve seen. One night there was these two jets that circled the town for about two hours. They looked kind of like A-10s, but not quite like them. they flew in some weird patterns, and I swear to this day that I caught one that was flying, stopped in the sky, and went in reverse for awhile. Well anyway, if anyone wants to see some weird stuff, come out around Whiteman AFB and wait for it to get a little dark.<n>

Then there was a bright red light in a consecutive pattern. Then they dis appeared. Then came the rest of the group (9 crafts) which came over at about the speed of 30 to 35 km per hourthey were about 500 meters long but these did not blend into the sky as well as the first group. Then 8 of the group disappeared but the 9th stayed and after a minute or two it landed. Then I and the other 7 people in my hiking group went to go see what was going on. When we got there we saw 50 or more short green-greyish creatures that seemed to be testing and examining the area. Then after an hour the creatures loaded back up into their space craft and took off into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was 9/11 the date of the world trade center bombing...i was hanging out with 2 of my friends talking about the incident that happen during the day..., we were outside my house in the front lawn having a cigarette to close out the night before going to bed....when my one friend pointed out the fact that this is one of the only nights you&#39;ll ever see the stars with no planes flying around, cause all air-ways were banned due to the new york bombing..., so were all looking up at the stars like wow......when i notice a brighter than normal star....i thought it was the north star, but then my friend pointed out otherwise, showing me the real north star......so there we were watching this brighter than normal star twinkle, but it started to flash....it flashed a couple of times, and pulsed and then started to zig zag around in the sky...and there was no sound whatsoever..(no engine noise, or anything)..it would zig zag at extreme angles and then stop.....and then zig zag some more.....and at this time....i noticed 3 different colored lights around it...blues and reds, .couldn&#39;t tell if the lights were in a triangle position or circuler....but they where definitly spinning around the center &#34;brighter star&#34; that was flashing and pulsing....we were watching it zig zag around, when all of a sudden in a split second, it beemed across the oposite side of the sky. We almost thought that it disspeared but then saw it flashing at the other end of the sky...By now, we were extremely excited and in shock.....It pulsed a little more, then slowly disapeared like it was fading backwards....then it was gone. About 5 seconds after that 2 fighter jets came roaring from the far side of the sky (it was loud and thunderous) and they circled the area twice before flying away....<n> <n><n> <n><n> and this was all on the night where there was supposed to be NO airplanes in the sky at all..and no aircraft allowed......so me and my 2 friends were completely amazed...<n> <n><n> <n><n> then next day we told everyone..and of course no one believed us....so i write here today to see if any other people in the southern philadelphia suburb area saw this or witnessed it too...i am completely serious about my report....or i wouldn&#39;t have taken the time to write this...cause i am an extremely busy person..., and it took me until now, to finally surf the net to try to find out if others had seen the same thing that night on 9/11/01<n>

There were no lights, but it reflected light, signs, and even a light from a radio tower it went bye.  It looked almost exactly like the Bedhampton UFO that was video taped.

Instantly, it bolted up, which had to have been hundreds or thousands of feet considering the distance it was from me, then bolted to the right and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  I consider myself a very logical person and a hardcore skeptic, but this was extrememly odd.  There was no way it was a meteor entering our atmosphere because of the angles in which it moved.  Falling stars don&#39;t sit still, then all of a sudden fly north, then just that quickly, fly west, then disappear. It was not a plane or aircraft that could be operated by humans because at the speed this thing moved, they&#39;d be killed by the G Forces.

The V was much larger than an aircraft or a satillite would be at that altitude and the lights were much dimmer than the Phoenix lights, they were almost grey like dim stars.  If I held my thumb out at arms length like in &#39;The Right Stuff&#39; the formation was about one to one and a half thumbs wide.  This was the night before 9/11 which is why I remember the date so well, I thought maybe the visitors! were here to witness the events of 9/11. I made an computer animation of what I seen and reported it to MUFON but never heard back probably because 9/11 was succh a hectic time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I am a Navy Veteran electronics data systems tech, my civilian background is engineering fiber optic outside plant networks and ROV electronics.

The lights travelled 75% of the sky in 4-6 seconds before disappearing into the blur of the Portland lights. The altitude seemed to be higher than a commercial aircraft and lower than a satellite.

They were sitting there smoking and comversing mostly between themselves. I was just sitting there to show my presence to show her boyfriend that I still liked his company even though their relationship of two years had recently broken up and had left everyone concerned,not knowing exactly how to address each other now! I just happened to be looking to the eastern sky when I saw a brilliant bright light in traditional flight lane over Fairborn, Ohio. I ws looking at it over some power lines that run over my back yard. The light moves up slightly over the power line and seemed to hover there, in relation to the power line and my direction of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within abo;ut two minutes I saw a light approach this brilliant light from the southern sky. It was headed at a normal aircraft pace to the place that the bright light was hovering. The light from the south sky approached the position where the brilliant light was and it moved straight up as if the jet(I&#39;m thinking) passed it by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a jet with lights blinkiing like an emergency vehicle and headed towards the bright light flew from what I surmise as around Wright Patterson field, which is close to where I live,at a &#34;bat outa hell&#34; pace and sped off toward the position of the light that is still in my vision over the power line in my back yard. When this jet approached this area something very strange happened. The brilliant light turned red and seemed to change into  not one but two  pulsating red lights and and just blinked out. The jet seemed to fly right past where it was....and we never seem the brilliant light nor the pulsating lights again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we talked about what we had seen, I told my daughter that she probably had just leen her first ufo.

Being after dusk the craft&#39;s colour was probably not dark but what I witnessed were several unmistakable dome shaped very dimly lit round  lights? large amber - brown on the underside of this craft in a definite formation. I remember doing everything physically possible to gain another second of vision. As I climbed the hand rail of my deck and held on to the house I could see it&#39;s tail end slowly passing diagonally over my house.The same appearance extreme heat gives in the air was coming from tail. I live in proximity to both a drive-in theatre and commercial airport. Strangely, this encounter(I&#39;ll call it)happened the evening before 9/11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following days had every airport on high alert.

I was ahead of my wife and son.

I suffer from a back problem, so I decided to rest on the bleachers in the football stadium while she continued.  As I lay  on my back looking at the stars, a large black  triangular shape traveled noiselessly across the sky.  It move from N.W to S.E.  The first thing that called my attention to it was that my view stars were being blocked as it moved across the sky.  I couldn&#39;t begin to guess how high it was, unless I knew it&#39;s actual size.  We live in the approach path of S.L International, and it seemed nearly as low as a typical 757 on approach 7 miles out. It was definitely larger than a passenger jet by 4 or 5 times (I would guess).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no lights on the object, and as I said there was no noise associated with it. It was obviously black or another dark color.  By the time I could get my wife&#39;s attention it was too far south of us to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited this long to report for the obvious reasons.

As I asked him if he seen it, and he started to answer yes, the light moved at an angle upward and then just poof was gone.  I thought at first the light might have been a plane flying low, but the quick movement of it in the upwards direction told me it was not just any old plane.

Washington State: 9/10/01 Two bright white burning, falling objects, one may have hit the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> While enjoying an evening walk near sunset (Appx 8:00 - 8:15 p.m.), we heard a small child walking on a perpendicular street exlaim &#34;wow, fireworks&#34;.  He and is two parents and a small child stopped and looked toward the sky in the SE, yet north of Mt. Rainier.  The two of us looked in the direction they were looking and saw what might be described as a falling object, very white in color, falling quickly toward the ground.  It looked almost like a Roman candle fire ball or some form of signal flare, but it was falling quickly.  No planes appeared directly in the vicinity, although 3 commercial flights were lined up for a Sea-Tac landing in the distance.  It&#39;s trajectory was not perfectly straight, nor it&#39;s speed steady.  It struck me of how a piece of plywood would fall from the sky, falling fast, then slowing and even changing it&#39;s horizontal allignment slightly as it &#34;caught air&#34;.  This first object appeared to stop burning before it hit the ground (if it hit the ground)at about 25 degrees above the horizon. My partner then stated that she could see another object, dark in color, falling very fast in the sky above the first.  I could not see it with my naked eyes but she continued to watch it and tried to point it out to me.  Within 10 to 20 seconds, this object appeared to burst into flame and burn in the same manner as the first object.  It&#39;s rate of fall and trajectory was similar to the first.  This object continued to burn and possibly did hit the ground.  Our view of it was obscured by a tree in the neighborhood, but we saw it flame down to within 5 degrees or less above the horizon when it went out of view, still very bright.  We did not hear anything nor did we see any smoke or any sort of a flash when it hit the ground.  The object flamed long enough to come down west (toward us) of the Cascade foothills in the vicinity of the White River valley SE of the City of Enumclaw. We continued to watch the sky but did not see any further activity.  We could not say for sure that the planes changed their courses, but the closest did seem to stay higher than the following two.  Upon reaching our home I did try to contact the closest FAA office in Auburn and was dismissed by the operator as a nut.  She stated in broken english that they had no reports of any such activity, laughed and then hung up the phone.  We assume it must have been some sort of space junk but are curious about why it would fall for some time, then appear to &#34;catch fire&#34; and then burn until it hit the ground.<n>

I always thought the experience was awe inspiring and that the timing of the event was extremely coincidental.  But in retrospect, after flipping backwards through my journal, ANY EVENT BEFORE 9-11 is significant.  I have searched for others&#39; reports of UFO activity on 9-10 but have found none, and therefore find it useful to finally let this information out for the universe to chew on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my journal entry:<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Monday 10 - Nighttime...walking back from Starbucks, I see a trapazoid shaped object flying through the sky...underneath this object were [many] faint lights...about 600-900ft off ground.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Context: I was an engineering student at the University of Texas at the time and was walking back to my dorm at the time.  I was standing right outside the University Coop on Guadalupe St., looking up above the UT Tower.  I was waiting at the crosswalk and had nothing better to do other than look up, when suddenly, I noticed these lights traveling at great speed.  At first I thought I was seeing birds illuminated by the UT Tower, but then birds don&#39;t travel that high, that smoothly, that quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was flying southbound passing nearly above the UT Tower, traveling towards the Texas Congressional building.  Now I&#39;m no expert, but I would assume that any area above UT/Texas Congress would be restricted, a no-fly zone.  My memory may be hazy here but I would say it traveled about a mile in 5 seconds.  That&#39;s roughly 720 mi/hr.  I only say a mile because that&#39;s what I would estimate a normal person can see at night looking up.<n>

It was approaching on an East to West line, and went directly overhead. The initial flash turned out to be some form of disk, which wavered on its course, reflecting sunlight as it dipped and wobbled.  At arms length, it was only the size of a small thumb tack, but the wavering motion clearly suggested a disk shape.  It had no lights, tail, wings or contrail.  It was silent, and crossed a 160 degree arc under 10 seconds, faster than commerical aircraft.  It lookedd very much like similar video sightings taken England when one passed over a tractor in a field.<n>

At one point I as the object was very close to the plane I thought &#34;That&#39;s awfully close&#34; and it swerved. Swerved quickly to the right, then swerved back again. A couple of seconds later it suddenly had reversed direction. It did not stop, then &#34;back up&#34; or turn...it just was going South to North one minute, then as it was stillmoving going bacwards, to the South, the next. I watched it until it traveled out of sight. My husband saw it at the end; as it was moving South; he said he did not think it was any brighter or different than anything else, which surprised me. It was hard for me to understand how he could say that. He did not observe it swerving or reversing direction.<n>

We had been driving out of the LA area on I-5 north and entering the little mountainous section leading into the Angeles National Forrest Area and Pyrmaid lake area.  The time was just before dark when I had been starring out the window and noticed that toward the coast there was someting in the air which wasn&#39;t very normal.  It seemed to be in the shape of some sort of missile and was on a very subtle donward trajectory.  It was very obviously not a plane and my husband who is an engineer also agreed that it wasn&#39;t a plane and also thought it kind of looked like a missile.  I have to admit that it freaked me out and I really didn&#39;t want to drive further. Anyway, we kept driving and when we were heading into grapevine California which is just over tejon pass and into the valley we started to encountered black smoke like something was burning  but apparently there was no fire so the source is unknown but we no longer saw what appeared to us to be a missile either.  .Anyway, this had both of us quite alarmed and freked out so we stopped in a parking lot to calm down a bit and as we sat in the car we saw a small ball f light flash and dissappear with incredible speed that surprised both of us and this light seemed to come from no where as well.  That is about al I have to say about what i saw except that it was very freaky and I probably will not be forgetting it anytime soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

I did not expect anything but this time there was a cluster of 5. I was riding a bicycle and when I got to my brothers house at approx.4:35, I made them look. We counted 7 small circular &#34;lights&#34; far up in the sky. I don&#39;t know if they had lights or were reflecting light. I watched one move in front of or behind and appear on the other side of another. They were moving in diferent patterns. Once all in a straight line. All moving north. One of these &#34;objects&#34; was much lower than the others. I thought it must be something else but my brother had binoculars. This one looked like an E and it was a spectrum on it or green and yellow lights. We watched this for about 15 minutes before they disappeared. The other events happened in the daylight also and on clear days around 5:00. The 1st event I saw 3, two stationary and 1 moving south(my neibor saw this one). The second event 08/18/01 at 4:30, I was downtown with my husband(who doesn&#39;t believe this), I was trying to explain about the ufo and I said to him &#34;Just imagine something so small like a ball of a ballpoint pen up in the sky.&#34; Then I saw 1. He could not see it. There may have been more but this one was between trees. I did not think I would ever see these again after the first time but I have... twice.  Just look up on a clear sky.<n>

I was also transmitting the audio from a digital timex 1000 program (sounds like a bunch of bees).  Then one afternoon around 3pm I was dialing in Michael savage out of san francisco on my radio shack shortwave radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the series of cliks i was transmitting around 3am in the morning were heard in the shortwave receiver.  The receiver was sitting next to the transmission cable leading to the cubical quad beam antenna on the van&#39;s roof.  I figure it inducted the signal into the small portable radio receiver. I was not able to figure from which night the signals were returned as I had been doing this for several nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was from the night before it would have been about a 12 hour round trip if from 2 nights before it would have been a 36 hour round trip and so on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 9-11 happened and since I was sitting across the bay from Naval Air Station North Island coronado I decided to take the antenna off the roof so as not to be consider spying or anything as that.  So this is one more mystery in my life that I have not figured out.  I invite anyone to try this as right now the window is open up to about sept 11.<n>

Our front door faces southeast, and there&#39;s a roof overhanging the front steps. My wife and I had just gotten back from shopping and brought the groceries in. I had heard the droaning of an airplane engine and went back out on the front steps to see if parachutists might be jumping, which is a common occurance on Sundays at a small airstrip located about a mile northwest of our condo just off route 111. I put my head out from under the overhang to look for the plane, and pulled back quickly as the bright sun was right overhead. Just then, from above the overhang came a small round silvery object. My first thought was that it was a white bird, but quickly discounted that as the object moved straight and steady towards the east southeast at a pretty good clip. I watched it for three seconds and it disappeared. I don&#39;t believe it was reflecting the sun as the sun was almost straight above it. It was round, possibly shaped like a ball or a disk, silvery white in color, and about the size of a round 1/8&#34; grape seed held between the tips of the first finger and the thumb at arms length, and it covered the distance of a 12 inch ruler held at arms length in three seconds. About two seconds later the airplane came into view moving in an east northeasterly direction. In comparison, the airplane was the size of a grape held at arms length and it moved the distance of the 12 inch ruler in about seven seconds. I&#39;ve seen high flying jets from the same location in the past, but there&#39;s always a lot of noise involved, usually following the jet at a distance. There was no noise from the silvery object. I don&#39;t know whether the object was small and close or large and very high in the sky, but it&#39;s possible someone on the airplane spotted it as it passed in front of them. I hope someone got a better look at it than I did and reports it. I have a background in logistics and inventory control, and currently deal in used and rare books.<n>

We were sitting outside facing east watching satellites, shooting stars, the occasional plane etc. My friend sitting to my right pointed out a small light, moving along the same path as the previous satellites we had seen earlier in the evening. He said he saw it flash very brightly &#34;like a huge camera flash going off&#34;. We all began to watch it as it flew in a straight line from south to north. It was quite dim until bam, we saw it flash, extremely bright, actually exactly like a very, very big camera flash. Again it would dim out and then zap, another great flash. It did this probably 6 or 7 times before it left our view to the north. What was peculiar was the fact that it seemed to be a satellite however I&#39;ve never seen a satellite emit a high powered flash before. I thought maybe a plane of some kind but it would have been at a tremendous altitude and it had no beacon lights or flashing lights common on aircraft, just a dim steady light until the big flashes.

Each flash lasted about four seconds, with the first being the brightest, and then progressively getting fainter.  When the flashes occurred they were stationary in the sky, and not moving like a meteor, satellite, or plane.  We have observed many planes and meteors for years and this was nothing like any of those occasions.  Each flash flared and then faded without moving, and then reappeared in a slightly different location still within the swan. We have no idea what we saw and are truly at a loss to explain it.  Further, we would appreciate any explanation you might give us.          Thank you<n>

What had appeared in the Southern sky that looked like a large group of illuminated balloons, was coming North in our direction. When IT was much closer than at first site, we could see a large golden glowing ball about the size of the face of the moon. It was hazy and seemed to have some object in the glowing round haze, but you could not make out what was inside the haze. Just in front of the glowing Ball, was about four, maybe five, tiny star-like objects.  They seemed to be in a formation just in front of the larger object. All stayed exactly in their formation and made over our heads in Northerly direction, never changing or blinking and never with any sound whatsoever. The tiny starlike objects seemed to be taking or leading the larger object away. They traveled at a high speed and moved out of our view over the house. We all agreed that we could not identify the object as OUR aircraft nor could we think of anything it could have been, other than a UFO.<n>

Then the other witnesses came out and I told them what I had seen and they too looked in the sky and saw it. It appeared to moving by then so we got in the car and drove not far from where we were and watched we saw other objects in the sky but they seemed to be planes and didn&#39;t have the same lights and light patterns that the object did. Then we drove to a marina to see if we couldn&#39;t get a better look and we could, it was far away by then but it was still noticeable we watched for about half an hour and it stood still for a long time then it would almost zigzag again and the stand still and then do it again and then go up and down quit always and then go back to its original position when we decided to leave it was in about the same spot it was when we first saw it at the marina.

My wife and I were out on our balcony at our apartment complex.  We have somewhat of a limited view of the eastern sky from this vantage point due to trees, however, I was watching a distant storm cloud moving northeast. It had my attention because flashes of cloud lightning were brillantly illuminating the cloud itself.  These ended and while talking with my wife I noticed a dull white light moving at a very high rate of speed, seemingly in the cloud itself.  It&#39;s speed is what first drew my attention.  Being in Fort Worth, approximately 15 miles from DFW airport, there&#39;s quite a lot of air traffic in the area.  But this was moving faster than even low flying aircraft move in the night skies.  At first I thought the light was within the cloud itself, moving out of it.  Although now upon reflection that couldn&#39;t of been the case:  this storm cloud was much too far off to see such a light.  And indeed it wasn&#39;t behind or in the cloud.  Upon reaching the cloud&#39;s edge and emerging from it, I realized the light had the same dull white appearance as it did while seemingly in the cloud.  The light had to have been much closer to us than the storm cloud.  At that point I stood up from the rocking chair I was seated at, and moved quickly to the railing to get a better look.  At that time, the object - or light- which originally was singular became a group of three or four lights of similar hue and size.  No blinking or FAA lights could be seen.  These were not airplanes.  They continued moving in what seemed to be either a diamond or a square formation.  Then at that time, and, of course, this is what really peaked my interest, the object(s) split into a &#34;V&#34; formation.  Or, if not trully a &#34;V,&#34; then a formation shaped similar to a banana with a slight to moderate curve in it.  Following this, the object(s) distanced themselves from one another, still in the same formation, but spaced apart more.  (And I should mention at this point that e! very cha nge in formation occurred almost instantaneously.  I could see the movement, but it was faster that anything I have ever before seen in the sky.)  Still moving at what was a southeasternly direction, a single light of the same brightness, shape and size moved into the formation from ahead.  It moved into the formation seemingly at the same rate of speed as the other object(s) that were moving toward it.  This independent light joined the formation at dead center or perhaps slightly below this point.  Then the object(s) regrouped into the box or diamond formation and slowed significantly, if not stopping.  Together they rose in altitude slightly before again forming the tight &#34;V-banana&#34; formation.  At this time the object(s) were about to enter the blind spot of my balcony so I ran outside, downstairs, and around my apartment building in an attempt to gain view unobstructed by foilage.  However, because of the strong light from the rising moon and the faint, dull light of the object(s) themselves I was unable to again locate it.  And realizing the speed at which the object(s) seemed to be moving at, I knew the sighting was over.  Upon joining me downstairs, by wife did say before she lost sight of the object(s) the tight &#34;V-banana&#34; formation loosened up. Again, this occurred at approximately 00:30-00:35 hours on September 8, 2001.  The weather conditions were windy and partly cloudy with the wind and clouds moving in a northeasternly direction.  And while the sky was cloudy, an equal amount of clear, visible sky was to be seen.  The object(s) moved in a southeasternly direction which, from where I live, would put in on a crow&#39;s flight toward Arlington, Texas. I am 26 years of age, college-educated, with a degree in English.  Struggling as a writer, I spend my days earning a living as a salesman for a contracting company.

Alot of stars out, moon hadn&#39;t risen yet so was getting very dark.  While I was listening to her, all of a sudden at about 60 degrees up, I saw this bright white light.  At first I thought it was a plane that was close (because of the brilliance) but the white light kept growing to about the size of a baseball.  It grew some more but then turned bright gaseous looking green color and swelled up to the size of a basketball at arms length.  As I was looking and trying to comprehend what I was seeing, I had an awful feeling that I was watching an atom bomb explode or something, just seeing it grow like it did.  All at once, the green light died out and flickered a few times and I THINK I saw a tiny white light in it&#39;s place that all of a sudden looked like a star.  I was alone and freaked out so that was it for my UFO watching last night.  I have only seen something like this once before and that was when a rocket was sent up from nearby Wallops Island, VA that was conducting some kind of chemical test.  Barring Wallops Island having sent a rocket up last night, this was definitely something I have never seen before.  At least two other aircraft on normal local flight paths were seen right after this flare up.<n>

It was in view just above the roof top of my neighbour&#39;s house which is across the back laneway from my house. The object appeared to remain motionless. I thought it was the lights of an airline coming straight at me, which would give the appearance of a stationary object. It did not fly over me however, and remained in the sky in the same spot for about 45 minutes. At 4:45 a.m. I called to Regina City Police to report a strange object in the sky and a police car was dispatched to investigate. The object began to emit a red light on either side, so it appeared as a white light between to red lights. At 5:15 a.m. the object was still in the same spot in the sky but now began to drift from right to left and then left to right, very slowly. It also began to rise slowly in the sky.

So I know it couldn&#39;t be a star or plane and I know it wasn&#39;t a car because you can&#39;t see the road behind my neighbors house from window behind the trees. So I watched it and it started rising in a diagonal moving left.  It went behind the trees and came out into clear view. It was going faster than a plane so I didn&#39;t have to time to check it out with my telescope so I used my binoculars. It was a disk shape. The bottom of it was just a big white light but around the perimeter was a single strip of colored lights blinking on and off in a pattern. It went out of view for a second but turned around and started moving right. But it was farther away now and it went behind some trees in the distance. (not next to my neighbors) I tried to keep an eye on it but it got smaller and smaller until finally it disappeared and I never saw it come out of the other side of the trees.<n>

Very noticible and very intense, it was a growing pulse of white light, that after about 9 seconds shaded to a bright sea green flaring into a dark blue eerie glow about 20 seconds later, the event ended with a shimmering type display, of dark blue light vanishing without a trace. I at first thought it was a meteor, but this object was not moving and i have never witnessed a blue colored meteor. Id estimate the magnitude of the display of light to be about a 2 or 3, very bright. Unfortunatley i failed to have my camera :( ((name deleted))<n>

I thought, wow look at the north star tonight, but then I noticed that it was brighter than normal and looked more like a spotlight shining towards my direction than a star.There was absolutely no sound. But it was about the same size in diameter as the stars all around it  which made me think this object is extremely far away and not a star, and not an airplane either. I could see no motion, no blinking, and no flickering whatsever. Then all of the sudden the light went dim, it was about exactly the same brightness of the stars around it then. And to my astonishment, it started moving Northeast in the sky away from me and faded away after about 3 to 5 seconds. The sky was absolutely clear, stars all around it clearly visible, but this object completely disappeared in just seconds. It was obvious that this object was headed towards the ground, then made a sudden turn and went the other direction. It did not cast a beam of light in the new direction it was headed which also makes me believe it was way up there above the atmospheric dust and moisture. I have never reported anything like this before, nor have I ever seen anything that I couldn&#39;t explain either. But I am absolutely sure this was no plane, no meteor, or anything that I have ever seen before.  I feel extremely fortunate to have seen this and doubt I&#39;ll ever see another one, but I would love to hear from anyone who might have seen this thing as well. After thinking about this incident for about 45 minutes and explaining it to my wife I decided to log into the internet to see if there was a place to log such sitings and I came accross this site.  I am not a UFO enthusiest or anything but I thought I would share it with someone who might appreciate it. I wrote this about 1 hour after I saw it while the incident was still fresh on my mind. j.baynard<n>

Noticed a white/silver object almost directly overhead, maybe 80 degrees north of the sun.  Looked to be a weather ballon; using triangulation with pencil-tip placed in front of my right eye, I determined without a doubt that the object was completely stationary. 3. The object remained stationary for up to ten minutes, after which, it began to move southward. 4. Over the two-minute journey out of sight, the object seemed to be rotating, or gyrating, in that it slightly changed shape (as if it were a pyramid or boomerang shape and was turning over). 5. The object proceeded in its southerly direction and passed the sun to the west... but not by much.  It was still distinctly bright, even while passing in close proximity to the sun. 6. I brought this to the attention of two women sitting nearby, who acknowledged the object.<n>

I lowered the camera and no more than 10 feet from me was a ball approximately two feet in diameter; with an outer glow that extended it to about 3 feet.  The shape was almost a perfect circle.  I did not feel any heat irradiating from the ball, yet it was burning bright red and emitting heat waves.  It remained about 20 seconds, then started to rise vertically, very slowly to about 60 feet, where it remained motionless for a short period.  It then made a 90 degree turn and then accelerated out of site.  I have a color photo of this event.  I called the police to report it and they had another report of a fire ball a block away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION REPORT:  ERIC BYLER, Oregon UFO Review,<n> <n><n> &lt;Oregon UFO Review@home.com&gt;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just got back from an investigation at the coast where I got the picture you see here along with the negatives.  I am still working on the report and have to make one more follow up call with him to clarify something, but the long and short of it is that the photographer is a ((deleted)) year old man of (partial) American Indian heritage by the name of ((deleted)).  He lives alone with a rather large ((dog)) in a very nice home on the coast of Oregon in a small town named Florence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((He)) spends a lot of time on his yard as it looks quite good. On the day of the picture, he was out with his camera...a ((high quality SLR camera))mm  1:3.5 - 4.5...using 35mm 400 film... a very nice camera that he chooses to keep on automatic for the simplicity of pointing and shooting.  He had already made a number of pictures when he approached the plants you see in this picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to his testimony, as he was looking through the view finder and was about to shoot, this image appeared in his view finder.  He quickly hit the shutter button and dropped the camera to see what this was. He estimated the object as being a couple feet wide and glowing like fire with an outer lighter glow that emanated like a heat wave.  He pointed out however that as close as he was, only a few feet away, he could feel no heat.  He thought this as odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, the object began to slowly rise until it reached tree level which is quite high as you can see in the picture, the whole time just watching in awe thinking, &#34;&#39;what in the hell is this?&#34;  Then he realized, hey, take another picture.  He brought the camera up to began lining it up with the object when it did a 90 degree turn and shot away from the house traveling west towards the ocean.  He immediately took the film down to have them developed to see if he indeed had got the object on film.  I have checked out the negatives and the package with the number of pictures that were developed and is does appear that he stopped taking pictures in his yard by the time he got to the picture in question.  My thought is if this were just a reflection of some sort on the lens then it probably would have only shown up when the pictures were developed and he would have continued taking pictures.  The fact that he did indeed stop taking pictures at number ten (the roll goes backward from 24 to 1) and then developed the pictures tell me that he may have indeed seen something of a nature that points away from simple lens reflection and does add up with his story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent some time in the house with ((witness)) and I found him very easy to talk with.  ((Witness) is a big man but soft spoken.  His house is very nice with lots of reference to his heritage seen in the art work on his walls.  He has three ((medals)) permanently displayed on a side table as he was in WW2.  A wall in another room had a number of framed certificates of achievements and education showing his many accomplishments over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In his main den where we talked there was a large volume of books on shelves.  I saw no books pertaining to UFO material as many were related to American Indian heritage<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Witness)) does not have a computer for internet access but does have basic television.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He has no idea what he saw.  He did contact the police who came over and took a report.  The following day he says he talked to the assistant fire chief while in town and he (the chief) mentioned hearing of a similar report on his scanner that day but remembers it as being on 24th street, rather than 23rd where ((witness)) lives.  I am following up on this.  I did contact the state police who reports that they have had similar reports like this over the past few months in other parts of the coast but did<n> <n><n> not elaborate.  This is being followed up on as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just in case the photo doesn&#39;t come through, go here... http://www.oregonuforeview.com/florence.html ... to view it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eric Byler - Oregon UFO Research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Eric Byler, Oregon UFO Review, for the excellent investigation and follow-up review.

I was traveling in a vehicle east on 7 and it looked like a large airplane &#34;climbing&#34; gradually.I would describe it as a fat,lit cigar.  Front was dark &amp; tapered like a big, fat cigar, back orange cylindrical glow &amp; bright white trail of smoke in backwards &#34;S&#34; shape.  Time was 5:50 AM &amp; I watched it &#34;ascend&#34; slowly by until I turned onto the Dulles Greenway at Leesburg, Virginia.  Did not think anything of it really at the time.  I thought the sun was coming up &amp; hitting the smoke so that it illuminated it bright white.  It wasn&#39;t until the radio announcer on Station 94.7 FM broadcasted that the phones were ringing off the hook with people calling about what the &#34;white fireworks&#34; were in the eastern sky.  Then as I got closer to Washington, DC (time 6:15 AM)and tuned to 1500 AM on the radio that calls were coming in from all over asking them what the great white streak was in the eastern sky.  That&#39;s when I began thinking about a few peculiararities I had not thought while watching it fly over.  1) very large  2) bright white smoke &amp; the sun had not risen yet AND when it did it was orange not white  3) don&#39;t usually see orange glow at rear of plane, except what I would describe as having seen on &#34;rear end&#34; shots of the US Space Shuttle Columbia landing on the runway in Texas! 4) how&#39;d the plane emit a backwards &#34;S&#34;  on takeoff? a plane of that size couldn&#39;t make a dip that tightly 5) the &#34;white smoke&#34; stayed around almost 45 full minutes without dissipating or expanding or thinning at all<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses observed the object that was reported by the U.

Our gratitude to this witness for having taking the time and trouble to contact us, and to provide such a thorough report.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 09/06/2001, at 0550 hours (EDST) myself and several witnesses viewed a &#34;missile-shaped&#34; object just south of Waterford, CT over Long Island Sound.  I am the Armed Response Force Team Leader at Millstone Nuclear in Waterford, CT and several of the witnesses are Armed Response Force Members and/or Licensed Nuclear Reactor Operators. From a distance of approximately one half mile, we witnessed what, at first, appeared to be a rapidly approaching plane heading toward our facility from the direction of Orient Point Long Island, NY.  This appeared as a very bright light approximately 300-400 feet above sea level, moving toward us at a high rate of speed.  The object was flying parallel to the ground at this height until it reached a distance approximately 1/4 mile from our shorline.  It then began a trajectory at approximately 60-70%, still headed in a North-Easterly direction (toward Providence, RI).  At this point, we were able to discern the outline of the object.  It was approximately 35-40&#39; in length and shaped very much like a rocket or missile.  It had a four-fin tail end and swept back wings near the front end.  The wings extended back and outward from the body, but we could not discern the distance they extended outward. As the object began to gain altitude, there were red sparks and bluish/white smoke erupting from the rear.  Although the flight path maintained a North-East bearing, it was evident that the object was not flying in a straight-line manner once it began its&#39; ascent.  The flight path became somewhat erratic as the object continued to gain altitude and proceded northward.  Because of the amount of contrail (which remained visible in the sky for nearly an hour) and the amount of flame being emitted, many of us were convinced the object was going to crash.  Many of the witnesses are former Naval Nuclear personnel and most thought the object was a &#34;Polaris-type&#34; missile or some other type of nautically-luanched device.  The weather conditions at the time of this incident were clear, mild, and very little wind,  The air temperature was approximately 60 degrees Farenheit.  There were no other objects visible in the sky and the sun was just rising above the horizon to our East.  we were able to view the object for approximately ane and one-half minutes prior to it becoming indistinct. Because we are a Federally Regulated Nuclear Facility, I made immediate notification to the FAA.  The FAA made inquiries to all the airports on the North East Corridor and none reported any planes down or in trouble at the time of the sighting, however, the FAA had recieved several other phone calls conerning this incident.  The FAA called me back about an hour later and suggested I file this report.<n>

After searching and on my way to bed, I looked out my front door window which looks down the street.  I immediately noticed an exceptionally bright light 2000-3000 feet high and approximately 5 miles away.  I thought this was an aircraft, which have holding patterns over this part of Connecticut.  I continued looking because the light was so bright I wondered what type of aircraft it could be. The light was at least 20 times brighter than an aircraft&#39;s landing light. The object then starting moving up and down, mimicing an oscilliscope wave.  My binoculars were 10 feet away and I ran to get them.  Upon returning to the window and before I could get the binoculars out of the case the object moved straight up (maybe 5 degrees off of vertical) at a speed that was so incredibly fast I knew it was no aircraft.  It also left, only for a few milliseconds, a white phosphorous trail that had to be at least 10,000 feet long.  It then disappeared into the CLEAR night.<n>

Looking South from the Halekulani Hotel on Wikiki beach, 6th floor. I had arrived earlier that day with my wife, and had NOT been drinking.  The hotel balcony is only about 300 feet from the ocean.  I first noticed a disk shaped object hovering what appeared to be 30-40 feet above the beach.  At first I thought this was a seagull sized bird flying in place against the ocean breeze.  This seemed unlikely, since it was 11:15pm and the wind was barely blowing.  My next thought was that this faintly outlined disk shaped object could be a kite.  The object was bobbing and moving like a kite would from my vantage point.  5 seconds later this object moved to my right about 10 degrees behind a palm tree and shortly thereafter re-appeared to the right of the tree.  This convinced me that this was not a kite since the object moved too fast and started to ascend slightly.  The object continued moving in a slightly ascending trajectory to the West (my right)  This movement covered roughly an additional 20 degrees.  Somewhere near this phase of the sighting, the object emmitted a dim red/orange continuous glow, and that&#39;s what I tracked for the remainder of the sighting.  As the object moved across the sky to the right, it suddenly reversed directions and started moving East in a relatively straight line. Now I knew that this was like nothing I had ever seen in my life.  The object then moved in a counter clockwise circular motion, followed by another pass from left to right. Finally the dim light stopped for a few seconds and then went straight up and slightly to my right.  After this point, the light became dimmer and dimmer in the black moonless sky.  I called my wife out to see, but she could not pick up the very faint light at this point, roughly 45 degrees off the horizon.  This episode lasted 30-45 seconds.  The next morning I repositioned myself on the balcony in order to guesstimate how far away this object was.  Clearly, the object. depending on it&#39;s size, was between 1/8 and 1/4 mile away at the early stages of the sighting. (Well below the horizon) This would make the object size about 20-30 feet across.  I am college educated, and I know what airplanes, helecopters, sattelites, and shooting stars all look like in the night sky.  I did not hear anything; my encounter was only visual.  All these signs tell me that this object was definitely out of this world.  Needless so say, I could not fall asleep for several hours.<n>

At this point it was traveling at a much higher elevation, and had change direction toward the south and increased speed. Disappeared soon after.<n>

This was a familiar sound as I have heard a Sonic-Boom many times before; the characteristic Boom, followed roughly 1 sec. later with another Boom.  I went to my mothers bedroom to see if she dropped something on the floor.  She said no but had heard the noise.  While we were talking, there was another Boom, though with roughly twice the energy and only a single Boom!  That one really rattled the windows!! I turned on the Scanner to see if any thing was reported to the local authorities-nothing.  I got on the Web and checked several sites that have instant reports of quakes and the such-nothing.  While on the Web, there was another Sonic-Boom (characteristic again) at 13:35 hours, local time.  Again, the windows really rattled! What is really interesting, was at 13:45 hours, the National Emergency Radio System was activated--(Nation Wide).  The Notice stated this was a planned event and was in effect until 14:00 hours local time. During the duration of this incident, the sky was completely overcast with visibility of approx. 10 miles, No other aircraft were seen or heard. If this was a coincidence, I find it to be VERY interesting! I wonder if other reports were received with regards to this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed very sincere and credible.  We contacted the FAA ARTCC in Auburn, WA, and they confirmed that one of their employees had heard the explosion, but did not know what it was.  The Public Affairs Officer from McChord AFB reported that no known aircraft were flying at supersonic speeds at the time, and that the only explosions in the area were caused by ordnance on Ft. Lewis, located near McChord, but a long way from Auburn.  We do not know what caused the event.  PD))<n>

At one point, we observed as many as 8 objects- they appeared to be clustering around one particularly bright star in the sky.  We also noticed that airplanes appeared to be following these unique vessels in the sky.

I notice a flashing light in the sky coming out of some clouds heading east .At first i thought it was a airplane heading for st.pete/clearwater airport. It was on a flight path for it. Then at a very high speed turn south coming my way. Then i notice it wasn&#39;t just one big light flashing as it got closer. there was at least four lights almost flashing at same time. The lights where..not really white,They just didn&#39;t look like lights from a airplane. At this point i stop the car, and got out to get a really good look at it.Before it got right about me,i notice the lights on the bottom of it was like a blacklight color&#39;purple,or a blueish color&#39;if you know what i mean. My car was still running and i had the radio on, the radio went out, and my car almost died ,At this time it picked up speed and took off out view to the southeast.The one thing the gets me, there was no sound, nothing from it,or bugs..I live in florida theres a ton of bugs that make alot of noise at night.I didn&#39;t notice this til i was going to leave. funny thing is,when i was getting in to my car there was three other cars pulled off the road watching it. We all talked about it for a bit ,before we left .One of the guys took a pics of this, I&#39;m trying to get a hold of him for a copy of the pics, I just hope they come out good. just in case i drew somes pics of it i can send in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The light, about the size of Venus, appeared in the eastern sky, about 25 degrees over the horizon.  It flashed white, red, yellow and green.  As we watched, the light began bobbing up and down in variants of about 3 degrees from &#34;center&#34; position, then rapidly shifting to a similar left-right motion.  It continued doing this for at least 30 minutes.  Several planes flew near the light in a north-south direction, likely headed to SF Airport while it was in the sky - this light was far different from the plane lights.  We watched until falling asleep.<n>

We were on a dirt road near the &#34;Bradshaw Ranch&#34; and noticed as we were driving in its direction it slowly decended towards the horizon near Clarksdale.  When we stopped to witness what type of movenment it was making, it hovered for about 10 Min. Then suddenly it zig-zaged west to east and back again.  Thats when I realized for sure that this was a unconventional object.  It soon decended behind the mountain and was gone. It reappeared on the north side of town on our way back to Boynton canyon at much higher altitude and remained there for another half hour until we decided that it was time to goto bed and was seen from our hotel door at the Days Inn in West Sedona. It was the brightest thing in the sky and had to have been witnessed by other people in town.<n>

The Red Light had a duratino of approximately 3 to 10 seconds, with an elevation of approximately 400-500 feet. After the red light disappeared, there was a large bright-white &#34;explosion &#34; between 50-100 feet above the original location of the red light. The &#34;explosion was then accompanied by a smaller flashing blue-white light, hich appeared to be flashing in a pattern. In a rural area, this light was extreamly unusual as there are no power or cellular towers in that direction and area. After observing this for about half an hour, I confirmed with the Local Municipal Airport Radar Control(Mansfield Lahm Internation Airport) that there was indead something in the sky. According to the Controler, there were four objects in that general location that were appearing on radar, but thaey were not any form of known aircraft. They appeared to him as ghost objects on the radar, but kept re-appearing, and were moving almost due North in a straight line, and were moving at an abnormally low rate of speed. After confirmation that what I was witnessing was indeed real, I started observing the lights even closer. The lights appeared top be on a translucent structure between 400-500 foot tall. THere were four red lights forming an almost perfec geometric square. After the Red light would disppear, and before the White lights would start flashing I could see the structure, it was very narrow in appearance. Approximately 20 foot wide. While the lights were not on, I could notice a &#34;cloud&#34; at the very bottom of this structure, but there was no real substance to the structure. I could see landscape behind the object, but it appeared to be distorted, or out of focus. When either of the lights would reappear, the cloud at the bottom would be gone. Also, upon closer investigation ( I Got out the binocular) The red lights appeared to be emitting a laser of some form. You could see the beam due to! the hum idity in the air. At approximately 23:00 I witnessed nine aircraft flying over the vincinity, and appeared to be in a search pattern over the unknown object. Also, I was able to write down the flashing pattern of the lights, and it appears to repeat itself. I know this sounds crazy, but I have seen unusuall lights over this area in the past, and I know I am not seeing things. I am a College Graduate (BA-Business Admin) and I am an Independant Computer Consultant, and I find this information somewhat disturbing. If you have any information about this siting, please let me know.<n>

It was a beautiful sunny day with some clouds but mostly long expanses of cloudless sky.  Where there WERE clouds, I would estimate that the ceiling was at 1000&#39; approx.  I happened to call her attention to this one little lone circular cloud in this big expanse of blue sky.  As soon as I did, there just appeared something in front of the cloud that started moving north to south in a fast straight line.  It was silver and round and looked about the size of a BB held at arms length.  I said &#34;what IS that?&#34;.  She said &#34;it&#39;s not a bird&#34; and I said &#34;it&#39;s not a plane&#34; at the same time and just at that moment it disappeared, like it had some type of cloaking device. There were no other clouds in that part of the sky and it just disappeared from view as we watched it. I suspect that it was hidden behind the lone circular cloud because at no time did I see it enter my line of sight from north to south.  As soon as I called her attention to the cloud, it was just there in front of it. The strange thing is that I got the feeling it KNEW we had spotted it and were discussing it. It covered about 1/3 of the sky from horizon to horizon in about 10 seconds.  It was traveling faster than a jet.   The strange thing is that even though we had just seen something we had NEVER seen before, we just kind of went back to our conversation after saying something like &#34;wow&#34;.  I didn&#39;t think about it til later that it was strange that we were so low key about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please change report from me dated 9/3 to 9/4, it was a tuesday, I made a mistake.

I also noticed a glowing halo directly above the object. It appeared to be a light coming from the top of the object. The object appeared to be moving slowly and made no noise.  I estimate the object was 1000 to 2000 feet high. At this point in time I yelled for my wife and two kids, ages 19 and 16 to come view the object. By this time the object had passed over the house, so we all ran to the front of the house and stood on the deck and watched the object with binoculars.  The object, which was shaped like a cross, with orange lights, proceeded North. We all noticed when the object was approximately 2-5 miles away it stopped and hovered. The intensity of the orange glow was changing. It was glowing very brightly and then the glow would almost disappear. This occurred three to four times. It then dropped a small object with the same color. It looked like a spark. The object then got very bright the brightest orange yet. It then dropped another and larger object, which again looked like a spark.  The object then just faded out. Looked like it winked out. I was still looking at the object with the binoculars as this occurred. I could not see the object it was just gone.<n>

The sky was clear except for the clouds created by the arial spraying, surface temps around 80°, winds calm. I set up my tripod and camera with zoom lens to 450 mm. I took several pictures of this but even with this magnification the object was still quite small. In the veiw finder I noticed a slight movement to the west. This change in position was similar to speed and direction as if watching a star at night i.e earth&#39;s rotational movement. Is it possible to see the International Space Station during a bright sunny day? If not then I&#39;m unsure as to what this may have been. At this time the photos are still undeveloped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Although much has been said and written about the alleged &#34;chemtrails,&#34; we continue to reserve judgment on that issue.  We have seen no strong evidence to support their existence, in fact.  However, we do not know what the object was that the witness apparently witnessed.  PD))<n>

The direction of the flight was from West to East directions in the Connecticut/Massachusets state border. The object had distinctively observable 4 ligth beams (similar to high beams in the cars) alligned in rectangular format and a flashing white ligth in the center. But, it could be in a diamond format from my point of view.  The sound of the craft was very unusual for a plane or a helicopter. It almost sound it like a metal to metal rubbing with a very high pitch grinding/roaring sound. The time I observed was at 5:16 am with a clear night view in the background.  The 4 beams on the corners and the center flashing light were pointing downwards, making the area below the craft relatively brite.  The speed of the craft was steady, with a speed comparable to a slow flying helicopter.  The altidude of the craft may have been in the range of approx. 1/2 km to 1 km. The whole observation may have been in 5 to 10 seconds time frame while, the object was still visible through my window.  I am wondering if anyone else has reported anything similar in this time period.<n>

At 23:55 I glanced out my back window, facing South, to view the full Moon I noticed out of the corner of my eye, what I thought at first was a brilliant Orange fireball.  I opened my back door and stepped onto my deck. I then noticed this was not a fireball, but an object moving from South to North. The object was appeared to be moving slowly and the object made no noise.  I estimate the object was 1000 to 2000 feet high. At this point in time I yelled for my wife and two kids, ages 19 and 16 to come view the object. By this time the object had passed over the house, so we all ran to the front of the house and stood on the deck and watched the object with binoculors.  The object, which was shaped like a cross, with orange lights, proceeded north. We all noticed when the object was approximately 2-5 miles away it stopped and hovered. The intensity if the orange glow was changing. It was glow very brightly and then the glow would almost dissapear. This occured 3 to four times. It then dropped a small object with the same color. It looked like a spark. The object then got very bright the brightest Orange yet. It then dropped another and larger object, whch again looked like a spark.  The object then just fadded out. looked like it winked out. I was still looking at the object with the binoculors as this occured. I could not see the object it was gone.<n>

Me, the driver spotted a small object high in the sky. At first we all thought it was a plane but since my father is an avid aviator I knew that it wasn&#39;t anything like the sort. It was heading left in our field of vision then, raised and fell. Since we were going down a hill it left bwehind some trees, but when we crested the next hill to investigate it was gone. There was NO chance of it still being behind the trees for this hill was very high and had a good overlook of the city. The craft was hard to determine its&#39;s actual shape for the sky was dark but clear. Anyway the way the lights were flahing it looked circular in shape.

On 9/02/01 approx 21:30 I was traveling south in West Dade (Carol City/Hialeah area). All of a sudden it looked like there was an explosion of brilliant light in the western sky.  Although it didn&#39;t seem to be at a very high altitude.  It was beautiful! The shape reminded me of an elongated pyramid. From the bottom of the object it looked like you could see the &#34;tail&#34; or trail which was also this brilliant white with green and purple colors. It was amazing. The direction of travel could have been an optical illusion as it appeared largest on the north and then disappeared to a pinpoint to the south.  I wrote down the date and time and drew a pic of what I had seen.<n>

We shot about 10 rockets with class B engines.  After the 10th one, I (the father) witnessed what appeared to be the wadding out of one of the rockets.  But with a closer look, and the help of binoculars, they were nothing like anything we have ever seen before.  They were roundish with a red light,  but the red was not sharply defined.  Then my sons witnessed the light changed from one big light, to smaller lights.  There were many small ufo&#39;s and about 2 bigger ones.  They seemed to hover and then move quickly in different directions.  One even went in the opposite direction without slowing down and no circle.  Then after approximately 10 minutes, they started to dissappear.  We could not see exactly what it was, but in one occation, it appeared to get closer and was a shinny aluminum but quickly changed direction to be just out of range of getting a better look.<n>

It appeared to have a constant speed and at one point zigzagged (i.e. moved at the same relative speed to the East, then to the South, and then to the Southeast), and then proceeded in the direction that it was taking when I first observed it.  I finally got my wife&#39;s attention and she observed the same object for approximately 5 seconds.  We both watched it suddenly disappear.  It did not have any characteristics belonging to those of a meteorite which I have seen many times.  I have never seen anything like this in my entire life.<n>

Then it stopped glowing (The bright glow was as the size of a softball) and it kept on going from north to south  and looked exactly as a satelight again.  I was sitting on the back porch with my husband when we saw it, so I emediately came inside to report this (9:55 P.M.)  Then, as soon as I got online, my husband came in and said that it had turned west and began glowing again.  He said it stopped and then glowed as it was stopped.

Also the blinking red light appeared heading in the direction of the white light.  After several minutes it appeared that the blinking red light was going to cross the white. When the red light got near I jokingly said, &#34;one of your better move.&#34;  Just as i said that, the white moved.  Looking at the white light, it moved in a southwest direction.  The red light turned towards the white light.  As the red light got near, the white light moved again, this time in a northwest direction.  Again, the red light turned towards the white. Again, the white moved, but this time behind a mountain.  And, the red light followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes, the red light came back out and headed back in the direction it came from.  I didn&#39;t see the white light again.

I know it was a craft only because of the way it left.  At first it was still - straight above me - and VERY clear the entire time. The size had to have been longer than a football field (I know this because I could judge its length as it was really very close.  Now let me say -  it was beautiful - the colors did not seem of this earth - it was long rectangular with a very bright diamond white light in the very center - I&#39;m only going to say &#34;cigar shaped&#34; because it was proportionate to a cigar in width and length, but its end corners were most unique - They were more perfect than a computer could draw out (how is that possible).  The material seemed to be like a silicon - it was not a metal - it was blue but darker than the sky and I say silicon material because of what the edges looked like, especially the corners - how the blue color defined itself.  It was not only too perfect of a shape for this world but the white shining light was like a diamond in its radiance, but not in its color - it was a solid white light, but not a light or sun white -like we see in any of our earth lights - not even our stars are this color white.  Also, it was not blinding, but had a magnificent radiance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting alone, but knew there was a couple about 10 yards to my side.  After about a full minute or more of me staring straight up - amazed and testing my eyes and sanity (am I awake?, here?, etc)- the craft started to move perfectly forward very slowly - as if it was a submarine (one of its ends leading).  It moved in a straight line in north-east direction.  At this time, I knew it was possibly leaving and so I moved slowly to the couple sitting close to me.  I continued to keep my eyes on the craft while I moved - nearly stumbled on the couple close by and pointed up - just saying &#34;Look&#34;.  One of the people (female) looked up and said &#34;Oh wow!&#34;  At just that moment the craft started moving faster (and I mean faster) it shot north, but (bing, bing) with two angles.  Our crafts can&#39;t do that right?  long shape disappeared very soon after it shot north - The light remained very very very bright for a longh time (at least a thirty seconds or more) - until it finally got smaller and smaller and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only one person who I went to - to look up -actually saw the long body of the craft, the other person looked up too late and only saw the white light as it bing binged away into the northern sky.  The person who saw the craft with me acted very calm - thought it was amazing, but said she had many amazing experience of the sort. She started saying,  &#34;Have you seen...I&#39;ve seen....&#34;.  I had never seen anything that was so clear, and so not of this world. I went inside and drew it immediately.  Even if I had not drawn exactly what I saw - my memory is crystal clear.  And the other witness, I am only happy for her that never in my mind will I ever question if it was an illusion of some sort.  It was very material, and very visible.  It never made one sound and it did not leave a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing you to ask you if you have any photographs or video of what I saw.  I can not find anything on internet - except distant videos and photos of long rod shaped craft things - but with no light in the middle and they don&#39;t look as large as what I saw.  I have been looking.  I want to have a real picture of this magnificent craft.  I want to show my husband -whose been hearing about it for years and has seen my drawing - I want to show him a photo if you have one.  I&#39;m thinking that I can not have been the only person who has seen this craft - it was not small - and it was still light in the skies.  I heard on coast to coast - that - in the same month/year - in the state of Washington also - &#34;balls of light&#34; were seen.  The short descriptions I heard were that the balls of light were small though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will email you a jpeg photo of my drawing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.

It was moving at about the normal speed of a high-altitude jet or perhaps somewhat faster, and seemed to be at the height of a normal jet at cruising altitude, but possibly higher - very hard to tell with no reference points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the head of the trail was a small but very obvious fiery reddish ball.  It may have been the reflection of the late-afternoon sun on a plane, but I&#39;ve seen many, many airliners under these conditions and this looked different.  It twinkled and at no time did it appear to change intensity.  Usually a strong sun glint on an airliner will vary as the reflection angle changed, but this didn&#39;t.  It looked exactly like a giant reddish road flare making a dense smoke trail heading more or less toward northern New Jersey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say giant because of the size of the trail.  It is impossible to estimate the size of the object but it appeared comparable to the size of Venus or Saturn when they&#39;re at their largest and most visible.  A twinkling, starlike reddish road flare with an immense and persistent white smoke trail.  It was unusual enough that we stopped to watch it until it disappeared behind buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t change speed, heading, altitude or intensity, and the motion was very steady.  The smoke trail remained for at least several minutes.  My thought at the time was that it was a reentry of some satellite, or an unusual meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall that there were some unusual meteor incidents in the time frame, but this was not the same as this one, for example:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/07/23/flash.boom/index.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.meteorobs.org/maillist/msg22061.html  It was shortly before 9/11, if I recall correctly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other contrails visible at the time, by the way.

I say this for 2 reasons, as it shifted in a direction directly between the trees in front of me, about 60 feet away, and most importanly, in an instant stopped then accelerated 3 times, in about as many feet. As I sat up looking, either it moved faster than my eyes could track it, or it seemed to vibrate or shimmer losing it&#39;s round shape while in motion. Afterwards resuming course to the SE. Even though it was very small for it&#39;s altitude. Using tangent at 65 degrees 50 feet away at ground level=107 feet high. The size was a thumbsnail at arms length. humidity 90% 59 degrees f. However the upper air vapor in the upper stratosphere was quite dry. This is my first sighting since the first part of march 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two sighting reports from same source.

I sat on the porch and was gazing up to the stars.  I saw what could be described as a game!!  There were seven objects east of my home which looked like where firing upon each other.  I sat and watched for what seemed like a very long time.  There was a reddish object to my left with 3 objects in the middle trying to deflect the shots, and a blueish object to my right.  It seemed like a referee was north and south.  At times, it appeared as if the red was firing at the blue and the 3 lights in the middle were trying to block. Also, at times there were objects that appeared to come from the other 7 objects, or trails of light.  I went inside and woke my spouse and told what I saw.  My spouse and my daughter came out and witness the exact same thing.  I have been a skeptic.  9-2-01.  Too cloudy to observe.  Was hoping to clarify what was seen as fact or fiction.<n>

The &#34;place&#34; is really just a highway scenic overlook on a high ridgeline.  It is very dark, and overlooks the city lights of Wimberly about 15 miles distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and myself were completely sober, and were looking for a &#34;romantic&#34; experience subsequent to a night of talking. I am a huge aviation enthusiast, and ex military. I was hoping to see the usual things one might see at 4 AM such as satelites, the space station, meteors, venus, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed moving from West to East at an altitude appearing equal to satalites a formation of what appeared to be 3 &#34;satalites&#34; in a loose, but not equilateral triangle formation. Stars were visible between the formation, so it was not one craft, but three. The objects were visible as unblinking, dim lights and moved in a constant direction at a constant speed. The speed was consistent with other satalites I&#39;ve seen. The formation was spaced about 1.5 inches apart at arms length. (Assuming low earth orbit) the triangle formation would have covered an area of at least one square mile. The ojects passed directly overhead, and dissapeared off to the East, as they grew too dim to see against the stars. The girl had an extreme reaction to this sighting and ran back to the car, crying. I told her it was probably just three satalites in formation, to calm here down. There was no sound with this sighting. I am color blinde, so the there was no color to report. Everything was consistent with three satalites flying in a loose triangle formation, however satalites do not fly in formation. The entire sighting lasted about 3 minutes, but has stuck with me to this day. I was prompted to post it when reading another identical sighting in Texas on your sight which I have included for a reference. Just a side note... I recently met a Sr. Officer with the Air Force Space Warfare Command and he assured me that there were &#34;OTHER THINGS&#34; in our inventory in addition to spy satalites. Perhaps these were Air Force Craft of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 6/17/2005 04:40 (Entered as : 06/17/2005 4:40) Reported: 6/17/2005 11:53:34 AM 11:53 Posted: 6/20/2005 Location: Goodrich, TX Shape: Light Duration:2 minutes 3 star like objects moving in unison with precision to the north, no change in direction, like small constellation moving fast  I awoke on June 17 at 4:30 in the morning to get the best view of the stars. I am an amateur astronomer, but I usually view the sky in the early evening to about midnight. The milky way is just to the west of my house at this time of the morning. As soon as I stepped onto my upper deck I began to gaze at the sky. A flash of light is what originally got my attention. When I focused on the spot just to the west of me, I noticed three star like lights with the magnitude of about 5 1/2. They were moving in perfect formation like a large 100 degree triangle pointing in the north to about 5 degrees maybe to the east. They seemed to be following the milky ways direction or they were atleast in that portion of the sky. They did not twinkle or vary from their formation. They continued in their direction, northwardly, until they were lost in the distance. It took about 1 to 2 minutes for them to pass from almost directly above me to the horizon. I am not usually up at this time, but I know this is a popular time to view satellites and I have never seen one to know the difference between ufos and normal celestial objects that would be moving that way. Another thing. I could see stars inside the triangle so it was not one solid object. It was like watching a small constellation move across the sky. There was no sound of jets, but I live along side a noisy highway so there was some highway noise. What made this seem so special was the way they moved with such precision together across the sky. I think there is a logical explination for this, but would like to know if what I saw was a ufo. I don&#39;t know why I saw a flash of light first, or if that has anything to do with the formation. It could have been a shooting star, but what a coincidence. I live about 60 miles north of Houston so there is alot of air traffic and they go in that direction the most. I think I have included everything to the best of my knowledge. I hope it is relevent. I am a christian who believes that if God included everything about our universe, the Bible would never end. He lets us figure some things out for ourselves. I believe we are the only humans with the ability to have the holy spirit in our hearts, but nature is an awesome thing. God bless all the scientist and curious people reading this and happy researching. P.S. On the 15th, two days ago we had a major black out over 10 counties lasting from 7pm to 1am. I&#39;m sure if there is anything intellegant flying out in space above our atmospere this looked like some kind of signal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of U. S.

I looked up and saw a red light begin to appear from over the roof. I am not sure how high this thing was but I looked huge it covered the whole sky over head . If it were an aircraft it would have fallen out of the sky,<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved overhead in  a southeastern direction very slowly. I could see that it was triangle shaped and  had large red lights at each tip of the triangle and one in the middle.  It made no sound accept for the very low pitch droning. Seriously it was almost inaudible. It made its way overhead and I could see the back end of it had three red lights like the ones in the bottom on the rear of it.  The lights glowed red like the moon on a lunar eclipse or like the plasma engines in star trek really weird. that’s about it i! t moved really slowly went past the tree line and out of sight.

I quicky paid my bill and exited the building hoping to find some Anbesol in my glove box to help with the tooth ache. I got about half way to my car when I noticed that the tooth ache was subsiding. At the same time I noticed that a faint humming sound in my ear. I don&#39;t know what made me do this, but I looked up at the sky, to the northwest I believe, and noticed a tight formation of 5 aircraft. At first I dismissed them as military planes doing training maneuvers. But as I continued to watch them, they did some pretty remarkable things. The three that were closest to me (5 miles?) suddenly descended from about 25000 feet to about 500 feet.  The other 2 craft, in the rear, simply disappeared. A bright beam began to shine down from one of them. That is when I blacked out. I came to about 30 minutes later in a farm field 10 miles away. I felt refreshed. (I still had my receipt from the Waffle House in my pocket. The time on the reciept showed what time I had left the resturaunt.) What happened during that 30 minute period is beyond me. I can&#39;t remember a thing. Anyway, I found a nearby road and was luckey to find a farm house with a light on inside. The farmer gave me a ride back to my car. It was then that I noticed the my tooth was missing. The strange thing was that there was no blood. It had completely healed over as if I had never been born with a tooth there in the first place. This is what prompted me to visit your website. Looking at my arms and legs, I notice nothing unusual except that there appears to be some kind of injection mark with a lump about the size of a pea on my left bicep. It doesn&#39;t hurt and it seems hard. My vision seems a little blurred. In the back pocket of my jeans, I noticed a piece of paper that has a type of hieroglyphics. One last thing to note, the farmer said that he saw a bright light about 5 minutes before I knocked on his door. He said that it was probably lightning though. I asked him if he had heard if there was any thunder, He said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We were somewhat surprised to learn that there is, indeed, a Roswell, GA.
