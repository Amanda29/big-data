Moments later, the craft paused and a string of red lights began flashing back and forth in a 5-4-3-2-1, 1-2-3-4-5- pattern around the objects midsection. The first craft was then joined by a second craft that flew in from its right side. The two crafts then dropped below the treeline and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later, two jets and a single column of helicopters approached the UFO hotspot from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes the Air Force jets and choppers left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:50 am the craft to the left rose up from the exact location that it had disappeared below the tree line nearly seven hours earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object displayed the same pattern of red flashing lights around its middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it shot straight up, paused and then the red flashing lights began to fade as the UFO took on a more luminous appearance and reminded me of a star as it just hung there in the dark, starry sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the eastern horizon lit up with orange and white colors as a Minute Man 2 missile rose up and within moments began its arc downrange the Eastern Test Range over the Atlantic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The luminous UFO then began zig-zagging across the sky, then performed a falling-leaf pattern, and all in one continuous lightning-swift motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the UFO shot to the left and seemed to draw very near the rapidly climbing missile. Then the UFO darted to the right, paused then shot off to the right again and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited until sunrise but I never got to see the second craft leave the location of which it had apparently landed nearly 12 hours or so earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above UFO sighting was the first of numerous other sightings that happened in the same area over the course of the next nine months.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/15/67 19:30|La Plata|MD|Circle|10 minutes|bright rotating colors, two objects, one large and one much smaller.|10/19/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/010/S10152.html|2|ndxe196712| bright rotating colors, two objects, one large and one much smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A round ball was hovering above the trees in our backyard. It had many different, bright, crystal clear colors rotating on it.  Disappeared when I went outside.  No engine noise.  Cloudy night; no moon or stars. The object was about the diameter of a full sized split foyer house if looking at it from the side view.  It disappeared when I went outside. I went to the back of our property and looked out over this open pasture and about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away was a small round white object about five feet in diameter flying in a very erratic fashion about 5 feet above the ground. I spoke to a neighbor the following day, and he said that he saw something hovering above the national guard armory which is close to our house, but he wouldn&#39;t answer any of my questions after that. I may mail a more complete description of my sighting to you.<n>
12/6/67 03:30|Broadview Heights|OH|Light|20 seconds|Saw descending star-shaped object, slow, bright, no trails, no explosion, twice in 15 years.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38324.html|3|ndxe196712| Saw descending star-shaped object, slow, bright, no trails, no explosion, twice in 15 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright star shaped light that was decending straight down, but desending slower than an object that would be falling.  No trail.  Not a meteor.  Why don&#39;t you have a star shape or bright light in your feild of choice?  Clear winter night, snow on ground, woods all around, got my rifle, dog and went to see what it was.  No explosion, walked 3 miles, nothing found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw same exact shape, decent, and no explosion 15 years later.  Same city.  Differnet direction of view and landing area..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weid part is, that second sighting happened after I move back another 15 years later, got up to go to bathroom, but half way there, I just got this feeling to stop, go back to the window, open curtain.  Then I saw exact same UFO desending same way, looked exactly the same.  No trail, desending slower than something falling, no explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had 2 other sitings, neither of which the same, to the above or to each other.  One suspended in air for about 1/2 hour and one that would appear, disappear a couple of times and then in a clear blue sky, (no clouds), diappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
