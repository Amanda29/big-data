I had carried the trash out and notice a bright light at the horizon. Being fascinated by all things in space I just stood there and watched. I lived by myself then and had no camera. I was so fascinated I might not have thought of it anyway. I had a very rare opportunity to watch this craft move very slow and was moving due west. I would guess it was moving less than 20mph I am not sure the duration of time elapsed  But as it moved closer I knew this was not a normal thing. It passed over my next door neighbors house and even cast enough light to see shadows. It move so slow that I was able to really get a great look. To my eyes it would be as long as a pencil help at arms length. And as reported by others it made no sound. I remember thinking &#34;;there is no sound.&#34;  I told all of my friends and family. Drew everyone a picture and talked about it for months. About 3 years ago a friend call me to tell me he had seen exactly what I drew on TV. Wishing I had seen it to, life went on. Tonight on the Discovery channel I saw the show about sightings and so the video shot by another sighting. The craft in the video is what I saw. I could not ever describe it better. The really strange part was it flew backwards,  flying with a flat side first. I had not ever seen this footage until tonight. The cold chills that I had that night have returned.<n>
1/20/93 21:00|Oliverea|NY|Light|5 minutes|two lights hovering over remote area of Catskill Mountains, made no sound, turned a sharp angle, and sped away|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42802.html|3|ndxe199301| Two lights hovering over remote area of Catskill Mountains, made no sound, turned a sharp angle, and sped away<n> <n><n> <n><n> This encounter took place in the middle of the Catskill Mountains, at about 9pm in the dead of winter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home, and when I walked up onto the front porch, I noticed a light in the sky over the mountains. The sky was clear, and I live several miles from the next closest house, so it was perfectly quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light for a minute, but is was more of a glow more than anything else. Then, a second light came from ground level and slowly raised up in the sky to where the first one was. At that time, the two moved together (independently)toward my general direction. There was absolutley no sound, which I thought was peculiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the two craft slowly, unwavering, and perfectly straight, came over the trees, and at point, they must have been about 200-300 yards from where I was standing on the porch. They traveled for 30 seconds, and then the two accelerated, and did a turn that I can only describe as a sharp angle pinpoint turn, and sped away so fast that they left a light trail in the sky, before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pretty frikkin&#39; scared at that point, I broke the key off in the doorlock. Six years later, I was working as a carpenter on a new house, and I was talking about this incident while we were eating lunch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another carpenter overheard me. He said he was at his home, a few miles down the road from mine, and saw the same thing in 1993!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The first time I saw it I was driving home from work aroung 6:30 pm EST. It had been dark for half an hour. I was traveling north on 441 about 7 miles north of Gainesville on my way home. I then noticed this orange ball of light hovering above the treeline. It just sat there. It glowed but didn&#39;t move. At first I thought maybe it was a heicopter searching for something, but the more I looked at it I realized it couldn&#39;t be a helicopter because the light wasn&#39;t a searchlight. It didn&#39;t reflect a beam of light: it just glowed. It couldn&#39;t have been a plane or helicopter because there were no other lights on it and no strobes. There are some towers in this area but it wasn&#39;t them because I could see them off in the distance and besides they having flashing red lights on them. I didn&#39;t stop to watch further because I had to get home. It was still in the same place as I watched from my rear view mirror until I was too far away from it to see it anymore. The second time I saw it was about a week later with my wife in the car as well. It was in almost the same spot that I saw it in the last time, but I think it was further north along the road. She didn&#39;t want me to stop and look at it so we continued on home. I saw it again about a week after that. So this time I stopped my car on the edge of the road to check it out. Unfortunately because of the height of the trees next to the road, it blocked my view of the orange ball of light. There was no sound from that spot in the sky. I thought surely I would hear an engine of some kind, but I didn&#39;t. When I got backl on the road I could still see it above the trees until I was too far away to see it anymore. I never reported this to anyone because of the skepticism most authorities have towards this type of siuation. I have driven this stretch of everyday for the last 7 years and I have seen nothing like that before or since.<n>

My parents were gone on a winter vacation.  On this particular night it was snowing quite heavily.  The three of us were out side talking, (as my friend was about to leave), when my friend saw a bright light in the western sky.  At first we thought nothing of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood there talking for about five minutes, the light never moved from its position.  At that point we relized it was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, we were not really talking but paying close attention to the object.  There was no sound and it did not move from it&#39;s position in the air.  As I said it was snowing quite hard and would not have been a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother became very scared and ran back into the house.  Shortly there after my friend and I felt it would be best if he left.  I went back in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my friend arrived at his home he called me.  He told me as he drove east back towards his house, which was about 15 miles to the east of my parents house, he lost sight of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some pressure from my friend, he got me to go out to check and see if the light was still there.  I went out and looked and the light was still in the air.  It was snowing harder and the light was brighter.  I was immediatly froze in my tracks, and chills ran through my body.  I was on the cordless phone with my friend and when I didn&#39;t say any thing he started yelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped out of it and told him it was there.  So we stayed on the phone together as I watched the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about thirty minutes, I could not take the cold any longer and had to return inside.  The light was still in the sky when I went back in to the house.  I had witnessed odd lights in the night sky before, but nothing ever like this and nothing this extrordinary since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/15/93 22:30|Canadian|TX|Triangle|15 minutes|It was triangular in shape, massive in size and eerily quiet.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42239.html|6|ndxe199301| It was triangular in shape, massive in size and eerily quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a State Trooper working the night shift and was patrolling US83 south of Canadian, TX.   It was around 10:30PM local time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always had a citizens band radio on and had been listening to two truck drivers enjoying a conversation.  It was an unusually warm evening for a winter night and I was wearing short sleeves and had the car window cracked a bit as I slowly patrolled northbound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this is the Texas panhandle area, the land is fairly flat, but with some rolling hills every so often.  I could see the two trucks ahead of me and all three of us were driving north.  The two trucks were approximately 1 - 1.5 miles ahead of me.  As we neared the Washita Creek bridge on US83, the road dipped down into a little valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the trucks as they dipped lower than me.  One of the drivers was talking away when he suddenly stopped and said &#34;What the hell is that&#34;?   I heard the second driver say &#34;What are you...oh hell!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The radio was silent for a few seconds and then I heard the second trucker say &#34;I nearly ran into you when you stopped.  Are you pulling over?&#34;  To which the other trucker said &#34;Hell yes...I want to see it&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I was starting down the incline toward the creek and I could see one truck stopped and on the side of the road and the other pulling past it to park in front of it.  I still didn&#39;t know what they were talking about but started slowing down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I crossed the bridge and at that point I saw the driver of the truck just in front of me standing in the middle of US83.  He was looking west and upward.  This was the first time that I realized a very bright light was shining onto the ground from what appeared to be a very large dark object which seemed to be about 1,000 feet in the air and maybe a mile and a half away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember thinking this because I&#39;d been down the dirt road that runs from this location west and was fairly familiar with the topography here...and I could make out it was over another hill.  I was afraid I&#39;d be run over from behind so I started to park my patrol car on the shoulder beside the first truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the second driver running to the first one and pointing at the object.  At this point, a small passenger car topped the hill just north of us and started slowing down...probably from seeing the two trucks and my car parked there.  But as the car passed by I saw the brake lights come on and the car slightly screeched to a stop right in the middle of the south-bound lane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a female driver and she stepped out of her car, right foot still inside but standing outside the car, and was looking at the object.  I asked her to quickly move out of the road.  She turned to me and said &#34;What is that?&#34;  I told her I didn&#39;t know, but to please move.  She did so quickly and then came back to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now there were the two truckers, the lady and myself standing on the shoulder of the southbound lane.  I couldn&#39;t hear a sound from the craft but could see a immensely bright beam of light shining straight down.  The light didn&#39;t sway back and forth like a search light or anything...it just shone straight down.  Suddenly I was aware of the fact that the object appeared to be moving toward us very slowly.  This was because I realized the sheer dimensions of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a moonless night..or as best as I can remember it was moonless.  Thousands of stars in a totally black sky made it very easy to see that the object was indeed moving toward us.  It was triangular in shape.  That was obvious almost from the start.  The point was forward as if you&#39;d imagine a triangle being mobile and one of the points being the front of the object.  (I hope that makes sense)<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. Not even a whisper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized no one was talking...I think we were completely confounded by what we were seeing.  After around five minutes, the object had gotten to a point that I felt it was within a mile of us.  I still had the strong sensation that it was higher above us than it appeared.  That&#39;s when the bright light simply shut off and it was easier to see the outline of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mere size of the craft was incredible.  If my references are even near what I think they are, I&#39;d estimate the size of the craft to be at least 1000&#39; per side.  It was massive.  The reason I use this word is two fold.  One is from the dimensions of it.  But the other is this.  As the craft neared being almost directly over us, I remember feeling weight....felt something heavy on me.  It also seemed as if there was a haze around the object...just barely off of the surface that seemed to make the stars near the edge flicker before they were occulted by the object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remember realizing I was holding my breath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And although we couldn&#39;t hear anything, one of the truckers said,  &#34;Do y&#39;all feel that?&#34;  It felt as though everything, the road, the air, us...everything seemed to be vibrating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up to this point, I don&#39;t think what I felt was fear....just amazement.  But when the craft was directly over us, something happened.  I was staring straight up at it, and I remember at this point that the women started sobbing and ran away to her car.  She left before I ever said another word to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was black. Much blacker than the sky.  This may have been an illusion from all the stars in the background, but it was darker to me.  But as I looked up, I suddenly saw a circle appear...just forward of what would be the center of the object.  This circle didn&#39;t light up. It became darker...as if there was absolutely no light shining from it or reflected from it.  Without a doubt it was darker than the rest of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft literally stopped directly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the drivers asked me if I should call for help.  I told him I didn&#39;t know what I&#39;d say.  The thought did cross my mind, but I was thinking they&#39;d be thinking I was crazy back at the Sheriff&#39;s Office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then started pivoting above us...with the point moving clockwise in relation to me until it was pointed in a generally north-west direction. Then it began moving again.  I remember hearing one of the truckers talking, but my ears felt as if they were going to pop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, there wasn&#39;t a sound from it...but a tremendous feeling of weight or pressure...sort of like when you dive deeply into the water.  That kind of feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft moved off slowly, one of the drivers said something about driving to the top of the next hill to see it more clearly.  He started to turn away and at that moment the craft sped up noticeably, then shot off to the northwest in a matter of 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drivers asked me what we should do and I told them I didn&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t know what we saw, what we experienced.  One of the drivers, the one that said he wanted to see it from the hilltop, ran to his truck and drove north.  I ran to my patrol car and got in, passed him on the way north and pulled over at the top of the rise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all got out again but couldn&#39;t see anything.  I remember my ears were ringing like mad.  Looking back, I think this was side effects of an adrenaline rush.  I&#39;ve been in shootings, high-speed pursuits and numerous other tension-filled moments and I always have that reaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some time, we all got in our vehicles and left.  I went straight home.  I undressed and took a shower.  I still could see the object in my mind...and am absolutely convinced about the darker circle inside the craft.  I<n> <n><n> <n><n> then sat down at my desk in the study and sketched out the craft on a piece of paper.  I then went into my bedroom where my wife was asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I lay down, she rolled over to kiss me goodnight but stopped and asked &#34;Have you been fighting a grass fire or something?&#34;  I said no and asked why.  She told me I smelled like burned grass or hair.  I told her what I&#39;d seen just an hour earlier.  She knew I was sincere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I got out of bed and walked into the bathroom. As I looked in the mirror, I saw that my face looked like I had a very light sunburn.  Not deep red...just a little blushed.  I looked down and most of the hair on both arms looked as if I&#39;d been synged with a flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife and she came in and gasped at how I looked.  We looked in the bed and there was a mass of burned hair on my pillow and the sheets.  I say burned...I mean it was very brittle and it and I still smelled like I&#39;d been fighting a fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was 12 years ago.  I still see it in my mind and I sometimes dream about it.  I&#39;ve never told anyone other than my dearest and most trusted friends.  I have no doubt that what I saw was real.  I have no doubt that it was huge, it was manned, and it was being intelligently operated.  I&#39;m not assuming anything...that it was an alien craft, a military craft or whatever.  But what I saw moved with great stealth when I first saw it and was able to reach an unbelievably high speed in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So...as you&#39;re reading this, you may think I&#39;m nuts.  But this is the single-most bizarre thing I&#39;ve ever experienced, and I&#39;m absolutely convinced it was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The incident happened some ten years ago, but probably you will be interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a soldier in the Bulgarian army. I had a duty between 2:00 and 4:00 in the morning. Those days I hadn&#39;t a swatch on me, that&#39;s why I often used to check the time looking at the stars. This time I saw a light, which was moving with random speed, changing its direction rather chaotic. First thought was that this should be a helicopter from the near airbase, but helicopters do not move like that, and do not have this type of light. I would say that the object was looking like a bright star, which was probably not so far from us. It moved sometimes slow, sometimes faster, and traectory was not straight, but rather chaotic. I actualy have some idea where this object exactly was, but I am no sure if I can say that in the Internet. At 4 o&#39;clock my colleague came to change me. With him there were three more people. Later on he said that after about 15 more minutes, the object suddenly disappeared: &#39;It was like a falling star - not falling on the ground, but falling in the sky.&#39; I would add that there was no sound, no flashes, no color changes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It looked like a very bright star and was about that size when we first noticed it.It took only a couple minutes to get home from there, we got out of the car and kept looking at it as it slowly came closer. It was very slow and very low. It was a perfect triangle in shape and had round muted lights around the three sides,on the bottom of it about 8 or 10 lights on each side. The color of it was gray-black. It looked no more than several city blocks up in the air it looked that low. We were able to watch it for at least 10 minutes till it went south east and I thought it was going towards the airport. Was a beautiful Craft very huge and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Its length appeared to be more than a mile long. The object was as dark as the sky, all I could see was many of its small dim lights on its edge. The object had a irregular shape, sort like a fat letter &#34;T&#34;. It traveled with a great speed. The object flew acrossed the entire sky within about 10 seconds. It spined slowly with rate about 10RPM. The huge object was extremly quiet. I didn&#39;t hear any sound!
