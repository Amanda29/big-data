Between Fruitville and University Pkwy the horses started to spook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we turned around there was a very large cylinder shaped craft behind us. It covered the roadway from fence to fence( what would soon be 6 lanes, a large median and shoulder lanes) , very large , NO NOISE at all , just flashing rotating lights of various colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mesmerizing to say the least like you could almost reach out and touch it. We all turned and just watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The horses started to spook and brought us all back to reality.  We then decided to split up and run. It disappeared behind us as fast as it had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I went outside the house by the pool. I looked up and saw what I thought was a 2-sided triangle of birds flying in formation beneath the clouds. The only thing is, upon closer examination, the thing had three sides and for the life of me I could not see individual birds flying. It looked to me like one of those racks you use for playing billiards. It was silent, moving south to north. I asked my girlfriend to look at it, she didn&#39;t know what to make of it. It had no lights. I tried to calculate its size by comparing it to the distance to the bottom of the low rolling clouds. The reason I say &#34;rolling&#34; is that I could see the bottom of the clouds in detail, they were moving pretty fast. It was kind of windy that night. I&#39;ve heard a lot of reports of &#34;triangles&#34; flying in the air, but never one like what I saw. I thought perhaps if you add this to your database, someone else may have seen something similar. I am a UNIX system administrator, I&#39;ve been working with computers since 1986. I&#39;m 40 years old, male, married, two kids.<n>

I heard over a CB radio that a ball of fire was coming across the sky.  I had time to pull off at the top of the mountain at a brake test area.  At which time I climbed to the highest area I could climb to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon my observation platform (rock) I was able to watch the ball of fire approach me.  As it grew near I could see that it was a structure that was a saucer shaped.  Fire was shooting from the portholes outside of the rim of the craft.  It looked like a wheel spinning around the outside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the feeling that the craft was in trouble it made no noise and I felt no heat.  It was moving approx. 20-30-MPH  Just putting.  It traveled over the top of my head just putting going very slow.  I was able to see the portholes where fire was emerging.  I watched the vehicle travel 20-30MPH creeping along the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I lost sight of the vehicle I returned to my truck and continued my journey.  When I reached Barstow, CA, the next morning, I listened to a local radio station.  The radio said people from California- New Mexico had seen the object.  The US Air Force said it was a Russian booster rocket had re-entered the atmosphere and burnt up.  I witnessed this object in controlled flight.  It slowly made its way NE along the mountains.  I was able to make out details of the bottom and sides of the vehicle because it was only 100-150 feet above me.  I heard no sound and there was no heat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning the Barstow radio station announced that it was a Russian booster rocket that had blown up.  I know that it was not a Russian booster rocket.  I had a feeing that it was in trouble.  I am not an artist but I can describe what it looked like.  Had it not been so close I would not be able to give a description of it. I know there were other people that saw it but I was so awe struck that I didn&#39;t know if anyone  else was around.  I have never seen this kind of technology since. If you want a picture I would have to find an! artist that could draw.  But it was basically a wheel rotating around the perimeter of the main craft.  Craft being about 50-75 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Thank you for listening to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be quite serious-minded, and credible as a witness.

3/1/81 22:00|Campbell|CA|Cigar|3 minutes|Multiple sighting in Campbell CA of spacecraft in detail|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49236.html|4|ndxe198103| Multiple sighting in Campbell CA of spacecraft in detail<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time in 1981 the following was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There had been sightings of lights and objects reported on the news at the local San Jose Airport. Even some friends were talking about the sitings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night after friends wer etalking we were sitting in a friends car outside of his house listening to the radio when we saw what appeared to be 3 lights go down behind the houses in the horizon. We both freaked and immediately drove in that direction but did not find anything and blew it of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple nights later we again were siting in the car but this time facing north listening to the radio when we saw a bright orange light approaching us. It appeared to be flying very low. My friend said it was a helicopter. Then all of a sudden it began to move back and forth eradictly. We both jumped out of the car as it flew directly overhead. It dimmed its lights and sat there motionless and silent overhead. It slowly turned off its lights and hovered above us. You could see all the detail of the ship. It had an observaton deck on the side and you could see inside a window and I noticed objects moving inside but could not make out any details other then something inside. The craft was probably about 1000 feet in the air. I would estimate that it was about 100 feet long. You could see dark burned looking edges on the craft. It was shaped like a cigar and had half domes in the back side of the craft that spun like gyros. In these gyros there was red and green lights. When the craft departed the gyros began to spin and the craft moved faster as the gyros spun. By this time my friend ran into the house to tell his parents while I just stood there staring. It finally took off and was instantly gone leaving a trail like Star trek. I was obviously freaked out. My friend ran out of the house and explained that his mom and dad were in the house watching the news as they were explaing that peopel were at the airport waiting to see the lights that were spotted the night before. We called the airport and they laughed. So they gave us the UFO report center number. I called and reported the sighting. To my surprise there is no record of our call. i have called back many time to check and checked all over many websites and have yet to see anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I went to another friends house to tell him about it. We sat and looked for about an hour but saw nothing. When i got on my motorcycle to go home I noticed the orange ligth again towards the Santa Cruz Mountains. The light appeared to be moving towards my neighborhood again. I drove home quickly parked my bike on the side of the house and ran into the house. I looked out my window and the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day me and my friend told everyone. Everyone thought we were doing drugs. Even my aprents thought we were crazy or on drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a wek later I was working as a custodian at a local school when I looked towards Los Gatos and saw the light. I went into a room and came out and it was gone. I was again kind of freaked out about it. I then put away all my equipment and was walking towards my bike when a truck load of friends came flying around the corner. They had just sighted the craft again at another friends house exactly where I was looking from the school. There was also anothe sighting for a short time early one evening but not competely confirmed because it was in a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/81 17:45|McKinleyville|CA|Other|00:00:20|Large (house-sized), slow moving (45-60 mph), low altitude (&lt; 2,000') meteor witnessed spring 1981 N. CA.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94903.html|5|ndxe198103| Large (house-sized), slow moving (45-60 mph), low altitude (&amp;lt; 2,000&#39;) meteor witnessed spring 1981 N. CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was of a VERY large, slow moving meteor at an altitude WELL below 5,000 feet, probably below 2,000 feet.  Depending on the actual altitude (without a point of reference, judging size and distance is difficult on an object), its size could have been as small as a very large cargo truck or cabin-sized house to a medium to large two-storey house.  It was travelling on an almost level track (west to east), at an approximate speed of 45-60 mph.  There was no trail of any sort. I could clearly see the distinct cragginess in detail.  The coloration varied from an earthy brown to black with lighter splotches of tan to white.  I could clearly see scorch marks along the leading surface, trailing back about 1/4-1/3 the length of the cuboidal shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three distinct jets of green fire. One from the edge between the face facing me and the face oriented toward the ground. The second appeared to come from the edge between the face away from me and the face oriented toward the ground. The third came from the upper face, perhaps along the edge of the face away from me. The three jets were all the same size. The first was in the front third, while the other two were almost all the way to the back. The jet facing me sputtered violently, while the others were more of a flicker. The length of flame was probably about 12 - 18 inches, and perhaps 3 - 5 inches in diameter. As the meteor travelled from left to right it rocked back and forth along all three axes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling north on US 101 between Arcata and Mckinleyville, CA. I was approaching the Mad River bridge about 15 - 20 minutes before sundown on a Sunday in Feb or Mar of 1981 (I know it was Sunday because I was on my way to church). The Coastal Range was to my immediate right, the ridge about 1,000 - 2,000 feet above the highway. When I saw the meteor out over the ocean, I rolled down my window to try and hear it, and couldn&#39;t. When It passed over the trees out of sight (still ahead of me slightly), I tried to see and hear if there was interaction with the trees along the ridge. Again, I couldn&#39;t hear anything, and there was no visible indication of fire or explosion.  I interpretted this to mean it had passed at least a couple of hundred feet above the closest foliage, or else the radiant heat would have probably caused a fire.  On my return trip an hour-and-a-half later, there was no sign of disturbance.  I assumed it struck the ground on the east side of the Central Valley opposite the Redding, CA area, perhaps striking the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Range. I watched the papers, and listened to the radio for other reports of this meteor.  Although I told a number of friends in the area, I never reported the sighting, primarily because I didn&#39;t know to whom or where to make the report.  Even this is not truly the best place to report this, but it is the only one that I know of at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
