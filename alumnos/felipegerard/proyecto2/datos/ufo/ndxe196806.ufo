Even though it is nighttime I can clearly see it&#39;s shape and the lights around it, it is of medium size, and is making absolutley no sound.  People who know me are amazed at my sharp memory for recalling events and dates from many years ago, this either happened in the fall of &#39;67 or &#39;68, one of the two.  This sighting was not an airplane, a toy, etc.  I still remember well to this day close to 40 years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Therefore I know that I have seen a valid UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

6/30/68 14:00|Hillsboro|KS|Unknown|5 minutes to 10 minutes|No saucers no lights Just 6 olive dull green humanoids about 7ft came to Hillsboro Missouri and studied me and left|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71132.html|3|ndxe196806| No saucers no lights Just 6 olive dull green humanoids about 7ft came to Hillsboro Missouri and studied me and left<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was aprox. 4 at the time this happened to me, I was with my mother visiting my grand parents out on Jarvis road in hillsboro Mo.  We were use to grandpa getting up every night to get snacks so never thought much of it if we heard doors even being little we wouldn&#39;t . I was laying on my back next to my mom that night Ill never forget as long as I am able to think and breath ill remember it as if it were last night. I heard a door open , knowing my grandmas house well I knew in my little mind it was the breeze way door from the sound it use to make .  It would have been around dark mid morning .<n> <n><n> <n><n> This twin bed my mom and I were cramped into was straight visioned to see down the hall.  I lifted my head slightly and seen these tall forms in a single line walking soundlessly straight at my mother and I were we lay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so afraid to move If a 4 year old could have heart failure I was having it , just as I got the nerve to try to bump my mom or scream it was like them being all around us at the bed in a operational formation , somehow they didn&#39;t let me do anything at all.  I could move or talk or nothing it was like they calmed me in my mind only not like a mom would more like very matter of fact with firm thoughts , they never made a sound at all .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember my eyes being able to move watching them stand over us . Seemed like they were studying me as I think back on it they touched or seem to touch places of my joints.  But I didn&#39;t feel them touch me it was like I just new they were . So hard to explain but then they all the sudden looked at one another and left in a single line just as they had walked in . My mind goes blank at this point the next thing I remember is I wake up next to my mom and am frantic to tell her what happened to me, she of  of corse being a mom along with the whole family said you probably just heard grandpa  get up and had a dream.  I remember wondering why when something like this happened to me they didn&#39;t want to know or wouldn&#39;t listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking back I wonder how can a little 4 year old dream in 1967 and see detailed humanoids that have a eery glow of greenish mist about them with huge black eyes same form and color and glow as would be said now in 2009 . How can a little girl know this when the only Aliens she has seen at this age is my favorite martian. Some man with a fish bowl on his head. Well I know I am not a liar or making up things now at 46 to impress anyone . I really finally just want to tell someone in hopes that maybe when I am gone and other things happen who knows maybe one of us and what happened to us or things that we saw will help someone out there that needs that little puzzle piece and if not it is alright with me as well, because they left me I feel better than I was before they came. I have because of them lived my life so much more open minded than I might have before it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were now I am guessing about 7 foot tall at least that .<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had a dull colored lime glow of misty look to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had no visual ears , they had black eyes They&#39;re head was shaped like a smooth cone huge top small chin They had a line where the mouth would be but very dim impression They communicated to me seemingly with thought and was able to control me as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They not once made me feel threatened or took me out of that bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would give anything to talk to someone else who has maybe went through this not all the bells and whistles and flying off with them but just they came and  studied you and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The object flew directly over our house and by the time we got outside it had disappeared.

6/30/68 12:00|Yankton (Gavins Point Dam)|SD|Unknown|20 minutes|Blue sky black, beam of light, South Dakota camp rangers on  blow horns "what you have just seen was a rare phenomenon of the weather.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69466.html|7|ndxe196806| Blue sky black, beam of light, South Dakota camp rangers on  blow horns &#34;what you have just seen was a rare phenomenon of the weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping with my mother at Gavins Point Dam near Yankton. South Dakota.  We were in the first camping area above the dam on the South Dakota side.  I was young. it was at a time that women didn&#39;t work and many mothers and children were camping.  I looked at the road across the dam to see my dad (I was looking for him to come to camp from work) and the sky which had been full daylight turned black.  The sky was completely black there was no daylight.  From the sky came down a beam of light.  Not like a flashlight but slowly down to the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beam of light then went scanning the up the river and then the beam came back towards where it started still focused on the river.  The beam went back up as it had come down and the sky became blue.  Everyone at the campground was yelling UFO, UFO.  And then it happened again.  The entire sky became black and the beam came down to the river it scanned the river up and down.  And then the beam went back up and the sky became blue.  Everyone was yelling UFO, UFO.  And then the park rangers drove around with a blow horn saying &#34;what you have just seen was a rare phenomenon in the weather &#34;over and over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that night or afternoon when my dad came home from work we (my mother and I) didn&#39;t tell him what happened.  We had forgotten, I think everyone forgot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a year later I was in Omaha, NE and I saw the movie &#34;Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind&#34; and while watching the show I remembered.  After the show I asked my mom if she remembered and she said she did but I think she was humoring me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When In college I went to a lecture on ufos and they talked about the beam of light.  It was the first time I had heard anyone talk about it.  They invited anyone that had seen a ufo to talk to them after the lecture.  I wanted to but I was afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in  college I was taking a course in meteorology and they talked of rare phenomonens in the weather and I wanted to ask about what I had seen.  I was still confused by the rangers then.  I was to afraid to ask and also I knew sort of that it wasn&#39;t a weather phenomenon that  I would have been asking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some time later I was at a ufo convention in Lincoln, NE.  Stanton Friedman was there and I told him my story about what I saw and about my memory.  And he said there was a lot of government in South Dakota which I still don&#39;t understand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides having my memory stepped on I believe I was given a fear program.  I think it was to cause me not to talk about what I saw if I did remember.  The first time I told my story at the UFO bookstore to a group I was really unusually scared to say it.  After I told my story for the first time there was no fear of telling it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to hear from anyone that was camping that same day and saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was moving way to fast to be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a little older than my niece, I joked that it was a UFO, just to see what she‘d say.  She was about 14 years old and very level headed for her age.  &#34;No,&#34; she said, &#34;It’s probably a satellite.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I agreed with her and we watched it together as it moved completely across the horizon from left to right in less than a couple of minutes, then about ¾’s of the way, it suddenly made a hard right angle turn and shot off into space and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve been watching the skies ever since and in all these years, I’ve never seen anything like that again.  But it convinced me that ‘they’ are out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

This was on the second floor of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> t then proceeded to go up and away from the house.  Since that time, my sister has had numerous, I would call events, that have caused her to say that she has been visited by other UFO&#39;s, at different times, which has made me think that there may have been many abductions of my sister by these UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched, on TV, other people say that they have been visited and been abducted many times as well, ((deleted)) by these creatures inside theses crafts perhaps for the purpose of making hybrids, and one women did think she saw her (hybrid) daughter inside of one of these crafts<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My father and mother was managing an apartment building on Kenmore Ave. during this time.  I was around twelve years old.  Their were six children in the family so at night we had to sleep two to a bed.  This night I was sleeping with my brother.  During the middle of the night I woke up to find an alien sleeping with us.  It was in the middle of our bed.  My brother was on his side facing the middle of the room and I was on my side with my back to the wall.  I looked at this thing and was scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about waking my brother up but was afraid that I would wake this thing up.  Then I thought about kicking my brother with my foot and again I was scared I would wake this thing up.  I finally went back to sleep and when I woke in the morning it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told my mother or father because I did not think that they would have believed me.  Years later I had seen on tv of what these aliens looked liked and it was what I had seen in my bed back in the late 60&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know you will not believe me, but this story is true and I have had to live with this for all my life and now I am 53 years old and live in the state of TN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We had a large bay window in the living room and I saw the lights outside so I decided to climb up onto the couch and look out.  It was the moon.  It was full and bright and very red, then blue, then green, then yellow and red again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 3-4 flying saucers and they hovered just outside in my back yard.  I walked outside in my pj&#39;s and looked up at them.  They streamed acrossed the sky and danced with colored lights.  I watched one land on the hill just behind my house and I remember walking up the hill and into the space craft.  I don&#39;t remember too much after entering the ship but I do remember not feeling afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked back inside my house and got my glass of water and went straight to bed.  I woke the next morning and in my tiny little hand was a flower.  It was colored a brightly blue soft color with a red center and the sem was a greenish yellow tint.  I put it away inside a book so my mom or dad wouldn&#39;t find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would find myself looking out the big bay window from my living room almost every night after that first night for a long time that I can remember.  But they didn&#39;t come back until years later.  I saw them again in the years between 1986 &amp; 1987 while I was feeding my horses one early morning in May.  Also again on my way to work in 1982.  And again in Rockville Md while driving home along Shady Grove Road off RT270S near the Metro Station in 1999.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen them many times and I think that I&#39;ve had contact with them , but I can&#39;t remember anything other than knowing that they&#39;ve been here.

The porch faced west toward Mingus Mountain, we were just setting there discussing our days events. As the conversation slowed my sister and I noticed about the same time an odd light rising over the mountain. As it got about three fingers high, it suddenly lit up the whole valley, like it was dusk, which by this time it was dark. It was oval shaped, and just hovered there for about half an hour. Then the light went out slowly until it was a small light and dark out. All of a sudden two more lights merged with the other and hovered there for a couple of seconds and then shot off to the North,and then there was only the dark sky and stars.

What started it for me was in 1967 or 68 in june I saw a large disc tree top high at about 15 mph .It was about 250ft around.and I could see the writing of some kind on the craft .I was in my dads yard and the ufo flew just over the trees across the road -my dad was under his car and dident come uot to see it when I yelled look.So I went to see if anyone nextstore saw it.Thay had there backs to it hanging cloyhs on the line... &#34;However they saw me&#34; about 9/2/03 I saw on the history channel that the cattel mutalations started in about 1967.And they say that it is lasers that make those clean cuts. And back then there was no laser or portable ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1967 in late june I was 8 year old-- this was after I saw the ufo--I was playing alone in the woods just behind the house for a while. Then I came to the front of the yard to see we had company--My dads sister and boys my age --they went to the treehouse--so I to went to find them --I went up the tree into the the treehouse --5 minits or so later I noticed my right leg felt funny --So I went back down to the house to my bedroom and pulled down my long leg bluejeans --with no cut in them--or no blood on them --I looked at my leg and I had a 6 inch long cut a inch and a half deep--still not bleeding--and no pain --I went to show my mom to take me to the doctor and have it sticked up--She said what happend --and I said I don&#39;t no-- But it is a laser cut made by that ufo I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1968 in june agin--I was with one of my 3 brothers picking blackbarrys with the family dog. This time we where accross the road from my dads house direcly under the path of the ufo I saw the year befor.  I said to my brother --I found more barrys over here so we went deeper into the woods and never seemed to find the barrrys --We thought we got lost--We got picked up by a ufo and they took us to a place and dropped us off--We think-- WE saw pine trees with snow on the branches ? --The next thing we no we found areselfs inside of a hourse fence a mile from home.--there is no way we could have walked there without crossing a tar road and 2 dirt roads. We did not cross any roads lost in the woods to get there. Thats where they dropped us off. We new right what had just happend. Also we don&#39;t remember when we lost the family dog. but the dog was at home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1976 trapping season my same brother went to cheak our trap line in back of the house--with a friend they dident go far--on a hay feild at dusc they heard a crashing noise like branches braking--They stopped and saw a dark image of a small ufo come right out of the forest and stop at the feild --then it started to glow and they ran and got me and we all went back to the spot --we took a gun with --We dident see anything at frst so we went farther back to a tree line dividing 2 feilds--At the end of the next feild we could see a red object that flew in the night sky slowly over the trees --the light would go out--and when it came back on it was forward and down from where it was--and when the light went out agin and came back on it was back and up from where it just was--and we could see the tree tops lighting up under it --like it was taking picturs 1999 I was at my dads cabin in atkin MN with my family of 3 and we slept in a camper in the yard that stay.after we left my dad called me to say there was 3 dark rings in the grass in the most open part of the yard.He said they where not there untill we stayed over the weekend<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I would guess it to be at least 150-200 feet at it&#39;s widest point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred when I was a child (about 8 or 9 years old) and could have happened in the summer of 1969.  I was camping with my family in Upper Lisle Park but was alone fishing in pond in a somewhat secluded area about 1000 feet south of Upper Lisle Rd. and 300 feet west of Whitney Point Reservoir.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing north at dusk as the craft came directly over me and continued moving north at a speed I would judge at about 5-10 miles an hour.  I watched until the trees to the north of me blocked my view.  I ran back to the campsite thinking everyone there would have seen it and would be talking about it.  However no one was, and afraid of being ridiculed,  I did not tell anyone that day of my experience.  I figured since it flew just above the trees, the trees must have blocked their view.  Plus it made no noise and it was getting dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had arrived late to set up the tent in the Badlands of South Dakota.  We had just finished setting up the tent when my dad and I looked up into the sky.  It was a very clear night and very dark so you could see thousands of stars in the sky.  Just about one minute after we started looking at the sky, I saw two objects the size of the stars seem to separate from one location.  They slowly made a huge circle in the sky and came back together again.  I could not believe what I was seeing so without looking away from them (I did not want to lose track of the objects), about half way into the circle I asked my dad if he was seeing what I was seeing.  He said he was.  When they came back together the object was one again. It began to slowly move in one direction and then picked up speed quickly and within a second was gone.  I continued to look for a while, but it was over.  I turned to my dad and asked him what he thought it was.  He said he was not sure.  I said could that have been a UFO and again playing it safe he said he was not sure.  But I know what I saw, and my dad verified the fact that I was not seeing things.  The USA or the rest of the world did not have anything that could have made that circle and disappeared that fast.  I am convinced this was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was about 8-years old at time of sighting. Myself and a group of 5 or 6 boys were playing football in a open field at the time of sighting. It was still daylight but just getting toward dusk. Sky was clear and blue. We all seemed to notice at about the same time an egg or oval shaped object slightly smaller than a dime held at arms length. The object moved across the sky in a more or less straight line from west to east. The entire object was luminescent. As if you were looking at the moon. There was no sound and no other type of lights on object. It moved at a leisurely pace across the sky and was in sight for about 5-10 seconds. Always wondered what it was that we saw that day.

As I was driving up this small hill I noticed a huge oddly shaped object to my left hugging close to the ground and trees.  I thought it and I still think it could have been some kind of balloon used to bonce radar or radio waves off of because of its chrome appearance metallic surface.  I watched it drift over an open field up and over a forested area.    It was 100-150 feet in diameter generally spherical in shape, but deflated in appearance.  I could see sharp angular edges mostly near the bottom of the object.  I drove home and told my dad.  He was not so interested.  Then one of his frieds came over and said.  &#34;Did you see that thing? It was huge&#34; to my dad.  Wanted to get hypnotised to remember better details.  The exact date is unknown.  All I remember about the date was I was 16 years old and it was summer time.  It may have been a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The three of us went to visit a married couple maybe 7 or 8 miles away from where my wife and I lived off Highway 49, 4 miles south of Georgetown, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to the couple&#39;s small secluded house up a long driveway, we discovered only the woman was home; her husband was in the Bay Area on business.  We evidently chatted for awhile.  I recall looking at their posters fastened to the wall and I was admiring how flat and perfectly displayed they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 of us left the couple&#39;s house, at the approximate time listed above, exited their driveway and began returning to Garden Valley.  Evidently we were at the intersection of Highway 49 and Garden Valley Green Valley Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky lit up.  I recall all heads (3) in immediate unison and perfectly coordinated lock onto the saucer (I was driving).  The trees were all lit up, the craft was above us slightly in front, visible through the windshield and off to the driver&#39;s side of the vehicle (a 59 Chevrolet Impala).  My thought were &#34;I could hit that with a rock.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began to move slowly from its forward position toward the rear of the vehicle.  I stuck my head out the driver&#39;s side window and watch it cruise overhead keeping its same altitude.  There was an inner ring with windows lighting up individually from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my head out of the vehicle and followed the craft until it arrived beyond the rear of the car.  It disappeared as if a light switch had been flipped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remembered nothing.  It wasn&#39;t until 1978, probably, that the I began to remember the sighting.  By that time my wife and I had divorced and I was estranged from our daughter.  I was living then, in the Bay Area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had occasion to visit, with a friend from my work, friends of his.  They were watching television, a program I had never seen, Battle Star Galactica.  I could not watch, I panicked, I had to leave, get outside into the fresh air and! away from that program.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fragments of the disk encounter began to quickly on occasion flash into consciousness over the following months.  In 1981 (?) I had moved back to my home town and the town where my ex-wife now lived also.  It came to pass that my ex wife, also recently separated from her second marriage, drove to Lake Tahoe California for an overnight at my new employer&#39;s cabin.  There were four of us in my car, the ex, her son by marriage number 2, and our daughter.  My daughter asks in route, &#34;Dad have you ever seen a flying saucer?&#34;  I ask my ex wife, &#34;Have you ever seen a flying saucer.?  She replies, &#34;You ought to know.&#34;  That was the end of the discussion evidently on that road trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been difficult to remember to ask her what she remembers.  I did ask her, &#34;Who was the 3rd person in the car with us.&#34;  She said who she thought it was.  A couple of years later I asked, &#34;Why didn&#39;t we drive off the road and crash?&#34;  She said, &#34;We were stopped.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact that we stopped was in my report but I needed to ask, years later, I remembered zip.  I have yet to ask her when she began to recall the sighting.  The memory was evidently erased yet we were &#39;allowed&#39; to recall the pass over.  At least that is all I can recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did go under hypnosis, maybe 1984/5.  The psychologist asked me while under hypnosis what did I see.  &#34;I see us on the ground.&#34; 3 standing by the car.  Then I said &#34;I see dead people in the dark.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> You just said on the Jeff Rense Show 02-14-14, why doesn&#39;t anyone who has been directly underneath a saucer report in even if its 8 decades.  At your service.  The event under the craft gets your memory wiped, at least in our too close for comfort encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t get me wrong I consider myself exalted by this unique experience.<n>

We all had mixed emotions. My Mom was frightened, I wished to leave the car, and she kept screaming for me not too! She recently died.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until now I was not allowed by my family to discuss the event. We held it in our family. My brother has zero problems talking about this, nor my sister but my Mom was frightened to a point where she tried to speed away in our car, however time stopped, we could not move! It was really fascinating I thought?  I knew all about UFO encounters as my father was in the Korean war and the US Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred while we were heading home from my grandmothers home in Short Hills, NJ on Old Short Hills Road prior to reaching Walnut Street in Livingston. I remember the UFO was hovering near the property that had a hidden resevoir behind it, and alot of power lines. I lived on the East Orange Resevoir in Livingston NJ and knew that some people thought UFO&#39;s where seen near water, so I was use to going and playing and ice skating on the resevoir and had zero fear, however my Mother would not allow the door to open and the car only had two front doors, and she remained fixed behind the wheel of the Pontiac convertible. I asked her years later why this scared her and she refused to speak ever about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However when I arrived home to Baker Road, I phoned my Dad whom worked in the Menlo Park Mall in Edison he owned a furniture store there.  He was working late that night.  I do recall we left during semi-daylight and arrove home in the dark!<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told me to call the Morristown Airport and report it! I did, at a small age, I never forgot this experience and have had an insatiable yet calm interest and patience abpout this topic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was married in 1977 at the young age of 17 years old, and when I told my future husbands Mother about how I had witnessed a UFO, she declared,&#34; Wow, I saw it along with most of my eight children and my husband, who at that time worked for Bell Labs in NJ,  My Dad was working close to the Thomas Edison Labs in Edison NJ at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We always wondered, if this UFO had something to do with the fact we did marry and have a son?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years later yet young as teens. I do truly believe that the UFO&#39;s come out of the Bermuda Triangle and are seen by many.  I saw on the news in the 1990&#39;s UFO&#39;s hovering over Phoenix, that was not like our experience.  Time stopping, I remember the exact clearing in the woods where this occurred, the exact home it happened in front of too. It is amazing to me that I am now 47 and this still perplexes me although I realize my Mom was aware of military interogation, blue book files etc, from my Father collecting Time Magazines, and the fact he always was into the paranormal!  Alot of people in my immediate family saw this occur, aprox 13 of us are alive to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have drawn it, however do not share it. I feel that we all have individual incounters and that they may be helping or hurting us? I do not want to open a pandora&#39;s box. I feel this is how my Mom was protecting me and my siblings, or I could have been reporting a encounter of the third kind or missing! I am glad I am not doing that. I wish all of you success. Do you realize that the UFO&#39;s are hanging out near the USA submarine bases? Look on the World Map? I do not know but would like to if they are hanging around other countrys submarine bases? They are built by General Dynamic&#39;s and Electric Boat, the fact that our Star Wars program has begune makes me feel like I just may see one soon, since I live near the Bangor Wa submarine base now? Who knows? It can not be a cooincidence, your tracking is excellent in my mind. Keep up the fantastic work and I will report any others I happen to see, to the US Navy or Marines since my son is a US Marine he told me I may have had response had I called them in NJ, way back when I was a little girl. True story, no additions. The craft was circular and looked invisible however you could see windows and lights. Within the circle. when I was interogated by my Dad in a most professional way, and this is more then likely why I have such a memory! I told him exactly what I am telling you, This craft flew over us, and then all of the cars behind us could move, and my Mother could have had a speeding ticket~! However we got home safe, and I wrang Dad He was excited and wanted to know more, at such a young age I was allowed to stay up late and explain and try and draw what I saw! It was round, perfectly, looked to have some sort of craft in the center, like if it were spinning or creating a temporary worm hole? It had beings in it, as they gazed at me out of tiny slits, within the outer ring, sort of how Jupiter has rings this one had one bright light ring belt around it.the center looked like an inverted bubble, unlike all of the drawings my Father had seen elsewhere mine was upside down? He did not question me. I still stick to seeing what I did indeed see, my brother remember it too. I have not asked my little baby sister because I do remember she was in a car seat at this time, so she was a baby of around two, it would definitely be in her memory from Dad bragging that his wife and family saw a UFO for real!<n>

Attacked by airplanes and left at high speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> Long time ago, in late 60s.  Bright light in clear sky over Bishop, CA was witnessed by hundreds of residents.  It was surrounded by a dayglow type of flourescent green vapor. When 4 or 5 fighter planes came from the south and flew straight at it, it accelerated almost vertically in what would approximate the speed of a shooting star. I have ruminated over this for years and feel that I might add something not known.  I had a communications receiver tuned to the frequency that the chase planes were using to communicate with the Blackbird which was being tested at the time over the Owens Valley.  I went in the house in time to hear a pilot say &#34;have sustained some damage-request to land at Tonopah&#34;  Reply was &#34;permission denied,return to ship-do not fly over valley-stay over mountains-give film to so and so immediatly&#34; or something very close to those words. After that transmission, I never heard that frequency used again.  The local radio station KIBS was talking about the UFO while it was overhead but when I called them after it was gone, they denied ever saying anything about it.<n>

As we reached the crest of the hill that led down to our home, I noticed a white/silvery light in the distance over the trees as we looked almost due east (or barely southeast). There was nothing else in sky as it was a clear summer day and I called attention to this unknown light to my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was surprised at the light and pulled the car over to the side of the road and we began watching the light in the distance(it was off in the distance but I can only guess 10-20 miles away.  When I first spotted this light what caught my attention was the fact that it was at times stationary but would then move up in a direct perpendicular line and would then sometomes move sideways in a direct horizontal line. These movements were in the blink of an eye and guessing at the distance I would say these horizontal and perpendicular movements were many miles in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this movement for about 15 minutes and the mental image I have is of this unknown light/object making a cross or plus sign in the sky.  As we watched this movement we both commented and agreed that there was nothing we knew of on this earth that could move and change directions so quickly and stop in an an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching this movement for about 15 minutes all of a sudden the light blinked out. This surprised us and we were going to proceed on home when the light blinked back on and reappeared in about the same spot as we originally saw it.  It made a few more horizontal/perpendicular movements and blinked out again and did not reappear. The total duration of this event was about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were perplexed at this event because we had no explanation for what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 16 years old at the time and never forgot those amazing 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know that reporting this 38 years later I can recall the incident as if it had happened 5 minutes ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1968 is approximate.

At about 5pm. It was a clear, cloudless day. I looked up and saw a cigar shaped, bright shiney object with fire coming out of it&#39;s tail. At first, I thought it resembled a rocket. But as I concentrated on it, it was unlike any flying object I had ever seen. (certainly unlike rockets taht you see on television) It was flying north at about 4-5,000 feet in a straight line. The fire that was trailing the aricraft was about 40% of the craft&#39;s total length. There was no black/dark smoke as a result of the fire. Just reddish flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day... I believe this may have been a UFO in distress. There was no noise or visible lights on the craft. It appeared to be SO reflective (silver in color) that the sunlight made the craft hard to distinguish. I estimate that it was travelling at 300mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My uncle was a F-102 pilot in the 111th / 147th ANG unit at Ellington. Shortly after dark on the evening of the 15th my uncle was scrambeled  by the guard unit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after he left we all noticed a cigar shaped object directly over the Bay which was hovering at about 5,000 ft. with flames coming out of one end.  It was stationary and stayed in place for several hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time we witnessed the scrambeled F-102&#39;s (there were no F-104&#39;s or F-106&#39;s at Ellington as reproted in other reports) from the ANG circle the object and they stayed on station unil running low on fuel and returning to Ellington, some 15 miles to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my uncle returned he was clearly upset about what he had seen but refused to talk about it.

This was my first sighting.  My hope is that the others that were there that day, will see this report and come forward with what they remember.  It isn&#39;t something that you’d forget. I haven&#39;t in all those years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t have the exact day or year but I never thought I’d need to remember that part.  Just remembering the incident itself was enough for me, at the time.  I know where I lived as we only lived there between the years of 1967 to 1969, so I am able to narrow the timeframe down to those years.  My feeling is that it happened closer to 1968 and probably in the summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened when I was young (11 to 12 years old).   We lived in an apartment complex, in Oak Cliff, Texas (part of Dallas).  We had been outside hanging out, running around with our friends when we ended up at the back of our apartments.  Someone in our group, or it could have been someone already standing outside, was looking at an object hovering near to where our old elementary school was located.  It had my full attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  Over the years I’ve read about other people’s encounters or sightings and sometimes it’s an object that’s so far away that it might have been any number of things, such as: a planet, a star, a plane, a weather balloon, a meteor, etc...Even the pictures that have been posted at times leave anyone questioning what the heck the object was.  This sighting was nothing like that.  We were close enough and it was still daylight or more specifically, it was late afternoon, moving towards the evening.   We could see it clearly as it was a clear summer afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to remember who was with us that afternoon.  I know it was my brother and I.  But, I also remember at least another person, maybe even two others.   We all stood there watching a UFO hovering in the air.   As I remember, I wanted a better look and finally went upstairs to the balcony.   When I did, I realized that several people (grown-ups) were coming out of their apartments to see what all the commotion was about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was about 1300 - 1500 ft away from where we were standing, hovering near an elementary school.  It was about 30 to 60 ft in the air, just off to one side of the building.  There were no lights and it never moved.  From this distance, it looked about 3 to 4 inches across (maybe someone who knows the mathematical equations can figure out how big that would make the craft).  It was metallic grey in color just like you’d expect.   I don’t remember it being shiny.  I remember oval portholes that appeared to run all the way around the disk, at least the part I could see.  It was saucer shaped, but with those portholes in the middle, or right above the middle.  I didn’t see any landing gear, nothing hanging down from the craft and nothing above the craft.  We didn’t hear any noise but it wasn’t near enough for us to hear noise.  I also don’t remember it flying off.  So either it got so dark that we couldn’t see it any longer, or we all had to go in for the night, or…..yea! rs later, I had some thoughts that someone was looking out of those portholes at us.  The other part is that I don’t remember going home that night.  I could speculate about any number of things that might have happened but I won’t.  There are just some unanswered questions.  Most likely due to the amount of time it’s been since it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember checking the newspaper over the next week, thinking someone had played an excellent prank on a lot of people with some type of flying saucer-shaped balloon or something that looked exactly like a flying saucer.   I even told my mother about it and we both wondered what it could have been.  After a while, I just let it go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in about 2002, I started to wonder if what I saw was a dream.  I decided to ask my brother if he remembered seeing something back in the day hovering near our school.  He finally said he saw the same thing that I saw and that’s about all he would say (don’t ask me why).  With this acknowledgment from him, I brought it up in a conversation with my mother who said she remembered me asking her to check the newspapers and that she remembered me telling her I had seen a flying saucer.  Oh man, I can’t tell you how much that meant to me as again, I had started to think that maybe I dreamed it all up.   Finally, someone was able to confirm to me that all those years ago I had mentioned my sighting to them, right after it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After having another sighting in 2007, I finally broke down and told my husband (almost 20 years into our marriage) that I had actually seen a flying saucer or something that looked just like one, many years ago.  He has no reason NOT to believe me, but I know that unless you’ve seen one yourself or you were there, you’re left wondering if that person really saw what they think they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the late “Star Hustler”, Jack Horkheimer always used to say, “Keep looking up!” and I always will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was daylight. I got out of my vehicle to go into the post exchange. I looked up and saw this enormous craft hovering in the sky over and to one side of the water tower. Detail was great. It appeared to have some sort of hatch on the side of the compartment above the saucer. Even though this siting was thirty years ago, it seems like only yesterday. I have never forgotten it. I went into the PX ( about 15 minutes), when I came out it was gone. I tried NOT to look to conspicuous. Remember, that was in 1965, People would think you were crazy back then.

It was very narrow and very high in the sky, but was very bright (silver in color).  The sky was very blue and there were some small puffy clouds that passed in front of the object which remained stationary for about five minutes.  It then moved in the direction the clouds were moving for about 5 degrees and stopped.  After a minute or so, it then moved in a direction opposite of the travel of the clouds.  By this time, most of the neighbors in the neighborhood that were home were outside, watching and commenting on the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of remaining stationary again, it then simply shot off (apparently upward) and was out of sight almost immediately.

We came around a line of high hedges that lined the street across from my house. On the other side of the hedges was a open field area.  Not a huge area but large enough to play ball. Thats what we were going to do. As we came around the corner of the hedge we all saw a silver disk approx 60 feet across just hoovering about 10 feet off the ground.  It was very close to a house on the other side of the clearing.  There was no sounds, no lights, it was bright day light and the sun was out. It just hoovered and would spin very slowly. We all looked at each other and said Wow! Then suddenly it thrust straight upward so fast it was like it vanished. A few seconds later, as we all were looking up into the sky, one of my friends pointed and yelled, There! There it is! As I again saw the craft. It was flying horizonal across the sky at about 2000 feet and there was a aircraft near it at one point. I remember the sun light shinning off the plane but not the disk.  I can see it today as if it just happened.  Because of obvious reasons I never told anyone about this until recent years. In fact as I was visiting my older brother in North Carolina. I brought this up and took a deep breath as I awaited my brother to begin to laugh. But he said&#34; Ya I saw it too! Not that day but another night with some of his friends. He is 4 years older than me. Same kinda craft but it was flying very close to the water tower up on the top of the hill. There was a school there also. I think it was Hoban. There is no person on this planet that can convince me that Aliens do not exsist.  Its a fact they are here!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is estimated by the witness.  PD))<n>

I will read about you experience at NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experiene happened off the coast of Vietnam in the Tonkin Gulf during the Vietnam war. At the time I was in OI division (Operational Intelegence).  I was a Radarman/Electronic counter measures and also trained as a lookout, so I had good observational skills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on duty on the 010 level, which is as high as you can get on the ship.  WE were standing down that night so there was no flight operations.  There were other aircraft carriers in the gulf doing flight operations but I know what other air craft look like in the night sky.  I was on port lookout duty that night and another person was on starboard lookout duty.  We both observed a light, that changed colors, off the port side of the ship a aproximatly 15 miles away and 20 degrees from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called CIC, Combat information center, to see if they had anything on radar. They reported that they did not have anything on surface or air radar in that area of the sky. The light seemed to hover in place for about 1 min then shot over head stoping off the starboard aft at about 10 t0 15 miles and about 30 degrees off horizon.  The speed was so fast thar it left a streak of light as it traved through the sky.  The distanced traveled was, we guessed, about 20 to 30 miles in about a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being in ECM I knew what air craft the U.S. and U.S.S.R had at the time and nothing could match the maneuvers this light was doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called down to the bridge to see if they had anything on there radar and to report it to the duty officer.  They reported no contacts in that area either.  The light hovered there for a few seconds then came toward the ship, it got about over-head and then shot straight up and disapeared within a couple seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Other observers included a lieutenant JG (also on the bridge); a  navigator seaman (on the bridge); a helmsman (one deck below the bridge); an engineman next to the helmsman operating the engines; and an after steering/lookout (engineman), on the fan tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared instantly; approximatly at a 45 degree angle in front of the ship and it looked about a hundred feet foward and one hundred feet from the water.  It was a huge light.  General Quarters was sounded and all personal went to battle stations. The light disappeared as abruptly as it appeared (10 to 20 minutes was how long the light stayed in front of the ship).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was written in the log book as a UFO sighting.

I was assigned to MMS Preload which was on the east side of the base, just south of the bomb dump. We were surrounded by revetments which we used to climb up to smoke and take a break. One night, I don&#39;t recall now the date but it was in the summer of 1968 around 1:00 a.m. while on one of these breaks someone spotted a series of lights off to the NNW. At first we thought it was returning B-52&#39;s but then someone reminded us that our returning aircraft normally came out of the North. Incoming aircraft are easily identified and this was not aircraft. It was common to see aircraft stacked one behind the other and you could normally see the landing lights. In fact, you could distinguish between a B-52 or a KC-135 by the lights. On this occasion, the lights were lined up horizontally. As I recall there were 5 to 7 lights and they held a steady position for several minutes. Then, several would not be there, only to reappear at a different location. Then several others would disappear and join the others. The lights appeared stationary other than when they would go off only to reappear. This pattern continued for about 20 minutes. We had a base telephone mounted on a tree and one of the guys ran to the phone and asked the operator to connect him to the tower which was done. The person in the tower said they had no incoming aircraft, did not have anything on radar, and thought we might be seeing things. We were seeing things, these strange lights. Others on base saw them and several inquiries were made but no explanation was ever provided. This has haunted me for over 35 years and to this day I have no explanation other than IT WAS NOT AIRCRAFT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Lit by full moon, totally silent, vanished without trace<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a very clear and warm Friday evening, I was driving my best friend home from our college library. Upon parking in front of his house on the SW corner of Quedo Dr. and Kelvin Ave. in Woodland Hills, I got out of the car (facing east) and my eye was caught by something moving under the full moon which had just risen.  I thought at first it was a large owl, but it quickly became apparent it was a brownish-metallic saucer hovering in a herky-jerky fashion over a residential area with no lights on and absolutely making no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this stealthy object was being well illuminated by the moonlight, we were able to observe this object with utter clarity and awe for about 5 minutes whereupon this thing stop; momentarily shudder; then vanish from sight.  It was as if it sensed us watching it and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated this UFO to be appx. 300 Yds. away and 100 Yds. up, and about the size of a school bus.  It had a small dome with a few portholes or windows which may have been slightly lit.  It is of note that the air was highly static and the hair on our arms was sticking up.  I also guessed that the craft was over the proximity of DeForest St. @ Natoma Ave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this occurred over 30 years ago, I hope it is of some relevance to report this now other than to get it off my chest.  This was quite an eerie experience; in fact my friend got so scared, he panicked and ran to his house where he hid in a corner of his room under a blanket for a full day.  Afterwards, he refused to talk about the incident and got very angry if I brought up the subject, so I refused to report it without his cooberration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in complete control of my senses that night, and later spent 6 years in the Marine Corps. as an electronics specialist in an A-4 Skyhawk squadron; and have seen most every type of aircraft; but nothing like this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I am not sure of the year or date, but I would guess I was probably around 6 years old and the weather was nice, making it around 1969, probably in the middle of June. I remember looking up and both of us seeing what I remember looked exactly like a flying saucer. At the time I did not think it odd that we were seeing something that was not supposed to exist. I just remember asking a man who was passing by, “Excuse me, what is that?” I recall him saying the strangest thing…something so strange that I repeated it over and over again until I could go home and ask a grown-up what it meant…he replied, “I don’t know! It looks like a U.F.O.”  He looked at it some more, then continued on his way. All the way home I kept repeating to my brother and myself, “UFO. UFO,” so I wouldn’t forget those letters.  I came home and asked my eldest brother what those letters meant. He explained, and then of course nobody believed us so we let it drop. However, all of these years I have wondered if maybe the US Military had some kind of aircraft that looked exactly like a flying saucer? I would love to find out.

My friend and I were sleeping outside in the front yard of his home (State College, Pa).  It was a warm, quiet, still evening.  There were no clouds at all....no wind.  Since he lived on the outskirts of town there were few street lights and little, if any traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were lying in sleeping bags looking up at the stars.  I suddenly saw a huge, glowing, white, oval, object pass over our heads and out of sight in less than 2 seconds.  The object was easily twice the size of two houses....easily.  It is difficult to judge how high it was in altitude.  If pressed I would guess that it was very low to the ground as it was so large and out of our sight in seconds.  The object made no noise....not even the sound of something pushing through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In approximately 30 seconds (which seemed like and eternity) my friend said: &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  I simply said: &#34;Yes.&#34;  He said  &#34;Lets go inside.&#34;   We never spoke of it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I hope I haven&#39;t wasted your time, I know this is minimal and not terribly exciting.  But this was 1968: it was not swamp gas, a weather balloon, a helicopter, air plane, etc.  It was immense in size, totally quiet, oval, fast, and glowing white.  I just don&#39;t think it was man made....I really know it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for all you do.<n>

It had a white light that shined straight down and made no noise at all that he remembered. This frightened him quite a bit and he went in the hanger where the watch supervisor was at his desk and asked him to come and see the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they went back outside it was gone but the fellow who saw it was so excited that he wanted to call the Air Force early warning radar site which was also on the base at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The radar site said, &#34;Yes we saw something on radar but we get blips like that all the time.&#34; This tells me the Air Force was very aware of what it was. Also none of us knew of groom lake at the time which was only a short jet flight from Fallon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always wondered where they got it if it was Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was all duly entered into the VA-125 night watch log.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness took a lot of flack over the sighting and the next day in the log someone wrote. 2100 no saucers sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However the man who sighted was not the kind of person that made things up or sought attention by doing things like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously I&#39;m not a witness.

I was not getting a ride so I was walking on the boulevard near Hartley Field when I noticed what looked like these lights which were going around in a circle. They were red and blue. I could not see a shape yet as they were in the top of the tree line.  They hovered there for  about 1 minute when all of a sudden they started to rise slowly.  As they got above the tree line I could make out a shape which looked like two saucers laying one on top of the other. It stayed at this altitude for about another 30 seconds when all of a sudden it took off and was gone very, very quickly. I don’t remember my reaction to this as whether I was frightened or not.  I did not have much time to think about this anyway as I seen this car going very fast on this dirt road in Hartley field and hitting Woodland Avenue and without stopping sped away at a very ! high speed.  Now you would have to see how dangerous this can be as the dirt road is a steep hill and when you got up to Woodland  Avenue there was a stop sign because it is in the middle of a sharp curve and you don’t just run this stop sign without looking both ways.  As this car sped away I noticed that it was a police car! I thought wow here this police car had come out of Hartley field right where the ship was hovering!  I did not have much to to think about this though as a friend picked me up and asked if I had seen this. I really do not remember anything else we said, and I never really talked much about this. I think I was afraid that no one would believe me. I always wondered though if those two policemen filed a report or told anybody as it was plain to see that they seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We were the first ship on station and searching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The water depth averaged between 6,000-12,000 feet deep there, with undersea mountains in the 4,000-10,000 ft. range, I remember (fathometer readings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the second night of searching, an object was reflected in the searchlight (24&#34; mercury arc light) I was on.  (I was a signalman and my duty station was on the signal bridge running the light).  As the ship turned toward the object, it went out of the &#34;beam,&#34; and was lost due to darkness (it was a cloudy night with no moon or stars, pitch black).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we were relieved on station by the rescue ships and continued on our way to the Sixth Fleet in the Med.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years later, I read about the aforementioned incident and that the object (which was lost in the beam) mysteriously lifted off the water and disappeared in the sky.  Also, the sinking of the Scorpion has been attributed to the &#34;Bermuda Triangle&#34; curse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does anyone have any info regarding these allegations?  I was involved in the actual incident and would like to hear any about any info suppossedly existing about this.

It started moving towards the lake and instead of turning to go up to our house, my husband slowed down and we watched as it slowly went over the lake, down over Renton Boeing field, then in a heartbeat it turned into a triangle and disappeared.  Not up or down or sideways, just disappeared.  I told my neighbor and she laughed at me.  Days (maybe a week) later she said there was a huge crowd (I think in PA) who said they all saw the same type of thing, which was reported in the newspaper.

I was 11 yrs old and I have realized through the years what a gift I was given.  It was on a Saturday night and I was home with my 2 brothers and my sister.  Our parents had gone out that night.  We were all in the living room watching television.  For some unknown reason I got up went to the kitchen opened the door that was on the side of the house that open to the side of the yard and stuck my head out.  We had a tree that was a little to the left of the front porch.  Up above the tree was a huge UFO sitting making no noise and lights were changing colors as they circled around.  It was round like a hat with a band.  The band was where the lights were circling around and I could make out what I would call round windows.  The tree looked so small under it and the branches did not move.  There were no leaves on the tree.  As I stood there looking up I thought to myself you are too big to land here.  My house had a s! treet in front of it and there was a river that ran parallel with the street.  On the other side of the river was a highway and it was traveled heavily.  I could see cars going up and down that highway and was so surprised that cars were not stopping. This thing was very bright and very large and there were bright lights circling around and it was very dark outside.  The lights would change from red, white, and blue, green.  I stood there soaking all this in for about 2 or 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then shut the door yelling as I ran to the doorway of the living room.  I was yelling I saw a UFO.  So everyone runs to the door and opens it and it wasn’t there.  My brothers said it was probably an airplane.   So I opened the door again sticking my head out again and kept saying aloud several times I saw you I know I saw you where did you go?   All of a sudden miles ahead in the sky the object shot across did a little zip and a tip to one side and was gone.  It made me laugh because I knew it could hear me and did respond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I know it’s been many years since that event and I do play this through my head trying to reason why I saw it and why the people on the other side of the river were not reacting to this.  I now know that when aircraft are searching for people and they spot them they tip the wing.  I feel my experience was very special.  Not sure what it was about but I am always looking up at the sky searching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting in 1968 is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was no sound, lights anything. It was huge. I watched it come out of the west and at first thought it was an airplane. It left no trail and finally stopped. I guess it was about as big as my thumbnail if I held my arm outstretched. I was daylight. I can only guess at the time. The sun did not reflect off of it. It was a slate gray color. After a short time it turned back to the west and slowly left my sight.<n>

One evening my sister and I were at a neighbor&#39;s house selling magazines for her high school class fundraiser and while we were there the lights and electricity went out.  Since, we were unable to conduct her magazine business we left and began driving home and I noticed 3 red spheres in the sky.  We watched the red speres flying a incredible speeds, going straight up then stopping, fying across the sky - touching and then  shooting up and down, stopping etc.  We were very excited.  When we gtot home we didn&#39;t have electricity either.  We told our mother about the flying spheres and all went outside to watch the red spheres in the sky and at that time noticed back in our woods, we had 175 acres, a very large round, yellow/orange glowing sphere ssitting in our woods.  My mother wanted to go check it out but decided not to because I&#39;m sure she was afraid.  I assume it stayed there all night because later we went inside and I did my homework by candle light.  When we read the local newswapre it stated that on the night of the power outage and our sightings of these objects the power station for the county had been vandalized.  I always thought this was very strange and feel the two were connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother got out of her car and saw a cigar shaped craft with a pink glow and making no noise. She is not sure if it was seconds or minuetes she watched object. The craftsuddenly took off toward twinsisters moutain at incredible speed. When she arrived at work and told people the srory she was scoffed at and made fun of, These were mostly pilots and flight line workers as the bar was just outside the base gate. I know this happened. MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER HAD MADE UP SUCH A STORY. And neighbours up and down the streetwitnessed this on a summer evening.

I specifically remember the three of us looking up and seeing a round object with all different colored lights that went round and round on the bottom of it.  It seemed very high up in the sky.  I have no idea how long it was there.  I think only a minute or two, probably.  Anyway, it was there and then it just disappeared in an instant.  Not even a helicopter could have disappeared that fast.  I remember us all wondering what it was and how it could disappear so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my older sister about this a couple years ago to see if she remembered that happening.  She told me that she did remember, that it had happened, and that Dad had been pretty freaked out by it.  She told me that he had watched the news for a couple weeks after that wondering what it was.  There must not have been any reports though that she remembers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I can only guess the year to be between 1967-1970.  I must have only been 7 or 8 at the time.  I estimate this because my Dad died of Muscular Dystrophy in ’72, and at the time this happened, he was still healthy enough to be walking.  I was hoping to find other reports on your site, but didn’t.  Therefore, the exact year is unknown.  I’d be interested to see if anyone else saw and maybe what year, if they remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The distance was to distant to be determined. We continued on for 20 or so minutes when a small plane approched the ball and it seemed to disapear into itself at a very fast rate. After the small plane passed it returned to the same position where it remained until we reached home some 10 miles norh east of Camden. We called the local radio station to see if anyone else observed the craft and they said they had received dozens of calls. The total trip was over 100 miles and lasted 2 hours and the craft remained visible the entire trip.

I looked up in the sky, which was completely free of any cloud cover whatsoever, and in the distant blue above our house there appeared a white light.  It was extremely visible in the vastness of the deep blue desert sky (before pollution invaded the valley) and from the distance I was watching, it looked about  the size stars look at night, only much closer, and it moved in an irratic pattern, but only within a very restricted area of space.  In other words, it rapidly moved up, down, left, right, etc., etc., but never left the radius of sky  just above our house, which amounted to about the radius that the full moon takes up in the night sky, only it seemed much closer than the moon.  I remember it was so very strange to see this in broad daylight, with there being no apparent reason for it being there, and nothing in the sky that could be causing a reflection of some sort.  I pointed it out my friends, and we stared at it for awhile, then I think we just got tired of guessing what it might be, and like all kids with short attention spans, went on with our playing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The Odenwald was right outside our fence, and our barracks was 20 feet from the fence. Our unit was &#34;in the field&#34;, so there was no &#34;lights out&#34;, and we were playing pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 22:00 and 00:00 we noticed small white Christmas tree-like lights flickering in the tree tops and started watching them, curious (not constantly).  We then noticed the balls wouldn&#39;t go in the pockets right. They sort of veered away a little. We all thought something peculiar was going on but had no idea what.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started getting the feeling of being watched and mentioned it.  At least one other person had a similar feeling. It was really bothering us and we had a new guy, just seventeen, that it was really freaking out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t remember exactly, and the date and time of day are estimates. I imagined whatever it was could read our minds and I must have been thinking UFO because I thought telepathically to whatever it was to leave before that guy freaked out completely and contact me after I got back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd feeling subsided and I went to bed. A little after laying down I had the sensation of being sucked out of my body. The legs part of me felt like they were at a right angle to how my physical body was laying in the bed and my shoulders and head were still in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had learned before to fight fear by concentrating on something else, and that&#39;s what I did. I&#39;m not saying I wasn&#39;t afraid that much. I was overwhelmed and consumed by raw fear. But I noticed it made me weaker in the fight against whatever it was, so I conentrated on a girl I knew and the feeling subsided and I was able to get up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was afraid to try to sleep then, so I went back up to the pool table and wanted to wait until daylight to try to sleep. A while later I went up to the fourth floor to a friend of mine&#39;s room and looked out the window just in time to see an oval shaped object take off out of the top of the trees. It was a fiery orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been in that woods many times and there is no swamp or water within miles. There is a large clearing a few hundred yards from our fence so it might have been sitting there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anyone about seeing the UFO until I got home out of the Army. I talked to a guy that was there a few months ago and he still remembers the lights in the trees and the rest of it, but he says he didn&#39;t see anything take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw another one, but I had many bad experiences for a few years after that that I think were related to it. And I heard one landed about two miles from where I lived about a week after I got home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two or three years ago my mother told me that my brother would see two guys sitting in a car parked at the end of our driveway when he got up for school in the morning.

I never did submit it, but I&#39;m sending it to you now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor:  Waterline  The article in last months Waterline about the Lake Michigan Triangle and UFO sightings along the lakefront caught my attention.  It brought to mind a boat ride I had taken years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 1968 and at that time I was working for a company called Tech Center in Morton Grove, Illinois.  Tech Center was a research and development house for the Armed Forces, the aerospace industry and NASA.  There was Tech Center equipment aboard the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules, we had even designed and built our own satellites, O.A.O. II is still in orbit and operational to this day.  The people who worked at Tech Center would be considered geeks by today’s standards, we all wore plastic pocket protectors and had slide rules (pre-calculator days) strapped to our belts.  But geeks or not, one thing we did know at Tech Center, was what the military did and didn’t have in the nineteen sixty’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back then I had a small Thompson cabin cruiser (remember the wooden boats with the lap strake hulls) and once every year I’d take the guys from work out fishing.  That morning in 1968 we got an early start.  We pulled out of Diversey Harbor around 3:30 a.m. and started heading north.  It was still dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour before sunrise we were trolling north, paralleling the shoreline, six miles out and twenty miles north of Chicago when the most extraordinary thing happened.  A craft flew directly over our heads.  I mean - RIGHT OVER OUR HEADS!  What first caught our attention was a mechanical humming sound behind us. All four of us in the boat simultaneously turned and looked above and behind to see what was causing it.  What we saw, was a craft in the air, 150 yards behind and slightly to port, perhaps 400 feet off the water and coming straight at us.  The craft was rapidly overtaking us, but at a very leisurely pace for an aircraft.  It was quiet, but loud enough to be heard (or perhaps felt) above the boats motor.  The craft didn’t sound like an airplane.  It didn’t whine like a jet, didn’t thump like a helicopter and it sure didn’t have propellers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw had no wings, tail or struts.  It’s fuselage was elliptical in shape with a blunted nose and tail.  It was large (but not huge), perhaps 150 feet long, 75 feet wide and 30 feet thick (like a skinny football which had been flattened out).  There were no windows or anything that resembled a cockpit.  The craft which appeared to be gray in color did not have any lights or visible markings.  It seemed to be dimly illuminated, or at least it was not as dark as the surrounding sky.  This may have been moonlight reflecting off the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember feeling the great mass of the craft as it passed above us.  Although the craft was not large in dimensions, it just felt a lot bigger than it was.  I’ve stood next to B52’s, 747’s and large Air Force cargo plans, all bigger aircraft, but without the same feeling of massiveness.  This thing above us felt as if it weighed hundreds of tons.  Although Spartan in appearance one sensed that this was some very serious machinery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft had come up behind us from the south-south-west and passed directly overhead at a height of no more than 400 feet.  Without pausing, changing speed or making any correction in course it just continued on a leisurely northward heading at a speed of about fifty miles per hour until it disappeared.  And that, was that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us were just dumbfounded.  We watched it slowly disappear into the night sky, and then it was gone and we were just left staring at each other in silence.  The entire incident had lasted less than four minutes.  There wasn’t one of us who could explain what we had just seen.  Remember, we were the four geeks from Tech Center.  My friend ((name deleted)) was the first to speak what we had all been thinking,  &#34;If there is such a thing as flying saucers, I think we just saw one.&#34;  No one argued with ((name deleted)).  Then we went back to fishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surprisingly, we never spoke afterwards about what happened that night. You would think that we would have, but we didn’t.  I believe each of us had our own thoughts about what we had seen and we were all keeping those thoughts to ourselves.  To this day I’ve only told the story to a very few people.  Believe what you will, or call me a nut job, I know what I saw that night.  It’s been thirty five years now and even with all of our great modern technology I’ve never seen anything like it before or since.<n>

I was sleeping in a room with my two older brothers. I woke up. I don&#39;t know why, I was drawn to the window, again I don&#39;t kow why. The window was open because it was hot. My family was poor then and we didn&#39;t have airconditioning.  I look out, and no more than three feet away from the window was very bright oval UFO.  About the size of a car.  I could see any windows or marking of any kind.  It was just floating there.  I had a sense that I wasn&#39;t suppose to have woke up and see it.  I sensed that the occupants were caught off gard.  I definatly had a sense that there were beings inside the craft.  I was not into UFO or aliens at eight.  We lived in the ghetto, and I just wanted to survive.  The craft then it took off without a sound.  I&#39;ll never forget it.  The object was a very bright solid white all over. Since then I have experienced other strange happenings.  Verified by physical exams when I was in the milliary.  I recently aslo saw another UFO in Los Angeles.<n>

I recall my husband and I were returning home from seeing the movie &#34;Rosemary&#39;s Baby&#34; with Mia Farrow. My husband (soon to be ex, at the time) was a navy pilot who after 6+ (?) years active duty, was still very active on weekends logging as many flight hours as he could manage (helicopters).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our house was in an older, established very residential area and our street was a rather steep hill from top to bottom. We lived about halfway up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband noticed something around the time we neared our house, that was in the sky seemingly at the top of the hill. Where our street ended, another street intersected where if you turned left, you continued on up the hill for some ways and very shortly you were in a quite rural area with farms, fields, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So he slowly proceeded past our house on up the hill out of curiosity, not really saying much. The object was huge and hanging apparently close to ground, not moving. Not making any sound. I was a little excited, my heart was speeding up, but I said nothing. I was young and trusted my husband in most matters, where if there were cause for alarm, he would not approach this thing and furthermore, as a pilot and a military officer, I figured he probably would be able to figure out what it was, etc. So I hung in there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to a sort of level part of the road, about a half a block long, and it seemed we were really close to the object by then and had a pretty clear view of it, and since it was not moving, we pulled over beside the road and either stopped or idled the car and just sat there and stared at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a thickly wooded area across the intersecting street which we could see well from where we were. But I couldn&#39;t figure out exactly how close the thing was to us or to the trees. The wooded area was a small zoo actually; it did not seem that the object would have much opportunity to hover or land within the zoo area because it was rough terrain on foot, hilly and bumpy, etc. and the whole zoo area itself was small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft must have been just above the height of the trees, because the treetops did not obstruct any part of my view of it.  At any rate, probably if I were someone more mature than I was at the time, I could have estimated how far away it was, etc.  All I can say is that from where I viewed it, which was actually too close for my comfort, it was at least the size of 5-6+ school buses. It was a definite saucer shape and the overall color was a dull, non reflecting finish, maybe dull dark gray.  But there were lovely bright orange round lights spaced around the rim of the saucer. They were not the type of lights that were giving off light, or beams, they were just sort of lit from within.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, on the dome part of the saucer, that is the hump part that sat on top of the saucer, there were seemingly windows spaced all the way around (I assumed, couldn&#39;t see anything but the side I was facing). They were rather small, rectangular shaped windows that were white, that is they emanated a white glow from within, not as bright lights but same as the orange lights in being lit from within.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was extremely curious at this point, wishing I could get a glimpse of something inside, but these &#34;windows&#34; did not seem to be like regular windows on a house, that is, for the purpose of seeing in and out of. They could have been just white lights or some other part of the craft that looked like windows to me.  Because the white of the rectangles seemed more of a solid white, you could not see through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, I do not recall any of the lights blinking, although it is possible that the orange lights could have been. I don&#39;t think so, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I just sat there looking at it for maybe 15 minutes, maybe more, sort of waiting for it to do something, but it did not do anything at all.  It just hung there silently.  It was a very clear night. I can remember how clearly I could see the thing. The outline of the dark parts of it were clearly visible because of the many street lights in the area.  I could not see the underside of the craft, though.  After awhile, my husband decided it was not going to do anything and so we drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall us ever talking about it and I forgot about it mostly, although I would recall it any time the expression UFO came up. I guess I just subconsciously decided that my husband probably had a good idea what it was, etc, but I had known him to be involved with military missions that were very secret and he could never discuss any part of them with me and of course I never pressed him on those matters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I was wrong (and looking back I think I probably was), and he really had no idea what it was and was maybe even frightened by it, he would not have let me know that either, for not wanting to scare me.  At that time he was away a lot (50% of the time or more) and we had 2 toddlers, and I am sure he would not want me getting all hysterical over this idea, especially since he no doubt saw no threat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not a news person at that time, did not read newspapers etc.  But my husband did, and I am pretty sure he would have mentioned it if he had seen any articles about it.  He would have looked for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And in spite of where the craft was, in the midst of such a residential area, it was an extremely quiet neighborhood, and it&#39;s very unlikely anyone who lived there but us, saw the thing.  It does seem likely, though, that people driving by might well have seen it, as we did. The road that ran alongside the zoo was a somewhat busy street, that is, at least busier than the street our house was on. I suppose you would not really call it busy, though.  People were almost never outside or even awake (with inside house lights on) past 10:30 pm or so, on our street and nearby streets. The majority of residents were older, many retired folks. This was probably around midnight, give or take. I did not see any signs that any of the people were up and about as we drove up the hill, nor would I have expected to at that hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, we had not lived there very long, a year or so, and I was not very friendly with my neighbors yet, and I never discussed this with any of them or asked around to see if anyone had seen anything.  At that point in time, probably those particular folks would have gotten a bad opinion of me if I had!<n> <n><n> <n><n> In reading through the NUFORC website, I noted many older reports such as this, and so I decided it must still be relevant after all these years, so here it is.  At least it feels somewhat relieving to tell it to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will attempt a rough drawing of the craft and enclose a Binghamton area map marked with the location, to be sent via snail mail.  This will take a little time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
