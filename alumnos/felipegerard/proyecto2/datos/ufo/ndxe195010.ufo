10/15/50 15:00|Sandy Hook/Highlands|NJ|Triangle|5 minutes|Triangles over New York Harbor 1950|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52110.html|1|ndxe195010| Triangles over New York Harbor 1950<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grand mother had taken me to Atlantic Highlands over looking Sandy Hook and New York Harbor. It was cold that day, I was 8 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had stopped at a little snack bar about half way up the road and she got a cup of coffee, I don&#39;t remeber what I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove to the top and parked on the overlook.  She was still driving her green 47 Chevy, she left the engine running and the heater on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed two triangle shaped objects comming down the Hudson from the direction of the George Washington Bridge they seemed to be at an altitude lower than us. They came very close, perhaps 1/4 mile or closer. We were looking down on them they were above the water perhaps 300-400 feet. As they passed the Chevy stalled and the Heater blower also stopped. The Blower started running when they were some distance out to sea.  About two minutes later two aircraft that I think they were F-80&#39;s they had wing tanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly there after the two objects flew past and up the Harbor toward the George Whashington Bridge at a high rate of speed the two F-80 were close behind.  The objects appeared to be playing with the jets. They slowed down and sped up a couple of times turned sharply and headed out to sea over Coney Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Grandmother died in 1966, I am now 63 years old I know what we saw was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in October 1950.  PD))<n>

THEY WERE IN FORMATIONS OF SIX  AND I FORGET WHETHER WE COUNTED 72 OR 78 DISK.  EACH PROCEDING FORMATION WAS MORE EAST OF THE LAST ONE.  WHEN ONE FORMATION GOT ALMOST OUT OF VIEW,  OVERHEAD WOULD BE ANOTHER FORMATION OF SIX.    THEIR SPEED WAS CONSTANT.  THEIR SPACING APPEARED THE SAME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I DO NOT KNOW THEIR SPEED BUT IT APPEARED SAME AS PLANES TRAVEL  AND ALTITUDE WAS VERY HIGH  AS WE WERE SEEING  SMALL DISK  WITHOUT DETAIL.   THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO BE REFLECTIVE  SO I CALL THEM WHITE.  WE WERE IN A QUITE LOCATION AND THERE WAS NO SOUND.  ALL THE OBSERVERS THAT I KNOW OF ARE DECEASED  EXCEPT TWO.
