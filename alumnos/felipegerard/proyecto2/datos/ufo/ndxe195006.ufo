I was sitting in the drivers seat holding my baby , my friend was sitting next to me and my three older children were playing on swings lower than the movie screen and we could see them. We were parked facing just to the left of true North. Boliver Peninsula is to the of true North from where we were. As we watched the movie, I noticed a large orange-red &#34;full Moon &#34; toward Bolivar. As I was admiring the &#34;full Moon&#34; it seemed to become larger and closer,and slowly lowering! At that I became afraid and asked my friend to get the children which she did. As we were leaving all the other cars were too and there were at least 30 cars. The movie wasn&#39;t half over. By this time the &#34;moon&#34; was overhead still lowering and I could hear a put-put sound as the object was heading toward hwy 45 and the bayou behind the hwy. I drove my friend home to the east end of Galveston where our homes were about 4 miles away and asked her to turn on her radio. When I arrived home I turnrd on my house radio. No news about the object we saw after listening for hours! The next day and there after we combed the local paper for an explination or just a report, Nothing!

It reminded me of a shiny new nickel, and as I watched, it flipped over and shot away at high speed. I was 7 1/2 years old and just the summer before had observed a craft with my parents at this same location.<n>

I lived in the only two-story house on my block when I was 8 years old.  My double bedroom window faced the East.  I always had to go to bed at 8 PM.  As I was climbing the stairs I began to hear a faint humming sound.  As I arrived at the top of the stairs and turned left to my open bedroom door, I walked across my room to my opened windows, as the humming became easier to hear.  As I looked out my window, hovering over my neighbor’s house were three small flying saucers hovering.  They were around 5 feet in diameter in a formation of a triangle, one in front and the other two behind the first.  They were roughly 5 feet below my window seal and no more then 20 feet away.  Back in the 50’s we didn’t have shows that were about UFO’s much less thought about them at my age.  I froze in disbelieve.  For at least a minute I watch and listened.  All three were identical.  First being saucer shape with a 2-foot diameter dome no more th! en a foot high, the outer skin was like frosted glass, barley transparent.  Around the edge was a 6 inch blue ring, shaped like dominos side by side.  In the middle of the dome was a pendulum that went counter clock wise around and around. It was easy to see passing under the frosted glass shell and the blue rings.  All the time making the humming noise as it revolved.  I had to prove to myself that this was real. I turned around with my back to them, but still heard the humming sounds they were making.  I turned back facing them and watch in amusement for at least another minute.  I again turned my back to them. As soon as I did, a few seconds past and the humming sound stopped.  I turn back towards my window and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t expect anyone to believe me.  My parents just laughed just as anyone else would have who has never witness such an unbelievable sight.  I even don’t expect whoever reads this to believe my story.  I never told a soul till a few years back to my wife of 22 years.  As I told her, I am probably just a few people on earth who ever saw a UFO up close, much less three.  Most sightings I read about are lights in the sky, not something as clear as looking at your TV set across the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not mind being tested under hypnosis or any other test to make believers of what I witness when I was eight years old, but I doubt if even that would ever happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of my sighting I have no doubt what so ever that there are others in our universe.  As I became older I figured the small spacecrafts were more of a surveillance craft sending images to the Mother ship.  Not occupied by small aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Walking along with friend in a northerly direction on the left bank of the Danube river of South Budapest. The river flows at this point quite accurately in the N-S dirction. We both were engineering students, the school was out, absolutely perfect day - no clouds, bright sunshine.  Discussing some technical problems, we stopped for a few seconds and turned around. With amazement, we saw a brilliant spot on the sky at about 35 degrees elevation about 245 degrees direction - the sun was now behind our backs. It was impossible to judge the distance of the spot, but it exhibited strong flickering light from it assumed to be the result of the air mass turbulence, similarly to star watching, indicating several miles. There were no aircraft of any kind in the vicinity. The size of the spot was approximately 2-3 times the diameter of Jupiter as can be seen from Earth. We do not know, how long the object was there before we noticed it, but it was stationary, no movement detected when we spotted it. It hung there for about 30 seconds or so, then very slowly drifted to the right from our vantage point - to the Westerly direction, and stopped for several seconds. After about 15 seconds, it started out in the same westerly direction, accelerating very rapidly, after moving about 15 degrees at an extremely high speed now, it took an abrupt turn 90 degrees to the North (from our position), kept moving with extreme speed, then slowly faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a Communist system in command at that time in Hungary, but apparently it overlooked the press report, because it reported that 200 thosand people called in about this phenomenon. That was the first and last official report on the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most advanced aircraft at that time in that region were the Mig series (15, and up) Russian vehicles, somewhat later. The only rockets at that time were the German V1 and the V2 rockets. At any rate, the extrmely high speed right angle turn (could not see any turning radius whatsoever) would have torn apart any conventional earthly craft by the lateral vector. I was speculating as to whether it could have been an aerial phenomenon - concentrated ligt focused overhead, etc. - but I had to discount these theories, I found no credible report on such phenomenon in the scientific field in the past 50 years. I have never reported this event before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It didn&#39;t flash again but appeared to be a reflective, metallic, egg shaped object hovering to the south over Washington D.C. or Chevy Chase, MD.  It first appeared similar to a blimp, but had no markings, tail surfaces, flaps, openings, windows, lights, rivets or other surface details.  It moved silently and left no contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kensington is at a higher elevation than Washington but it was difficult to judge the size, distance and height of the object.  It appeared to be at about 20 degrees elevation from the horizon and disappeared at perhaps 60 degrees from horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved very slowly to the west parallel to the ground for several minutes, and after angling upwards 45 or 50 degrees it began to ascend rapidly and in 15 or 20 seconds it became a tiny point of light in the dark blue sky before disappearing.  Its upward movement was of continuous and rapid acceleration at several times the speed of a conventional aircraft.  As it moved the object&#39;s apparent shape changed from egg-like to a flattish ellipsoid,  more specifically a symmetrical convex lenticular cross section top-to-bottom, a slightly elongated ellipse along it length, the narrower part of which was its rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was also seen by my wife and neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  This is an amended version of a report submitted to NICAP by my now deceased father.

It occurred during their childhood in rural Neshoba County, Mississippi.  Both are Air Force veterans and solid citizens.  I have absolutely no reason to doubt their word.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to the observers (who are twin boys), they were about seven or eight years old, and out of school for the summer.  The rural mail carrier delivered the mail to their home somewhat near the end of his route, and usually arrived after 3:00 p.m.  Their home was located approximately 100 yards up a gravel driveway from the main roadway, also a gravel road at the time.  The twins heard the mailman approach the mailbox, stop, and then accelerate off to the next home down the road.  They asked their mother if they could go down to the mailbox and get the mail.  She allowed them to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They walked the 100 yards or so down to the mailbox, retrieved the mail and headed back towards the house.  When they were approximately half way up the drive (50 yards from their home), my great-aunt began yelling for them to &#34;run, run!&#34; in an urgent tone.  They ran towards her.  When they arrived at the front porch of their home, my great-aunt pointed towards the woodline on the other side of a field approximately 4-500 yards from their home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Silently hovering over the woodline was a very large silvery disk, perhaps 100-200 feet or larger in circumference.  They observed the disk hover for approximately another four or five minutes.  It then took off at a very high rate of speed, accelerating as it gained in altitude.  It was out of sight in only a few seconds, and was entirely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousins told me that they were in awe of the object but, being children, they quickly resumed playing and had only the vaguest memory of both the object and the event for many years.  While reminiscing at a Thanksgiving dinner many years later (in the mid-1990s), my great-aunt questioned them both to see if they remembered the event.  They both recalled the event and had virtually identical recollections.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An older brother who was a test engineer at the Nevada Test Site until his retirement also recalled that the story was related to him shortly after it happened in the early 1950s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not aware of any other witnesses, nor am I aware of any graphic images such as photos, movies, etc., that exist of the incident.

I heard it from an old friend while I was in high school, which was 1960-64.  He had graduated fron UCLA engineering school, and was on vacation in (as I recall) Mexicali, Mexico, with a friend. The year was schetchy, but I know he said it was after the war had ended, and before 1958. Over the city plaza, a large disk, perhaps 200= feet across just appeared and hovered.  He and the friend noticed first that the town&#39;s people were jabbering and pointing in awe at this thing above them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk was sivery, with noticable &#34;portholes&#34;, and it  perhaps 200-500 feet above the plaza.  He was very impressed by it, for it darted suddenly over here to the left, then to the right, then in a moment, it dashed completely out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a recent grad from engineering school, he knew that nothing he had ever seen or studied could possibly withstand that kind of forces of acceleration and maneuvering agility.  He concluded that it therefor must be extra-terrestrial.  He was guarded as he told us, for he didn&#39;t share the account for concern that others would think him to be crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you ever had any other reports of such a sighting in Mexico, above a city plaza?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
