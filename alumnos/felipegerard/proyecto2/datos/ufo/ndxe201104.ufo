4/30/11 23:40|Seattle|WA|Formation|30 seconds|V-Shaped Formation of Objects Over Seattle|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81077.html|1|ndxe201104| V-Shaped Formation of Objects Over Seattle<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 43 year old graphic artist, and will email you my Photoshop interpretation of the sighting.  Please note that this is NOT a real photo but was drawn immediately after the sighting while my memory was very fresh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:40pm I stepped out on my rooftop deck for a breath of air and to take in the view before bed. The deck faces south and offers a panoramic view of Seattle.  As I am located about a half mile from downtown, the glow of the city lights gave a subtle pinkish hue to the few scattered clouds in the sky.  There was no moon or wind of any kind, nor any sound except the faint drone of city traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my gaze drifted to the 40 degree Southwestern area of the sky I suddenly noticed a v-shaped squadron of about 8-10 pale whitish objects rapidly emerge from behind a cloud.  They were flying toward the Northeast at a very high rate of speed for their apparent very high altitude.  They caught my attention due to the oddly pale appearance, great speed and lack of any marking lights or sound.  It was hard to tell whether they were self-illuminated or merely reflecting the glow of the city lights as they were so pale.  The squadron was about the size of my index and middle fingers held at arm&#39;s length, from the tips to the knuckle.  The point of the V was at the prevailing tip of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds it reached the 90 degree position, so I turned to continue watching.  At this point I noticed that there were two additional objects of the same color, size and brightness off to the right of the formation.  These two objects were very close together and kept a perfect pace with the &#34;main v&#34;, and were the distance of roughly five &#34;squadrons&#34; away.  At about 140 degrees northeast the objects became obscured by a cloud and I lost track of them as they were already getting very far away anyhow.  The time from the start of the sighting until the end was about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight path was perfectly straight and unwavering.  At no time did any of the objects deviate in position at all from the others, which indicated that possibly this could have been one gigantic triangle rather than separate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the exact moment that the formation disappeared, a passenger jet and small private plane came into view lower in the same section of the sky.  It was instantly obvious that the formation wasn&#39;t conventional aircraft because the jet and plane had all the usual lights and obvious sounds coming from them, and they were far brighter and more yellowish in color than the pale and dim white hue of the formation.<n>

It caught his attention as it did not resemble a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the object for several minutes he witnessed the object split into 3 identical lights, one shot off to the right and quickly disappeared, the other moved beneath the the original light, hovered a bit, and slowly descended until we lost site of it behind a local church.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main light continued to hover, this is when my husband ran inside and got me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out and observed the light with him for at approx 30 minutes, taking a few pictures in the process.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while we tired and went to bed, the object has not returned since.<n>

There were no blinking lights or sounds that are familiar with aircraft sightings.  The object had intense white lights that formed a chevron silhouette in the darkness.  The craft appeared to change direction as it passed overhead.  Suddenly it dimmed the bright lights and was gone in a instant.<n>

It was only in the sky for a few a seconds and in those few seconds all the lights in the neighborhood went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself didn&#39;t make any noise but it caused the surroundings in the area to vibrate making a thumping sound.

We saw what first looked like a hot air or weather balloon.  It appeared to be round in shape and almost looked like it was either a fireball or a flame inside the shape. It was of a orange/yellow color and appeared to be traveling Southwest to Northeast.  It was neither slow nor fast, but seemed to travel in a steady pace.<n>

We&#39;re very close to downtown Nashville on the East side.  out of nowhere what appeared to be a fleet of slow moving fireball like objects moved across the sky.  They kept coming out of the horizon, with 2 staggering behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have footage of the last 2 objects that are quite clear, sadly we didn&#39;t capture the big fleet.<n>

While walking toward my apartment, I looked up in the sky and observed 8-10 glowing objects hovering northbound of Santa Fe, New Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were in a boomerang formation.  Each light can be described as 1/4 the size of the moon. All the objects appeared to look similar to eachother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that each object moved out of sequence with the other objects but still proceeded north in the boomerang shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted approximately 15 seconds.  There was also no sound that came from the objects.  The objects faded out as they grew a larger distance from me.  The height of the object seemed similar to as high as a helicopter&#39;s common altitude.<n>

[This took between 10 and 15 seconds]   It went between two apartment buildings, then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light was pretty bright, almost white with a little yellow in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember feeling a sence of peace during this occurance.<n>

The craft was huge!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got scared and u-turned and didn’t look back.  I drove the 20 minutes home and called and told my friends I was too tired to go out--which wasn’t fun because I had really wanted to go to see my friend, R., who was in town just for one night.  The spaceship is the only reason I didn’t make it to the bonfire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had 4 or 5 previous sighting with this kind of craft.  It is a UFO to me because I don’t know what can hover like that and I have seen them zigzag through the night sky out of sight in a split second; it could very well be a government aircraft, but since my government has not informed me of such things (as they should if they have them!) it may also be alien spacecraft.  I have seen one over the ocean in North Carolina that backed behind a cloud and came back (this was a GIANT black craft, still the three white lights on the ends---there was a government base nearby I know), one when I was traveling from Kansas to St. Louis down 70 E near Colombia (this looked exactly like the one from last night, except that when I first noticed it, there was a sort of spotlight coming from it I thought it was a soccer field spotlight at first, this one stayed with me on my drive down 70 for  a while), I have seen one at camp Zoe, MO (far off in the night sky and zigzags across in ! irregular patterns and then darted across to the right in less than a second.  This one looked different than the others and the lights looked like white-then-blue-then-red or a combination of the three colors, my guess for this is the far distance away the light were),  I briefly saw the red-blue-white lights in a triangle shape also on highway 70 going west about three years ago, (this one also disappeared very quickly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know what it is I am seeing these last three years.  I have only seen triangle-shaped with three lights on the ends.  I have reason to believe that each of them have a see-through hole directly in the middle of the triangle (my ex boyfriend saw one very close up in daylight).  I don’t want to be abducted but I also don’t want to be scared.  I always tell myself I will be brave next time I see them but I am not yet very brave when I am alone (like last night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully, I will run into them with my boyfriend so he can see and also so we can be together if anything were to happen.  Optimistically, they are our friends in the sky that just want to say hello and see what going on with the humans these days.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of April the 29th, 2011, sometime around midnight, several of my friends and I spent the evening at an outdoor party in the valley wrapped around Douglas Creek--about 10 miles from the small town of Douglas.  This party happens every year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I gathered around our campsite, looking into the clear night sky.   We could see every star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, my friend grabbed my arm and pointed to the west.   We could see a bright light--a star, as it appeared.   We noted the light as it intensified. I became thrilled--this star is becoming brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the star become brighter, and brighter.  Within a moment, the star became so bright, we could nolonger see the smaller stars in the sky. We realized that this light was in our atmosphere.  And because it remained in a fixed position in the sky while intensifying in brightness, we conjectured we were looking at a satellite, and it appeared to be travelling in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute, maybe two, the intensifying light which appeared fixed in its position in the sky began to move east in an eliptical direction around the area--it never flew directly over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, we started getting excited. We were sure this was some kind of satellite, and that it was going to hit the earth.  It was moving at very high speed, much faster than any plane.  Yet, we heard nothing. It moved around Douglas Creek, traveling east toward the horizon.  The light appeared to be flying low enough to hit the mountainside on the eastern side of the valley.  We watched eagerly to see the collision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, the light traveled east toward the Horizon, but stopped above the mountainside--still several hundered feet in the air.  It stood fixed in the sky, as it had when we saw it in the west a moment earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we became really excited.  We watched this light, fixed in the eastern sky, intensify as it had when we first saw it, and it slowely faded to black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The truely amazing thing about this sighting was the intensity of the light.  It lit the entire sky.  The night was still, and we could see every star in the sky before.  However, this light overpowered all others as it closed in. While we watched, all other stars faded.  When the light disappeared, all was calm and clear as it was before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what we saw--None of us are sure what we saw.  It was very interesting. I told many of my friends and co-workers, and I heard of some local legends of &#34;spooklights&#34; over Waterville, a small town outside of Doulgas, our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hearing of this, I did some research, and saw some local reports of this strange phenomena; however, the videos of these &#34;spooklights&#34; is not what we saw.  What we saw did not change directions, and didn&#39;t move as quickly.  What we saw was a single, much brighter--white light--not a dim orange light.  And this light looked like a star, at first, as it stood fixed in the west.  Then the light looked like an aircraft as it travelled east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the light disappeared, it looked more like a star, again, as it had in the west before it moved.  It was all very bizzare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this information will be helpfull at some point.  I&#39;m not a UFO buff, by any means, but what I saw blew my mind.  I will never forget the odd behavior of this light--like nothing I could have imagined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take care.  Good fortune in future endeavors.<n>

The strange thing is that the object was rectangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming down from a NW toward the NE direction at a very shallow angle +/-140degs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rectangular shape was not thinnest in the direction of travel, but perpendicular to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was engulfed in white flames while yellow flames just streaked off from behind.  You could tell that small fragments were braking off from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately waited for a big bang, but it never happened.  I take this to mean that the object was very far away even though it seemed close because of its large size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably fell in the Atlantic close to Jacksonville???<n> <n><n> <n><n> I logged-in a 911 call in Alachua County, Fl.  If it was a meteor, it was very strange, slow and large????<n>

Unlike a metor or falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it was gone the sky filled with four flying crafts; mostly airplanes because of the lights, but they surrounding the area and moving towards the site in the sky.

The fireball extinguished itself in midfilight after a brighter pinkish flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event took about 4 or 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was ordnance from Eglin AFB or Tyndall AFB but the location (North of I10) and direction of its path negated that.  It seemed to fit other descriptions of space junk falling to earth (e.g., slow and green).  Interestingly, the first observer (in Jacksonville) stated that the object was falling toward the west, whereas I (near Marianna) observed it moving generally toward  the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved from left to right, about three-quarters of the way up my driver&#39;s window, as my vehicle moved east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was focused on driving, so didn&#39;t observe any other associated phenomena.  It was brief, fascinating and cool!<n>

The objects were clustered together at first, then separated randomly.  They were visible for about 5-10 minutes. They travelled in a southeast direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the ground and at night, it was impossible to tell the altitude, speed, or size of the objects.  It was like watching airplanes in the sky at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Winds were 28-30 mph, out of the north.<n>

It was around 8:40ish while I was watching the SJ Sharks Hockey game in my garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over my roof line and towards Morgan Hill area were about 8 glowing orageish balls.  This was 8:40ish pm and at first I thought they were flares but they were moving erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first staying still then moving rapidly.  This was Cambrian area facing Morgan Hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw them for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I googled the sighting and it looked very similar to other sightings shown; multiple round objects moving unnaturally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not saying they are not from this world but it was highly unnatural.<n>

I was sitting with a clear view of the eastern sky, and a view of the northern sky that was blocked off by the building. It was very cloudy and humid, but otherwise a nice tolerable night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at one friend explaining a documentary, when over his right shoulder in the sky, I saw a green fireball with no trail or tail fall toward the ground from the sky.  It appeared from behind a cloud, disappeared behind another cloud as it descended, reappeared, and finally disappeared for the final time amongst the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled at the speed of like a spark that falls from fireworks, or a descending flare.  All in all, after doing research I am positive this wasn&#39;t a meteor or anything of the sort.  None of it seems to fit the bill of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For informational purposes, I am a 21 year old college student.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite reliable, and credible.

I parked so I could continue looking at the object and I noticed it was moving real slow to only one direction and knowing off the top of my head that every airplane in the sky is required to have flashing lights, this one did not.  I stared at it more because I was thinking maybe the lights are delaying or something but to my surprise it started to dim out real slow when it completely turned off.  As it was off you could tell it was round and it looked white or grey,  I kept my eye on it for about fifteen seconds when it started going out of my vision that’s when I jumped back into my car and tried to follow it but it was too late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got home and started to park I saw two lights that definitely looked like the same light I had just seen and these lights looked pretty big to be a plane and they also were not flashing, just a deep, bright red orange light that reminds you of the color of fire. It almost looked like it was on fire.  As I got off the car I was watching these two lights travel slow next to each other but they had a distance. The light that was on the left side dimmed maybe ten seconds after I was watching both of them and the second light took longer to turn off but as I was watching that light I was examining it more to rule out the theory of this object being out of the ordinary and I truly found this object fascinating. I know for a fact it did not have any flashing lights at all it was just glowing that red orange color, and I found it so weird how it turned itself off and you can still see the object moving in the sky, if this was an airplane or a man made object it made some illega! l moves by not having flashing lights and flying in the sky with its lights off.  If anyone else saw this, please I would very much love to hear about it.  I want to know if I was the only one to see this.  Those lights caught my eye right away so I bet it did the same to another person.  Please let me know I need to know if I was the only one person to witness this.<n>

My mom and i both saw these... and could tell from seeing the planes flying around afterwards that these did not look anything like planes... probably sounds conf! using but hope that makes some sense.

I saw my first ever UFO.  This round circular blob like craft was unlike anything I have ever scene before.  My eyes were immediately drawn to this object moving through the sky at a very high rate of speed. It was not an airplane, nor a balloon of any type.  It moved effortlessly through the sky at  high rate of speed before disappearing from view because of a large tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to my friend as I ran toward far side of yard to gain a view behind the tree. That’s when the object vanished into the clouds above.  Today was slightly overcast with fast moving clouds. This object stood out to me as it traveled much faster than any cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want an explanation for what I saw today.  Hopefully somebody else in the area witnessed this object as well. This is going to bother until I gain an acceptable explanation. I don’t know what else to do….<n>

They were heading East.  The crafts were spherical and the outer walls appeared to be made of a metal like the kind used to build walls.  They weren&#39;t very large, in fact they were about the size of a full grown man sitting, if you wrapped a sphere of metal around him.  There was a red glass-like circle on the &#34;front&#34;.  I think it may have been a window.  There was no propulsion system on the other side.  No rocket, jet, fan, or anything it just flew.  There was a misty purple haze around it, and it left a trail behind it which was the same color.  The trail lasted maybe 30 seconds before disappearing.  They continued heading East until I couldnt see them anymore.<n>

Suddenly, from outside, I heard something fall. So I look out the window, and in my backyard, in the northeast corner of my backyard, is a lump/pile of white stuff that looks like plastic. It even sounded like a ton of large, empty, plastic milk containers falling on top of each other. Also, it was right under a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed my mom, and she said she didn’t know what it was, probably just plastic falling from the tree. Honestly, I think it was way too big to be in a tree without the tree dropping it until then. And I’ve never seen plastic in that tree. I’ve never seen plastic in any tree! And how would plastic get up there, anyway?    However, I was going to go out to inspect it, but I couldn’t find the time. So one day, I was about to go look at it, when I saw it wasn’t there anymore! Again, I told my mom, and she said my dad probably picked it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly, I don’t know what it was.  My guess that it could either be:  Plastic falling from a tree  A small UFO  Pieces of a UFO   Things from inside a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first I thought it was a model airplane but then when I looked again, there were 3.  There were dancing around (like they were playing) and then I noticed one went into a 90 degree turn without stopping.  They were about the size of my truck (Saturn VEU) and aprox 1200 to 1400 feet.  I have seen this type before when I was on vacation in Costa Rica.  The item in question was over a small town and then I got pictures of it next to an active volcano.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will enail the pictures I obtained in Costa Rica.<n>

We were talking while we were looking up at the sky.  It was partly cloudy that night but u could still see a great number of stars.  As we sitting looking up a light caught my eye it was small round light coming through a cloud and it looked like there was a light behind it.  Naturally I said o look to my Girlfriend there is a shooting star.  I thought it was a low one with a bright tail behind it. She looked up and it came out of the cloud into a clearing in the sky.  What came out of that cloud was no shooting star.  It was rectangle in shape with three small round lights in a line inside the rectangle.  The lights were brighter then the rectangle part.  It wasn&#39;t very high and it kept moving in the same direction.  It was no Meteor, no satellite , no plane or jet.  It didn&#39;t even make noise when it was approaching or when i was gone like a jet does just quiet. !<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at her and I said, &#34;Umm, did you see that?&#34;  just to make sure and she replied,  &#34;I think we just saw a UFO&#34; I could not believe it at first but I am 100% certain this was a UFO.  I did some looking up on Google and it seems on September , 5 , 2010 there was a similar sighting of this object<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moving toward Duryea  Pennsylvania which is about 10 miles away from where are sighting happened.  My girlfriend is a strong believer of aliens,UFO&#39;s,E.T life.  I on the other hand really never took much interest or believed in aliens or any of that stuff but after this sighting it has changed my whole out look on the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also there were other jets you could see that night flying around because there is a airport about 13 miles away.  And there were other planes flying at this time.<n>

It only lit up the area around the object, the object seemed to pulse for around 2 to 3 seconds and then disappear from view, almost like it went invisible, we both saw the object at the same time and new it was not a radio tower or water tower as it was much to big and bright of a light, my friend and i are both in our early 20&#39;s and i know i have NEVER seen anything like this before. i don&#39;t know what it is that i saw but it was definitely not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

4/26/11 00:30|Pacoima/Tujunga|CA|Disk|3-4 Hours on and off|Faint red disc shape seen multiple times in a long span of time, over mountains and dam.|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81019.html|53|ndxe201104| Faint red disc shape seen multiple times in a long span of time, over mountains and dam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around midnight I stepped outside for a smoke before bed and was on the phone with my boyfriend when I saw the object.  It wasn’t high in the sky but more on the level where I caught the movement out of the corner of my eye.  It appeared to be a faint reddish color, not too bright but bright enough to see clearly.  And you could really see it with the clear sky. It was disc like in shape, but that could have been motion blurring it?  It was going left in a zig zag motion and then stopped (complete stop) and dropped down then came up again then shot off to the left.  It was there and the next moment it was just gone.  Since it’s been extremely windy, I also though perhaps it could have been a plastic bag up high or some other thing, but nothing I’d know of would just stop like that.  I went inside for a while but decided to come back out about half an hour later to see if I could ease my fears because frankly it’s scary thing to experience.  I wasn’t seeing anything ! and again I was on the phone with my boyfriend when I happened to see it again.  This time it went from the left of the sky to the right with little corkscrew-ish turns but extremely fast and smoothly.  It wasn’t as faint as before when it had been near the mountains and it seemed a little larger in appearance.  We have a dam nearby that’s extremely well lit up and it went in that direction.  I stayed out for another hour looking for it still and it actually appeared again.  It seemed to come back from that direction but this time it flew seemingly straight and still extremely fast.  I actually had to get out of my car to see where it was going. About 3 minutes passed and I saw it the final time.  It appeared near the little/big dipper (not sure which it was) and made a few strange movements like it was drawing a star or octagon. Just left, right, forward, back but all extremely fast.  And this time instead of winking out when it was done, it did it in the middle. It would reappear! then disappear.  Then it finally stopped.  I waited another hou! r before I went inside to bed but it didn’t reappear again.  As a result i&#39;m one tired camper at work this morning!!  Because of the weather, I considered trash flying about or debris in the sky perhaps catching the glow of the lights around me, but the way this moved and the range of sky I repeatedly saw the same object in nullifies that conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a lot of planes as well, but this was closer to the earth than they were.  Also, the planes were extremely slow where as this object caused me to look from my right and turn around to continue looking at it in 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also considered other things like lights or laser pointers, but there was absolutely nothing for anything to reflect off of.  It was a completely clear night and the wind was blowing in gusts of 35mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, each time I saw the object wasn’t for long at all.  The first time was the longest, lasting about 15 seconds. The 2nd and third time were both durations of 4-5 seconds.  And the 4th time it lasted maybe a little longer…8 seconds at most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe there might have been only one of them, but i&#39;m pretty sure that the last 3 sightings were the same one.  If anyone could shed some light on this it would be much appreciated.  If it&#39;s not a UFO (well i suppose it is lol), then are there any logical alternative explanations for this?<n>

We have alot of planes that fly around our house (DFW airport aint far so its common).I was looking up &amp; I did see a plane but I also saw other lights.  So i tell my stepdad and we&#39;re both observing it.  It was moving slowly approximately 20-30 feet back from the plane but then it moved up fast, then went slow again, moved up fast again, then slow again, next thing we know it just vanished.<n>
4/25/11 21:52|Rockwall|TX|Rectangle|8-12 seconds|Rectangular object soaring silently with no lights or sound and with a digital camouflage pattern|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81023.html|55|ndxe201104| Rectangular object soaring silently with no lights or sound and with a digital camouflage pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were sitting outside on our patio on 4/25/11 at 9:52 pm when we saw a rectangular shaped object soaring silently from southeast to northwest.  It is difficult to estimate the size or how high it was.  The object could be seen clearly and it was not rotating, making noise or illuminated.  My wife believes it was roughly 200’ x 200’ and was flying at roughly 1500’.  I believe it was much larger and was flying closer to 1 mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be in a liquid state, such as the chemical mercury, but it retained its parallelogram shape throughout the sighting.  It appeared to only be reflecting the lights from the ground, and had no lights on the craft itself.  The object had a &#34;digital&#34; camouflaged appearance of a circuit board or other layered pattern.  It was dark outside with few clouds and the stars were shining brightly.  There were no other aircraft in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise and flew in a straight line and was faster than any ai! rcraft I have ever personally seen.  We live in an area with little surrounding lights from our community.  Neither my wife nor myself have ever seen anything like this and have never witnessed any unidentified object.  We have lived at this home for eleven years and spend every evening outside with our small dog.  We live on a small 1 acre estate and have a perimeter fence and gate.  The view was unobstructed.  I have lived in Rockwall County, Texas, for 39 years and have never heard anyone mention a sighting before this.<n>

Review, was working the day watch out on council meetings Wednesday morning when the phone rang.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor xxxxxxxx picked up the receiver, and heard the voice of one xxxxxxxxxxxx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The editor began taking notes, as he learned of four unidentified-flying objects that the man believed had landed briefly just west of Athens Housing, located in front of the Loop 7 underpass on the east side, off U.S. Highway 175.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Yes sir, we&#39;ll check that out,&#34; the editor promised the caller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Thursday that the editor ordered this reporter to get to the bottom of this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Call this guy, and see what the heck&#39;s going on.  And if you go out there, don&#39;t get distracted, and stop at those phone booths that always hold you up,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the editor that we don’t have that many phone booths anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Hello,  the man carrying the voice of Mr. xxxxxxxxx said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Heard you spotted a UFO, sir.  We&#39;re calling to the get the facts,&#34; the reporter said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;This is really embarrassing,&#34; xxxxxxx said.  &#34;We started not to say anything about this to anybody.&#34;  &#34;Why&#39;s that, Sir?&#34;   &#34;Everybody will think we&#39;re crazy,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Naw, naw,&#34; the reporter said, reassuringly.  &#34;Now sir, we need to get to the bottom of this.  Were the eyes of the aliens green, and were they bald-headed and wrinkled?  If you could just give us a quick description, Sir.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We didn&#39;t see any faces.&#34;   &#34;I see.&#34;   &#34;We saw four lights.&#34;   &#34;Who&#39;s we?&#34;  The man nervously explained that ((female name deleted)),  the owner of ((deleted)) Housing, and he were sitting on the front porch of the office smoking cigarettes when it happened late Tuesday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;They (the UFOs) appeared to be about 10 to 15 feet in diameter.&#34;   &#34;That&#39;s a guesstimate, I suppose?   &#34;Yes, but they looked like they were the same size as the four circles on the ground on the other side of the lot.&#34;  &#34;Circles?  What kind of circles, Sir?&#34;   The man explained that it appeared four UFOs could have stopped there under the power lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We&#39;re not crazy, Sir. Really.  I don&#39;t believe in UFOs, and I&#39;ve never had anything like this happen to me before.&#34;   &#34;Did you say it was cigarettes you were smoking?&#34;   &#34; Yes Sir. Why?&#34;   &#34;No reason. Just curious. So, what&#39;s your evidence, Mr. xxxxxxx?&#34;   He explained the line that made the circle felt like a soft, powdery substance, something like graphite.  He said it did no damage to the bermuda grass beneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Under further questioning, Ms. xxxxx and Mr. xxxxxxx explained they hadn&#39;t seen the circles on Tuesday night.  What they did see, both of them individually, was four lights at close range.  They too were 10 to 15 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were said to have flown around the side of the lot, making a left turn, then stopping just above another power line, where they are described as having stared at the two humans for about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either that, or it was suggested they could have been drawing more energy from the power line they were a few feet above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I promise you, we&#39;re not crazy,&#34; said Ms. xxxxx.   &#34;It looked like they were sitting on top of the power line, and that we scared them off.&#34;   How did the UFO leave ma&#39;am?   &#34;After they saw us, they formed a perfect diamond, and then went straight up in the air very fast and disappeared.&#34;   Attempts were made to photograph the dark circles, but they&#39;re hard to see in a photograph.  But they are there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. xxxxxxx scooped up some of the powdery substance, and poured it into a Land O Lakes All Natural Whipped Butter container, so people could see it better.  No one at the Review wanted to touch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reporter assured the couple he wouldn&#39;t make them look crazy.   He, in fact, saw the same circle, felt the substance, and can verify it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the lights, they&#39;re on their own about that.  Suggestions like a car turning around with its four lights on bright, was dismissed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More proof was needed to identify the substance.  Henderson County Extension Agent xxxx xxxxxx, was called to the site to look and sniff and diagnose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he thinks it&#39;s a fungus, but he sent samples of the circle dust to a plant pathologist in Overton, and expects to get results back in two or three days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pressed as to how a fungus could make perfectly-round circles, xxxxxx reminded the reporter that the fungus is alive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And apparently it has the sense to make perfect, geometric circles.  &#34;It&#39;s very common,&#34; xxxxxx said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The county extension agent didn&#39;t dismiss the two sightings by the two citizens, because he had read an article recently in the Longview paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;There was a sighting just about like this one recently in Longview,&#34; he said, &#34;They saw lights, and they found marks on the ground.&#34;   But xxxxxx was adamant that he was not making any evaluation of any alleged lights, and what they were all about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I&#39;m just talking about stuff within my bailiwick,&#34; he said.  &#34;I&#39;m just commenting on the lights.&#34;   &#34;I promise you we are not crazy,&#34; Ms. xxxxx said, again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Yes ma&#39;am,&#34; the reporter said.  &#34;You definitely saw something, and with what happened in Longview recently, maybe somebody else can explain what has been happening in the East Texas sky recently.&#34;  One thing seemed certain late Thursday evening. xxxxxx will get to the bottom of this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Article from the Athens Daily Review (May 26th, 2011)<n>

However, it left no trail and the edges of the light twinkled as the craft ran a long curve downwards and parallel to the velocity of my truck.  After following the object with my eyes for a mile or so, I saw where the source of the light was coming from.   A nearby cell tower was producing light of the exact same hue and color.  I came to the conclusion that the flying object was reflecting the light from the tower rather than producing its own light.  When a line of thick trees began to build by the road, I lost the object and when I came out on the other side of the grove of woods it was gone.  It was suggested that maybe it was a plane landing in Albany; however, no such aircraft could be spotted from 55 miles away, the location of Albany relative to Omega.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses elects to remain totally anonymous; provide no contact information.

It didn&#39;t have any wings, moved in a straight line, looked like a black shoebox, or the underneath of a black platform.

This light that is now known to me, would decrease and increase in brightness.  After five minutes the light dimmed, but was still visible, and a second orb appeared next to the original light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pair would decrease, increase brightness and would move further or closer to each other.  The objects would change direction, or formation.  There was no noise to the craft but I did hear helicopter not too far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I used my binoculars I did see something emitting the light.   I don’t know what it was but I saw something.  At 00:05, the two lights turned into one and dimmed.  Then I heard the sounds of helicopters about 30 seconds later.<n>

Now I figured it would be a anything from a star, plane, etc.  I have a background in aviation and I knew that it was nothing of a normal aircraft.  This object was pretty high up but not high enough to be mistaken for a star, satellite, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked outside to our second story patio to get a better look.  This object just had us dumbfounded. It seemed to revolve around with the red/blue/white type of lighting as well as almost bob around on an irregular axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen things before that could have been considered unidentified, but lastnight&#39;s sighting totally changed my belief that these things do exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally after about 15 minutes of this object hovering in the same general area it simply vanished, almost like someone shut the switch off on a light, just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very curious to know if anyone was able to witness what we did and ! their conclusions as to what it could have been. This was not a normal object/plane/helicopter etc. To add to this, there were &#34;normal&#34; aircraft flying by it in the 15 minute span with their own becons, nav lights, etc. I hope I get to witness something like this again, thank you for your time.<n>

They were not in any type of formation. My wife and I both decided to see what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 minutes or so we got to the point of where they were.  They had gone to the south east of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both noticed one of the objects coming towards where we had parked.  It was very bright with no blinking lights.  As it went over head, all the lights were gone and we had a great look of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about 1000 ft in the air; it made no sound at all. It was moving in a straight line going NW at about 55-60 mph.  The wind was out of the south at 6 mph.  The object looked as big as a 4 door sedan.  It was a grayish/white rectangle with rounded edges. It looked as if the object had a rippling effect after it past overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that object went out of sight, we saw another object headed our way with the same type of or! ange fiery light.  This object also had no sound to it.  As this second object went over head, it stayed glowing. There were no blinking lights on it.  All the other objects in the sky where these two came from were gone.<n>
4/23/11 20:59|Spokane Valley|WA|Rectangle|90 seconds|Dim rectangular object seen over Spokane Valley.|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88628.html|75|ndxe201104| Dim rectangular object seen over Spokane Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:59 PM, Monday April 23rd I was working on my computer when my roommate called me outside to look at something. We live in the Spokane Valley and our back porch faces west towards the city of Spokane. My roommate who had been observing Venus and the crescent moon observed an object moving exactly from south to north at the speed of a light aircraft travelling at about 8-10,000 feet altitude. This was over 1 hour after local sunset so the skies were not quite black but nearly so. It took me twenty seconds to acquire the object. It was only visible from the reflected light of the city of Spokane. The object had no lights, was completely silent, and appeared to be tan or light brown in color. I noticed that it was heading directly towards Venus and amazingly in a few seconds it passed directly in front of Venus. It completely blocked out Venus for 1 second and I was able to get an impression of an elongated  (in the direction of travel)irregularly shaped cr! aft (something similar to a box-like “pixilated”appearance). The fact that this object was silent struck me as very weird. I ran to get my binocs and when I returned the object was quickly receding from view in part because of the severe light pollution in this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From our location the object was 30 degrees above the western horizon when it passed in front of Venus. I estimate it had an angular diameter between 1/8 and ¼ degree.  I only saw the object for a total of  10-15 seconds but my roommate estimates it took 70-80 seconds from the time it appeared near the southern horizon to when it occulted Venus. I wish I could describe the craft in more detail but it was only visible from reflected light and my night vision was shot from looking at a computer screen. From my perspective it appeared to be larger than a Cessna would be at that altitude (5-10,000 feet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the object was in fact an aircraft it was clearly in violation of  FAA rules as it had no navigation lights or strobe 1 hour after local sunset. I attempted to contact Spokane International Flight Tower but there were no personnel to answer my inquiry.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside after supper and noticed a yellowish-white light at 37 degrees NE and just above the tree-line in the night sky.  I stared at it for a long moment because I knew that the light had not been in the sky on previous nights.  Then I realized that the light was moving ever so slowly towards the NE.  I only took my eyes off of it long enough to look back behind me and call one of my sons to come out.  When I turned my head back, I saw the light speed away towards the east faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n>

The object was very slow moving and when we tried to listen to hear the engine, the craft was silent.  On the front of the craft was a small red light and appeared to have a dome on top of the craft, but because it was viewed from the bottom, we are unable to determine what was on the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving west very slowly and when the craft flew behind a tree and we lost sight for a moment, but coming from the south east was a big airplane following it in the same direc! tion, as if it was perusing the unknown craft.  When we regained our sight of the craft, it had gained speed and altitude and began heading eastward as if it was trying to evade the pursuing airplane<n>

PD))|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80987.html|89|ndxe201104| Square craft, 4 orange lights with 1 flashing light in center<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4/22/11 approx. 12:00am<n> <n><n> <n><n> HOLLISTER, CALIFORNIA  On the night of April 21st around 12:00am PST (technically April 22nd), me and two others were having a cigarette outside of my sister&#39;s home, and noticed a helicopter coming in for landing at our local hospital (which is closeby her home).  Shortly after the helicopter passed, we were conversating about something unimportant when I couldn&#39;t help but cut in and say, &#34;it could just be a plane or another copter...but look at that thing, it looks so weird&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the guys looked up and agreed, it was a very strange looking craft.  But I always throw out something like &#34;its probably just a governement plane&#34;...so I don&#39;t look like an idiot assuming crazy things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the guys confirmed to me that they&#39;d never seen anything like that before, and that it was quite low and easily visible at first then gained altitude quickly but almost unnoticeably as it moved North-bound and away from us.  Way high above it, we noticed and heard a commercial jet-plane as it flew Southwest, and after the trailing engine sounds from the jet passed (and the UFO still in sight, slowly and very closeby) we were SURE that this object was emitting no noise.  Within about 15 seconds it seemed to go from a few hundred feet above us, to about 30,000ft with effortless grace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft itself had a large dark gray/black rectangular body.  It was hard to see the actually body in the night sky, but it was the lights that were most obvious to me.  And all that we could really desribe of the craft was the ventral surface (or underside), being the only side we could see very clearly.  It had 4 lights in its four corners, all gleaming a constant orangish light, and in the center of the 4 lights was one flashing yellow or white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being familiar with air traffic lights and landing lights, etc, I knew these were not normal lights nor was their positioning.  And, because I know where our airport is located and the directions of our runway, I knew this was not a craft that had just taken off, nor was it coming in for landing while making its descent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement of the craft was, as I said, effortlessly graceful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first spotted it, it was going at a slow constant rate and staying at about the same altitude for probably a full 10 seconds, but then gained altitude very quickly going northbound and within seconds, was noticeably very far from us.<n>

We heard the noise again, only this time much louder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son ran outside and quickly yelled for us to come outside.  We ran outside only to see a triangular solid aircraft that had 3 lights on the outside of the craft.  It was a very large craft and very loud, as it shook my house as it flew by.  Within a few minutes, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son had seen this ship a few weeks earlier but we did not believe him.<n>

Then I&#39;ve noticed two similar objects but they were bright white light instead of read one.  They were moving the same direction at similar speed.  There is no airport in the area and they seemed to be quite low over the ground (however quite far away).  They couldn&#39;t be passenger airplines. I thought that maybe they are small, private airplanes and I would stick to that theory, but then s! uddenly the started to move in the opposite direction and then stopped moving and started hoovering in the same place.  I&#39;m not sure if they did it several times or only once, I guess I was too amazed by the whole situation.  I&#39;ve tried to call my friend who is into UFOs and who leaves in the area to take some photos but I wasn&#39;t able to contact him then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m filing a report, however I want to express it very clearly, that I&#39;m not sure about the nature of the whole situation.  Maybe those objects hoovering in one spot were just optical illusion and in reality they were flying towards me or in the opposite direction, which from my perspective might have looked like they were not moving.  So please, take this report with the grain of salt.  If you have seen something similar to that, maybe it will be of value to you, but please don&#39;t rely on my report only.  Those objects were flying really quite low and then they disappeared (landed? accelerated really quickly?),<n>

We were facing north, just talking amongst each other and looking around for no particular reason.  All of a sudden I gazed towards the lower part of the north-eastern sky and I saw this huge (I say huge because it was far bigger and wider than the tiny dots called stars) rectangular shaped, faintly white &amp; opaque in color, sort of mist-like/phantom-like &#34;thing&#34; drift quickly downwards before it disappeared. As it drifted downwards, it was like some of the form still stayed in the original spot but changed as it moved. Like pulling on a piece of laffy taffy..  I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say that this all happened in less than 10 seconds.  As soon as I saw it, I said, &#34;Oh my God. What is that?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister caught the last glimpse of it floating downward before it disappeared but her friend didn&#39;t see it (that&#39;s why I say there were 2 witnesses - me &amp; my sister).  Later when I described to my whole family about what we saw, she agreed with me about what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still at a loss of words as to what this was..  What amazes me is the size of it and how it had this &#34;clear/see-through&#34; look to it.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it but I had to report this in the hopes that at least someone else out there has seen anything like it.<n>

When i looked up it seemed to just be a bright star, but on closer inspection, it moved. I brought out my husbands binoculars to see it and it was disk shaped with flashing lights, i couldnt see TOO much more as my binoculars werent strong enough.  I brought my husband out to confirm what i saw and when we scanned for any other movement i counted 5 more ``stars`` moving.  Looking at each of them, they all had the same brightness, shape, flashing lights and movement.  I also saw what appeared to be a shooting star shoot directly to the first one i saw.  My husband has seen several UFO`s over his lifespan, this was my first sighting, i guess sightings.  I stayed outside for a half an hour just watching them, they each were hovering and moving just off of a star.  My husband and i also saw three aircraft moving in the same direction across the sky, but they looked to be jets, no standa! rd aviation lights though and they moved about as fast as a jet...I can for sure say that the 6 i saw were unidentified, not so sure about the extra 3. I was unable to take photos or videos since we dont have a strong enough camera, but my husband can attest to what i saw.<n>

At first I thought it was some sort of fireworks but quickly knew that they weren’t.

Even though I&#39;m aware of the possibility of intelligent life being out there given the number of galaxies in the universe I&#39;m not exactly a firm believer.  So you can imagine our reaction when saw the unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The local power station had suddenly caught fire the night before around midnight and a large area that we live in and the surrounding areas as well was left without power.  I live in a seven storied apartment in a place called Bashundhara in the capital, Dhaka.  My wife, mother and my six year old daugter went up to the roof top to get some fresh air.  The surrounding area was almost pitch dark except for the light from the full moon. It was such an amazing view.  The sky was absolutely clear and full of stars.  My little girl was asking questions about the stars and planets while my wife and my mother were a few feet away from us talking about some family matters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the particular star that I was poiting out to my daughter vanished right before my eyes and then re-appeared a moment later.  To my utter dismay I saw the same thing being repeated time and time again with other stars around it as well.  It was as if something was hiding the stars from my view.  But the strange thing was that sky was still full of stars and I couldn&#39;t see anything that would explain how and why the stars were being blocked from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for my wife and mother&#39;s attention and pointed it out to them.  By this time we saw a HUGE triangular shaped object right on top of us, gliding slowly away from us.  It was a triangular object and was lit with lights that resembled the stars in the sky.  The object may have been dark in color which may explain why we couldn&#39;t see it.  Strangely there was no sound whatsoever as it slowly glided away from us.  It took the object couple of mintues to glide away in the darkness and out of our sight.<n>

It was still dark.  A few minutes into my observation, a strange light caught my eye.  It was blinking at about 1 blink every 2 seconds.  After a few seconds, the UFO made a very quick flash and it went in a zig-zag manner.  It&#39;s very hard to explain.  The craft zig-zags while emitting a very bright flash(split second).  Then it went straight up as the craft&#39;s lights became dimmer.  After a few seconds, I saw a satellite so I know that the object I saw before was NOT a satellite.

Family witnesses 3 lighted crafts north of their home. 2 of the crafts flew east at extreme speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 01:15 I stepped out onto my back porch to smoke a cigarette and noticed a smaller lighted object appearing to be a satellite.  I looked longer and payed more attention to it over the course of a few minutes and it was changing color.  Strobing like a light bar on top of an emergency vehicle in the distance.  My eyes adjusting to the darkness more I see that it really isn&#39;t in space and appeared to be in the area above Cougar reservoir. In our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was depth behind the craft.  This place being about thirty miles north west of my home as the crow flies.  It moved in small circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then two smaller white lights moved away from the craft going east.  It was quite suprising to me so I went inside and woke my Father up to show him.  He was rather amazed as well and said he saw something much like it some years ago sitting in the hottub with my Mother.  I went inside and woke my Mother and she came outside and said &#34;Wow, that looks like the one we saw th! at night in the hottub, babe.&#34;  I checked on the light for several hours it remaining in about the same area in the sky.  It is now 03:16 and the light is still there moving slightly from time to time.  But I cant watch it all night.  This is the first time I have ever saw anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights changed between blue, white and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a satillite but did not move like one and was much closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> North of Westfir, OR, 3 objects total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 21 year old woman who is currently residing in my parent&#39;s home.

Object had 3 lights in a row on top, two in a row below this.  Almost appeared to be using road as a landing strip.  Had to pull off the road abruptly thinking it would hit our vehicle.  Stopped to watch, put windows down, no sound. Object appeared to see us watching and disappeared.   We were too shocked to even snap a photo with 2 cell phones on hand.  A friend asked the next day if we saw something &#34;weird last night&#34; and when we said yes, why?  She reported to us seeing a large low flying object with 5 large, bright lights on it.  The friend was about 3 roads away from where we encountered the object.  It was very frightening especially due to the fact that we thought it was going to fly into the car similar to when a low flying airplane can seem like it can hit a car when driving near an airport.  We were not near an airport and have not seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a week before and after this incident we have seen massive numbers of strange objects in the night sky that we have not seen before.  Photographs reveal rainbow colors but to the naked eye they vary from white with blinking red/green lights, to amber shades on some others.  They are definitely not stars, some move faster than any aircraft could, some hover but moving slightly, some zigzagging, some left and right, some up and down.  Almost too many to describe.  We took over 500 pictures over 4 days and cannot make sense of any of it.<n>

But it just sat there in the same spot.  I was looking around thinking maybe it was just my eyes, when I noticed there were about 4 others just like it but further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while the first bright one we saw started moving towards us and slowly illuminated turning into a pale yellow color and got extremely bright!  It looked like a huge light almost an oval shape (imagine a headlight in the dark with a &#34;halo&#34; around it)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it sped up and moved across the sky above us (not as fast as a shooting star, but much faster than an airplane) and got further away it slowly turned red and soon got so far away it was out of sight.  The other 4 objects remained in the same spot as they were when we first saw them.  Soon, we went inside and that was the last we saw of the flickering objects.<n>

It was unbelievable!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The air craft then came to a complete stop and its red lights changed to green while it remained still hovering the same spot for about 2 minutes.

Then after being stable in the sky for about 2 minutes, it turned to reddish and started flying faster than a passenger plane towards north-west.  Then disappeared into the hazy sky while flying northwest.  Note that it passed next to a flying plane.<n>

It turned out that it was just the bright moon that evening that was producing the light through my sliding glass door.  At that point, I saw an orange ball of light in the sky when I was facing south-east towards Arters Mill Rd.  It was hovering over the tree line and was probably a mile or two from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was surprised that it was stationary given how strong the wind was that night and the coloring made it look like a small sun.  It was bright orange and really stood out in the clear sky.  I was so intrigued by what I was seeing, that I didn’t want to leave to try and get my camera that was on the other side of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a couple of minutes and at one point, it faded out quickly to black and then reappeared at full brightness.  About 30 seconds or so later, it just vanished so fast that it seemed like I was directly behind it because I saw no movement to either side of where the object was situated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what it was, but I’ve never seen anything like it before and there were no flashing beacon lights like helicopters and airplanes use.  It was circular in shape and it appeared that there was a red aura around part of it, but it was faint.  I live out in the country and am pretty much surrounded by farm land and some other houses a few acres away, so I’m not sure what could have produced that light.  I also did not hear any noise aside from the wind noise that evening.<n>

The deck faces NW.  The light was purposefully ambling along about several hundred feet above treetop level, and only 250 ft south from my position.  I was sure it was no regular flying object, as all I saw was the light.  I observed it for 10 seconds and it traveled to the horizon and was obscured by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting to confirm two previous reports from NC of the same object.

4/17/11 17:40|Miami|FL|Sphere|10 to 15 minutes|Appx  20 or more twinkling star like objects traveling north eastward over Miami on April 17, 2011.|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80924.html|132|ndxe201104| Appx  20 or more twinkling star like objects traveling north eastward over Miami on April 17, 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of  the 17th of April, 2011 at approximately 5:40pm I observed 3 small points of light in the sky just underneath very dark clouds.  At this time we were driving west bound on SW 88th St (Kendall Drive) and the objects were high in the sky.  Since we were driving home I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes later we arrived in front of our home, I ran out of the car to see if I would see the objects and found a spot  near the lake for a clear, unobstructed view.  It took me a few moments before I saw 3 star like objects in the sky headed in a north westerly direction.  They looked to be twinkling or flickering on and off and also seemed small and orb like.  As I stood there more and more began to appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions were very cloudy with dark to light grey clouds in the sky, but as you looked west it seemed to be clearing up and plenty of sun light was coming from the west.  I believe that the sky was clearing just over and around Shark Valley Everglades National Park.  I believe this is important because I realize now that this was most likely the cause of the objects appearing to twinkle or flicker.  They seamed to be metallic and able to reflect or shine light from this source.  In addition, I would like to mention, that it was not raining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction I was facing on the lake was north. At first all I saw were objects to the north that seem to just disappear  into the clouds once they hit the northerly point, but then I started to look further to the east and noticed that the objects would begin appearing exactly 90 degress from the north ( towards the east) and I was not able to track them coming in from further south. I also realized that the new local hospital was having its grand opening and started to think it might be metallic balloons from the hospitals grand opening.  Only problem was that these objects were traveling fast and appearing high in the sky in the east as a small twinkle and then, although small, as they traveled north east they would look slightly larger in size having enough mass I could more easily follow the objects.  Just to make it clear I was facing north and my arms spread to a 90 degree angle (left arm directly north, right arm east). I had to question myself about the possibility they were balloons and check myself, but I have seen runaway balloons and they were not.  The movement was steady and fast and they all seemed to travel along just right underneath the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects seemed to be coming from a distance near the turnpike (5.4 linear miles)  on Kendall Drive from my home and traveling north east towards the casino. I also noticed airplanes on their normal flight path over the everglades near the casino area heading towards Miami International Airport for landing. In comparison these objects, I believe, were much smaller making them appear farther. From the moment they appeared on the east to the moment they disappeared in the north it only took the objects 30 to 40 sec from point to point. Some of them looked to be traveling a bit faster than others at times. In total I saw approximately 20. Please also note I could not hear sounds from these objects like you would fighter planes. Near by is Homestead Air Force Base, but had these planes flown by you can easily see it’s a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the wind direction on-line at:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.usairnet.com/cgi-bin/Winds/Aloft.cgi?location=MIA&amp;hour=06&amp;course=azimuth<n> <n><n> <n><n> The winds at that moment and using a 6 hour forecast were all pointing east, from 3000 feet, and south east in higher elevations.  Had these been balloons they would be traveling against the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this has been helpful.  My 15 yr old son was with me and witnessed seeing some of these objects as well.  I am a 34 year old female that works in the admitting dept at a hospital neat Miami International Airport.  I&#39;ve had an interest in shows involving UFO&#39;s, but had never, till yesterday, seen what I believe were UFO&#39;s.<n>

The orb wasn't attached to anything.|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80946.html|135|ndxe201104| quiet jet and red orb flying low over San Tan Valley, Az at midnight. The orb wasn&#39;t attached to anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching television Sat nite 4-16-11 when I heard a very low flying jet getting closer.   went out in my back yard and looked up just as a jet, at only a few thousand feet, had passed my house traveling in a northerly direction.  ( Mesa Gateway airport,   formerly Williams Air Force Base, is about 10 miles from here to the northwest ) Flying along with the jet was a red orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thoughts were that this was the Anatov 225 (biggest plane in the world) sneaking into the airport to refuel without attracting attention with the red lite being on the craft that generally flys with it. I realized almost immediately that this could not be the case since the plane wasn’t nearly big enough to be the an 225 and the red orb was not attached to anything.  As I watched these continue north, the orb moved to the left of the jet, then  seemed to backtrack toward me.  I say “seemed to” because for a moment it appeared much larger than  when I first saw it as if it was! closer to me.  Thinking about this last night (4-18) it almost seemed, in retrospect, that the orb was aware of my presence and was checking me out.  It then  retreated back closer to the jet after this and after a few miles the jet banked to the west with the orb disappearing in a westerly direction over the rooftops.  The only sound heard was the relatively quiet jet engines and nothing else.  The only lights on the plane were a dim white light at the tip of each wing.( I couldn’t really see the plane due to the darkness but had the wings been visible the lites would’ve have been on the tips)  No landing lites, no strobes, just the dim lites above,  If you put my address in Google Earth you’ll see that my house is at the back of the development.  The plane and orb were traveling just inside the back edge of the development toward the north at a very low altitude.  Others in the neighborhood heard the plane also and were very surprised at the low altitude, though I was the only one to go outside and look.  It almost seemed that both objects were trying to get to where they were going while attracting as little attention as possible.  I’ve never seen a plane flying that low over these  houses, let alone at midnight on a Saturday!  I have no doubt that something out of the ordinary was going on.  The orb reminded me of one that I saw 2 nights running (Aug 8 &amp; 9 in  2009 except that was very high up in the sky.  That orb was reported on this site, as well as Mufon and ATS.<n>

At the time, it was around 11:45 PM, and I was sitting on the beach, facing to the west.  My sister and I both saw three lights in the shape of a triangle flying across the sky.   They flew by very fast and then disappeared into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were very surprised, and also excited to have seen UFOs for the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We plan to go back tonight and tomorrow night and watch for more lights.<n>

Although it looked like 3 separate lights, because they were so equally spaced and were moving together we all came to the conclusion that it was a dark coloured or black triangular-shaped craft (although we could not make this out) with a red light at each point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also several passenger planes travelling north to south as we are underneath a busy flight corridor, although the object we saw looked nothing like a plane (and made no sound).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They got close to the clouds toward the west and the clouds parted and I saw briefly what looked like a huge shadowy disk.  It didn’t seem to have much substance to it, just shadowy.  It was big enough to contain 50 full moons.  The clouds and the sun moved back over and I lost sight of it.  It was really strange.  I only was able to see it a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The morning of the full moon (April 18)  I took a picture of the moon setting over the mountains and when I uploaded it to my computer and looked at the picture there was the same looking huge disk, about 1:00 o’clock two inches (on the photo) above the full  moon, still very shadowy looking.  You have to move the screen on the computer to be able to see it. I remember watching Star Trek and it reminded me of something that was being &#34;cloaked&#34; I certainly can’t explain it but I saw what I saw and the photo captured disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was on the Colorado University Campus and lay down on a bench while on the phone with my friend and was just looking up at the sky when an airplane flew by and left a streak in the sky.  I landed my eye on that streak so I would have a point of reference and saw these 2 lights that were definitely above the airplane streak move. They both moved in a semi straight line, past the streak and then stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then spotted a third one moving toward the airplane streak, but it did not pass it. Those 3 lights lined up in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After spotting those, I tried to look for others, and thought I saw things moving, but the streak had faded, so I didn&#39;t know if my eyes were playing tricks on me. But I know that I saw those 3 lights move, and they were too far away to be a plane.  After a while, the lights very quickly moved upward and disappeared to my sight.  I&#39;m amazed that I was able to see something just by trying to look for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I just found this site and thought this would be a good place to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In early 2011 in Norman, Oklahoma, around midnight to one o’clock a.m., my son and I were up late talking.  My chair faced the patio doors, and as it was mild that night the blinds were open.  I noticed three lights in the distance, heading in the direction of my neighborhood.  Since Norman isn&#39;t far from Tinker AFB, I didn&#39;t think anything of it.  As we talked, over the course of several minutes the lights gradually came closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes, I told my son to come take a look for himself, they were moving really slowly, like a slow moving helicopter.  This was the course of about ten minutes.  We went outside, as the lights were getting very close, and extremely low.  Tree top level. It eventually passed over the house behind us, and over the house.  The craft was so low if we had thrown a rock, we could have hit it.  It was a huge, triangular shaped object, each point of the triangle was a bright whitish yellow light, the were not blinking, and were slightly rounded over. It appeared black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was about 45 to 50 feet wide, the right corner came directly over the roof of my garage, it made no sound, and caused no breeze as it passed.  As we watched the craft pass, I took a photograph of the object with my cell phone, and immediately called Tinker Air Force base to let them know, as it was moving in that general direction.  I was asked to describe the object, and then was told nothing was in the area, and they would look into it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, we saw three fighter jets in the area that broke off and headed in the direction of the craft.  No further contact was made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted the picture on my facebook page the next day, and then forgot about it.  A few weeks later, I was telling one of our friends about the incident.  I looked for the picture on my facebook page, and it was gone.  It had also disappeared from my phone.  I am currently attempting to recover the photo from old files, as I had loaded it onto my computer, and have since backed up my files several times.<n>

The weather was fine, no cloudiness nor precipitation. In the West something caught my eye and I stood looking in that direction a moment to identify what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small light, the size of a distant evening star, seemed to be moving.  As I stood watching it, the light became slightly larger and brighter. The object was moving toward my direction heading in a North East direction coming from the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home is in a darkened area, raised away from city lighting and surrounded by mountains.  All nature of planes fly constantly overhead as two airports are located in relatively close proximity, as well as the area of sky above our property is a fly zone for all aircraft.  I am a casual night sky observer, familiar with constellations and etc. and very familiar with observing shooting stars, satellites and all manner of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was coming in my direction, there was only a bright white light, no plane marker lights to be identified at that angle.  The pace/speed of the object was steady and constant and the light visibly growing larger and brighter the closer it came toward my property.  At this point in time I now suspected I was watching a satellite, as there was no sound, nor other usual plane markers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object reached the range of my property I was able to see clearly two separate objects.  Both bright white lights and flying in tandem, as you might see two fighter planes flying in tandem.  As the objects flew by I never took my eyes from them and turned my body in conjunction with the movement of the objects, so that as I saw them clearly I was now facing North.  The objects continued toward the East until out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire flight pattern of the objects was in the pattern of an arc, flying in from the west toward the northeast and flying out toward the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unlike a satellite, the objects flew very low in the sky and were both large, very bright, white lights with no other lights, neither flashing nor colored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither object had any kind of identifying shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unlike a shooting star, the objects did not have any other coloring except bright white, similar to the look of a larger bright star in the night sky.  There was no trail, no sparking, nothing to indicate that these objects were shooting stars.  Nor did they have the speed of a shooting star, as those “shoot” quickly past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their constant speed was similar to the steadiness of a satellite’s movement.  The altitude was similar to a low flying prop plane.   The speed was not as slow nor as ungraceful as a prop, it was smoother like a jet, but not as fast as a jet.  These objects moved quickly, but steadily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, from start to finish, there was not a single sound emitted before, during, nor after they disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

PD))|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81078.html|153|ndxe201104| 1 orb and two orbs that changed shape into moonlike objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> Picking up my daughter from school i see a white &#34;star&#34; in the sky.   Ive been seeing these ufos for over a year now so when i saw it i knew to run to my car and get my camera(that i carry with me all the time now).   On the way to the car i spot another brighter white star below i to the right.  So im looking back and fourth between my daughter(8yrs old) and the two white orbs, when out of thin air a third red orb appears to the right of the white orbs.  They are approaching my location from the east at about the speed of a small plane, at this point im running to my car for camera.  When i get my camera they are just about overhead, the first orb i spotted is quite faint and looks like a small star at a high altitude. The other two however, to my amazement, have changed thier shape.  They appear like two small crescent moons, one bright white the other bright red, and they are slowly spinning.  The spinning motion is not constant, the spinning is fast at times then! slow at other times, going one way then the other.  Both the red and white &#34;moons&#34; are spining but independently, at this point even my daughter is kinda freaking out.  The other star like one was still slightly off to the left of the two spinning &#34;moons&#34; but kinda just floated along with them from the east to the west.  So now these things are above me and i actually can see them in my cameras view finder.  I do get 8 pictures of the two spinning moon like objects and accidently get a 2sec video. When i got the pics home and inspected them closer i was excited, although the pics don&#39;t do the sighting justice some of the detail when zoomed in i could not see with the naked eye.  After seeing the detail ive concluded that they were not only spining they were changing shape. In the pictures you will see the two spining/changing ones, but the third starlike one was there above to the left out of view.  The sighting ended with the object flying over the homes/trees that i was standi! ng next to and out of sight. The only thing i would like to ad! d was as im on the sidewalk next to my daughter,taking pictures and both of us looking up, about a dozen kids with parents also leaving the school walked by me. Almost as amazing as the ufos flying above my head was that NOT ONE person asked me what we were taking pictures of or even bothered to look up to see what i was looking at for almost 5 min. This truly disturbed me, i wanted to scream look up, but it just felt awkward so i didn&#39;t. In retrospect i wish i would have tho.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the objects are clusters of balloons.  PD))<n>

I was just simply taking the trash out threw it away turned around and looked up a beautiful clear night sky tonight.  I was refreshed being outside as I stared into the still sky when suddenly what first seemed like a star began to travel vertical slooooow in the sky around 68 degrees up horizon toward ursa major  (I know a lil bout constellations) ...!  it was a soft peach light. it ascended for what seemed about 4 seconds and 18 degrees in my line of sight. surged possible a lil brighter just before it swwwwosh !  took off in a second! like a shooting star right to left!!!!!!!  it had to be 25 degrees lateral in my sky view...  the distance it &#34;tailed&#34;/ streaked was akin to a shooting star and I would had dismissed it like a meteor show except for that I witnessed before that portion of the experience...  the vertical slow &#34;controlled&#34; ascension then to veer like it did is unexplainable to me growing up an GE hornet aircraft engineer&#39;s son.

At first I thought it was a plane with it’s landing lights on traveling through a fog layer.  This sighting occurred next to our local airport.  After watching it for a few minutes the light appeared to fade but the hazy aura around the light remained.  During the time I had been watching it, it had traveled east in the southern sky.  When this phenomenon was due south of where I was standing, I started looking at it with binoculars.  What I saw was a nebulous cone shaped cloud that glowed in the night sky. The blunt end of the cone was pointed east with the tapered end pointed west.  A short distance behind the cone shaped cloud was a perfectly spherical orb. On the east side of the orb, were waves radiating out in the direction of the cloud.  I couldn’t judge the speed or the altitude of this sighting, although it looked quite high, a mile or two, and traveled at ! a speed of a fast plane.  I don’t believe it was weather related or a natural phenomenon.  It didn’t look like anything I have ever seen before nor do I have a clue as to what it was.<n>

At first I thought it was a meteorite but was moving to slow. as it got closer i noticed a orange vapor trail shaped almost like an angel fish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friend from inside the house to come out and she saw it as well.   the UFO was getting closer it suddenly disappeared along with the orange vapor trail.  It was invisible for about 5 seconds then was visible again for about 5 more seconds then disappeared again.  My best guess for altitude is possibly 30,000 feet and going about four to five times faster than the jets I see come over the mountain to land at the Palm Springs airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I&#39;ve seen a UFO.  I can&#39;t saw what shape the craft was only that the gas trail was the dominating visual.  I still have an adrenaline rush going after seeing this thing.  I shot video with my iphone but I&#39;m not sure I got it.

I think it was at an altitude of 5 to 6 thousand feet high but it was hard to tell. My first thought was that it was a large meteor streaking in the sky but it didn&#39;t look to be descending at all. I thought it looked like a meteor because it was the color of fire and very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was totally silent. I ran across the yard and told my mom to &#34;come quick I see a UFO&#34;. Before she could get out side the object changed direction from coming directly to me and started moving toward the west over the ocean. As it moved it began to diminish in intensity and started to move faster. My mom and I began to try to explain what it could possibly be but it was clear it fit no identifiable explanation. As it continued to move westward it began to blink out then it would flare up again. It did this 3 or 4 times then just didn&#39;t come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared  my mom and I noticed that there was an unusually large number of airplanes in the sky. As we were looking around at the airplanes and commenting on the blinking lights and the differences from what we saw we noticed another strange light that didn&#39;t look like the other airplanes going almost directly over us heading north. As it got closer we noticed it was also totally silent and was a large triangle shaped craft (TR3-B I believe). We watched it continue slowly right over our heads and went directly over the mountains to our north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs.

I say a bright orange egg shaped object that looked like it had a huge fire ball coming from the back of it.  The object looked like it came from the Elk Hills Petroleum Reserve.  For a couple of seconds it looked like it was still so I thought they were just burning off natural gas. Suddenly the object started moving from North West to a South East direction.  The object looked to be flying very low, starting at about 500ft then increasing altitude as it flew South East.  The object was not flying that fast.  At one point, I drove underneath the object.  As the object flew South East, the orange glow went disappeared but the object was still there.  After a couple of seconds of the orange glow disappeared, the object disappeared also.  I know how this sounds, but I can guarantee that this object was not an airplane or a rocket of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs.

We looked up at the south south west night sky and noticed an orange orb.  It was 3 times bigger than commercial airliners that you would see flying at its highest point in the sky.  We watched it as it was staying in the same spot and then it started emitting a very small trail and a haze of orange as it started moving slowly east. It then instantly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple seconds later it reappeared instantly in the spot it disappeared.  Another couple seconds went by and it disappeared again instantly.  We never heard it making a sound during the whole 7 minute sighting.  We watched for another 30 minutes to see if it would reappear again but it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in between China Lake military base and Lemoore Navel Air Station and see jets fly back and forth between bases all the time.  There is also a small airport near by and see planes landing.

It was a clear night with no clouds in the sky and a bright moon. Whatever we saw that night was not a plane.  It had no characteristics of the other planes in the sky like flashing lights or turning on white head lights on a descent to land.

At that time we both spotted a very large orange glowing light directly west of us approximately 800 to 1000 ft in the air. We both watched silently as it seemed to sit still for about 10-15 seconds. At first I thought it was a massive gas flare that we often see at the elk hills oil and gas facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had realized that this object was too high to be a natural gas flare. The large round orange object appeared to be hovering above the southwest corner of the elk hills oilfield near the elk hills power generation facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sitting still for 10-15 seconds, the object began to gain altitude moving south east while it gained altitude. As it gained altitude the orange light got extremely brighter. At this point I noticed some vehicle pulling over to view the object. As we passed Elk Hills road the object was directly over us still climbing. The objects bright orange then faded to light orange then to a light blue. The object then disappeared. The object did not fade out, it disappeared in an instance. At the time the object disappeared we had pulled over on midway road and were looking east to see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs.

Visibility was excellent.  There was a ¾ moon overhead.   I was looking WSW and saw, approaching from the west, two sets of lights which I assumed were transiting aircraft as this area is a busy air traffic corridor.  Flight separation between the two was approximately 2000 ft.  I quickly discerned that the lead, faster moving object was NOT a normal aircraft.  It appeared to be a slow moving meteor.  There was a bright light emanating from the nose and a whitish orange fan-shaped &#34;tail&#34; coming from the aft of the craft.  The movement was steady to slightly accelerating.  I figured the craft was at 2-4 thousand feet AGL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This strange craft overtook the other set of lights which was, by all appearances, a small general aviation craft such as a Cessna 172.  I say that by the pattern of the anti-smash lights and the familiar drone of the engine and also the approach path as it appeared inbound to the local airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to observe the &#34;slow meteor&#34; as it approached and noticed the fan-shaped tail took on an orange to greenish hue.  If my guess to altitude is correct I’d estimate ths corona-like tail was 2-3 hundred yards in length.  The fan shape of the tail was oriented vertically and the width of this plume was narrow.  The color was something like mixing a sodium vapor lamp and the color of copper being burned.  There was no pulsing or flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 seconds of watching, and as it approached it seemed to accelerate and begin ascending.  Then the nose and tail lights extinguished.  I SAW the object at CPA (I was facing due South at its closest point of approach).  It was no more than a mile to the south of where I stood.  It was small, dark and obloid, or, football shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it emitted a brief puff of hazy orange light and accelerated to an incredible speed while slowly ascending.  It was out of eye-sight within a quarter second after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound.  This was unsettling to me as I would have expected to hear it as this mountain pass area traps and funnels noise quite readily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total sighting lasted 20-30 seconds.  I have to assume that the general aviation pilot saw what I saw and I’m writing this in hopes of corroborating stories.   If it WAS a meteor I’d like to report an ascending meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little background on myself:  I was a Naval Aircrewman for 21 years.  I flew in several airframes and have thousands of flight hours of experience.  I’ve seen many strange things while flying and my share of meteors.  I am not taken to having flights of fancy.  I was fatigued but sober and otherwise in a calm state of mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs. (Pacific).  PD))<n>

The airport was to my right (east).   At this point, I figured that a small plane was going in for a landing except that as it came closer towards me (in the direction of the airport landing strips), it stopped abruptly!  The object seemed odd to me in that it was the size of a helicopter but the lights on in were in a triangle shape.  Red lights stayed on and white lights blinked (strobe like)…I rolled my window down thinking I would be able to hear it, if it was in fact a helicopter.  No such sounds, actually, there weren’t any sounds, which is very odd considering its proximity to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I slowed down considerably…to watch.  Once the object stopped in midair, it made a quick movement backwards for a short distance, then forward again.  Now I am really freaking out, I haven’t ever seen anything move like that.  I came upon my turn, pulled into a parking lot and when I looked back to see if the object was still there, it wasn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I finished I turned facing west and I noticed a large unusually bright red glowing light just across the street over some buildings.  At first I thought it was an airplane light since the air traffic around here is pretty steady.  I quickly realized this was no plane; the light was extraordinarily bright, never flickered and seemed to be rapidly approaching me.  It was coming eastbound very quickly and it was very low.  I began to run towards it across the parking lot to try to make out what it was but the light was so bright that’s all I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the object it was a ball of light but as it came closer I saw it in its profile and it appeared as a long continuous red glowing cigar shape.  It was only about a football field away from me to my left and it was flying over the train yard located across from valley blvd.  I then noticed a helicopter flying westbound (I believe it was an Industry Sheriff helicopter) and the object quickly shrank back into a ball shape.  It was as if the object was playing chicken with the helicopter, I almost thought they were going to collide or that the object would attack because it was so low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the helicopter and object passed each other, the object flew over the helicopter and was probably less than 30 meters above it from my estimation, the object threw out a red almost force field like crescent moon shaped illumination towards its front end.  It completely lit the sky up around it and in doing so it revealed itself. It seemed like a ball of mercury, it was silverish and perfectly round.  The light shown for a few seconds and quickly faded into nothing although I could still see the circular object, as if it were driving with the lights out and there seemed to be very small electrical charges going off in front of it and I literally watched it fade into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I bet anything that the pilots in that chopper saw it too; there is no way they couldn’t have.  It was heading right for them and when it threw that red field out I know it illuminated the inside of their chopper.  So unreal I&#39;m still in complete awe…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs. (Pacific).  PD))<n>

On April 14, 2011, I was leaving work about 8 pm.  I had called my husband with my cell phone and had him on speaker so he could  &#34;walk&#34; me to my car.  It was already dark outside and my car is parked in the rear parking lot of my business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking south towards my car, I noticed that the school located across the street had its field lit up.  Directly above the glow of those lights above the field, there was a formation that looked at first like birds when they are in the V pattern.  As it got closer it grew brighter &amp; brighter until I realized those weren’t birds, but lights in a very distinct V flying directly overhead, just slightly east of where I was standing.  I remember 2 rows of 4 lights (7 total).  I was shouting on the phone for my husband to run outside and go up onto our deck to try to see what I was seeing.  I remember there was no sound whatsoever.  I was shaking, as I could not believe my eyes.  The entire experience lasted approximately one minute from the time I saw it come into view, fly across &amp; vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went further towards the north towards Vegas, it simply vanished one light at a time.  My husband was still on the phone with me and both he and my son were up on the deck looking for what I had just witnessed.  They saw nothing.  I have no idea if anyone else in Lake Havasu saw what I saw too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so shaken up by the event that I forgot to load my laundry hamper into the back of my car and drove off without it.  I immediately called my mother and told her about it on my way home.  I didn’t really know what to do or who to report it to until I did a little more investigating on the Internet today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this information helps in some way.<n>

The shape was hard to see since the light was fading.  It was bright white on the top and blue, red and white lights were flashing under the craft in random.  It slowly moved within the two hours backwards until the mountain obscured it.  My husband also observed the craft.  There was no noise from it but we were miles away.  The spot it hovered was about ½ mile from the Forest Service Tower.  I knew this because I work for the F.S. and knew the exact location of the tower.  As it continued to move I could tell it was moving backwards away from our location at our house over the mountain since it diminished in size.  Again no noise and it was such a clear night and we have a flight pattern over our house and see many planes lights at nights.  It could not have been a helicopter as we heard no noise and we hear so clearly every plane or helicopter in our area very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I had a glass of milk and headed back to bed when I had a feeling I should go take a look at the sky.  I am a private researcher and have been since the early 70’s.  When I walked outside I was facing NE and I noticed a very bright object coming out of the NW and heading SE, it was fairly low in the sky and I immediately thought it was the ISS.  I grabbed my binoculars and yes after viewing the object I knew from past experience that it was the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then I turned to face W and I looked straight up.  Immediately, I noticed another bright object then another, then another.  These objects were glowing blue in color through my binoculars.  They were initially coming from the South and heading North, I followed them maybe 20 degrees in the sky and they all, in formation changed course and headed in an Easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects made no sound and were spaced in a diagonal line, far enough apart that I could only see two at a time in the field of view of my binoculars.  I kept shifting from binocular view to naked eye view to make sure that I was actually seeing three objects.  I continued to watch them as they eventually went out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly enough I retrained my view back directly overhead and once again, I saw another object.  This one was also coming from the south and heading north.  This object was also blue and gaging by my view through the binoculars it seemed to be the same but at a higher altitude.  Just as I began to think that this one was a satellite, it began to change its course to follow the three that had just passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the satellite charts online and the only satellite confirmed at that time was the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sightings have been occurring on a fairly regular basis here.  The only difference is that I usually see the orange orbs.  I am going to check with the local press to see if there are any other reports to follow.<n>

We went outside and stood around looking at the stars for about 10 minutes.  When we went to go inside, out of the corner of my eye I saw movement in the sky.  At first I thought it was a satellite, but then two more lights appeared.  The formation was that of a scalene triangle, and the formation didn&#39;t waiver at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew from South-Southwest to North-Northeast in a steady speed.  It flew directly over our house and made no sound at all.  We watched it for about 5 minutes until it faded from view.  It&#39;s hard to tell how big it was because it looked like it was high up.  After having been in the Air Force for almost 9 years, and having been around aircraft for over 30 years I can tell you that I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in my life.  The feeling we got from watching it was one of excitement and awe.  I&#39;ve seen satellites in the past, but never have I seen them in a constant patterned formation like what we observed.<n>
4/14/11 03:08|Falls Church|VA|Light||Object chased by military jets|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80922.html|178|ndxe201104| Object chased by military jets<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late last night (on or about 3:08 a.m., 04/14/11) I stepped outside for a smoke.  All of a sudden I heard an increasing in volume thunderous roar, approaching from the north-west.  This made me look up. It sounded like military jet with the pilots really pushing the pedal to the metal.  I did not see the jets, but it sounded like the ones I saw flying over Andrews Airforce base in Maryland.  Commercial jets do not sound anything like that and fly much higher.  (I see a lot of them, since I live about 15 minutes away from Dulles International Airport).  These jets seemed to be flying pretty low and I have never seen or heard them flying over at this time of night - never.  I looked up to see what is making all that noise, but did not see the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, panning the skies from west to south, I saw what looked like a very bright large star, crossing the sky from west to south in the south-western quadrant of the sky. It had the same bluish-white tint to it that the stars do. The line of sight was at about 30 degrees angle to the ground. I could not judge the distance and did not see any shape that might have been associated with the object, but it crossed the sky in under 10 seconds and disappeared behind the trees I have to the south of my house. The strangest thing about the object was that it was blinking in a very peculiar manner. Commercial jets have red and green light, blinking continuously without interruption. This thing was bluish-white, would blink 3 times within approximately 1 second, then would stop blinking all together for a second, then blink 3 times within approximately 1 second again, then stop blinking for a second, etc., during the whole 10 seconds or so it took it to cross the visible to me sout! h west quadrant of the sky. These was no noise at all coming from the UFO directing - the roar I heard was rapidly approaching from the north - west. As I said before, the UFO disappeared behind the trees in about 10 seconds, but I kept hearing the roar for another 5 minutes or so. Sounded like the jets kept flying around. Then everything went silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Half an hour later the roar came back, but I was already in bed and did not run outside to see what was going on. It would not do any good anyhow, since the speed with which the object moves - it would have been gone by the time I got out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got up and came to work, had to tell someone what I saw. I told the story to a security guard that I am friendly with and he said that he lives right near Andrews Airforce Base and he heard they scrambled jets several times last night, which, according to him, they never do at night. He thought someone might have flown into Washington DC no-fly zone or something. This confirms my suspicions that the roar I heard was military jets. The object could not have been a satellite. I have seen those and they do not blink, do not fly at 30 degrees angle above the horizon and do not get chased by the military jets because the jets cannot fly that high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequently I found out that there were two other reports filed by people from the same area filed with the MUFON CMS pretty much describing the same thing I saw.<n>

4/13/11 19:15|Detroit|MI|Rectangle|About 25 minutes|Rectangular object hovering over downtown Detroit-Windsor area during daylight hours.|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81067.html|183|ndxe201104| Rectangular object hovering over downtown Detroit-Windsor area during daylight hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Wednesday, April 13th, 2011, at several minutes after 7pm, I left a friend’s home in Taylor, near the crossing of Telegraph Rd. and Van Born St.  It did not take me long to get back to the highway from her house, after only a very short trip on main roads, a quick gas fill-up at the pump using my card, and then a lengthy stop at a red light, which I suspect puts the sighting at around 7:10 to 7:20 when it began, and lasted for approximately 20-25 minutes in full, though it was not completely visible for me that entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drive a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire, and my sketches include features from my perspective while sitting in my vehicle.  I was driving alone with a cell phone which was packed away in a bag in my passenger seat, and because my dashboard clock does not work, I was unsure of the exact time.  I have no camera phone or other recording device, so I had to document and sketch it from memory.  To my knowledge, there were no other witnesses, although other people were driving on the same road and able to see the same thing, though none seemed to notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On eastbound I-94 in metro Detroit, near the Southfield Highway intersection, while the interstate is significantly above ground level enough to see the object hovering near the horizon, I caught sight of what I first believed was a banner of some sort, like those trailing behind airplanes (aerial advertising).   Then I realized that this object’s relative position to me and lack of motion meant that there was no plane tugging a banner along, and I surely couldn’t spot a plane of any form near the object.  As I continued to drive, I had to fight with looking over or past other obstacles to my vision while still driving at high speeds during traffic; I did well with this, and there was luckily no danger involved during this period of time.  As I think back on it, I only wish I would have had the foresight to pull off the interstate to a main road where the object was still visible, and to watch it as long as I could.  However, I never came to the conclusion that I was the only eyewitness to this object, and surely I would see some news of it when I arrived home.  If I had the chance again, I would watch it until it left my sight on its own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got better and better glances at the object, I continued to move along the highway, making my way for I-75, my ultimate route back home.  At one point, I was angled so that it was visible in my passenger-side window in my direct view, with no obstacles, and showing me clearly that it was not attached to anything, and it was unlike anything I had previously seen or ever heard about here on Earth.  Though I was clearly astonished at the sight of it, I was intent on getting back home, and though I was continuously debunking my own skeptical ideas of what Earthly craft this could be, I was instinctively sure that someone somewhere was getting press coverage of this event at that very moment, and I should get home and watch the news on TV and the net.  Later, when I arrived home, I learned there was no news, no sightings on the TV or internet, and wished I would have taken action then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I have seen tethered balloons used as advertising, I even thought maybe it could be something like that, but the better glances I got, the more and more skeptical of my own skepticism I became.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having the object in my sights at several points on I-94, I wasn’t quite sure of where it was, or how far away it was, and therefore – how large the object might have been.  It was very difficult to discern its exact size and location, and only after looking at a Google Map of the area was I able to determine approximately where it could have been located.  Based on those figures, I would guess the craft could have been anywhere from 300 feet to a mile or more in width, and about one-quarter that in height.  If I had ever seen a rectangular blimp (an object that could hover for extended periods of time, such as this object did), I would believe this could be a blimp, but the whole concept of a rectangular aerial craft defies the use of aerodynamics used in the craft’s design in order to adequately fly the thing around during an event – this object was clearly rectangular or perhaps even more of a parallelogram, but it had relatively angular and obvious corners, with two pair! s of parallel sides.  When I first spotted the object, I could have sworn it was angled diagonally, making me think it was a banner being pulled by an airplane, though it could have been the curvature of my windshield, since I was looking between the windshield and the passenger-side window, leaning back and forward, ducking my head down and then trying to peer over – all because it was positioned somewhat behind the car frame bar between those two windows, giving me a pretty precise angle of my first sighting of it, as well as future angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I merged on to northbound I-75, I could see the object still in my rear-view and side mirrors, though my curving driving motion made it difficult to keep in my sight at all times.  Then, while on a straight path on the interstate, I got a very clear sighting of it in my rear-view mirror, as well as my side mirror, both separately for several seconds, enough to pinpoint a general location relative to my own position.  I have included drawings of these perspectives in my report, showing the object as it was situated in my view in both mirrors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still rather bright daylight outside, with the low sun nearly set, and making the colors of the sky begin to be more vibrant, giving off rosy pink tones and yellow hued light on most things reflecting it.  There were no stars visible yet, and the sky was not really dark enough for them in any location.  There were few clouds, and the ones present were very far away and thin, not having much mass or density.  No other objects appeared as solid and obvious as this one.  I could see no Earthly craft, such as planes, helicopters, or jets.  When I first glimpsed the object it was positioned in a location where it was made somewhat darker, appearing as a muted magenta or deep reddish mauve, and by the time it was positioned clearly in my window it had brightened because of the sun’s light, falling on it and the rest of the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my side window is where I caught the best glimpse of the object, and is the view I remembered when making my color renditions.  I mostly remember how the light reflected off it: it was solid, a different color than the sky, and reflected the colors of the sunset and sky, though not as if it were “shiny” so much as it was solid and had mass that caught the unique sky colors.  It did not seem to have any writings, markings, or other significant or relevant identifiers, and it not produce light, phenomena, or effects such as that.  I cannot be sure if it was silent or audible, since I was driving in a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In full, the sites where/when the object was visible were around the Southfield Highway/I-94 intersection, for several miles, and then it was no longer visible because of the elevation of the highway for a large portion of the remaining distance to I-75.  However, it began to be visible again as I could overlook the city of Detroit from the ramp between I-94 E and I-75 N.  By the time I was heading north on I-75, it was visible in my mirrors.  I have attached a map that I got using Google Maps and adding in where I was located when I spotted the object.  Though I placed myself after Southfield Highway on my trip when I first spotted it, when I took another trip on the same route to be sure of my sighting locations, I realized that it may have been before I passed this intersection that I remember being one of my landmarks.  After driving on I-75 for some distance, I was considering getting off the highway and parking somewhere I might be able to view the object, but by that ! time I had a difficult time trying to see it, and figured it best to simply make it home and watch the news.  That was about 1-2 miles before the Davison Freeway (M-8, I believe), ending my active sighting.  I never stayed to see what the craft did, where it went, etc.  I now wish I would have parked to stay and watch it as adamantly as I did while driving on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not seem to move, or moved incredibly slowly as if hovering, and though I could not be sure of its absolute motion or stillness due to my own driving motion, I can easily say that it did not change locations much based on the angles at which I could view it – it must have been hovering or moving incredibly slowly for an extended period of time, and no airplane could have done what it did.  As shown in one of my sketches, I broke down to myself why it could not be an airplane (with a banner or without), a simple helicopter, a military helicopter, or simple blimp, and was left with no options to my knowledge.  After extensive discussion with others as to what I could have been witnessing, the discussions have only proven to show me more ways in which the object that I witnessed was operating and was constructed unlike anything known to myself or the general public.  If it’s man-made, it isn’t publicly accessible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine suggested that perhaps it was a Harrier jet (sp?) because they are capable of flying in one relative position for a short period, however another friend of mine who was in the US army in Iraq for three years said that that kind of jet would never hang out in one position for as long as I described, and would use a lot of fuel just to do that, while also making a loud noise that I would have heard even over my vehicle’s engine.  Lastly, though a jet is angular, this object did not have enough angles to make it a jet – only four angles, and they were simple corners.  Another friend supported my blimp theory by saying that that evening was the first night of the Red Wings play-offs, and could have been a blimp used to record the area from an aerial view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited to write this report in order to do some decent sketches and digital renditions of what I witnessed.  Having finished them but still seeing no coverage of the object on local media, I was about to give up my urges to report it and move on to other issues in life.  Then I saw this article (http://www.examiner.com/ufo-in-national/rectangle-ufo-appeared-a-liquid-state-over-texas?fb_comment=32512566) which described an object spotted in Texas that sounded as if it appeared similar to what I saw here in my own state.  After realizing that this thing may have made a re-appearance elsewhere, I knew I had to reveal my sighting to the world the right way.<n>

It had different colored lights on it and was very obviously not a star. The object had very bright blue lights on it.  It began as a stationary object. It moved in a few different directions(dart to the left or right then halt, move in zigzags).  Every once in a while, it seemed like it was pulsating light, almost like a heart beat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, still seeing that object, we notice a smaller, much more dim light appear and they started heading towards each other!  They looked like they were going to collide.  But, when they &#34;collided,&#34; the Blue One came to a complete stop.  No slowing down, just an immediate stop.  And the small one was gone, we never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the night we encountered a couple of &#34;stars&#34; that would take a U Turn and seem to disappear into the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 AM:  By this time, we were seeing at least 3 large ones, like the blue one that had been moving all night. The 3 big ones formed a perfect triangle, at a distance from each other.  There was a blue, an orange, and a white.  Every once in a while they would do the same thing with the colliding star from different directions.  We also noticed there was a large amount of airplanes in the area. We would see at least 3 in the sky at a time flying close to the objects.  The planes came from all different directions and the number of them increased as the number of moving UFOs was rising.  A plane seemed to get really close to the top white object, and very quickly it shot a very short distance toward the plane and you could see a “tail” on it almost, it looked like it was threatening the plane.  We could see sometimes other things moving and appearing/disappearing.  Things we also saw included helicopter-like objects.  They looked like a helicopter, maybe.  There was 3 spotted at this t! ime.  Eventually, the blue and orange objects were out of sight completely.  At that point, about 1 AM, everything stopped moving. Or at least it looked like it to us. There was still a few planes in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 AM:  One more star seems to move sporadically, and yes, it is another object.

We took the next off ramp to turn around and get a better look at it but when we got back on the freeway the object in the sky was gone.  If it had been any type of plane or helicopter we would still have been able to see it in motion as it was leaving the area.  The speed in which this thing disappeared was not any type of technology that is of this earth, that’s for sure.  There was no sound that we heard coming from this object nor was the dirt on the ground below being disturbed in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw last night, again in the Antelope Valley, CA, had the same very bright lights on each corner defining it as being a triangular shape.  I did not see lights lining an underneath cavity this time around.  We were parked while the triangle shaped object moved closer to us.  Just as it reached the point of being right in front of us, it changed direction in a split second.  No airplane or helicopter can change direction like that without having to swoop around first so we knew this was not an ordinary earthly object.  Just after changing direction it shot off at what I would say was light speed and disappeared into thin air.  Again there was no sound that I heard even though the object was very low and not too far away from where we were parked. Without a doubt I know I saw for a second time, a UFO.<n>

About one month ago, I witnessed this same event and had convinced myself that I was seeing things.  But tonight (I smoke outside which is why I am outside a lot), I know what I saw.  The first time it happened - one month ago, the only difference was the light traveled from west to east (facing south).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am anxious now to know whether anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for having this website available for public use.<n>

This activity continued for about 10-20 minutes before disappearing behind the trees out of my view.  When I first saw this, I was sitting in my truck talking on the telephone.  I then hung up with the person I was talking to and called my wife outside.  We both watched this for about five minutes before we lost sight.  Now I live close to a military branch ( Fort A.P. Hill).  So this could very well be some kind of new technology our government is working with.  I have never seen anything like this and is wondering if there is some kind of explanation?  The Camera on my cell phone could not pick it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/12/11 19:00|New Boston|TX|Unknown|15 minutes|One craft becomes three, and leaves trail.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90355.html|193|ndxe201104| One craft becomes three, and leaves trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In April of 2011 I was leaving a friends house in rural North East Texas.  I came to the end of his road, and was about to merge onto F.M. 1840 to head back to my apartment.  I looked to the left looking for traffic, and looked up into the sky.  There was something making a contrail in the sky, and I looked at it for a few seconds wondering if it was going to be a contrail, or a chemtrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, was very high up, and, as such, I could not make out what it was.  As I watched it it broke apart.  For a moment I thought something bad had happened, and I was witnessing a plane breaking apart, and crashing.  Instead of crashing it, for lack of a better term, did a maneuver.  It was like it broke apart, and two of the units did this cork-screw maneuver.  It went from one solid unit flying across the sky to three units flying across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the one contrail became three parallel contrails racing across the sky.  I didn&#39;t have my camera on me, so I put it in first gear, and raced home.  I&#39;m surprised that I didn&#39;t run off the road, as I keep an eye on the sky watching the three craft race across the sky leaving contrails in their wake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got to my apartment the craft were disappearing from the sky, and by the time I ran upstairs, found my camera, and got back down stairs they were gone from my field of view.  I took several photos of the contrails from my apartment parking lot, but the sun had sunk so low, and directly in the path of where the craft separated from one to three, so you can&#39;t really see the maneuver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know where to send my photos at the time, so I posted them on a military forum.  I wanted to see if some military guys knew if this was a standard military aircraft maneuver, but I didn&#39;t get any constructive feedback.  I am emailing them to you as soon as I finish this.  Thank you for looking at them, and I welcome any feedback.  Please contact me by email only at this time.<n>

A bird fly&#39;s really low behind me to my right so I look to the right.  Which is south and i&#39;m facing east where the sun rises from.  I see this really big bright metallic elongated disc looking thing.  I had to turn away because the reflection of the sun on this thing hurt my eyes.  I look back with my hand trying to shade my eyes from the reflection and see this thing still there only for like a second before it just disappears. It made no noise at all the whole time.  So I finish my cigarette and see two air planes get kind of close to each other.  One small plane heading south and one larger commercial air liner heading east. The eastward plane seemed to fly into some invisible haze.  The sky was blue with no clouds in the area. The plain was still somewhat visible and I could hear the both planes like I normally do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

A day after the event in question, several USAF reconnaissance flight over the area in Carrollton, Texas witnessed.  Following this event,  a severe thunderstorm and hail storm reported including a massive forest/county fire report, culminating with ~200 tornado touchdowns. Recent weather, doppler /radar report showed a gigantic trail of concentrated thunderstorm cloud strip expanding toward the northern territories of the United States, dissipating out toward the Atlantic ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The captured scenes show a huge steak or trail of cloud expanding toward the northern territory, hundreds of miles and miles. Midst of these strange cloud phenomena, there are some unique “image” or unidentifiable flying objects.  In particular, an object near over my head in the sky, an object bigger or as big as the sun, is clearly visible on the digital video. After reviewing the video several times, I personally concluded that there exists more than one UFO because there are some obscure objects with shaded geometrical shapes and lines  in/around the huge streak of cloud against bluish sky background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The  pictures and videos of April/2011 UFO(s) consist of:  Several pictures during a sunset following a strange cloud formation  Some night videos of flying “star” alike object followed by a close footage of our airplane flying by  this shows the depth and distance of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	Several daylight videos of this gigantic trail of strange cloud with UFO’s This report will be my first formal written UFO sightings report.

I dont suspect it to be a meteor as it had no tail and did not illuminate the night sky, as well as airport/city lights make star and meteor gazing difficult.

I just happened to be looking out at the sky when I observed 3 large white orbs stacked vertically in a tight formation.  They were travelling east to west at a very high rate of speed.  The lights were round and bright white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw them I was looking northeast and watched as they crossed in front of me, now looking north and watched as they headed northwest, disappearing out of sight looking west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Kennewick, along the river, and from my viewpoint the angle of height was approximately 30 degrees.  From my viewpoint, looking east, where I first saw it, to looking west, where they disappeared.  Horizontally, the angle was approximately 100 degrees of view.  It took approximately 10 seconds from the time they first came into view until the time they disappeared.  I noted that the bright white lights never blinked like an aircraft would.  Nor were there any jet engine sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects appeared to be close to where my house is and appeared to be following the Columbia River at a low altitude and a very high rate of speed.  My view was unobstructed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I certify this to be true and correct under penalty of perjury.<n>

This was no aircraft, they don&#39;t behave like that.  Years ago I saw one just to our east, way late at night, slowly moving, then hauling ass south to the Columbia River then straight up and gone.  Nothing of this earth moves that fast.<n>

We both noticed what appeared to be three bright horizontal lights low hovering above the road east of us.  The lights were like very bright car headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving and when I turned onto Game Farm Road, the lights were there.  My passenger said, &#34;What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the airport is about 2 miles away, at first I thought at first was a small plane coming to the airport.  But since it did not appear to be moving, I quickly ruled that idea out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were there for at least 3 or 4 minutes (for the time it took for me to drive from Phenning Road to Wilson Creek Road).  We turned north on Wilson Creek Road and the lights were still low in the horizon to the east, appearing to be very near and low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights disappeared suddenly after a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see the lights again, but have been thinking of them since wondering what I saw.<n>

I wish I could contact you to compare sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting occurred in 04/2011, as I was visiting my sister.  I was about midway between Dallas and Fort Worth and about 4 miles south of the DFW Airport.  As I did often, I was sitting on my sister’s patio, early in the night, watching the aircraft going in and out of DFW.  While watching the aircraft it was not unusual to see an occasional satellite cruising across the sky.  On this, forever memorable night, I was on the patio talking on the phone with a friend of mine in Houston.  I remarked to my friend on the phone, “hey Greg I can see a satellite moving across  the sky.”  It was no sooner than I had said that when I dropped the phone on the concrete surface of the patio, breaking the cover off of it.  The assumed satellite I was watching had come to a complete stop.  It remained motionless for about 3 seconds before tearing across the sky at a right angle from it’s former position and covering about one-third of the sky in less than a second.  The object made 4 or 5 more similar maneuvers, all at 90 degree angles from it last position before moving in a straight line and disappearing.  The speed at which this thing moved was incredible, moving across large portions of the sky in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking about the sighting in the future, it was almost as if the object was surveying the DFW Airfield.  The next day I was at a local restaurant talking with a friend of mine who recently retired from the FAA.  I, of course told him the story, expecting to see a surprised expressing on his face.  When I finished the story he finally turned to look at me and said, “(expletive) Steve, our pilots tell us (expletive) like that all the time.”  Ha!  I felt cheated; as though the most profound experience of my life was suddenly made quite commonplace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There has never been any doubt about what I saw.  I only regret that I was alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had screamed for my sister and brother-in-law, but when they arrived, the incident was over.  I am very gratified I have your forum to share this with people who have had similar experiences.  I have no doubt that this object was manufactured, was controlled by intelligent operators and was not in the realm of any technology that I am have heard of.  I hope the person from Kennewick, WA will read this.  Their prior report certainly affirmed my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

They all came together as one, conformed, and shot back in opposite directions. They were pretty low to the ground.  Airplanes are typically much higher.  The three objects were traveling extremely fast and disappeared into the sky eventually.  From research, I learned that there is a naval base it Great Lakes, IL, which is about ten miles from the sighting, so this could be a possibility.  However, I don&#39;t understand the motive behind what happened if it was Navy organized.  The triangular flashed red and yellow very quickly as they moved together and until they disappeared.  I got a vague glimpse at one of them as they passed, and it was nothing like I&#39;ve ever seen before.  Not an airplane, helicopter, or anything of that nature.  A UFO sighting or something else?<n>

It was moving North to South when I first noticed it and after about 30-45 seconds it immediately changed direction heading East South East and appeared to be increasing in altitude.   There were no flashing lights, it slowly got smaller until it dimmed out and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore leading me to believe it was increasing in altitude.  I decided to report it because I haven&#39;t seen aircraft quite that high up and the closest to that altitude that I have seen them the flashing lights were always clearly visible and this was just glowing white.<n>

Because of this the camera was put away until my daughter, ((name deleted)), opened it up much later to look for her pictures and found this clear picture between the blurry ones, and upon looking at all the other pictures we took that night, you can clearly see large round orbs just before they popped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I notice in the trail the ufo left behind, this object descended from space and after the color red, the craft turned at 90 degree right angles, and aprox 180 degrees after the green color trail, and emits<n> <n><n> less color when traveling in curves or straighter lines.

We saw what appeared to be 4 lights in the sky way ahead of us.  They were in the shape of an isoceles triangle; only where there should have been a light at the bottom left, there was none.  The lights slowly dissipated.   We then both saw what to me looked like what you would see if hot air balloons flying at night, but the angle was all wrong, and my wife noted that there was no outline of any balloon against the night sky.  There wasn&#39;t.  We watched as they slowly moved across the sky above us.  I pulled over into a mortuary parking lot and we got out of the car to watch them as they moved overhead in a linear direction; slowly.  I can&#39;t say how fast.  We watched two of them until the first one seemed to burn out until there was only a pinpoint of very dim light floating.  The second light did the same thing, &#34;burning out&#34; until there was just a pinpoint of ! dim light.  I lost it in the streetlight and was not able to visually aquire it again, after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, we thought the triangle thing was airplanes in formation waiting to land, but they weren&#39;t moving.  Then, after the lights started disappearing, we knew it wasn&#39;t airplanes.  The lights were a red color. They looked much further off than the second set of lights we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how the other lights we saw are related to the triangle.<n>

They were very very bright both leaving behind a green trail.  Not long after the sun started to rise and we noticed a very bright light in the sky.  It moved in very fast motions.   It looked like it would go miles the the left or right or up and down within seconds.   When zoomed in on with camera it looked like a rectangle standing vertical and it was continuously turning.   With every side that appeared to us it was a different color; blue, red, green, etc.  Throughout watching it, it seemed like there was a colored glow around it and at one point there was like this burst of white dots that shot out from the right side of it in an open cone shape.  I got pictures of it but it turned out like a line with bulbous sections, so I&#39;m not sure if it was moving or if it was due to me moving.<n>

Three people saw the entire sighting, while 3 others claimed to see the last few moments of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning a duel propeller helicopter flew overhead.  This was not the same object seen previously the night before.<n>

At first I believed what I was seeing was simply a &#34;shooting star&#34; until the blue/green object shifted directions diagonally and zoomed over my head and disappeared.  I saw the object for about 5 seconds total, and it moved very quickly so I am not sure of the exact shape, but I do know what I saw was unlike anything I have seen before.<n>

They looked almost as far as the stars, but there were 4 in a line, and 2 behind the ones on the far left and right, so we believe there were 6 of them.  They were moving very fast, across the whole sky in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then before they exceeded our sightline, we saw them just disappear.  Maybe 2 minutes later, this time  I said &#34;Oh my God!  There&#39;s another one!

I ran back to my place and grabbed a pair of binoculars and observed the two objects for about a minute.  Through the binoculars the object appeared to have no form, just a pulsating ball of orange light.  I then noticed a third orange light following in line behind the other two.  This third object was nearly directly above me so I got a better view through the binoculars but there was still not form, just a ball of orange light.  I watched as all three objects disappeared into the distance.  It was a cloudy night and these objects were below the cloud cover.  They made no noise whatsoever, just moved silently. I do not believe the objects were an airplane or helicopter because even with binoculars the objects were just balls of light yet they were not too far away and they made no noise.  I got one grainy picture on my ce! ll phone but don’t know how much use it might be.  I am a 23 year old college senior.<n>

We observed the object due east at our two o&#39;clock.  It was out over the Atlantic ocean which is approximately 1/4 mile from our location.  I estimate the object was further out over the ocean.  In the course of observing this craft two more appeared in the same part of the sky.  All three objects had three lights that emitted a steady glow and a pulsating strobe that circled around the object.  The objects danced in the sky and seemed to jump up and down.   I brought out my binoculars and went out onto my roof.  There I observed over the next thirty minutes four additional objects.  Two were in the same part of the sky where my wife first observed the initial object.  One was far to the north, approx 5 miles away and moving inland.  The other appeared from the southeast and continued north ! up the coast and disappeared.  These craft would move, appear stationary and then move in the opposite direction or up or down.  Approximately midway through the sighting, an aircraft flew directly overhead from the direction of either Lakehurst NAS or McGuire AFB and flew diectly toward one of the objects.  It appeared to be a large four engine aircraft, either a transport or a tanker. Both disappeared into a cloud bank.  We live close to an approach pattern for Newark Airport and are used to seeing commercial aircraft.  These objects were not flying in any sort of pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife who is a confirmed skeptic wanted to report the incident to the police while it was happening.  Instead we tried the NUFORC hotline but the center reporting mailbox was full.  We would be very interested to know if any one else shared these observations as this part of the coast is heavily populated and many people were out and about this Saturday night.<n>

It was partially cloudy and that was mainly to the south.  It was a bright -5.6M flare and just as one of the websites predicted, it was there at the location that the website said it would be and there was nothing else that was to follow.  (Link for the flare being viewed:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.heavens-above.com/flaredetails.asp?SatID=25106&amp;lat=42.886&amp;lng=-78.879&amp;alt=183&amp;loc=Buffalo&amp;TZ=EST&amp;Date=40643.018484537&amp;Mirror=1)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Polaris was becoming more visible at the time and other brighter stars were more visible.  After the flare took place I noticed a fuzzy object about 10 degrees (to the NW) away from the star Capella, which was to the west.   This was a pink-like (almost orange) object that appeared like a bright star with fuzziness then just faded away.   It was actually brighter (about -3 magnitude) than Capella, which made it most noticeable.   Unlike the satellite that created the iridium flare, which was moving, this object was stationary.  Since spotting this object the entire viewing was about fifteen seconds.  I am uncertain how long it was there prior to viewing the flare.   I do not know if this was a weather balloon or something else.  Many of the satellites I have seen do not last too long in view and move across the sky, this object did not move and faded out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did have my Olympus DSLR camera at the time to photograph the flare, but I was not prepared for that object.  There was a brief moment where the maxing moon had a minor halo around it due to light clouds and may have caused the fuzziness around the object.   Why it disappeared is another thing.<n>

Don&#39;t know what it can be, it&#39;s not a helicopter, since they don&#39;t move that speed and they usually make a lot of noise.  Also did not see any other coloured lights.

Upon finishing my meal I was just looking up at the sky at the partial moon in the blue sky.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  When I saw a red dot.  As my eyes focused in, I noticed there was a mixture of dots.  Three appeared to be red, four white and one semi green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These dots seemed to be very high in the sky.  They moved around in different directions.  Passing between each other going in different directions and forming straight lines and triangles. Towards the end of the experience they all totally disappeared at the same time.  Then after some scouring of the sky 4 or 5 reappeared  northwest of the original location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no way this could have been balloons, satellites or planes. They held the same location besides moving around each other for more than 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time we have ever seen anything like this.  Whatever we saw seemed to have control of some kind, to be moving backwards and forwards and up and down. There is no way this could be weather related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Wife Googled to see how we could tell someone about experience, because we felt compelled to let someone, because it was really weird.   While Googling we stumbled on a site that had a video on April 8 in Arizona which looked very similar to what we saw.   But theirs was at night and ours was during the day.  And you could distinctively see the three different colors. White, Green and Red.   Even with the sun going down we have never seen anything that appeared to be that high with such color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought you needed to know.  We are glad we found your site to report this.  We feel in our selves that we saw something very special tonight.  It is not B.s..<n>

Not unusual, I live near a municipal airport.  This helicopter was different, totally black, even the windows were blacked out and had no markings.  I watched it circle the area for a few minutes until it disappeared to the south.  Still looking up, something caught my eye to north.  Two metallic orbs about 6-8 feet in diameter, 500 ft. in altitude were dancing, swirling around each other and bobbing up and down.  This went on for about 90 seconds until out of nowhere, the helicopter came racing towards the orbs at full speed.  The orbs stopped dancing, came together in formation and took off at about mach 2 to the west with the helicopter in full pursuit !  I thought: good luck trying to catch them!<n>

Sometimes even though they had a lower light intensity would radiate more light up to 3 or 4 times as bright.  Objects occasionally appeared to change direction.  Shape was round like a distant star, color and light was bluish white like a distant star.  Objects would change intensity and shine bright a few times during lateral travel.  Seemed to be a cluster.

Then about 3 others kept moving around the sky two were reddish colors one was sort of blue and then they all hovered at different parts of the sky. One was southeast of us the others were west and south west of us.Im freeking out over all this.  Before i went to bed one hovered over our place.

I saw three white lights moving north simultaneously in a triangular shape, never straying away from each other.  No flashing lights or sound was present from the object. It moved north at a steady pace. This plane or whatever it was, looked to be very large from my perception maybe 100ft. to 150ft. wide.  I could not make out the length from the rear to the front of the object.  It kept moving north until the light pollution in the horizon was too bright to see anything; it looked as if it disappeared.<n>

A separate, similar sized light was leading the triangle at an unknown distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the triangle passed overhead, a 5 and 6thth amber light came into view following the triangle.  In total, there were 6 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The height and distance between the individual orbs was difficult to estimate because I have never seen anything that moved like them.  They moved in sync and had none of the characteristics of traditional, well known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been a UFO skeptic but this changed my perception.

One particular star or orb was brighter than the others and appeared to be moving upward in the sky which would indicate moving toward my location. I presumed it was a helicopter as we have a weekly run over our house by a chopper.  But it was far away and I thought it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it picked up in speed, shooting straight upward.  Then, suddenly, it stop on a dime and then made a 90 degree turn, heading north.  It continued heading north for about half the distance it had gone when moving upward.  Suddenly, it stopped on a dime, then made a reverse 30 degree change and headed back south and went farther than the prependicular location where it was first sited.  It stopped again, then headed upward which would be west.  It continued west for twice the distance of the initial advance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled hundreds of miles in seconds, then stopped abruptly and changed direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife to come see to be sure I wasn&#39;t hallucinating and she watched the activity and confirmed the same observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued these triangular and irregular movements for several minutes whereupon we gave up and went back into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had never seen an object in the sky move like this.

This jet was very high - it was a clear, sunny day, (today, April 8th, 2011) and the object appeared to be angled to the right side, higher than the jet but cruising along at the same speed, same path of flight. We watched until the jet left our view.   This happened over a period of about 3 minutes.  The jet was flying over Spokane. Again, this was a large jet at cruising altitude. It was travelling east.  The witnesses include two adults, one teenager, 3 children.   We each speculated what it could be and it was not, and could not, have been part of the plane as it was not attached.  Given the height of the jet, the object had to be relatively close to have been noticed but it! was definitely discernable as a separate object.  There was no jet stream from the object like there was from the plane, and it had no propellant system that was visible.  We definitely had a clear view of the plane and object.  In contrast to the largeness of the jet, the object appeared to be about a 1/4 of the size.<n>

(on 4/8/11, 3:15 am.) at  a trailer yard my work has there.  I drive tractor trailer and was there to pick up a trailer and return to Springfield,Ma. I began to pre-trip inspect the trailer, when I got to the back door area I had to pee, it is a wooded, fairly remote location.As I was standing there I looked into the sky and thought about how clear and crisp the night sky was.  Movement drew my attention to the south east. I observed two  white lights, very high up, moving at incredible speed. I immediately  focused in on the first star I saw next to them to try an tell if I was really seeing them move or it was my eyes tricking me, and they were obviously moving very fast. I would say they were about the size and brightness of a very small star.  There was no noise at all, but with the sheer altitude they were at, I&#39;m not sure if I would have expected to hear anything anyway.They were about two inches apart from each other (from my perspective on the ground),and traveled about seven inches( again ,my perspective)in a south westerly direction.  They came to a sudden stop.  Sat in place for a moment, then one light faded away, the other flashed brightly, then disappeared.The whole event lasted maybe five seconds.  I have lived in Cocoa Beach , Fl., for many years, and with Nasa, and a busy  Patrick Air Force base in town I&#39;ve  seen every type of aircraft I can think of, and this was like nothing I have ever witnessed. I was, and still am pretty shaken afterward.  I am not sure what to believe anymore.  I have never been a &#39;skeptic&#39; per say, but never really believed in &#34;u.f.o. stories&#34; either.  I do know that what I saw was very real and quite possibly a life changing moment for me....<n>

4/7/11 23:05|Munford|TN|Unknown|1 minute|Large hoovering craft that disappeared|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80805.html|244|ndxe201104| Large hoovering craft that disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving I noticed a set of lights in a triangular shape that initially looked like a C-130 type of craft very low to the ground. I would have initially estimated the lights at approximately 900 to 1200 feet above the ground. Initially I also believed the object was a plane moving directly toward me because it looked like it was sitting still.  Because I was driving directly toward the object I became more interested in it very quickly because I realized it was not far ahead of me and low to the ground and was obviously too large to be any type of helicopter.  After driving about ¼ mile at 20mph I stopped the truck, turned off my lights and engine and got out to look at the craft.  I heard no noise for about 10 seconds as I stood there looking at the craft trying to figure out what it was.  I would estimate the lights that appeared to span side to side to be about 200 feet apart and front to rear lights about 50 feet.  This light scheme from a distance ga! ve the impression of an airplane but looked very unnatural up close.  Although I could see the lights clearly I could not actually make out the shape of the craft and I believe to be mounted to the bottom vice the sides or forward facing. There was minimal cloud cover and the craft was very close to my position but I was still unable to tell its exact shape or identify it in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at it for about 10 seconds or so I heard what sounded like a distant jet engine and then a few seconds later the craft started to move off at a 30 degree angle from where I was standing.  Suddenly the lights went off and I could no longer see or hear the craft although it could not have been more than ¼ mile from me when I lost it. There was nothing to obstruct my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then continued on to my destination which was just around the corner from where I was parked (in the middle of the road). I parked my truck and began to wait for my daughter whom I was there to pick up.  While I waited I watched the sky and noticed after about 10 minutes that there were several planes coming in from a distance that seemed to be circling which I also found very odd. Then I saw the object once again when lights suddenly came on and it immediately (not at any unimaginable speed) began to move toward the closest plane in the area.  I was able to watch it for a few more seconds until once again the lights went off and I was unable to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 45 minutes or so I watched as what I would estimate to be about 20 separate planes flying low and basically circling the town. I have never seen planes in this quantity to anything like this before and I believe they were also looking for something.<n>

It was headed in  what appeared to be a north easterly direction. It was moving faster than any plane that I have ever seen and did not make any noise.

At first I thought it was a couple of fireworks shot up.  Looked away, but looked right back and realized they weren&#39;t falling.  I said what the hell is that?  My girlfriend immediately got up off the sofa and I went out onto our deck and watched them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What were they?  2 orange lights in the sky moving from the Northwest to the Southwest.  They moved very slowly but at an unwavering pace.  Did not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was amazing was, the entire time we watched them, they never moved closer or further apart but kept perfect distance from each other.  I would say we watched them for about a good minute to a minute and a half as they passed overhead until we lost sight of them when they passed over to the other side of our building.  They could not have been that high as we could have watched them for a fair bit longer if they were higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend remarked at one point that they kind of looking like floating candles ( the flame of a candle, that sort of colour ).  I thought perhaps they were fighter planes or perhaps helicopters flying in formation but there were no other lights other than that emanating from what could only have been the center of their mass.  Did not detect a real mass or shadow behind them either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In terms of shape round, but more like glowing orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In terms of backgrounds, I am a 36 year old lawyer and my girlfriend is a 42 year old medical research assistant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, pretty amazing we both feel privileged to have witnessed that.<n>

It was very bright and! large compared to the stars that were near it.  It was eerie the way it just fell straight down from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the fact that the bottom part of my window had blinds - I was only able to watch the orb until it started to plummet - then the bottom part of that window, because it had blinds over it, blocked me from viewing it any further.

The light turned into three comet like blue-white lights as it accelerated in descent, approximately a 60 to 70 angle traveling north west.  As it accellerated two small red lights appeared between the three blue-white lights, all five lights were in a straight line perpendicular to the flight path.  The tails from the blue lights went from the beginning point I saw the light to the point it leveled out, no less than 300 feet, then slowly retracted to a single light moving away towards the North East.  Very quickly its size shrank and disappeared.  No sound other than the airliner overhead.  There was also a plane to the!

I asked her to try and get a photo and she did ,its hard to see the object but you do see something that kind of looks like a cloud but she said it was several lights.  She sent the picture to me and I would be happy to forward this to you.  She said it didn&#39;t make a sound and it was quite big.  This happened at 3:21 pm Texas time.<n>
4/6/11 03:15|Hatfield|MA|Formation|7 seconds|April 6 2011 Formation Sighting Over Hatfield MA|5/2/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80788.html|261|ndxe201104| April 6 2011  Formation Sighting Over Hatfield MA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a truck driver, so I have early work start times I was not purposely looking at the sky the morning of April 6, 2011, but I was cleaning the West Coast mirror of my truck so I was looking up at the mirror.  In my peripheral vision, I saw a left to right moving light (west to east). I thought immediately it was a satellite because there was an absence of sound.  I am always curious about moving objects in the night sky so when I was finished moving the squeegee down the mirror, I focused on the object.  Much to my surprise, it wasn’t one object; it was 3 spheres of light moving together in a triangle pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I studied the objects and atmospheric conditions carefully.  I estimate they were 1500-2000 feet high, moving at about 100-200MPH.  The night sky was cloudless with winds blowing from the NW at about 15-20MPH. I estimate these spheres of light to be approximately 75-100 ft in diameter.  Let me emphasis, these objects were not points of light that you might see from a specific light source, such as the strobe lights on an airplane.  These were spheres of muted white light, 75-100 ft in diameter each. After 6 seconds, I was preparing to take a video with my iphone.  At 7 seconds, the objects vanished in a way that looked similar to the way people disappeared when in the &#34;transporter&#34; on the TV series &#34;Star Trek,&#34; not instantly, but over a period of about a second or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me just mention as background information: my father was a career Air Force NCO.  I grew up on Air Force Bases and around airplanes. I have observed airplanes both civilian and military all of my life (I am now 58 years old).  I have observed satellites since I was a kid.  I know what they look like and their predictable behavior.  This observation was unlike any in my past.  The soundless, formation flying objects were unlike any airplane(s) or satellites I have ever seen.  The fact that they were flying over one of the largest food warehouses on the east coast may just be coincidence, but maybe not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a Cooke but when I shared my observations with others that night, I was treated by some like I was.  I have never reported anything like this before.  This observation has shaken me because I cannot explain it and I am reporting it in hopes that somehow the information can be beneficial.<n>

She had a bad headache and kept getting visions of all/any ordinary object with gashes/large wounds in them....bleeding....we went to bed early, which we never do.  I awoke at the time specified to the sound of what seemed like a plane/jet flying over...except i picked up on the undertones of several other pitch variations that kept varying.  It was a sound that almost paralyzed me.  i don&#39;t fear easily and this scared the fuck out of me.  My wife and I saw a round sphere moving at 20-30mph (rough guess) about 20 feet over the tree line heading north by north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this round sphere had 3 arms that acted like those  of a jelly fish but were clearly metallic looking one with a red like at the tip another with yellow and the third orange.   Each of this gentle bobbing &#34;tendrils&#34; seemed to be sampling/searching either the tree tops or the forest floor.  the &#34;tendrils came out of the hemisphere! of the object, which was dark except for the lights, and all from one point.  When it finally left,  only when my wife asked me what it was(me lying said it was a damn jet or plane to calm her down) the lulling undertone noises that varied greatly were replaced by those of what we correlate with that of an overpassing plane and headed north easterly quite quickly.  It was almost as if the object realized/heard us awake.   at the beginning it was crazy loud...like ridiculously loud.  The next day neither one of us spoke or thought about it until we returned home from work and after dinner.  I mentioned what a weird night the night before was.  Had my wife draw a picture of what she saw....to rule out a dream sequence.  and it was exactly what we saw....and not a dream.<n>

They looked like they were going to collide by the angles they were moving in.  Right before they did, a third glowing object came in from the side.  Right before they all hit each other, all three shot straight upward and disappeared.  The two that were falling together did a close to 180 degree turn and the third glowing object probably turned at a 50-60 degree angle. It&#39;s hard to gauge how far away they were so it could have been anywhere over northern California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

These were visible colors; not just vague pastel flashes like most stars.  The light was single, about 70-degrees above the horizon and exactly southwest of my location (I confirmed this with my iphone compass).  The light was larger and brighter than Venus (as a reference), and as mentioned, changed into separate and very distinct colors:  red, green, blue, white, yellowish.  No particular order to the color changes.  No sounds overheard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for several minutes and even tried to take a video with my phone.

This is the third time me and my mother have seen this light, we are not sure what to make of it and weren’t sure what to do about seeing it!   Now that is the third time seeing this I don’t feel so crazy!   Has anyone else seen a light like this one?<n>

It was moving pretty slow, however it seemed bigger than what a helicopter or plane would look like in the sky.  I freaked out and started recording it, but my cellphone was terrible quality as opposed to what was really being seen.  We didn&#39;t think much of it after a while until a little light would appear behind it.  When that started to happen that&#39;s when our attention was 100 percent on the moving object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the light/object moving, we noticed it was moving upward but going in a slanted route. The little light would appear off and on behind it.  As it moved towards the moon, it came to a complete halt.  All of a sudden these little lights were dropping out of it almost as if they were like shooting stars because the lights that were shooting out would disappear as they shot out.  And it was going on for quite a while and we even felt a little uneasy because it was literally so bizarre and amazing.  And then it just disappeared like it literally went poof (no sound was made).  Not even gaining speed or anything it just was there and then it wasn&#39;t.<n>

Then it disappearred, then reappearred and saw a another straight ahead in southern sky, and another in western sky, seemed to shape a perfect gigantic triangle.  Disappearred again, then all were in the western sky and there was a 4th light between the top of the triangle and the bottom left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched until around 11:15pm then left to go home due to the late hour, so don&#39;t know how long it hung around or where else it may have moved to.<n>

I swear on all my grandparent&#39;s graves at what I saw.  May god strike me down if I am lying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking southward that evening down my steps in my backyard, didn&#39;t see anything odd, but felt compelled to look up.  Right when I looked up, above me, saw a huge, giant glowing rectangle above me very high up, perhaps stratosphere, no clouds.  Hard to say how huge but, I think it was very, very high up, seemingly as high as the stars, but I think stratosphere.  Massive, at my sight, from my perspective, at it that high up it was 3 or 4in long and 2in tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was itself bright and glowing, not sending light out, but itself only, no reflective light, as if it were some energy light.  It was 3/4 left side fluorescent white, glowing and fluorecent blue 1/4 on right side, perfectly, vertically seperated by a line of both colors glowing as one.  Hard to explain.  It flashed brightly, and disappeared, then in a fraction of a second before I could think about what I was seeing, it reappeared to the left, or south, about 6feet from my perspective, but obvioulsy quite a far distance that far up. I yelled to a friend to come out and see, I wanted to tell him to grab the camera, but didn&#39;t want him to miss it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the interim, it flashed again, and again, reappeared to the left of it&#39;s position as it was moving southward.  Just before my friend arrived at the outside door, it then flashed again, dissapeared and then a giant sphere of fluoresecent white light, brighter than the moon (which I could not see that night, tall redwoods around me), brighter and bigger than anything I have ever seen, other than the moon, in the night sky appeared almost like a super nova, glowed brightly and then shot off like a bullet to the west, over Big Basin State Park, flying above hwy 236.  The rectangle had gone, it seemed as if it became the sphere after it flashed the third time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend missed the whole thing, a very short period of time elapsed, but much happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

Lauterdale to st. petersburg passing through alligator alley on i75 N.  I was listening to my cd, not really paying attention to anything since i was on cc, when all of the sudden I saw some kind of strange object in the sky, in front above me.  it was really weird because it had 4 big lights on both sides, and one huge beam light in the front which seemed to be shooting straight out but because it was so bright, it lid up the whole road! and i know i&#39;m not the only one who saw it because the other cars on the road were also kind of tapping their breaks looking up to see what it was!  it literaly flashed 4 times and was gone in about two to three seconds!  each time it flashed, it was in a different spot then before seemed to be going forward, once infront of me, once almost above me, once above and behind me, and the last time was completely behind me and then gone!  i know it wasn&#39;t a regular military air craft because i have many friends in the service and i know what helicopters and airplanes etc look like!  this thing was huge!  bigger then any airplane, and in order for an airplane to appear this big above my car it will have to be almost landed, but i was in the middle of nowhere in alligator alley nowhere near any airport!!!!!<n>

This is an area that is not very populated and has mostly farmland and swamps.  It was so bright that it looked like one object but when I took the pictures with my phone it turned out to be 4 lights which seemed weird to us.  I guess because it was super bright.  It seemed to be just moving around very slowly just about high as the trees and then just disappeared.  The object looked to be about 2-3 miles away from us.<n>

Nothing like I ever have seen before.  I first saw it while I was leaving Mccarran Airport; the aircraft was directly south of the airport, I think it might have been in the restricted airspace area.  At first, it was flying normally, except it wasn&#39;t in the shape of any aircraft I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But about 15 seconds after that, it made a sharp 165 degree turn, speed up, and dissappeard into the south over Henderson and Black Mountain.  At my view, it was very shiny and jet-black.  Also, it turned, from my view, from the size of a penny to the size of a pen dot.  This was while it was speeding up and dissappeared.<n>

There was nothing in the night sky but stars (as often the case when you live by the sea).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i looked up i seen a light to my left, it went from left to right across the sky, (which would of took a plane about 2 minutes to cross) in this case it flew at incredible speed and took 5-6 seconds and in a very straight line.

Faded away...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were driving West on Southwest Parkway in Wichita Falls, TX on 4/2/11 around 8 PM when I noticed what looked like an airplane flying at an unusually high altitude. I didn&#39;t think much of it until I noticed that it had no visible wings and didn&#39;t appear to be moving. I know when you fly in the same direction as a plane it can appear that it isn&#39;t moving, but after we made a few turns, we realized it wasn&#39;t moving like a plane.  It left no contrail, and it was a perfectly clear, dry Spring day at dusk. I pointed it out to my husband who began watching it as he drove along.  After a minute of us both watching, the object slowly disappeared, as if someone turned down it&#39;s brightness, versus it turning in a different direction, or flying off into the distance.  It didn&#39;t get smaller, it just uniformly faded. My husband was witness to this event.  We have a major air force base here in town, so I&#39;m not going to assume it was extra-terrestrial, but I&#39;ve never seen an airplane do that, commercial or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose you could say it was cigar or cylinder shaped, but in a way it almost looked like a Zeppelin.  It was hard to tell cause as I said, it was at a high altitude.  But as I also said, it really didn&#39;t look like or act like a commercial airliner.  It was either white or silver, also hard to tell cause it could have been reflecting (or I suppose even putting off) light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are both college educated, middle class, 20-somethings who are skeptical of usual claims, but open to the possibility of them being legitimate.  He is from the area, and I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia.  My husband also claims he saw one in the area almost ten years ago while he was fishing, but it looked like a different type of craft, 3 dots in a triangle shape, more reflective than shiny.  That incidence occurred over a period of several hours.<n>

It appeared nearly overhead, was silent and its speed I would estimate to be approximately 50-60 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had symmetry forming an approximate 25 degree angle from its apex toward the aft part of the object.  The object had bilateral surface detail suggesting nacelles in a fuselage.  They were very definitive. The object did not appear to be very large, being about the size of a larger radio controlled aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew in a straight line and constant speed for the brief time I had it in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost it as it passed over the treeline to the north, this being a heavily wooded suburb of Chicago.  I would estimate the altitude at less than 500 feet AGL.<n>

My home orientations is SE by NW.  Cloud movement was moderate and star position could be fixed.  I attempted to position my self and reference any above stars with local tree top locality.   Given the cloud movement I had noted that a fixed star appeared to move SW and initially wondered about satellite movement.  However, with commercial traffic of high attitude which I am aware of being that my location is in line of sight for approaches and fly overs to Vancouver BC for destination to and from Asia or Alaska north and south, the object observed proceeded in north east direction which seemed to follow at a rate of high speed similar to satellite or ISS cross over.  But when it seemed to slow and accelerate in a erratic fashion this was what made me focus on its movement.  The object did seem to zig zag in a minimal pattern for a brief moment.  Angle of zag was approx. at 30 degree angles which in perceptional direction went off by a few cm by eye site.  This craft was non- distinguishable, given height and speed.  Like I mentioned it had the look or brilliance of satellite or ISS size and movement.  The rate of speed appeared to be 3 times as fast as commercial traffic and brightness or lack of strobe lighting negated commercial traffic in my opinion.<n>

I thought its trajectory was unusual because it didn&#39;t follow a conventional/straight path, it moved in a sort of predictably alternating up-and-down motion as it traveled east.  Suspecting I was mistaken, I slowed my car to a stop on the otherwise empty road, watched it, and established to my surprise it was moving the way I thought it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A moment later, it seemed to disappear altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rationalizing at this point that all this might have a conventional explanation to the affect of &#34;it was a plane that flew behind a cloud,&#34;  I searched the sky carefully in the area of the disappearance and was alarmed to discover I could only see, vividly, the stars in the sky characteristic of near-perfect visibility-no clouds to be had.  Some to the near southwest were illuminated reddish by light pollution and could be distinguished from the deep black night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hadn&#39;t even traveled across the whole length of sky visible from the road through the trees that surround it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became anxious about how weird the whole thing seemed and hurried home.<n>

It moved at a high but smooth speed and stopped directly above a cliffline.  Within seconds a second identical light approched at the same high speed and seemed to merge with no interuption or change in size or motion with the first light.  I took digital photos as a third light seemed to come from behind the mountain and join the first two. When it intersected the first two lights it became a triangle, tightly packed and appearing as a a single light with a very black center.  With binoculars I could see 3 balls of bluish lights joined by hazy ( light beams?)in a triangle.  I have one photo detailing the approach of the third light.  The craft spun and bobbed around for a moment, flarred brighter and dissapered.  I am one of the only residents on Chinook Pass this winter.  I have been watching these lights on a regular bassis for over a year now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently the sightings have followed the sighting of what I believe is a remote controlled craft of mam made origin.  From a distance these unmanned planes sound like a model &#34;hobby&#34; plane or chopper. As they get closer the sound changes to that of a large duel prop plane.  I have been located on several occassions in dense forest cover during day and late night outings. on more than one trip both the fast blue lights and the slow moving survalliance craft are in the sky at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have attemted to take photos of planes and stars to compare to the blue lights.  The stars and marked, lighted planes barely show up but the photo.  However the fast moving balls are clearly seen and when blown up often break into three seperate light in a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen the lights hover and fly over the area I live in for nearly 2 years now.<n>

It had either 6 or 8 very large circular raised lights on the underside of the rectangle.  It was flying low so it looked very large but it was also moving very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my daugther to take the wheel so I could look behind me to track it and it was already gone.  I have never seen a rectangular plane before.  It was low enough that I got a good look at it.  IT was definitely flying and definitely had bright lights on the underside.  And it was definitely big and fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I could have gotten a longer look!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The north 2 red circular lights were in line and the south one was spaced equally apart but on the south side and all lights moved at same speed.  They faded out as it got more to the west.  It took about 3-5sec from point i seen them to when they faded out.  Moved a little slower than a falling star and made no noise at all.<n>

I stood up and when it cleared the trees I could see it was a round glowing object. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and made no sound.  When it was directly above me it flickered and went almost dark but what blew me away was I could see a solid shape against the night sky moving away from me at a high rate of speed and I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to sit down and I looked up and in the same exact spot 2 more lights, the same color, same shape, traveling at the same speed came over and flickered and went almost dark and I could see the disk shaped objects again against the night sky moving away guickly and again with out a bit of noise.  The sky was clear and bright with stars, with no moon at that time.  I know what satalites look like and these where not satalites!  I have never in my life seen anything like this before and am baffled.<n>

There were two separate groups of 3 to 4 lights each moving parallel to each other directly north.  One of the lights from the group on the left moved diagonally and met and continued to move with the right group.  The time from when they caught our eye until they became to faint to see was only seconds.  They were moving extremely fast, we initially saw them basically straight above us and then they disappeared to the north.  We did not hear any noise associated with them, nothing obscured our view and the lights were not flashing or colored.  In the area tonight the Air National Guard is flying at least 2 C1-30s, which is pretty common here.  They were not around when we saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 30 feet from the ground.  It almost blended in with the sky; if it wasn’t for the dim reddish lights I wouldn’t have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went by extremely silent I tried looking at the flying craft itself; the triangle was semi-invisible, you could see a triangle shape but not every detail.   Pardon the pun but like the clocking device on star track when they first start to go invisible or when they are taking the clock down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It felt like I was dreaming while I watched this craft go by us, then it glided more to the South past us and it was it disappeared into the sky because of its black color and dim lights.  We couldn’t see it any longer. When it was gone all I could keep saying was that was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son started saying he didn’t want to be abducted, he was frightened after seeing that.  My husband and I were in amazement.  I drew a picture of what I saw.  The picture isn’t a perfect image of it  I am not an artist but it’s what we saw that night, we will never forget.<n>
4/1/11 21:00|Homer Glen|IL|Light|45 minutes|Sightings of 7 different objects in the night sky over Homer Glen, Illinois|4/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80739.html|314|ndxe201104| Sightings of 7 different objects in the night sky over Homer Glen, Illinois<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:00PM on Saturday (April 2, 2011), my wife had just taken the dog upstairs to go to bed and I was downstairs in the family room playing a video game before turning in myself when she came running down telling me that she sees “a UFO outside”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately put the game on “pause” and followed her upstairs to our bedroom to see what she was talking about.  As she led me to the window of our walk-in closet (which faces north), she was telling me that, with the window partially open, she started hearing a lot of the neighborhood dogs barking so she got up to look and see what was going on.  As she looked out the window she heard a “crackling sound” (like fireworks) and looking north-eastward she saw what appeared to be some strange type of orange “firework” rising from beyond the tree line trailing white sparks down to the ground.  The orange ball, after shedding the white sparks, then moved slowly across the sky.  At which point she ran down to get me so I could see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the window, I observed this orange glow in the sky moving slowly in a northerly direction.  As I looked at it more closely, I noticed the single orange glow appeared to be three smaller orange lights hanging beneath something I could not make out and then thought it would be good to try and get a picture of whatever it was.  I ran downstairs, grabbed my camera but by the time I got outside, the glowing orange ball had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After things calmed down a bit, my wife proceeded to call her parents to tell them what happened while I returned to finish the video game I had postponed. No sooner than a few minutes later my wife ran back down the stairs saying, “It’s happening again!” So, for the second time, she heard the “crackling”, looked out the closet window and saw another orange glow, trailing white sparks appear in almost the exact same location as before. This time, by the time I ran outside with my camera, I again only saw the orange glow as it moved north and vanished attempting to take a picture of it but I was unable to focus on it.  I decided that I would prepare my video camera in the event it happened again because the digital camera couldn’t seem to focus on the object..<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, sure enough, it did happen again; but this time, I got to see what my wife was trying to describe.  The orange glow was, indeed, trailing white sparks and there was the distinct sound of “fireworks” but what I noticed is that the sound was more of an electrical “pop”, than an explosive “pop”.  Also, the orange glow, once it shed its white sparks, did not burn out, fall back down or make any sound whatsoever as fireworks should do, this one also continued on a trajectory north as did the two prior orange balls which, again, slowly flew out of sight. (It should be noted that the wind was blowing from the west to the east, so these orange objects were flying in an angle, adjacent to the wind current.) Now, totally unsure of what I just saw I thought to myself, “if it happened three times, it can happen again” I loaded my video camera with fresh batteries, a blank tape, went outside and waited.  As I stood there with video in hand looking toward the north-east, expecting to hear the crackling and see the next odd-orange ball, I turned and looked west and was startled to see two orange balls, a great distance apart from each other, hovering in the night sky.  I quickly turned my camera on and tried to catch them on film they were very far apart and could not get them both in the frame and as I moved toward the back yard pointing the camera skyward and to the west, the orange glow lower to the horizon was already fading into the distance while the other, which was higher on the horizon, had already vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frustrated, I began to make my way back around to the front of the house and as I turned the corner and stood in my driveway, I saw another orange glow over and passed my neighbor’s roof to the south moving north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the glow I caught on film for approximately 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the video, as it slowly moves north it appears to turn south slightly before it disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this is explained away as normal air traffic, I will say that there are planes that fly over all the time.  We may even be near an approach corridor for Midway; however, being very aware of what planes do look because they fly by all the time and are seen in the sky around my house to the point where you are very familiar with typical aircraft, these objects/lights were not typical aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/1/11 20:30|Natomas|CA|Light|10-20 seconds|Saw a quick graceful moving object with a line of lights (mostly bright blue)  that turned on and off quickly.

Object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never written anything like this before, but then again, I have never seen anything like this before. I&#39;m a regular person with a regular job, this is not a hoax, and maybe it&#39;s not a real UFO-- I don&#39;t know WHAT it was, so I&#39;m reporting it just in case because I can&#39;t explain it. I work with special needs children, and I was going to &#34;Family Movie Night&#34; at an elementary school in Natomas.  It started at 6pm and ended around 8:20.  After it ended (around 8:30) I was on the freeway back to downtown Sacramento, just past the Del Paso exit, when I saw something odd in the sky in the field to the left of the highway (a lot of Natomas is not developed yet.)  I thought it was an airplane at first, but it had a very brilliant blue light at the bottom.  The lighted up part looked rectangular, like a line of really bright, true blue lights.  I turned my head to watch it, and when I did I noticed it had a few other colored lights on it-- then I saw it move.  It was ! amazing!!  It did this really graceful swan dive, and then disappeared for a second.  Then it reappeared and maneuvered very quickly again.  It was almost a gliding motion, like a kite, except for it was way too high up and large to be a kite and I don&#39;t know of anyone who flies those things in vacant fields by the highway at 8:30.  I guess it&#39;s possible, but I really don&#39;t think it was any kind of kite, it just had that really swift graceful gliding motion, nothing like an airplane.  Plus, the lights kept switching on and off (when they were off it looked as if it disappeared, then reappeared when the lights went on), and it would hover, and then move very quickly.  I watched as long as I could, but I was driving, and then it disappeared before it was even out of my field of view.  I called my boyfriend right away (yep, I know, using my cell phone in the car) and he just thought it was funny, but I can&#39;t believe I actually saw something like that!  I think it may have been a real ! UFO, and that is just fascinating. I have no other explanation.  Again, I was heading from Natomas to Downtown Sacramento (on I-5 South) just past the Del Paso exit, and I saw this in the sky above a vacant field to the left of the highway.  I was in no way impaired at the time. It was pretty amazing!<n>
