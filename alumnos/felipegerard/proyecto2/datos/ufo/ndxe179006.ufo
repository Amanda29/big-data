BROWN   SCHOHARIE   PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR BY L. CUTHBERT     1823<n> <n><n> <n><n> The meteor   About the year 1790, on a clear summer evening, I was sitting on the stoop playing the fiddle.  About 9 o’clock in the evening a shine of light appeared and increased until it overshone even the light of the meridian sun in some clear day, and enlightened my stoop in such a manner, that I might have picked up a pin in every corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I heard a great roaring coming direct from the North,  I started up and looked out from the stoop, and behold! I saw a fiery meteor, or as the Germans call it a &#34;mine droke,&#34;  a dragon coming on and passing by at the distance of about 250 yards West of me, a distance of about 60 or 70 feet above the cleared ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept along down through the hollow, on the other side of the hollow it met with the rising of the hill covered with woods and tall trees, there it took a sudden rise and went just over the tall trees so as not to touch them, and on over a kind of flat or level ground, until it met with the foot of the noted hill, by the Indians called &#34;Owelus Sowless,&#34; then it ascended higher, ascending as the ground rose, and went over the hill where I could not watch it farther.   I had had a view of it about a mile and a quarter.  It moved about as fast as a common horse in a horse race.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The meteor as I shall now call it, was about 300 yards long in a serpentine shape, excepting the head which resembled the root of a tree plucked up by force.  It had no appearance of a neck, the body was thick as a bullock, tapering off like a serpent at the end of the tail.  The appearance was similar to welding hot iron and sparkling like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The immense heat warmed through my whole house, and left a stench like burning tar and sulphur, which was smelled all the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traditions, superstitions and fabulous stories are often told of meteors, apparitions and ghosts, wherein I place but small confidence for want of confirmation, but for the above, mine own eyes, and sound mind and body bear witness of the truth I have here related.  As witness my hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Carlisle, August 23, 1823.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
