Just over our garden we noticed a large very bright light falling slowly to the ground until it was no longer visable.  This light was not a white light like the moon and stars but a yellow/gold light and extremly bright making the moon and stars look dull.  It looked the same size as the moon.  I have never seen something so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed this light as I opened the back door to have a cigerette and myself and my mother noticed it straight away.  It was so big that we were literally waiting for an explosion or something to follow as it went out of sight, but none came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

5/31/06 01:37|Palm Desert|CA|Light|10 minutes|Four Green lights in a line moving from South to North|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50775.html|2|ndxe200605| Four Green lights in a line moving from South to North<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a field supervisor for a security company in the area and I was walking away from doing a patrol hit. I was looking at my vehicle when I saw something out of the corner of my eye that caused me to look up at the sky. When I looked up I saw four green lights in a line about 600 feet above the ground. I was facing north and watched the lights for about 10 minutes until I could not see them any more. They traveled from about a 45 degree angle to a 90 degree angle in that 10 minute period that I watched them. While they traveled a tree was partially covering them but I could still see them through the leaves and branches. There was no sound coming from them at all. There was no other lights flashing like it would have been if it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being in the security business we are trained to be observant and to watch for things out of the ordinary. Living in the desert allows for great views of the night sky so I know I didn’t see Jupiter since I had my back to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were sitting on top of the car hood and noticed that the whole sky was strobing! It fluxuated between darker and then a second of lighter then darker navy blue. It was like really intense heat lightning. And then I saw something else in the sky, a small, black circle. It grew fast into a large, black hole and even blotted out the stars. This was near the vicinity of the Big Dipper looking strait up and towards the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then a craft came through the middle of the hole that was lighter black - kind of dark grey , and it appeared as it emerged from the hole and slowed it&#39;s speed after the whole thing came through. The craft was shaped like a sphere or a disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the black hole shrunk the same way it emerged and the craft disappeared  and then everything disappeared, nothing was left but strobing sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband witnessed the strobing sky but not the &#34;gateway&#34; or the craft because that part only lasted at most a few seconds although the strobing lights in the sky lasted maybe 10 minutes, and my husband was looking at another part of the sky. He does say however that my description was similar to an event he witnessed 3 years ago up north in Alaska with the &#34;portal&#34; and a dark saucer shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My son saw two big lights going together but crossing each other while following a smaller and straight going light appearing higher than the two others, no noise, they came from a clear patch and went trough the lowest clouds withish on a dark background.  My son called me on the Balcony at that point, and together we saw them going trough the clouds in a very smooth random pattern, (following the smaller light that I could not see probably because of the clouds),the movement was smooth and swaying like the course that fishes swimming in a pond would take.  They were easily visible trough the really low clouds, and it was clear that they were not attached to each other, they would come close together and then move apart in a weird ballet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There may have been a second but not 100 % sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the last star on the big dipper heading westward (at position the big dipper was in at the time mentioned) near two other visible stars is where the object was seen leaving the earths atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For more information contact me<n>

They were moving about randomly in a small area sort of making circles and moves like figure eights. I called my wife out to look and just as she stepped out, the lights got very bright, like car head lights 100 feet away. This lasted about 15 seconds before the lights dimmed again to when I first saw them, and then they all moved off to the east going very, very fast and I lost sight of them going over some trees. There was no noise, and the lights were much brighter than the couple of stars visible as the sky was still a little light from sunset. I have seen many airplanes and helicopters in my life, and these were not normal aircraft, nor meteors, nor lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/29/06 20:00|Miami|FL|Fireball|60 seconds|Red/White Ball seen from Passenger Plane, 4PM, over Miami Int. Airport, Memorial Day 06, approach.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50763.html|9|ndxe200605| Red/White Ball seen from Passenger Plane, 4PM, over Miami Int. Airport, Memorial Day 06, approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was witnessed by airline passenger, port side, facing Easterly.  On final approach to MIA, at about 3:55 PM, while plane was making final 180 degree turn, at approximately 4 to 3000 feet altitude, a glowing red-white ball crossed our path.  This crossing was below us, at approximatly 2000 feet, and at the general center point of the radius for which our airplane was turning around.  This fire-ball appeared to be traveling northbound, paralleling the SR-997 to the East.  If we were traveling at 222 mph, I estimate the ball was traveling 120 mph.  No change in vector was observed of the ball.  If I were able to have streched out my arm, and pinched my fingers together and opened them a bit, the gap would have been 1/4 to 3/8 inch.  If that ball was 1500 feet away from my eye, it might have been 10 to 15 foot in diameter.  The lumens given off pulsated strongly from red to white to read, with no observed briliance disipation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wether conditions were overcast, no direct sun.  Thunder clouds were starting to form at that time, and sky darkened by the 5 oclock hour.  No rain fell at airport, and no thunder or lightening was abserved by me durring the 2 hours I remained at the airport, awaiting a connection.  85F, cloudy, still air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made special effort to disprove what I was seeing.  I do have 20/20 vision, and I am not color blind.  I was not drinking or druging at the time.  I witnessed this ball for more than half the duration of the 180 degree turn the aircraft made, aproximately for 45 seconds.  The angle of the object, with respect to the floor of the aircraft, was just below the parallel of the floor, and drifting rearward.  The object left my view when we continued across its path and onward to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below where the ball was seen are active surface mines, with associated lakes of varying shades of green to grey.  These may be cement or sand or shell bed mines, I am not sure.  It was labor day, and 4 of the 10 mines there showed activity with dump trucks and conveyors.  The mine imediately below the object did not appear to be active.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane was full, and I was in seat 32A.  I was interested in speaking with the pilot, but the cabin was still shut when I exited the plane.  At the time, I did not feel the need to wait for the pilot, for I needed to catch the next plane, in a different terminal.  I also thought he&#39;d think I was insane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not feel alarm while observing this ball, but I did feel like this may be a ufo probe mapping the planet running concentric passes, around and around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No powerlines were visable to me in the area.  I have e-mailed a MapPoint sketch of the area where it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I write this I have thought of possible glide path markers that would indicate were pilots need to turn for approach at night.  This is a good piece of doubt to ponder.  It was daylight out, and I did not see any tower structures at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be very large,low in the sky and hovering.  The sky was mostly clear with a few clouds. There was no sound or other aircraft in the sky at the time. There was no metalic reflection from the object. The object did not appear to be moving (left or right) from my angle although it rapidly got smaller and smaller before it dissapeared.As the object was getting smaller a couple walked up from behind me and and asked what is was. So I know it had a very unusual appearance. I am just curious if anyone else reported any sightings in that area on the same day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/29/06 17:30|Jeffersonville|IN|Other|6 to 8 minutes|Multiple witness viewing of unusual object over major metropolitan area|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57712.html|11|ndxe200605| Multiple witness viewing of unusual object over major metropolitan area<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the late afternoon of Memorial Day 2006, I was visiting with a friend that resides in Jeffersonville, In located adjacent to Louisville, Ky across the Ohio river.  I reside in Louisville, and frequently visit said friend as we have a 20 plus year friendship.  The day was fairly mundane and customary of the visits- on this particular day we were having a cookout to celebrate the holiday.   My friends brother of which Im also closely acquainted,  had also arrived and was assisting us with preparing the food.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing in a group in the patio area of my friends apartment, when for no particular reason I happened to glance upward facing East.  Immediately I viewed an object which was instantly unusual and atypical to me.  I called it to the attention of my friends.  For the next several minutes we observed this object in silence, then I suggested my friend go retrieve his binoculars.  Roughly 2 minutes later my friend appeared outside again with the binoculars and each of us in turn observed the object more closely through the binoculars.  This had the effect of enhancing the unusual nature of what we were witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather that day was partly cloudy with a storm approaching from the west.  We were each facing east where visibility was clear.  It was approximately 5:30 in the afternoon and the sky was a crisp blue where visible to the east.  A bank of thin clouds were immediately overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object we were viewing was a very stark black of perfectly square configuration.  The object had no surface features, no protrusions, no reflectivity and no oscillation.  The was no sound accompanying the object.  Upon first viewing the object it was roughly 25 degrees from the horizon and stationary.  As soon as I first viewed the object, it began ascending along a single vector straight upward at a very slow leisurely pace.  The object maintained it&#39;s relative configuration, size, speed of ascension, and color value the entire duration of the sighting and ascended until it dissapeared behind the above cloud bank.  With my arm outstretched the object would have been approximately the size of my forefinger nail.   As the object was against the backdrop of the sky there was no frame of reference to accurately determine distance or relative size of the object.   If I were to make a presumption based on my own depth perception of the objects spatial orientation it appeared to be closer rather than further, less than 2 miles away, making it roughly the size of an automobile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in clear view long enough for a discussion during the sighting on what it clearly was not.  An entire gambit of possible explanations was dismissed as we were all viewing the object.  The object was clearly not an aircraft of conventional configuration, balloon, parasail, garbage bag, insect, bird, toy, kite,  or illusory figment.   This was a tangible, solid object that possessed mass and weight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately contacted 911 and was instructed to contact New Albany or Jeffersonville police department, of which I did neither as the event was over and the object was no longer visible.   Additionally I contacted Louisville international airport and spoke with the radar operator.  The operator indicated there was nothing unusual in the sky over southern Indiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event left me disturbed and confounded.   I have a background in Psychology and I am fully aware of the many mechanisms within the human mind that can create potential misinterpretations of visual stimuli.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The irony is while observing this object I distinctly recall all of these formal concepts raced through my mind it seemed,  and none of these were satisfactory to me.  Remotely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is one thing to read about unexplained aerial phenomenon over the years, but to actually witness something that defies frame of reference or educational background  is quite startling.  I consider myself a fairly learned and educated individual with a working knowledge of meteorology, astronomy, physics, military aircraft, and human perception, yet the object I witnessed defied all of these schools of thought and rationale.  I am the type of person that doesn&#39;t enjoy mysteries and despite researching, careful contemplation, review, and even soul-searching, I never discovered an explanation that satisfies what I and my friends witnessed. A square object is not even aerodynamic, to say nothing of the stark black appearance of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not prepared to say what I viewed was of extraterrestrial origin, yet at the same time I am prepared to say what I viewed does not belong in the sky  over a major metropolitan area in broad daylight for all the world to see.  There was a strange eerie stillness to the whole event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my knowledge no one else viewed this object with the exception of the  three of us, despite our close proximity to Interstate 65 which runs through southern Indiana and Louisville Ky. I would be quite curious if there was anyone else that happened to view this object that day.  To be perfectly honest, I would be relieved if it were infact mundane and simply mis-identified.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They also looked like they could have been pairs of spheres attached to each other.  Three of these moving very quickly, and I saw them for around one minute.  There had been a cloud stream-producing aircraft to the north of these objects moments before they appeared.  At first I saw one, then almost immediately two others appeared.  Then within a minute, they had moved farther southeast and higher into the sky until I could just barely see one of them, then I could not see them at all.  By the time I took photos, only one was visible to me (barely), and it did not show up on my digital camera photos.  Also, the objects seemed to be silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was the object traveling slower, faster, or about the same speed, as a plane would fly? Faster for the maneuvers it was making, but not meteorite speed, just slightly too fast for convention aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15. If it was a very close sighting, did you feel any kind of a physical sensation? Not that close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 16. What do you estimate the size of the object was?

Their dog barked, but as I stated, that was most likely do to me going into the driveway.  It stopped barking when it recognized me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 32. Did any of the witnesses experience psychological or physiological effects during or after the event, such as fear, anxiety, nose breeds, burns, headache, rash, etc (please describe as much as you can)? If yes, were you treated by a doctor for such symptoms and what was the physicians’ findings? None known.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 33. How long did the sighting last? About a minute and a half from my best estimate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 34. When you witnessed the object was it in the air the whole time, or was it on the ground? In the air the entire time, making a series of S-turns and a few north to south zigzag motions.  I gauged the motions by first using a large tree, it wasn’t windy, however when I moved positions I gauged the movement against the side of the house which I knew wind would not affect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 35. If on the ground, did any occupants come out of the object? Not on ground, no occupants.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 36. If yes to the above question, then please described the occupants: size, skin color/type, eyes shape and color, what they were wearing, how many were there, what were they doing, did they see you, how did they react to you, was there any kind of communication between them or you and them, how long did they stay?

Were you able to get any photographic pictures or video of the sighting and would you like to post your images on our site? If no photographic pictures, then could you provide a sketch/s of the object/s? No photos, yes I could sketch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 39. After witnessing the sighting, what is your impression to what you think it might have been? I know it was not a conventional aircraft.  My father was in the Air Force and worked on the Gemini and Apollo programs in flight simulators.  He was also later in life on the helicopter unit of a sheriff’s department.  I was in the Army and was also taught to recognize aircraft and lived close to Nellis AFB for a few years.  I am used to seeing strange aircraft maneuvers.  This was a new one.  Definitely unconventional maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was visible for just under 2 minutes, from first appearance to flying towards my direction and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) 0122 - object suddenly appeared in the southern sky (as if a light had been turned on), then moved extremely fast to the east before disappearing (as if the light had then been turned off). There was no cloud obstruction, it was low in altitude, and had an angle of elevation of 30 degrees. It was approximately 1 magnitude dimmer than Sirius, and travelled a horizontal distance of the tip of my thumb to my wrist held at arm&#39;s length in just under a second. Its light was a quick movement of light, similar to taking a flashlight and moving in front of you from one side to the other as fast as you can. It was not a lasting streak (a line) like a meteor or flare. Like all previous objects, it had no other lights other than its white light body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) 0138 - object seen moving from south to north. It was very faint, and moved with a slow, stop-start motion, like a person trying to walk in sludge. It disappeared overhead to my left after about 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) 0216 - object seen moving from southeast to northwest. It was very similar to the previous object, very faint and with a jerky type of motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5) 0225 - object streaked across the sky from east to west at incredible speed. It had an angle of elevation of about 45 degrees, and, like object #2 from tonight, was at a lower altitude than the others. It was 1 magnitude brighter than Sirius, with its light characteristics similar to object #2 as well, i.e. it was a quick movement of light and not a lasting streak line. I got the sense that it was closer in distance to me than any of the other objects seen over my 3 nights of observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6) 0234 - object seen moving from south to north. Its movement was slower than the other objects seen tonight; I would almost call it graceful. It was about the same speed as a passenger aircraft as seen at 36,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7) 0238 - object seen moving from northwest to southeast. Like objects #3 and #4, it had a slow, stop-start type of motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8) 0240 – a conventional aircraft was seen and heard moving from west to east. It had an angle of elevation of about 45 degrees, and an altitude of, I would estimate, 10,000 feet. It had a setup of lights consisting of a white anti-collision light on the underside of its fuselage and 2 red position lights on each wing. The blinking of the lights was very unusual to me - it is best described as imagining an object bouncing through the lights from one end to the other; it was an alternating fashion of blinking which I am not familiar with. As mentioned in my previous reports, aircraft (apart from fighter jets and other two-seater military training aircraft) are very uncommon here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9) 0258 - object seen moving from south to north. It was very dim, but did not have the peculiar movement of the three previous dim objects. It passed straight over my head and out of sight after about 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped observing at 0320. This was another eventful evening that, once again, at times left me speechless. I am planning to contact the local air force base later today to see if I can glean anything from them.<n>

It was so still I recall noticing how bright the light was but didn&#39;t bother looking up because I thought it was just the moon. Once I glanced up and noticed it was blue and not the moon, it immediately jetted to the east at an extremely high rate of speed - from where we were standing it was like twenty feet and it was then behind the tops of our trees - then it stayed there but the light dimmed and made wiggly trails and disappeared. My friend and I started freaking out about it. It was unusual because it &#34;hovered&#34; above in the clearing almost like it had been watching us, once we looked up and noticed it, it took off. Never seen anything like it in my life. This was not a plane or helicopter or firework - it was in the air totally not moving or making noise for a good minute before it shot off to the right (east). We were facing north. It was like it was watching us. Big blue glowing sphere shape. Then it disappeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was thou|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50755.html|17|ndxe200605| While sitting outside, at the same moment two persons notices a bright flash in the northern sky, right of the big dipper.  It was thought to be a meteorite until  it happened again, in exactly the same location and wasn&#39;t streaking as a meteorite would.  Over a 20 minute period the light contined to flash, rhythmically, every 5-6 seconds.  At times it appeared strong enough to be a ground based, advertising spotlight, albeit very far away, but it never had a &#34;line of light&#34; from the ground.  It appeared to be approximately the length of a thumbnail, when held to the sky and it never changed location, although it appeared that the direction of the &#34;beam&#34; may have been rotating.  The sky was very clear, stars being visible, although there was some whispy, high misty clouds at high altitudes, which sometimes made the light appear a bit &#34;fuzzy&#34; and not so distinct.  Then, after observing it for 20 minutes or so, it got dimmer (still never changing location) and then just stopped.  We checked up till 45 minutes later and never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Initially, we thought it was a star, however it  was moving erraticallly.  It would be still for awhile then it would move to the left or right and make circle patterns.  Eratic movements best describes it but it never got closer.  Planes came and went and they looked totally different.  It appeared to &#34;sparkle&#34; but would change hue from white to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/28/06 20:45|Spring Hill|TN|Flash|1 second|Flash/Pulse of light shooting through Big Dipper|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50839.html|19|ndxe200605| Flash/Pulse of light shooting through Big Dipper<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my kitchen, looking out the window facing the W/NW. (this was shortly after sunset, &amp; the sky was just getting dark) I saw a Red &#34;fireball&#34; that got my attention, which was similar to a flare being fired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside a few minutes later to look in the sky &amp; see if any of my neighbors might be shooting fireworks or flares... there were no other &#34;fireballs&#34; that followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching the sky, and was looking at the &#34;Big Dipper&#34;. (Which is almost perpendicular to the land horizon this time of year) At 8:45PM I saw a thick, white, &#34;flash/streak&#34; of light &#34;shoot&#34; through the center of the &#34;cup&#34; of the Dipper.  It came in from behind the &#34;handle&#34; &amp; traveled between the 4 stars that make up the &#34;cup&#34;..... (Megrez, Phecda, Merak, &amp; Dubhe.)  It was a perfectly centered path through the cup, &amp; was 1/2 the width, or thickness of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (If you were to scale the cup of the Big Dipper at let&#39;s say, 4 inches deep, the &#34;flash/streak&#34; would be 2 inches thick, by 4-6 inches long, &amp; split the center perfectly, leaving an inch on both sides.)  The &#34;object&#34;/flash/ was not a bright streak like a meteor, but was more of a &#34;beam&#34;, or &#34;pulse&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was faint but clearly visible.  I&#39;d say the brightness could be compared to the glow of the Milky Way on a good clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a quick pulse, lasting about a second or just under, &amp; then was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of the &#34;flash&#34; &amp; &#34;beam/contrails&#34; of the 1991 Space Shuttle Discovery Video &#34;STS 48&#34; .....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ...where an &#34;object&#34; is seen coming over Earth&#39;s horizon moving in a straight direction..... &amp; then in the lower left corner of the screen a noticeable &#34;Flash&#34; occurs, which causes the &#34;object&#34; (along with a couple others) to suddenly change directions at a 90 degree angle &amp; accelerate outward away from Earth.  Immediately following the mysterious flash, there are 2 &#34;beams/pulses/contrails&#34; that are visible speeding toward the direction of the main object that rose up over the Earth horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;Flash/Pulse&#34; I saw go through the Big Dipper, was very similar to the ones that appear to be &#34;fired&#34; at the mystery object in the STS 48 Video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was unlike any other &#34;UFO&#34; sightings I&#39;ve seen, &amp; don&#39;t feel that it was a craft of any sort.... but then again, I just don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/28/06 20:00|Santa Clara|CA|Oval|15 seconds|Fast moving gliding oval shaped object in the sky just before Great America Parkway Fireworks event on Sunday May 28, 2006.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50774.html|20|ndxe200605| Fast moving gliding oval shaped object in the sky just before Great America Parkway Fireworks event on Sunday May 28, 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tend to think that this was a man made object - I do not believe in UFOs. I could have dismissed this as some kind of balloon - except that something struck me odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was some kind of oval shaped object - perhaps the closest thing I can think of is football (american). No visible things protruding outside the eliptical, oval shell shape. I can&#39;t remember the color, but I think it was sort of greyish. This thing was so benign and innocent that you would see it but would not even notice it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So naturally fitting in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized that there were three things odd - (1) it was high in the sky must be roughly somewhere between 1000 ft to 10000 ft - a plane flew from San Jose airport and its size and height was of the comparable order. So, I thought it perhaps is not a balloon as I have not seen balloons of  plane sizes.  (2) It was moving at an incredible thing. It did not look like any object having an engine - no audible noise, no smoke trail, and it was sort of gliding - something like an orphan kite. But it was going from west to east, and speed seemed 10 times faster than a jet. It cleared the whole sky in my view in less than 15 seconds, while I think a plane would have taken at least 2 minues or so. (3) towards the end it was so far that I would have lost it anyway but then it sort of started gaining altitude. Significant gain in about a couple of seconds. If it was not for logically thinking about these things, I would have completely ignored and not even remembered about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my Dad. As I felt something odd about this object, I pointed it to my dad. He saw this as well. I pointed to him my logical inconsistency of speed - he seemed to agree. We were in Great America Parkway waiting for the fireworks when this happened. Time must be between 8:00 to 8:30pm. There must be a few thousand people right there looking into the sky. I did not talk to any one, but I was hoping that someone else saw it. I surfed web to see any information, tried to dismiss it as some sort of balloon. But could not find any conclussive evidence either way. Nor did find any one else mentioning this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I decided to report it. If there are more people who saw this and can conclussively identify this as man made object, I would be thankful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This would solve the puzzle and satisfy my curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that I am not an expert on aircrafts, balloons, natural phenomenon, or any other such things that could explain many of the so called UFO sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this, it was no optical illusion as it was a solid object. It was not any of the usual kind aircraft with wings etc.. as this object had nothing protruding out of its shell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I drove, and he asked if I could stop down in Chinatown so he could pick up some tea and some new teacups.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took 95-N and got off at the Washington Ave exit, and proceeded up Washington Ave to 7th St. A few blocks before I turned onto 7th, I was looking up at the clouds when I saw something just kind of sitting there in the clouds that I could not identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we turned south on 7th St., we pulled into a parking lot just off the intersection and across from Pho Ha where my father wanted to stop. I decided to hop out and use the DV camcorder my folks bought for my girlfriend and I back in Novemember when our son was born, and started recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The quality is not the best, and there&#39;s a Vietnamese band playing in the background in part of the footage but take a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s clearly not an airplane or a helicopter.  Around 2:38, I zoom all the way out to show just how far away this thing is, and based on that (which you&#39;ll see), I don&#39;t feel confident that it&#39;s a balloon as from that distance, even with my good eyesight, I don&#39;t think I would have seen a regular balloon flying that high, that far away, with the late afternoon sun kind of in my eyes otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So by definition, it&#39;s a UFO. What exactly it is, I don&#39;t know but enjoy, let others know for enjoyment if you want, and leave some comments if you want.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote about it on my website here - (http://phillybits.blogspot.com/2006/05/ufo-sighting-over-philadelphia.html)  Video can be seen here - (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKEk5nu00lQ)<n>

I figured it must have just been  a statlite, but at that moment, it moved awkardly backwards, diagonally. It was much more visible before, but no i have to lean out of my porch to see it. It is what looks like 3 star clumped to form a triangle. It is no bigger than your fingernail, a full arms length away. It has changed colors, but in very long timespans. It went from whioth saw it and belive it is te, to red, blue and green light. It has what seems to be a trail of light connected to it. MY dad and siter both saw it and agree that it is a ufo. I triangulated its position, and it seems to be above me, a little bit closer to the horizon.<n>

The light appeared with a flash and took less than a second to cross the sky.  The light was radiating heavily and looked to have extuinguished before coming in contact with the ground.  The size of the object is uncertain because of the distance and the rate of speed.  It looked to be quite large, and I would speculate that it exceeded the size of a full size truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have been looking at it, and as my witnesses left, it started to move slightly, like trying to message me, as it moved, it made what looked like to be shapes. It moved at a steady rate, then returned to a state of rest. Although it looked originally like a star, it moved, and in too awkward a shape to be a satalite.  There is what seems like a trail of light. Im still looking at it as i type this, and it still moves ocoasionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/27/06 22:00|Saluda|VA|Changing|20 Seconds|UFO(s) spotted at sprint car race in Virginia, 4 (?) objects spotted|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50749.html|30|ndxe200605| UFO(s) spotted at sprint car race in Virginia, 4 (?) objects spotted<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at a ASCS sprint car race at Virginia Motor Speedway in Saluda, Virginia. I saw 4 bright lights ascend, and then hover in the air for approx. 5 seconds and fly away. The area is rather remote so I ruled out being commercial aircraft. I work at a military installion, NAS Oceana where we have many F-18 fighter aircraft flying. It was not F-18&#39;s because the only time they fly with their lights on is when they are on the ground taxiing, or when they are approaching the runway. I know there is a coast guard facility about 30 miles from the track, but I don&#39;t think what I saw could have been done by a helicopter. I have lived near an airport (CID, Cedar Rapids Iowa Municipal Airport) all my life, and never seen anything like I saw this evening. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m 100% sure it was something abnormal, but being around aviation my whole life, nothing I have ever seen was like I saw tonight. I was with two other friends, and one dismissed it as he figured it was just a small aircraft, but my other friend thought it looked quite out of the ordinary as well. I saw 4 lights, which where white in color, and I saw them moving across the sky at a fairly quick rate, and then they stopped for about 5 seconds and continued on their way. It looked to me as if all four lights were independent, but my friend who agreed that something weird had happened wasn&#39;t sure. I heard someone else say that they were Speed TV&#39;s helicopters covering the race, but I was at the track before the sprint cars were racing and they never passed over the track, and I never heard them or anything. The only possible explanation I can come up with was that they were F-18s flying in formation, but why they did they have their lights on? Why were they 80 miles away from their normal fly zone? Why didn&#39;t I hear the engines? How did they hover in the air for nearly five seconds without changing direction? The objects were going to fast for how close the lights were, but I didn&#39;t hear anything, and that was one of the main reasons I found what I saw very strange. Please get back to me to let me know what was going on. I&#39;ve always been a skeptic of UFO&#39;s but what I saw tonight was nothing like I have ever seen. Please let me know if there were any others that that thought it was strange, there had to be at least 1,000 people at the race tonight, I know other people saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Good health and good vision.   Took dog out for evening walk on Saturday, May 27, 2006, at exactly 9:12 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky was covered with coulds.  There was rain predictions for later at night.  As I walked out of the house....I looked up in the sky, looking northwest, to check for any clearance in the sky and to see if it will rain as to make the decision to go for a 20 minute walk with my dog.   My dog Lear, does not like to get wet...and he refused to walk and was heading back home.   I took another look at the sky and there was absolutely no visible sky, stars, etc....it was a gray dark evening....I looked at my watch, it was exactly 9:12 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up at the sky , three bright ligths appeard in the sky.....they were evenly spaced.   I watched the formation for about 8 seconds.......two more light appeard below the three and about 8 seconds following another light lit up about the same distance from the two lights as the two lights had from the first three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a perfect cone shape...or an inverted Christmas Tree shape.   The light persisted shining for another 5 to 8 seconds.....and went out all at once.   In another five sconds the two light went on again and remained bright for about 8 seconds and then all the light went out.   There was no sound from jet plane to be heard since O&#39;Hare Air Post is not far away and at times planes fly directly over Northbrook on take offs.    The lights were stationary and there was no sound of any airplane at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All four were in a square formation. 2 flickered on and off, disappeared then reappeared.  Then one by one they slowly faded.  Almost immediately after they faded an airplane flew right through the path.  Most bizarre experience of our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a beam of light shining down that seemed to be scanning the ground between the house and the woods. The window was open with only a screen window in the room. I heard a technological sound, a whirring if you will. My wife was in the room but I did not want to wake her. We drove back home the next day which was an eight hour drive after visiting family. I then remembered looking throught a magnify glass looking device and I saw the same beam of light from above looking down through the light. I saw a uniformed pant leg walk into the light and disappear. I was looking down through the light at about tree top level. I believe I was inside the craft?<n>
5/27/06 01:00|Pocahontas|AR|Oval|1 hour|Apparently intelligently controled objects spotted in Pocahontas Arkansas|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50751.html|34|ndxe200605| Apparently intelligently controled objects spotted in Pocahontas Arkansas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to gaze at the stars because it was such a pretty night. First I see withinin a 20- minute period 3 oval shaped objects which I have seen in the past. They were flying at what appeared to be normal speed, but they didn&#39;t have flashing beacons nor did they make a sound, they were just lit up. The objects flew from east to west in the same path each time, after that I just thought &#34;Wow&#34; another sighting of some of those strange lights that I have saw many times before. What happened next is still unbelievable to me as I sit here and write it. I sttod there in the same area of my backyard, for a few minutes, I had my spotlight with me because it is so dark out there and I try to watch for snakes, we have alot of copperhead snakes around here! Well&#39; here comes another object, now the first two objects were approximately 30 40 thousand feet in altitude, it is really according to how big they were, they looked small of course. This next object was much lower and it was coming from the east. it was traveling at a relitively low speed, just to be silly and playing around I shined my spolight toward the object. What happened next is wild, The object slowed down to almost a complete stop as I flashed and blinked the spotlight at it. It then continued to gain a little more speed and it continued on. As I was still watching that object, here comes another out of the west. This one was about 15 to 20 thousand feet in altitude, and again no sound or no flashing beacon, just lit up. All objects were low enough that I could have heard an engine. Again, I shined my spotlight at it and held it on it for several seconds, now remember you can see a spotlight from an airplane if you are looking for it. Already amzed and almost chilled from the last craft, this one began to slow down as well, almost to a complete stop, I wasn&#39;t believing my own eyes.And then it bagn to speed up after I continued shining the light toward it, as it was speeding up it was climbing, at a rate that was just unreal, it looked as though it shot into space, within seconds I just simply couldn&#39;t see it anymore. People say &#34;oh those things are those UAV&#39;s that the air force uses, I am sorry I don&#39;t think so,at the altitude that these objects were, I could have heard them and they are not capable of climbing as fast as that object did. Those objects, especially the last two without doubt were under intelligent control, and I don&#39;t think it was of the this earth. If they were UAV&#39;s of the Air force, why would we be spending tax dollars for them to fly over Pocahontas Ark.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then we saw a weird shape move very fast and low across the trees. It looked like a circle that came to a point at the top, with the point being at the rear of the craft. It went really fast over us but then turned around maybe a couple thousand feet down. We got really scared and turned to run but it just flew over us again. Interestingly, the noise stayed at the same sound level regardless of how close the craft was. Also, there was a faint light coming from the entire craft, just barely enough the distinguish it from the night sky. We tried to take a few pictures as it was leaving but I don&#39;t know how they will turn out.<n>

I would say that this light lasted for about 25 secs, possibly less. This light did not move, then suddenly it just vanished in an upwards motion!<n>

Well by now I had pulled over and we had gotten out of the car when remembering that I had a camera on my cell phone and it was better than nothing I was scrambling to find it in the bottom of my purse, but it was too late as the object started to really move rapidly and just as I raised the phone to take a picture of it  the tail end of it disappeared behind the peak of the mountain. I called a couple of news stations to see if it may have been reported by anyone else and apparently it had not, I also got on the internet to look up photos of other sightings around the world and I did find a couple that look exactly like the one we saw. I&#39;m just happy I wasn&#39;t alone and had another witness with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/26/06 03:00|Laurie|MO|Disk|20 minutes|Spinning, brightly-lit flying saucer approached me from across the lake|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50759.html|39|ndxe200605| Spinning, brightly-lit flying saucer approached me from across the lake<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside at about 3 a.m. by myself at the Lake of the Ozarks in Laurie, MO. I started noticing a star randomly blinking light that was very obvious and bright. The sky then began to flash at random, like a camera, but much softer than lightning. I started noticing more activity within the stars, such as random blinking red and green lights as well as the flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My attention turned back to the original blinking star. It would flash, disappear, then flicker around frantically while alternating red and green lights. After about 20 minutes of watching this the star shot abrubtly into the sky at tremendous speed, and proceeded to come across the lake at the same incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 15 seconds, I could see a flying saucer above the lake which looked to be about 350-400 feet above the ground. The main body of the ship was like an intertube ((sic)), wrapping around a circular dome on top of the ship. The intertube part had magnificent white lights, in vertical rectangular forms, surrounding it in an even pattern as it was rotating clockwise with the lights flashing in no particular pattern. The dome top was rotating the opposite direction as the intertube (counterclockwise) and had smaller, circular red and green lights surrounding it, which were also being lit up as it spun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The outline of the ship was very clearly defined by the extremely bright lights it was emitting. It&#39;s strange though, because the lights were something I had never seen before, as if it were an energy source we couldn&#39;t even comprehend, but the lights weren&#39;t too bright to look at, even though they were by far the brightest lights i&#39;ve ever witnessed. It&#39;s trajectory was perfect, flawless, as it came from the stars towards me across the lake. It was absolutely silent and moved at a rate I couldn&#39;t even describe, but was still very visible and clear as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it neared me I debated for a split second whether to stay out and see what happens or to run inside, because half of me was incredibly curious and in awe while the other half of me was more terrified than I had ever been in my life. I ran inside and woke my friend who accounts me being &#34;white as a ghost&#34; and &#34;frantically explaining what I saw&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me, the best way I can describe what I saw, is that the stars were camoflauging some sort of ship, which then proceeded across the lake towards me uncamoflauged and in perfect sight. I got the feeling that I had seen something which I shouldn&#39;t, and that the flying saucer was actually coming towards ME, and me specifically, from across the lake.<n>

This time I had my binoculars and a proper, non-intrusive light for writing, and recorded the following activity.  All objects were similar to the ones I saw the previous night, that is small white lights the size of stars. Observation under binoculars revealed they had no other lights of any kind. Unless otherwise noted, they continued in the specified direction until disappearing out of sight. At no point during the evening did I hear any noise in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) 0039 - object seen moving from west to east<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) 0046 - object seen moving from south to north<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) 0051 - object seen moving from southeast to northwest<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) 0057 - object seen moving from south to north.

It was positioned at about an angle of elevation of 80 degrees, and shortly after appearing gave off a bright flash approximately one magnitude level brighter than Sirius, then disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9) 0117 - object seen moving from southeast to northwest.  At this point the sky started to become significantly cloudy and visibility reduced. The night started off clear but became progressively more cloudy, and sightings became more sparse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10) 0131 - object seen moving from southeast to northwest. It was positioned at about an angle of elevation of 85 degrees, and was moving very rapidly, much faster than any of the other objects. I would estimate its speed to be at least three times the speed of a passenger aircraft as seen at 36,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11) 0154 – object seen moving from south to north. Its angle of elevation and speed were similar to the previous object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12) 0208 – object appearing in the east rose vertically with great speed, then seemed to disappear behind cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 13) 0213 – object seen moving from west to east, but seemed to disappear behind cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped observing at 0245. The activity was similar to the previous night in terms of the objects&#39; brightness (magnitudes varied, but most were approximately +1), elevation (most were at around 40 to 50 degrees, except where noted), and distance (this was again hard to determine, but I would put it at no more than 20,000 to 30,000 feet). I will continue to monitor the sky here and report any other activity.<n>

Moving way too fast to be an aircraft and made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 27 at approx. 0030 hrs I observed what I first thought was an approaching aircraft out of the west. This would be a normal activity. It was a cloudy night as we had just had thunderstorms and althought the rain had stopped clouds still hung in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first observation was of a double pulse of white light that i initailly thought were wing beacons as the pulsed twice very rapidly. I waited for the secound pulse and when it came the object had moved way too fast in the sky. it now appeared almost directly overhead with the same two pulse beacon light. It stayed in the same area with the secound sighting. and pulsed there with the same two white flashes about 8 times in the course of 2 and a half mins. during this whole time the object made no sound. even thought it appeared to be directly overhead. Then back on the horizon I observed an actual aircraft that headed east toward my location ( Commerical aircraft ) and the turned to the north. This aircraft as it got closer had sound and it never came close. As I waited for the pulse of beacons I observed it pulse twice more as it shot back across the horizon from the south to the north just above the tree line. What ever it was it was very very fast and made no sound that i could hear. I never actually saw a craft just the two pulses of bright white light very close together and it seemed to have no sequence, in the time between the pulses. The cloud ceiling was low but I don&#39;t know what hight it was, but surely if an aircraft was under the cloud ceiling and moved like this thing I would have heard some noise from the engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a Police Officer for 11 years and prior to that I was in the Air Force stationed in Dover Delaware. I have never saw or claimed to have seen a UFO until now. I am sure it can be explained. For several moments I thought it might have been a glider, But again it moved way to fast from one spot in the sky to another<n>

As I looked up in to the sky storm clouds were coming in. I looked a bit closer and thought I saw a straight line going across the clouds. I thought it looked a bit wierd. I followed the line till it dropped straight down forming the back end of what looked like a triangle. As I kept looking I saw that the lines were moving. The clouds were moving as well but the triangle was moving faster. I couldn&#39;t see the object but only the outer edge where it met the clouds. As the object cleared the clouds and came into the clear sky it disappeared. Little by little the object turned into nothing. It appeared as if the object was cloaked some how.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry if this sounds weird I would not normally report something like this and never have before but it scared the heck out of me.

It was near Jupiter.  It first looked like a star, but then I saw that it blue and it was blinking.  It was circular and did not move at all.  IT disapered after 20 min.  There where some trees around but it did not move at all so I could see it all the time.<n>

The engines were all stopped and my daughter and I were on the 5th floor, out on the balcony of our room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking out to sea for any sighs of coastguard help that may be on the way for rescue.  This was approximately 2 and ½ hours after the engines had stopped.  The waters were calm with little wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out on the horizon there was a very small amber colored light that seemed stationary.  I pointed this light out to my daughter, and commented that this may be a boat or some vehicle to assist with the search and rescue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching this light it changed from an amber dot of light to a white tower shaped light.  At the same time it started to move rapidly towards the ship.  Within a minute it traveled from the horizon to 100-300 feet from the side of the ship and stopped.  The was no noise emanating from the light source. The water however was churning and upset.  The engines of the ship were still at all stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light remained aside the ship, still and hovering for about 40 seconds, then was gone from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We remained in this area for 14 hours.  There was an coastguard airplane that flew by several times circling the boat, from far off.  This airplane was nothing like what I saw earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When morning came I went up on deck and spoke with some other passengers, and they were talking about the man who had jumped overboard, and I found no-one who mentioned this strange occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if there were others that saw what my daughter and I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((COPIED CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> -----Original Message-----<n> <n><n> From: Peter B.

I did not ask any crew if this had been logged since the event centered around the tragedy of a man jumping overboard.  We were off the ship soon afterward.  A special note: Since we were legally bound to stay in the vicinity of where the man jumped, we were going to be 14 or so hours late arriving in New York.  We were able to make brief phone call to home, but this was monitored, and no details of why we were going to be late were to be given over the phone at that time. Funny?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>
5/25/06 00:55|UK/England||Light|2 hours|Multiple luminous objects sighted in night sky|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50726.html|49|ndxe200605| Multiple luminous objects sighted in night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note to receiver: I am sending this again because I saw in the confirmation page that my apostrophes didn&#39;t display correctly as I copied and pasted the report from Microsoft Word. Please accept my apologies.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to report a series of object sightings that took place in the early hours of this past Thursday morning. I would have reported it on Thursday, but unfortunately did not have the time to do so. I observed multiple luminous objects again this (Friday) morning, and will fill out a separate report for this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned in the one previous report I sent to your website (2/19/05), as I was an astronomy student for many years, and still enjoy it as a hobby, I am familiar with the sky and the phenomena it can present, and also know about optical illusions like the one that occurs when you stare at a star for a few seconds and it appears to jump around in place. I also have very good eyesight (20/10). I say these things merely to let you know the type of observer I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sightings began at 0055 on Thursday morning, when I was settling into bed. I sleep with my curtains open, and as my bed is right next to my window, I sometimes look at the sky before I go to sleep. I live out in the Scottish countryside, where there is little light pollution, so we get some fantastic nights when the clouds stay off. This night was a totally clear night and remained so until sunrise, which is very early here in the summer (about 0430 right now, so my viewing window is short). A bright object moving in a southeast-northwesterly direction caught my eye. It was simply a white light the size of a star with no other light on or around it, and it moved slightly faster than an airplane would have at that estimated altitude. It then gave off a bright flash the size of a pinkie fingernail held at arm&#39;s length that was about twice the magnitude of Sirius. This lasted 1 second, then it continued on its course until it flew over my house and out of sight. I could hear no noise coming from the sky at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately jumped up and grabbed a pen and paper from the table in my room in case any other objects appeared and I could write down anything noteworthy.  Approximately 1 minute later, I saw two other objects heading in the same direction as this previous object. They were also both the size of a star and consisted of nothing but a point of white light, however, these 2 were lower in magnitude than the first. They flew very close to one another, a distance of 2 dimes held at arm&#39;s length. I continued to watch them until they disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have my digital camera or my binoculars in my room at this point, but I was so riveted by this that I could not bear to turn my eyes away. I started to need to use the toilet halfway through the night, but did not dare leave then, either. In any case, I knew that my camera&#39;s memory was full and its battery was not charged (though its video feature does not produce good video of the night sky anyway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this point on, these objects continued to appear, one after the other, again and again that night. Their altitudes and magnitudes varied, but they were all simply points of white light with no position lights that an aircraft would have (I confirmed this the following night with my binoculars). I jotted down details as I went along, but I was working in almost no light, except the light that was coming from outside, so my notes are not as thorough as the next night, when I had an Indiglo light that I turned on whenever I needed to write something, and was able to record the exact time and heading of each object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After one object had disappeared from view, I would stare at the center of the sky, let everything fall out of focus, and wait for any moving points of light to appear. When one appeared, I would then follow that one until it disappeared, and so on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The headings of the objects were mainly southeast-northwest and west-east. In total, I counted 14 of these objects and up to 3 unusual (what appeared to be) conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 2nd and 3rd objects I mentioned that appeared together, a new object would appear approximately every 5 minutes for the first half of the group or so (the intervals grew as time went on), and travel in one of the headings mentioned above until it was out of sight. Their movements were straight and precise, though faster than a passenger airplane. Their speeds and magnitudes would vary. One object, the 11th object, was particularly noteworthy. It seemed to appear very low in the sky, at about 10 degrees elevation, then began moving vertically upwards. It did not move straight up, but in a sort of side to side aberrant motion, even one time moving down a little before moving up. After it had reached about 30 degrees in the sky, it travelled straight down again at tremendous speed accompanied by a streak of bright white light, brighter than Sirius. It disappeared after this. It travelled a distance of about from the tip of my thumb to my wrist held at arm&#39;s length in less than 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another white object after this, same in appearance as the previous, then I noticed what appeared to be an aircraft flying towards my direction (southeast-northwest) from where the bright object was. As it approached I could hear it, and it had green and red position lights on its right and left wings, respectively. It also had a very large (the size of the head of a tack held at arm&#39;s length), pulsating white light on the underside of its fuselage. I have not seen this type of light on an aircraft before, but I am not an expert on aircraft lighting. It flew over my house at an altitude of at least 10,000 feet, I would estimate. I could hear it in the sky after it flew past my house, until its noise faded out of range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should note that passenger aircraft are not that common in our area as others, perhaps due to our location relative to the airports in the country as well as the path of other flight routes passing over the country. Our sky never seems to have any contrails in it. An aircraft of any type is uncommon, save for the fighter jets from the nearby air force base, especially at night (I hear the occasional passenger aircraft during the day when they do pass, but almost never night for some reason, even when I am up very late), and therefore one of this appearance was even more bizarre. I was to see what was either the same aircraft making more passes, or 1 or 2 other aircraft of the same type making passes, twice later on that night. It is impossible to say if it was the same craft as the first time I saw it, it passed over my house and I did not have visual contact with it the entire time. I happened to note the time of this craft, and that was at 0204. The second and third planes, the last objects I saw that night, appeared at 0253 and 0258 respectively, both heading west-east. The last white object I saw was at 0235, and I went to bed shortly after 0300.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The number and behaviour of these objects is what astounded me. I have watched meteor showers before and knew they weren&#39;t meteors. The fact that the two white objects that in particular displayed remarkable characteristics were identical to the myriad of other white objects makes it hard for me to accept at the present moment that these other objects were conventional aircraft. I should note that there is an air force base, RAF Leuchars, approximately 10 km to the northeast of here. Their fighter jets can be seen and heard flying in the skies here every day, but never at night, and make a considerable noise even when at high altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The average altitude of the objects was hard to determine. They could have been small objects quite close, or large objects considerably far away. My best estimate would be between 20,000 and 30,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not here to report conclusively what the objects were, as I cannot say this, but only to pass on this information. I will continue to monitor the sky here and report any other activity.<n>

It had one really bright light in the front and the bottom also had a much larger light, and the middle to the end of the craft had a blinking white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I told her to turn left on Locust Street so that we could at least get under it or get there before it got to us, when we were flying onto it, it passed us and the only thing that I saw was its back end which it looked very strange, really skinny in width, but really long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we saw it, we tried to chase it down, when we got to the bottom of the hill, there was nothing in the sky. Never seen anything like this before.<n>

It was very high in the sky. It started to move across the sky toward the south then turned to the east, then turned again to the north. then took off so fast that it appeared to vanish. A couple of minutes later two Airplanes (jets) flew past at a very fast rate. Over the next hour I saw at least 6 planes circling the sky. Oddly enough there was a local sighting a day or two earlier and the airbase did say they were doing some testing. But i do happen to Know from friends still in the airforce that the bases runway is suppose to be shut down for repair. All aircraft are suppose to be flying out of lincoln.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spotted a small black spot against a large cumulus cloud. I looked at it through binoculars for a few seconds,it was completely stationary-to me about 2-3mm in diameter, lots of normal a/craft in the vacinity.  (I should mention I live on an air route to m/chester airport)I then quickly grabbed my camcorder, at the vital moment it failed to work (though later it did)  It&#39;d took me 20-30 seconds to do this,and in this time the object had vanished. I should mention that I&#39;m very familiar with the appearence of earthly aircraft. It was a very nice bright day with some large clouds.  Also I should mention that UFOs have been seen in this area on and off for years.<n>

I ran inside to get my binoculars. Soon as I opened the door to come outside my mother said it just disappeared. She said one second it was blinking then it was gone.

She said it was a plane, but I&#39;ve seen a plane at night and this (UFO) didnt have no flickering lights like planes do at night. It was moving slow to the left and as if it was turning to the left cause the white light would get brighter and than it dissappeared. Than like a minute later we seen it again, this time we were going south on James and seen it as if it was like in the foothills near I5.<n>

5/23/06 21:50|Shady Spring|WV|Changing|1 hour +|Colorful Objects in Night Sky over Shady Spring, WV.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of celestial body, we suspect.  PD))|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50701.html|60|ndxe200605| Colorful Objects in Night Sky over Shady Spring, WV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observing the night sky around 9 PM, notice a solid white light traveling across the sky from southeast (Hinton, WV) to northwest (Beckley, WV) direction.  Similar to airplane movement but no blinking lights, just one solid emission.  Object slows and eventually fades out.  Keep looking for a few more minutes, nothing happens.  Then, what we think is a regular star suddenly emits three incredible pulses (flashes) of light and disappears.  Keep watching sky, not noticing anything for about 5-10 minutes.  Suddenly notice a bright twinkling light further on over the tree line in the distance (toward Beckley).  At first looks like a bright planet but notice slight movement.  Staying mostly still, it hovers a great number of feet in perfectly vertical direction up and down or shoots with incredible speed from side to side.  Obviously not man-made aircraft, at least one the public does not know about.  Observing object through binoculars, notice there seems to be no definite shape and a multitude of colorful lights is constantly revolving or moving around the object.  After another 10 minutes or so, notice a group of smaller  lighted objects moving below the main object just above the tree line, hovering above, in and through the tree tops.  At all times there are at least 3 to 4 airplanes in the sky.  As soon as one passes over the tree line another appears, obviously coming from the nearby airport (Raleigh County Airport).  After a while notice second object to the East with similar colorful emissions after a few minutes also emitting smaller lighted objects in the tree tops.  By this time the airplanes begin flying under and around unknown aircraft repeatedly, passing very close.  It is odd to see so many airplanes in the night sky over West Virginia.  Usually you may see one or two, I counted anywhere from 10-20 or airlpanes over the course of just an hour.  After 45 minutes to an hour, notice yet another object to the southeast (toward Hinton) same appearance and mannerisms as first two objects.  Take girlfriend home and leave for Parkersburg, she calls about 20 minutes later to tell me the latter object is hovering over the graveyard beside her house.  All observers are normal hard-working people.  We are all pretty open-minded.  Two are married with a child and second on the way.  I&#39;m 25 years old and nothing like this has ever happened to me.  I am very fascinated, intrigued and just a little scared, but most of all curious.  I hope I get the chance to witness something like this again someday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of celestial body, we suspect.  PD))<n>

As usual there were approx 4 groups of golfers and caddies playing.  It was a typical windy day with the winds coming from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Across the estuary is RAF Leuchars.  I spotted a spherical shape approx 200 ft above the ground travel in a straight line approaching from the east or the 6th fairway of the New course and continue in a calm, straight line eastward across the 9th and 10th of the Old Course, the 8th and 13th of the New Course and 6th and 14th of the Jubilee on it&#39;s way out toward the North Sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I lost track of it.  It occurred to me that this was a very odd sighting as I thought it was a plastic bag which had possibly escaped the trash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was why wasn&#39;t it gusting with the strong winds but the object just kept moving at a constant, slow speed without wavering in any way.  It was as though it was attached to a track of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked a collegue who was in the area if he had noticed the strange plastic in the sky but he did not see it.<n>

Looked up saw an object brighter than Jupiter in a position that was not where Jupiter was.  I thought to myself,  &#34;whats jupiter doing over there?&#34; Then I looked and saw Jupiter was still over where it was supposed to be,  looked back at the object.  It was bright white,  and it started to move slowly,  picked up speed.  It moved across the horizon from south to northwest. Went and got my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Typically we get a lot of air traffic being near the Riverside Descent Area to Detroit Metro Airport.  But I was able to see other planes at extremely high altitudes.  Planes typically have flashing lights, and red/green lights on the wingtips.  I looked at the object with my binoculars.  No flashing lights at all.  Just a bright pure white light.   My wife saw another object moving in the opposite direction and had been looking at that.  Then after the 2nd object had moved across the sky in the exact same trafjectory but opposite direction, we picked up another 3rd object moving the exact same direction as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not a plane with its landing lights (another typical phenomenon I&#39;ve seen in this area for 30 years) because it was almost at the zenith and it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a satellite, as it was moving much too slow.  Plus it had started off stationary, like just a star in the sky,  then it started to move off.  Eventually the object did lose its brightness and fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen satellites get bright and then fade away but the speed never changed.  this was stationary for a bit before it moved off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station was not visible from Windsor, Ontario, on May 22nd, 2006.  We presume that the witness implies a nighttime sighting, and we have amended the time to reflect that fact.  PD))<n>

After blinking about 20 times, it began to move VERY SLOWLY and it wasnt until then I realized it wasnt just a bright star. I said something to friend at that point and we both then watched it for over 40 minutes. Its movement was in east to west direction but it stopped and started many times over and with seemingly different velocities over 45 minute period and often made directional changes back/forth and up/down--with a gradual westerly progression as net effect.  At 12:01 seemed to stop and not move again, still a bright light (brightest in this night sky).  Would a satellite act like this??  NO trails, auras, sounds, beams or other objects.  Several planes went by in this general direction much faster than this bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a stunning sight and I hurredly called it to the attention of my companion. The formation proceeded in the direction of VEGA, passed to the west of it, veered off to the East and disappeared from our view. The formation was about the size of my hand held at arms length. It was impossible to determine its height. There was no sound at any point. It consisted of about 6-8 indivdual lights. The lights were not spots, but vertical with a slight bulge in the middle. The formation was somewhat triangular, vertical on its left side and sloping slightly outward on the right side. It was traveling wide end or bottom forward. There was no variance in spacing or intensity of the lights nor variation in speed. The night was clear with no haze or cloud cover. The phenomena appeared as if it could have been produced by a searchlight but there was no cover upon which it could have been reflected and no variation in the light as would be seen if on cloud or haze cover. The light was soft and about a 1 in intensity. It did not reappear. There was no airplane traffic in the area prior to, during, or until some time after the sighting.

I have a long background in technical design and analysis for defence projects. Among other things I am a licenced Amateur Radio Operator, I am also an amateur photographer, although I was in the air force, I was not a flier. I am not ever given to going off half cocked and I do look quite carefully and often quadruple check unusual events for logical explanations and often find them. My first witness (looked like a paw) is a level headed surveyor accustomed to using his vision professionally and noting with care. My second witness (harbinger of hail) is more of a passing nature, an out of town visitor whom I asked what he thought of that cloud. Being that I am involved within and without the military troubleshooting complicated electronic equipment and systems, I have developed a keen habit of noting almost everything visual. I use corrective lenses and I was using them at the time. I am diet controlled Diabetic Type II and so was quite in charge of my senses. I know that the ground winds were from the West as the forest was shielding us from the wind in our tents.  There can be no doubt as to the date of this event for a)I have found the debit card record for a purchase of wild rice and b) that the wind and the rain woke me up several times during the night before this sighting. There is absolutely no question in my mind now, that this can be nothing other than a manufactured machine having found a picture of it (now lost but recovered again as we &#34;speak&#34;) on the website mentioned above.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the point where the planes were turning I noticed a small object, that I initially thought was a balloon, coming towards the strip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In less than 5 minutes from when I spotted it, the object slowed down above the Wynn golf course area. It stayed in this area for about 5 minutes.  It was not stationary at this point, but moving slowly westward. It then started picking up speed and moving in a north westerly direction and was out of my site in less than 5 minutes. It was barley visible as it left my field of view from the hotel window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the point that it slowed down, I had a decent view of the object as it was directly in front of me.  It was fairly high up, but well under the cloud cover.  The object appeared mostly white with a patch of darker, gray on it.  It seem as though it was probably the size of a car or van. The shape was not perfectly round; it seemed as though it was more pyramid shaped but very rounded.  It also looked to be rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what it was, but I could tell that it was not a balloon. It was not bobbing with the wind and the size was much too large for the height that it was at. It was not a plane as it would have dropped out of the sky as it moved slowly over the Vegas strip area. There were helicopters flying well north of the object and were clearly visible as helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not an object I could identify and I did have a fairly close and clear view of it.<n>

I was looking almost straight up and observed it traveling from north to south, it was above a plane taking off and below a plane traveling from east to west at about 35000 ft.  It left no contrail nor did it seem to make any noise.  I called for my wife to come out and see it, but she didn&#39;t make it in time.  It was moving faster than any aircraft in the sky judging by the other aircraft speeds.  I&#39;m prior military and have seen F-14&#39;s at mach 2, this is the only comparison i can make to the speed. It was about the size of this dot &#34;o&#34; from my vantage.  The sighting lasted about 10 seconds from zenith to 45 degrees until I lost it over the roof top of the apartment building next to ours.  It was unusual enough to raise the hairs on my arms.  This will be the third object I have seen in the Arizona sky&#39;s that I cannot explain and would have been the second for my wife.  Let me know if any body else seen this please.  Thanks ((name and e-address deleted)).<n>

When I ordered this Eagle view for this property; ((deleted)) W. Cambridge Ave., Phoenix, AZ 85035, I discovered a very peculiar photo of two lights traveling at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The great part is I have this photo from Eagle View and anyone can order this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I googled the date and location for other sightings.  Sure enough, others had spotted the same two bright lights traveling at high speeds.<n>

No source was observed, but the light seemed to come from above and appeared to pulse several times per second. After about 15 min, the speed of the pulse quickened until almost a blur and the light appeared to gradually fade away. No sound was heard. No object was observed, and what we saw could very well have a logical explanation but should you recieve other reports feel free to call.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I at first saw one pinpoint of light traveling north to south, as it passed across the eyepiece i then noticed a second point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights moved together. I do not know the distance beween them but can only say I used a wide angle eyepieces, of 60 degress. These 2 objects fit with in 50 degrees of this eyepiece, just enough to track them both in the same field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects did appear to move as one unit the entire time i watched them  I have sme figures that may help in identifying them  The scope used was a 4 and 1/2 inch f4 wide field scope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> eyepiece used was also widefield 60 degrees. 20mm. Which would put it at 20x magnification.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have setting circles so I do not know the elevation. But, these objects did pass by M13 which is in hercules. they were within a degree of it from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amount of sky covered within this viewing was from anywhere north. And I lost track around scorpio as my scope is in a cradle mount and was hitting the back of the chair that I had it on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the entire time I view I guessing is 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i did see a plane or jet pass in front of my scope as viewing ese objects also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in front of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So they deffinitly were further out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights never blinked they stayed steadily lit. No flickering and no other lights emmiting from either of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> they moved so perfecgtly ogether that it did seem as one object, I didnt see anything between them that would suggest this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thankyou<n>

We all looked up into the star lite sky and seen something very strange, it was moving faster than any aircraft from south to north it was shaped like a box kite, with two squares at each end with a cylinder conneting in the middle. The object had no sound and two diffused lights one light was on the upper box and the other light was on the lower box. It took about 9 seconds to travel all the way across the sky, faster than any of us had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later two navel jets flew past in the same direction as the object we had seen.  I came in and called 911 to report the object.  The dispatcher said that she had received a few other calls on this.  The next morning we contacted nbc5 news to see if anyone had reported anything over the north Texas sky.  The lady took my wifes name and number but said nothing had been reported.  I than contacted Alliance airport tower, they gave me the number to the Joint Reserve Naval Air Base approximatly 10 miles from us.   The Reserve Base tower checked their logs from the previous night but would not give me any information but offered to take a report from me which I did.  They said they would get back with me in 3 to 4 days.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear, cloudless night. The stars shown brilliantly against the dark sky. I stood looking up at the stars in the heavens, when suddenly I noticed a moving &#34;light&#34; very high up in the sky. I knew, from the altitude that this moving &#34;light&#34; appeared  to be, that whatever it was that I was looking at, must either be the space-station, or a satillite. The light maintained its altitude, but when it was directly above me, I was dumbstruck by the sudden brilliance of a brightness that suddenly seemed to appear from the bottom of this object when the object got directly overhead. There seemed to be four (4)lights that were part whatever it was that I was looking at. I felt that what I was seeing was triangular in shape, with white, non-blinking lights on three cornors, with the bottom, suddenly brilliant &#34;beam&#34; in the middle of the other three. AT NO TIME DID ANY OF THE LIGHTS THAT I SAW &#39;BLINK,&#39; AS THEY WOULD HAVE IF THIS WERE AN AIRPLANE! The light then proceeded to change course. It made a turn; not abrupt, but a gradual, gentle course change. It then accelerated, gaining speed quite rapidly, and I watched it until it trailed off from sight. The bright &#34;beam&#34; that I refer to, in the middle of this object, seemed to gain in luminosity when it was directly over my head. In other words, one second, it wasn&#39;t bright. Then, quite suddenly, when it was directly overhead, it was! I ruled out an airplane, as they have red, and green blinking lights on their wings. I thought that the brilliant light &#34;beam&#34; could have been an airplanes landing lights. But there was no change in the luminosity that should have accompanied the deployment of landing lights in front of or around this object. Besides, with no blinking of any kind noted, it seemed unlikely that this was an aircraft. I stood there, wondering what it was I had seen, for several minutes after I finally lost sight of this object. I have spent many moments in the past looking up at the heavens. This was my second UFO (if this was one) sighting. The first occurred over 53 years ago. This is my first report to NUFORC, even though I look at the site often. I will attempt to get a map for referencing to you regarding what I saw, with direction[s] object traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since the sun was fully visible and the clouds were thin I couldn&#39;t understand how the blimp was casting a shadow if it itself wasn&#39;t visible where it should be located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the shadow, it headed slowly to the North changing shape as it moved over the edges of the scattered clouds as one would expect to see from a large moving object above them creating the shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud layer wasn&#39;t too large so the shadow finally disappeared as it left the layer on the right after about 30 seconds.  I continued to watch for anything that could have created the shadow thinking it would appear out of the sun maybe or was obscured by the clouds.  Nothing was ever seen in the sky for the 15 or so minutes I continued to watch and no other clouds were in the sky that afternoon at any level that could have caused the shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound was ever heard and considering the size of the shadow and the estimated four to five thousand foot cloud layer, from past experiences if it had been the blimp I&#39;m sure I would have heard it as it would have been upwind of my location and not all that far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#34;sighting&#34; has haunted me for months now without an explanation and I am submitting it in the hopes that someone else around this time period may have witnessed it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself to be a credible witness being a private pilot with a passion towards anything that flies.  I&#39;ve seen lots of &#34;strange&#34; things in the sky but can usually figure out what they are with some time and logic.  This one has me totally baffled however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then, after staring at it for about 30 seconds, it darted into a nearby cloud, extrememly fast from a hovering position. I watched the cloud intently for about 30 minutes, wishing it would come out, and it did not. I was not afraid, which surprised me, and found myself just staring and wishing it would come out so I could see it again.  It almost felt like it knew I was watching, and then darted in to a cloud to hide. (Wierd, I know.)  Feel free to contact me if you wish.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spotted (4) objects moving south at a steady speed.  They were traveling in a line, one after another, closely spaced and evenly spaced.  They were bright white in color, although due to their distance from me I could not discern their shape.  In spite of their distance from me, however, they appeared to be quite large.  The (4) objects did not appear as points of white, but rather were larger and each had a horizontal dimension slightly greatly than their vertical dimension.  They were traveling close enough to the ground that they were passing in front of the Olympic mountains.  The appeared to me to be traveling along the tops of the foothills just in front of the Olympic mountains.  They were traveling level or nearly level;  they did not appear to be gaining or losing elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting the above because I have not been able figure what they may have been -- they are unidentified to me.  I am not assuming them to be alien craft, but I am not ruling it out either.  I curious to see if there are any other people that reported these objects<n>

The object looked somewhat like a plane, in which it had a center light with a glow around it, but it was moving extremely too fast to be any aircraft to my knowledge. I had seen a lot of meteors that night also but I have seen quite a few meteors and even &#34;fireballs&#34; in the past and this looked nothing like those.

All of a sudden a very bright light like a fireball started going down,very fast like in free fall. My first thought that came to my mind was the Lockerbie disaster that happened almost 20 years ago.

After it went further away I saw bright blue/white flash with pale green around it above our house for split second but I couldn&#39;t get better look at it. About 30 seconds later I saw 2nd flash and tried to take better look at it this time. It look like some kind of ball of lighting but it&#39;s not very bright. It look strange because I never see anything like that before. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s UFO or something else but I decided to report it anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It glided left then right, then left then right, then hovered, then glided a few houses down, then glided left , then right, then hovered, then glided a few more houses down and kept doing that till I lost sight of it behind some trees, then I didn&#39;t see it again.

The moment i noticed it, it was bright for a 5 second count standing still, then suddenly shot left about 5 ft.,stopped, then it was gone(light went out) Several friends where standing behind me, but not paying attention to what i just seen, so i said &#34;Hey, anyone just see that?&#34; they all joked and broke my stones, then about 4 friends and myself where looking for what i just descibed, when suddenly 1-red/orange light popped on, then the 2nd light, 3rd, and 4th, they all where in line same height off the sea, same distance from eachother, they stayed on for about 30 seconds then they went off in the same order they came on 1-2-3-4. We waited to see if there was any more activity for approx. 15-20 minutes with nothing more. Then the discussion started, I was in the Marine Corps and I immediatly said too high to be a ship/boat, forget flares of any type, and forget after burner, 3 out of my 4 friends all admitted never have seen this ever and no one offered a logical solution to this event, we believe we saw something that is not normal maritime behavior or normal airline/flight behavior<n>

I glanced off over his shoulder and noticed a glowing yellow orange oval shaped light in the night sky. This object was self luminesent. It looked like a beacon or hazard light on the top of a radio tower at first. but it wasn&#39;t blinking. I told myself thats what it  must be, even though I had lived here for years and knew there wasn&#39;t a tower over there. &#34;They must have built one&#34;, I thought. It wasn&#39;t alarming looking or anything. I ignored it for awhile really. I just kept talking and glanced at it during breaks in conversation. It didn&#39;t move at all, nor did it change its hue. It actually looked like someones yellow porch lightblub from a great distance accept it was higher than the trees. I think it was miles away really, but it was obvious. After awhile, I had had enough and couldn&#39;t figure it out. I interupted my friend in mid sentence and pointed to the object. I asked him what he thought it was. He said he didn&#39;t know and laughingly started to tell me about how he and some friends had seen what they thought was a UFO one time. It was then that i glanced back at the light and it was was doing the weirdest thing. It looked like it was shooting sparks out of itself. They were coming from the top left corner  of the light from what I could tell. It looked kind of like a golden firework spray, but didn&#39;t fade out. It just hung there next to the object. It is very hard to explain, but it looked like the sparks were dripping. I got very excited and pointed again. This time my friend paid more attention and said &#34;it must be a meteor or something...&#34;. I don&#39;t agree, as the object had been there, unmoving, for at least 10 minutes by this time.  Nothing was different about it&#39;s appeatance other than now it was dripping golden sparks in an arc out of it&#39;s top. Neither on of us (both college educated)could figure out what it might be. I looked at him and made a comment about it being a UFO. He&#39;a  big born again Christian and started in on me about how we Christians weren&#39;t supposed to believe in UFO&#39;s. His face was saying something different though. He couldn&#39;t figure it out either. We looked back over one last time and it was gone. We kept talking about it and laughed about it being weird. About 5 minutes later it reappeared to our south and looked like it was tree top tall going over houses down the street. It dissapeared from our sight a minute later. The object made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

After my lessons one of my friends came by to say hi and he is a graduate from the University of Washington who is a skeptic in the UFO area but this was an eye opener so we walk up to my car and the obeject was still in the area but at a very high altitude around 15,000 to 18,000 in front of clouds that were out on this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can get my students to report the sighting if needed from the tennis class as well as my UW friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was about half the size of a dime if you held a dime at arm&#39;s length from your eyes. Weather conditions: A sunny clear day with no clouds. The object seemed to move very slowly downward and to the west for the short time it appeared,(1-2 minutes) and then all of a sudden it disappeared. I&#39;m a sales rep for a major manufacturing company after retiring from radio broadcasting for 27 years.  This is my first sighting of what I would classify as a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Fort Chaffee military flares or UFOs ?|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50616.html|116|ndxe200605| Orange lights seen from southern Fort Smith. Fort Chaffee military flares or UFOs ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my fathers truck last night when I noticed a circular orange light flashing for approx 4 seconds and then dissapearing and reappearing in the sky.   I called for my sister and her friend to come look.  The light continued to do this for about 5 minutes, dissapearing and then reappearing.  I can&#39;t give an approx measurement or altitude, but the lights were rather bright compared to that of a normal star and the altitude seemed low for military aircraft.  Although I do not know much of military aircrafts and dropping flares at night, there was no sound or smoke. I live pretty close to Fort Chaffee, so I assummed that if they were flares, then we could of heard the planes or seen the smoke, but I didn&#39;t rule that possibility out.  After the lights faded, my sister and I sat outside and they finally appeared in the same area about 10 minutes later.  The lights began to do exactly what they did before, but this time there was only 1 of them.  It disseapered for only a few seconds and repeared much higher than it was before, and then suddenly about 5 or 6 appeared at once around that orange light.   These did not move and remained in one place for only 4 seconds. Then one by one, starting from the end, they dissappeared.  Because they appeared in a straight line, I began to think they might have been flares.  I am not totally convinced that what we saw was an alien aircraft, but we heard/saw no planes nearby.  The only reason why I am considering this may have been a ufo is because as far as I know, as long as gravity exists, flares do not hover in the sky instead of falling down as they disappeared. The disappearence seemed dramatic instead of random flares being dropped at once and disseapearing altogether and the same time. I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw this and I don&#39;t know what to think of it. My sister and her friend are convinced that aliens are here in Arkansas to invade...  and as convincing as these theories may be, I still remain a bit skeptical on ufo sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It then sunk very rapidly behind some trees still in a horizontal position.  About this time my friend returned and I told her about it.

We often go on weekend drives out this way.  The sky was completely clear with just a few puffy clouds.   We had passed the border patrol checkpoint on the westbound side that is before Jacumba and about 10 minutes from Golden Acorn Casino.   On the horizon I saw a silver cigar shaped object that I believed was a plane...my partner did not see it.   It was very far in the distance.   It went behind a small puffy cloud, came out the other side and then disappeared right as I was looking at it.   I informed my partner and he basically said I was seeing things.  So I convinced myself it was just a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 3 or 4 minutes later, I looked up and saw a brownish object in the shape of a cigar or boomerang moving slowly directly over the highway and yet very high in the sky.  I started pointing at it telling my partner that it was likely a plane.   Mind you it was directly over the highway.  He did not see it again.   As I was watching it, it just vanished.  This one was much, much closer than the previous one but still high in the sky.  My partner still does not believe me but I definitely saw it and it vanished right in front of my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else has seen this please post!<n>

It did not move like an ordinary airplane you see over Los Angeles, rather it moved like something I have never seen before.  I saw the object move very slowly and it never got close nor did it move away like a normal plane would.  I called out my parents to see if they could see what I was seeing and they also saw what i was seeing.  By this time the object was moving in strange patterns.  All these movements occured in the west to the north west parts of the sky.  I saw it move very quikly to the left, right, up, down, inward, outward, and In circular motions. At one point my mother and I were able to see the shape of the craft, which was similar to a boomerang.  The red light was centered in the middle area of the craft.  We did have binoculars to see this object and this helped out in viewing it.  My parents went inside the house after observing it for a while, but I stayed out and saw it linger there for quite a while. As i watched it, my neighboor had just arrived home and I told her if she could see the same thing.  She wanted to go inside her house after a long day, but she stood out for a few moments to observe this craft.  We looked at it together and it did some king of loop-de-loop action then it dipped down and dissapeared from sight at approximaetly  10:20 P.M.  The duration of the sighting was for 50 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the biggest aircraft i&#39;ve ever seen!! it was flying so low, it was way below the clouds, but the weird thing was, it was totally silent. Then, of course, my dad said it was probably one of the new stealth bombers, but as he said that, it got bigger, then we all said that that was wayyy to big to be a stealth bomber. As we drove away, we all had to look straight because our necks were hurting and when we looked back to see it again, it was gone!<n>
5/17/06 20:25|San Mateo|CA|Unknown|5-7 minutes|2 bright streaks of light with dark object above them observed in clear, cloudless sky.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50606.html|128|ndxe200605| 2 bright streaks of light with dark object above them observed in clear, cloudless sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving Highway 101 northbound, from Redwood City towards San Mateo, nearing the time of sunset, approx 8:25pm.  It was a very clear, cloudless sky.  I noticed what initially appeared to be two, parallel &#34;streaks&#34; of bright light, slightly angled to the left of what would have been a vertical position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed the streaks, they appeared to be moving downward.  This only lasted a second or two, and then the streaks appeared stationary. I said to my husband (who was driving) &#34;Look at that...what do you think that is?&#34;  Neither he nor I could come up with an explanation of what it could be.  It was an interesting phenomena, because we both were expecting as we drove closer that whatever the object was (airplane, cloud, etc) would soon become apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove closer, the bright streaks of light dimmed considerably, eventually becoming just a greyish color, and we wondered if it could have been the setting sun which was illuminating these two streaks.  As we approached our exit, I could just make out a solid dark object above these streaks, and it was obviously much farther away than I had originally thought.  Due to the distance, I cannot describe the shape of the object, other than that it was wider side to side than it was top to bottom. It did not appear to be completely smooth, but to have some shape to it. The object and streaks did not move, rotate, etc. following the few seconds after which we originally saw them. The dark object above the streaks was not lit in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took our exit and quickly parked our car and ran back near the freeway, but whatever it was was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was invisible except for the triagular part. example of what it could look like, I you had a straight peice of aluminium and bent it at 90 degrees, that was the basic shape but with golded wave ripples along the length of the bottom.I live under a busy aircraft route, this wasnt a standard plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I woke up my husband and we went out side to look at it.

5/17/06 02:10|East Setauket|NY|Circle|7 seconds|Small UFO moving in backyard with red and white lights|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60938.html|131|ndxe200605| Small UFO moving in backyard with red and white lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember it being a windy night when I was inside my house on the computer. Unlike all the other nights I sit at this place at my computer, I had a strange feeling something wasn&#39;t right. I had to keep glancing over my shoulder checking the large window behind me. Between the window and the computer is about an eight foot distance to where I observed a UFO, whilst I sat in the chair. Each time I looked all I saw outside my window was the trees blowing in the wind and the other usual things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until I had the most overwhelming feeling something was watching me. I ignored it for a few seconds, but the longer I did the more nervous I got. I turned around fully and looked through the window, whilst sitting in the chair. I saw a circular object in the corner of where my backyard is outside. I watched it, realizing it was moving. I observed the difference between this strange light and the light of another residence through my backyard (I live in a suburban area). There was a definite difference and it was unlike anything I ever even heard of, as it was not a typical UFO, which is large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light came closer, until it seemed to be only 15 or twenty feet away from the window outside. For the first few seconds, it looked had white light emanating from it, with a red light on top. The lights were flashing within the object. Then the red lights on the UFO seemed to be moving from the top of the UFO to the bottom. And as it continued to move closer to the window, I ran away from the room as I felt the object was watching me and could see me in my house. I believe my feelings are right, and not silly. Again, the object appeared to be about five to seven feet long, and about the same amount wide, yet it might have been saucer shaped. The shape was difficult to discern, yet it seemed closest to a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light from the UFO had a shape though and was extremely clear to my eyes and I am sure I can&#39;t explain it as a normal occurence. I was 20 years old the night I saw it. I did not really believe it was a UFO until I heard in a documentary about &#34;alien probes&#34; appearing over suburban areas. The conditions from the room I was observing in, included a lamp light, which was on and a few feet away from the window next to it. Yet, this light did nothing to distort the image. The light of this thing appeared to my eyes to be moving in the middle of my backyard probably 15 feet off the ground. Another detail is that this object was one hundred percent light, but had a definite form, as the red light shifted from top to bottom. At least it appeared to be all light from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the early am of 17 May 06, Wednesday at about 12:20 am. I was headed south and as I approached the area of Bolling AFB (to the right) and the Naval Research Lab on the 295 I saw the side view shape of a Stealth aircraft......nothing else has that shape....flying over the interstate headed in the direction of the AFB..to the right. I then looked to the left side of the 295 and saw a black triangular shaped craft with 3 red circular lights in each corner of the triangle flying over the area across from the Naval Research Lab. The stealth appeared to be escorting the craft. the triangle was descending and appeared to go down in an area with a very high treeline. The treeline is thick and dense with a fence that stretches the entire distance of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/16/06 23:10|Holland|MI|Unknown|4 Minutes|Object with shimmering lights (no sounds) at low elevation seen over Holland Michigan|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51541.html|137|ndxe200605| Object with shimmering lights (no sounds) at low elevation seen over Holland Michigan<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night at about 11:10pm my friend and I came out of his house and we were standing in his back yard. He lives on New Holland Road on the north side of Holland Michigan. Holland is located on the west side of the state of Michigan and is right on the Lake Michigan coast line. My friends house is about a 5 minute drive to the coast line. He has about 9 acres in a relatively undeveloped area of town with very few lights obstructing the evening sky. We were just looking at the stars and as I looked at the western sky (toward Lake Michigan)  I saw a very bright shining light. This light appeared white and bright. It shimered at times. I did not see where it came from or how it got to that point in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my friends attention to it and he immediately thought it was very odd. We both have spent many evenings enjoying the stars and late night skies over his property and have seen airplanes and helecopters on a number of occassions. What struck us as odd was it seemed close. Eventhough it appeared low out over the western horizon as if it were a plane at +20,000 feet coming over the lake (which is common) the lights seem as if they were no farther than a mile away over an area used for agricultural purposes. The light kind of hung there with a shimering effect. It was moving and eventualy approached my friends property roughly flying in a westerly to easterly direction. As it slowly moved just north of our position we did see a few lights on the object. We saw a red light additional white light and a green light. This brought up the brief discussion that it could simply be a plane with red and green navigation lights but their were still some oddities to this object. First- it still appeared to be very close. Lets say...less than a mile and looked to be no more than a one thousand feet (at most) in the air. Second - other than some distant highway traffic sounds it is relatively quiet at my friends property. As I said earlier...we have watched many airplanes and helecopters fly throughout this airspace many times. The difference is that this object made NO noise. We ussually can hear planes and other aircraft for miles and even when they are 20,000 feet in the air. We kept listening for the noise and nothing. As it passed us by heading in a easterly direction it made a slight direction change heading slightly northeast.Still no sounds. It eventually disappeared from our view over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have been an airplane but the shimering lights, close proximity/elevation and apparent lack of sound left us a bit bewildered. This is the first time that we both felt that we may have seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/16/06 23:00|Del Rio (35 miles outside of)|TX|Other|15 min.|Sighting of prism like craft on the devils river in west Texas|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52509.html|138|ndxe200605| Sighting of prism like craft on the devils river in west Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four of us witnessed a craft that lookes like a spining prism at a distance of about 800 yards.We were working on a ranch that was on the devils river outside of del rio, Texas. The first night the object was seen only two people witnessed this craft.The object was so close it awoke on of the witnesses with the lights coming in the back window of a motor home. The lights were changing colors like a prism blue , yellow , purple, etc... We were at the very end of the road , THERE IS NO POSSIBLE VEHICLE THAT COULD ACCESS THIS AREA. The following night I was able to get binoculars on the object, when i did the hair on the back of my head stood up. I have family that are pilots and i have been around aircraft my entire life, THIS WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT.When i handed the binoculars to another person i walked over to my truck and grabbed my riffle , not with any intendtion of using it but this object shook me up and i guess i needed a little sucurity. The project manager was trying to get a telescope focused on the object during this time and as we were speaking about how strange it was and right before we could get the telescope on it , it took off like an inverted shooting star. Nothing man made travels that fast from 800 yards to completely out of site in seconds. I have been puzzled over the entire event , and none of us talk about it very much. It would be intresting to find out about simular reports or explainations.These witnesses are Home builders, excavation contractors and septic installers not scientist of star gazeriers. This was a real sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw 2 to the right and 1 on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live close to Westfield Air Force Base and Barnes Airport in Westfield, MA, and there were 3 planes that came from that direction and went directly toward it and one dipped below the horizon and disappeared, and the second came about 5 minutes afterwards and flew higher at it and then dipped below the horizon.  A third plane went by and continued northward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was definitely SOMEthing strange going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking to the west, observing passing aircraft.  I noticed a brilliant white flash and then a streaking white light, slightly to the left of the plane i was watching. It appeared to be heading diagonally down and east. At first I thought it was just an exceptionally large looking meteor, but in a matter of about two seconds this thing rapidly decelerated and changed direction.  As it slowed down the pure white color quickly faded to a dull off white/orangish glow. At this point the object appeared to be heading north, parallel to the horizon. Since the color had faded, the object was now barely visible against the night sky. At this point the object was traveling at a speed you would expect from a regular aircraft, and almost appeared to be one except with no strobing lights or red/green running lights or whatever they&#39;re called. I continued to watch the object for a good 20 to 30 seconds until my view of it became obscured by trees.  After seeing this I ended up staring at the sky for another four hours hoping to see something else but saw nothing besides planes and a regular satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was no airpanes insight when the lights were around. i could not hear any noise that would explain the lights as they were low enogh that you should have been able to hear the roar of an engine or something.  i hurrie home so that i could get my camera and camecorder to take picturs and record my sighting this time but by the time I came back out which was a matter of seconds the lights were gone.  I know for a fact that what I seen in 2005 and my latest sighting on 5/15/2006 was not any kind of human aircraft or flairs.  WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR????   DO WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO THEM??   WHY WOULD I SEE THEM A YEAR LATER??<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended/corrected the date above.  PD))<n>

I was driving down Man O&#39;War Blvd one evening at around 7 or 8 pm, returning from my University.  I turned right onto Winchester Rd by the channel 36 news station headed towards Paris.  I love the scenery out in that area, and turned my head to look at one of the beautiful farms there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right above the horizon at a distance I cannot even begin to calculate was a very large cigar shaped object that was glowing a radiant reddish orange color.  It looked to me like a huge metallic blimp that was catching the setting sun or something.  The road, being heavy with traffic at that time was not to be ignored, so I looked back at the road as to not rear end someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back over at the sky, and the object was no longer there.  This object was clearly and obviously there a few seconds earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to justify every possible explanation....maybe the sun reflecting off of some kind of cloud.... Whatever it was it was very strange. I haven&#39;t told anyone about this because of fear of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

5/15/06 18:00|Moscow|ID|Triangle|35 Seconds|I was sitting in the passenger's side of the car, and i saw a dark triangular shape in the sky, and then drift in the clouds.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59211.html|148|ndxe200605| I was sitting in the passenger&#39;s side of the car, and i saw a dark triangular shape in the sky, and then drift in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to go to school at the alternative school in Moscow, though i live in another town. At the time the school got out at around 5-6:00 pm. I don&#39;t know the name of the road we were on, but it was down the road only a little ways from the alternitive school, and we were going to head west. We were sitting in traffic for a long time. It was sort of a windy cloudy day which is rather typical in Moscow. My friend was driving the car and i was in the passengers seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there for quite some time and i began looking up into the white sky and suddenly i saw something that was pretty strange. I didn&#39;t say anything for a moment and i did not take my eyes off of what is saw that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the sky was a dark colored triangular aircraft of some kind. It was perfectly triangular and was obviously not something natural. I wouldn&#39;t say it was black; more of a metallic dark grey. I was comepletely amazed at what i saw, and for the most part i wanted to be practical and believe it had an obvious explaination. It seemed to have been standing in place but suddenly it started moving. It was moving steadily fast. I moved fast enough that it was leaving sight rather quickly, but it wasn&#39;t leaving at lightning speed. It was a super cloudy day that day, and it was probably strange that we even saw it at all considering how overcast it was. I watched it go into the clouds and i kept looking out for it, but i simply didn&#39;t see it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend then spoke up and told me that she had just seen something really weird. She hadn&#39;t known that i had seen it too. And my i told her that i had seen it and we talked about it for the ride home. I kept looking for it all the way home, but i didn&#39;t see anything strange. I decided to believe it was nothing, and when i told adults, they sort of looked at me as though i didn&#39;t know what i was talking about, since i was only sixteen at the time. I gave up trying to get anyone to believe me and soon i quit thinking about it, though i never forgot it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple nights ago something sparked my memory and so i decided to look it up on the internet and i did some research. I didn&#39;t even know that triangular shaped UFO&#39;s are reported but i found out that they are. And i looked at the description and sure enough, the descriptions had an uncanny resemblance to what i saw. So, i looked into it further. I typed in something about triangular ufo&#39;s seen in Moscow Idaho. I didn&#39;t think i would get anything. I found a reporting on this website that took place on the same date someone else had reported a sighting. I also noticed that that it is not particularily common for Moscow to have reported UFO sightings on this website. But mainly, i was take away that it was on the same day. So my friend and i were not the only ones to see it, and not only that, but they saw a triangle as well. It is all rather eerie and too ironic to be an accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was doing yard work and scanning the sky for the local redtail hawks when my eye was drawn to a moving object far above traveling west to east.  It flew silently in a straight line and into the horizon of the trees.  Incredibly, it appeared to be camouflaged with the blue sky.  What was remarkable was I never would have noticed it in the sky except that the moment my eye caught it, it was moving over a cloud.  I saw a definite fixed shape and structure.  Even once it passed the cloud its outline was well defined although the blue color of the craft matched the sky.  It was shaped, overall, as a triangle, but its edges were rounded and the rear edge slightly curved towards the front &#34;point&#34;.  I suppose the &#34;boomerang&#34; description is most applicable, but its width was fatter or thicker than that word implies.  It may or may not be pertinent to note there were no lights beaming, flashing, or shining.  I watched it, awestruck, (it was daytime!), unlike anything I&#39;ve seen or experienced, until it was gone in the distance.  There was an object flying at a high speed and I sure as heck can&#39;t identify it to be anything of this world.  Immediately afterwards, I ran inside and sketched what I saw.  I don&#39;t know if anyone has ever had a similar experience, maybe this report can be of use to someone along the line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 24 year old student working towards a degree in communication disorders to become a speech and language pathologist.  I consider myself conservative, analytic, and not easily fooled.  I was so moved by what I saw that day, it was profound...  it was what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was about two in the afternoon (in April or May of 2006 as best I can recall).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was warm, with clear blue sky, no clouds at all. I was alone in my car driving south on Intersate 5 somewhere to the north of Esparto California.  I was doing about 70 mph.  Through my windsheld I suddenly noticed a stationary object dip into view and then right itself, as it righted itself it disappeared in place.  This sighting lasted only about 3 seconds. No lights were visible, and there was no sound, however the edges of the object were &amp;quot;fuzzed&amp;quot; and indistinct.  As far as I could tell the object was saucer-shaped, as if two dinner plates on top of each other and separated by a wall between them.  The front of it tilted down approx 15 degrees from horizontal and then immediately tilted back up again and disappeared as it did so.  It was a smooth motion and seemed appropriate to it&#39;s size - not a jerky motion.  My impression was that it was a very large object, possibly two football fields in diameter and it seemed to be about 500-1000 off the ground! , no more than that.  It seemed to be about a mile or two distant from me on the west side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to chuckle because I had the distinct impression that somebody inside had made an error and had to quickly correct the tilt.  It seemed to me a &amp;quot;cloaking device&amp;quot; had developed a problem.  A second impression later was that this object was half-in and half-out of this dimension, odd as that may sound, since I have absolutely no experience in either cloaking devices or extra dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not pull over or stop because the object had disappeared completely and all I could see was clear blue sky, although I did keep looking as I passed the area.  As I said, the duration of this sighting was no more than 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove further I thought that maybe it had been just a reflection in my windshield of something inside my car, so I tried to re-create a reflection with no luck.  The object itself seemed to be tan/dark tan colored, I coud see no markings, windows or any detail at that distance.  My car is tan and has a tan interior, so that should be taken into consideration when considering a reflection of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My own out-loud reaction when I noticed the &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; was &amp;quot;What the hell is that!&amp;quot;.  As soon as I finished those words it was gone or disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise or lights associated with the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are large electrical transmission towers in that general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am uncertain that what I saw was anything more than a random reflection in my windshield, but I have this sneaking suspicion it was exactly what it seemed to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a &amp;quot;UFO&amp;quot; before or since, and I&#39;m not really a fan of UFO stuff.  But it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if such a thing existed.  But I&#39;m not holding my breath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was windy, and so I was looking up watching the leaves flutter around on the trees. It was then I saw a dull chrome object (I say &#34;dull&#34; chrome as it was not really reflecting the light as a normal chrome finish should)(maybe there was a haze around the object that made it appear duller? it was most definitely chrome.) at first glance I thought it was an airplane or a jet, yet on closer inspection I noticed that  1.)It was moving at such a slow pace it was nearly stationary, 2.)It had no wings or windows at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.)It was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.)It was spinning on its side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I say spinning on its side, I mean that it was roughly shaped like this &lt;&gt; except the sides were rounded. much like a 3d oval with pointed ends. the rounded sides was theoutermost spinning edge, like the Earth&#39;s equator, and the pointed ends were like the poles. after I noticed this, I also noticed it was much too low in the sky to be a conventional aircraft. even though it was directly above me, it scarcely cleared the tops of the trees. As I reached into my pocket to pull out my cell phone (which has a camera function) to take it&#39;s picture, it sped up slightly, and I managed to take the picture and save it. shortly afterwards, it stopped spinning for a half second, traveled backwards about 20 yards, and then turned on it&#39;s engines, which emitted 3 vapor trails and began spinning and traveling at great speed. at this time the vapor trails resembled a helix (DNA) without the ladder rungs and one trail in the middle. it zigzaged across the sky, shot upwards and then back down and upwards again, and then flew off at a speed impossible for an airplane or jet, and disappeared beyond the clearing through the trees. shortly after this, I looked back at my cell phone, and it had been turned off (not by me) and when I turned it back on, It had been erased clean of anything I had stored onto it. ringtones, pictures, my address book--all gone. 3 or 4 days later, at night,(approx 2:35 am) I woke up to a pulsing, buzzing, electrical/magnetic type noise directly outside my window. after a minute or two I looked outside, and there seemed to be nothing there. Just the noise. But, when I returned to bed, the buzzing stopped, and there was a split-second flash of sea-green light. I dont know if this was from the same object, but it seemed to be related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> additional info: -When I spotted it, I was facing (roughly) NW -It was in the eastern part of the sky that it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -the pulsing sound in the night afterward lasted roughly 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I am sure there might be a couple of them out there! How does any of us know what we are viewing up there thats why its a ufo?? Having this site to report with people are more open and willing to report a possible sighting that would norally not say anything at all out of fear of someone saying they are crazy or seeing things! And it well just might be a real ufo we don&#39;t know and someone also could of seen the same thing on the same day, it might of been just a flash of light or a streak going thru the sky, ufo&#39;s if they are real must be able to travel at great speeds or they would never get to our planet traveling at our slow primitive ways it would take they decades to get here we would be very old or would have passed away already!

It was at that time that I saw 2 or 3 white objects fall from beneath the place. I pointed them out to my husband and asked him if he saw what I was seeing and he replied yes. It was like seeing tiny stars from lack of oxygen that slowly disappear. A few minutes later another plane flew by over our heads and I saw dozens of these little white objects fall all at the same time from beneath the belly of the plane and slowly drift towards the mountains. The aircrafts we flying in separate directions and looked as though they were DC 10&#39;s, silver in color. I thought perhaps it may have been parachutes but I wasn&#39;t aware that dozens could jump all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not a stranger to strange phenomenon; Colorado seems a hot spot for strange light shows. I’m never exactly sure what I am seeing but I’m such a skeptic and surrounded by skeptics, I have never gone public with my sightings until now. I have seen at night in Castle Rock what looks like pulses of light, like an explosion underwater, in the sky before an object cracked like the Challenger and shot up into the night. I have also seen a green ball of light come down into the foothills of Littleton years back which illuminated the trees before it disappeared. I’m certainly not afraid but this last occurrence was a bit unsettling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Later it was to the north of Cincy.  Did anyone else see this? Would have been so close to the airport, but it didn&#39;t move in any pattern it just hovered very high up within plane paths I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen these before but I never wrote about them. Am I crazy?<n>

All of a suddent, it changed course and moved north west very slowly for approximately 1 minute.  It then changed course again, going north east, but then it changed to a glowing red color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another minute, it went to a very dim white and disappeared. There were no planes in the area.<n>

It looked like a star but during the day, which I thought was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to point it out to a couple of my relatives and they were also able to see it, though I was the one tracking it for about an hour and took pictures of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly moved toward the sun from southeast to northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went online to see if there were to be any astronomical occurances that day.  The only thing that could be a match was Mercury was to be in that exact portion of the sky.  But reading more into it, it seemed it would be to dim to see during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures I took, do seem to be of a crescent planet. That would shift back and forth most likely due to atmospheric distortion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am really curious to as if this was a UFO or a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.

At first I thought I was seeing things so I paid no attention to it then I saw another one. At that time I asked the other person in the car if they saw it and she said yes and we were asking eachother what it was when we saw another one. At that time I told her to stop the car and as soon as she did there were about twelve more side by side. When they appeared the started on the right side of the car and then swooped down and then back up and disappeared always in the same pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A single red dot with a red light appeared in mid air on the the left hand side in a field  (The height was about where a telephone wire would be).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would disappear and another one would appear down the road always on the left hand side up in mid air in the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After, the 3rd one appeard, I stopped my car in the middle of the gravel road.  Now 1:32 am<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds shooting from the right side  of the field was like a  big group of the lights appears to be red dots side by side with two columns of them with four total objects in each column.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There seemed to be a lighter red haze around these red light objects. They swooped over the road about 30 to 35  yards in front of my car.  They had speed on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then down the ditch and straight up into the air and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had to go straight up because there was a hill in the field.  But they didnt go over it they just disappeared in mid air.  Right in front of our eyes.<n>

The light got dim as it got closer and seemed to slow down then it disappeared for about 20 seconds when I noticed it again as a faint glow but this time it was moving back in the opposite direction and it got brighter as it picked up speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared in a matter of seconds heading back to the East and I thought this was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes I noticed a another Military Jet Flying around at a very high attitude Flying towards where the light came from and how I know they were Military Jets because they have just one blinking Red light you can see from the rear after they fly past and you can hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 911 attacks I saw those same Jets flying in our skies so I&#39;m sure they were Military. I heard them fly over this area all night long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also earlier in the evening a Military Jet did a low swoop over this area and headed straight up and it was so loud it shook the house and my neighbors came out to look as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was moving slowly and appeared to be an airplane, but what caught my attention was the way it was changing in intensity, not blinking like the normal airplane light does.  As it came nearer, it suddenly shot out to the rear what appeared to be a flare (it reminded me of a fighter jet spitting out chalf to defend against a heat seaking missile).  It did that three times as it approached, and then when it got directly over my house, the light split in two with the appearance of flares, and then was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that this could have possibly been a meteor, but it appeared to be moving to low and slow for a meteor, and the flares coming off traveled in the opposite direction and then dropped down before flaming out.  If it was a meteor, wouldn&#39;t all the pieces from the fragmentation keep traveling in the same direction as the main body?<n>

I saw it very far off, and it was indeed changing color, blinking, but I could not discern whether it might have been a satellite or a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home, we took a closer look at it-- it was NOT MOVING AT ALL, it was BLINKING red, white and green. BLINKING. Location was due north, towards Boise. We inspected the sky and I spotted a second object in the north east. Same... stationery, blinking colors, level in height with the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 22:10 I (the adult mother, 49 yrs old) can verify 4 objects. Another daughter, 14 years old spotted five. THE MOST DISTINCTIVE IS IN THE NORTHEAST AND IS VERY CLEAR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have called a friend who has a telescope. He has called back and has verified sighting one object. He is a medical doctor and an excellent source. He cannot see any of the others as his property is obstructed by trees. We are considering that they may be stars, and the atmosphere may be causing the color change, but we are both skeptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End report 22:26 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are both in our 20s &amp; were both sober &amp; of sound mind at the time of the sighting. ((name deleted)) looked out the passenger window &amp; asked &#34;What is that?&#34;.I looked over to my right(south) &amp; saw the object as what I dimissed at first glance as a passenger plane,as the Bush Intercontinental Airport is in the NW area of Houston(south of our location).  ((fiancee)) then said &#34;But,it&#39;s not moving.&#34; I looked again &amp; slowed the car to about 20mph &amp; observed the &#34;craft&#34; was indeed perfectly still hovering over trees &amp; a shopping center in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both observed that it&#39;s lights were forming a triangle(7 white lights at the points &amp; along it&#39;s 3 edges with 1 large white pulsating light in the center on the bottom.The craft could easily be mistaken as a jumbo jet, but it&#39;s behavior indicated otherwise.  A few seconds after we noticed it hovering, it began to slowly accelerate S/W at low speed &amp; at a perfect line without dipping or wavering as a plane would at low altitude.I completely stopped the car on the overpass with no other cars on the road ahead or behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the craft it then did something even more strange.  It stopped completely &amp; hovered again without any motion or sound,as if it noticed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then proceeded down the road to pull over out of the road but it began to move S/W again over the trees which obstructed our sight.I made a U-turn in order to chase it &amp; continued back over the bridge to the west.  Once back over we saw nothing in the sky. The only lights visible were from the traffic below on Hwy 59 &amp; the tower lights on the freeway. This area is a high traffic area for planes &amp; helicopters but after we saw the triangular UFO there was no more air traffic at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted between 1-2 min. Strange but true.  I called the local 13 Eye Witness News Tip Line an hour later.  I was the only report at the time regarding this sighting.<n>

They were in the north sky. The full moon was just to right and south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now sitting at the stop light there were other cars around us at the stop light as well. We were able to see a shape that looked like a straight line . It was horizontal and moving from horizontal to slanted left to right. It was very large ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> the size of the full moon or bigger. It suddenly pulled away further north faster than we could track it. Our light turned green but all the cars were hesitant to go including myself. I finally resumed driving north keeping my eye on the object which was still strobing. The object came to a sudden stop while we were still travelling north. The object was actually very close to a light tower off in the distance and it just sat there hovering. The lights went off and the object was a dark triangle now .

Having seen this before, I got my housemate immediately so I could have a witness.  The light was moving slowly in a southerly direction, and was consistently decelerating.  After moving about 15 degrees in the sky, it came to a stop.  My housemate thought it was rising, though I couldn&#39;t tell.  Using my binoculars (with a large garbage can as a base to steady the binoculars), I viewed the light for 3-4 minutes.  There appeared to be a very dim orange light directly above the very bright light, with a distinct gap between the two lights.  The light moved slightly in a southwesterly direction, stopped again, then began moving north.  After traveling about 5 degrees in the sky, it pulsed once, then disappeared.  I watched for another 10 minutes or so, and the light did not reappear.  This is the third time that this light has been viewed from this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had my digital camera with me to take pictures of my son when we go to the park. I took two pictures. The first I took with the window up. I immediately turned the window down and took another. I did not notice anything unusual in the sky when looking which might have been because I should be wearing eyeglasses but don&#39;t.  Once I got home and downloaded the pictures onto my computer I noticed something circular within one of the clouds. In the second picture the object is not there. I have never seen a UFO before and have never quite belived in them. I was just curious to find out what it was if anything. I&#39;ve shown the picture to my mother and she told me to try and find out if it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/12/06 15:57|Pearland|TX|Circle|8-10 seconds|Fast-moving, circular, white object observed for 8-10 seconds--day time sighting.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50535.html|189|ndxe200605| Fast-moving, circular, white object observed for 8-10 seconds--day time sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the above time, date &amp; location, I observed a very small, white, circular craft almost directly above me--looking straight up in the sky.  This object was traveling almost directly north with about a 10-30 degree westerly direction, (using a 360 degree compass).  The object traveled two (2) times faster than a satellite; possibly three (3) times faster than a satellite.  This craft traveled in a straight line for 8-10 seconds &amp; then faded out.  I did not hear any sound at all from this craft.  It is extremely difficult for me to determine the altitude of this object, which as I think about it, is truly another odd characteristic of this craft.  (I will explain this comment further in the text).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was 100% cloudless, very clear, and a beautiful day that everyone was commenting about.  The temperature was about 78 degrees with calm winds &amp; moderate to low humidity.  I was getting my car washed, and was walking my dog and looking up at the sky when I observed this craft.  (I had a video camera in the trunk of my car, but this object was moving so quickly, there was absolutely no time to go back for it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Holding my hand straight out, my thumb would easily cover this craft.  The best description on size I could think of was that this craft was about the same size as a very high flying plane that you can just make out on an extremely clear day, maybe a plane at 30,000-40,000 feet or so.  In other words, a plane that you CAN completely make out, but is absolutely tiny as seen with the naked eye because its altitude is so high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With this said, it should be understood that I have been a plane fanatic since I was small child.  It should also be understood I enjoy looking for and watching night time satellites &amp; have easily seen 100 in my life.  (Out in the country on one night, I observed eight satellites in a 2-3 hour time period, I know what satellites look like).  I have grown up close to a major civilian airport, and also around a military airport.  I can easily estimate the altitude of just about any plane or helicopter with relative accuracy.  But with this object, I am having a real problem with even attempting to guess its altitude to an almost frustrating degree.  I do not understand this.  My best guess is that this object was at an altitude of 10,000 to 40,000 feet.  I am leaning toward roughly 30,000 feet.  I will say that I do not believe it was any lower than approximately 10,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how large this circular craft was.  However, this craft looked remarkably similar to the craft seen in the videos that are repeatedly taped in Mexico.  I am speaking of the dozens of white (apparently circular) craft that fly together usually in formation, sometimes in, &#34;swarms.&#34;  The craft I saw looked like one of these craft, but at an apparently higher altitude and moving much faster than most of the videos I have seen of similar craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will say that this thing was really moving; it had to be going at least 4,000 mph or much faster depending on its altitude.  No sonic boom, no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should add that I was wearing sunglasses.  The brand name of these sunglasses is, &#34;Costa Del Mar.&#34;  I paid about $140 dollars for these about seven years ago.  What distinguishes these sunglasses from the corner store sunglasses is the coating.  Without getting technical, these sunglasses make objects extremely vivid &amp; clear as compared to any other sunglasses I have ever owned or come across.  (These sunglasses are actually fisherman’s sunglasses, although I do not fish).  When I first purchased them, I was amazed how vivid &amp; clear birds &amp; planes appeared.  My point is that, with the exceptionally clear weather, together with my 20/20 vision, and the added clarity of these sunglasses, I was able to determine this craft’s shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was not glowing white, no lights, no pulsing.  It was simply a clear, vivid white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides my inability to determine the objects altitude &amp; size, another odd characteristic was its movement.  I would not describe it as flying, but as gliding. This is simply my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe this was a daytime satellite.  The reason I do not believe this was a satellite was that I could make out this craft’s shape which was, although tiny, clearly round.  A second reason I do not believe this was a satellite was because this thing was moving faster than any object I have ever seen in my life; two to three times faster than any satellite.  With that said, and to be completely objective, I do not recall observing a day time satellite--only early morning or late evening satellites.  So if it was a day time satellite, why was it clearly round, and why was it moving so fast?  I am in my mid thirties, and have never seen a UFO in my life.  And it is not for lack of trying; I am constantly sky watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this object may have been except a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear ((name and title deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the excellent report!  You seem to us to be an excellent witness, and you compose prose unusually well, which is something we observe here only rarely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did the object generate a contrail, please?  Also, was its shape similar to any type of aircraft that you can imagine?  For example, if it had wings, were they swept back, or similar to a delta-winged aircraft, perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, do you have any idea why the object faded from view?  It seems unusual that the object disappeared from view, given that you sighted it during daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center, and for taking the time to compose such a nice report.  We will be posting newly received reports tomorrow, and yours will be among them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, we just received two reports tonight, one from Texas, and one from Sacramento.

(And there were no contrails in the sky that I noticed as well).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its shape was not similar to any aircraft I have ever seen including the alleged Aurora.  I have been to a few air shows, and pride myself on distinguishing most military aircraft &amp; have done so since I was in 7th grade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No wings, no swept back wings like the F-14.  Not delta-winged.  This object was clearly circular in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, I failed to answer this in my report &amp; knew while I was writing it that this was not clearly stated.  I do not know why it faded from my view.  Perhaps this object was much higher than 40,000 feet.  In layman’s terms, if 12 O’clock is straight up, I observed this object at about 12:30 and, &#34;lost&#34; it at about roughly 2 O’clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving.  Possibly it was in the atmosphere.  I just cannot answer this.  I will say that this object, this craft, was indeed difficult to see &amp; perhaps I just lost sight of it.  My best guess, and this is a guess, is that it was at 30,000 to 40,000 feet, a tiny 30 foot disc, and I just lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You are welcome.  Thank you for all you have done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, we just received two reports tonight, one from Texas, and one from Sacramento.  The TX sighting may have been of a satellite, but the CA sighting was of a totally dark, motionless, triangular craft, that reportedly was seen hovering above a busy intersection in Sacramento.<n> <n><n> Many cars stopped, so that the occupants could get a better look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, at about 10 pm to 10:15 pm, I was walking my dog &amp; listening to my ((deleted)) on my cell phone.  I looked up at the stars as I always do.  I noticed what appeared to be a bright star.  It caught my eye for just a second or two, I believe because it may have been moving, I am not sure, and I looked back down.  (Just a normal bright star).  I looked up maybe five seconds later and this, &#34;star,&#34; was gone and that really caught my attention.  So I carefully watched the sky roughly where this, &#34;star,&#34; had been, and then noticed a typical looking satellite, a satellite that has, &#34;dimmed,&#34; after not being lit up by the sun, but is clearly visible.  (It was traveling north).  I only saw this apparent satellite after it had, &#34;dimmed,&#34; for a couple of seconds before it clearly disappeared from my view.  This &#34;dimmed&#34; satellite moved at the speed as per normal for all satellites I have observed.  As I was still looking up at the sky, I then noticed a very dimly lit V-shaped formation of maybe 8 to 10, &#34;birds&#34; (?) moving north/north-east.  If these were birds, they kept one hell of a tight formation.  I lost these, &#34;birds&#34; within a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER seen anything that I considered could possibly be a UFO until I submitted my report.  I was literally typing the report when my ((deleted)) called &amp; ((deleted))  So I walked my dog.  The first object was probably a satellite, the second object very possible birds.  But the second object was simply odd because this formation was so tight and literally kept perfect formation.  It truly looked like the typical V-shaped formation that has so often been seen.  This was so weird that I could not bring myself to submit a second report--in the middle of my first UFO sighting/report of my life; I walk outside and see this.  But after the two sightings you mentioned I felt I should at least mention this.  Again, this is so odd, that I never would have mentioned this had you not mentioned these sightings.  Please understand this information is absolutely true, absolutely sincere, and not a joke in any form.  I do not know what else to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,<n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END RESPONSE))<n>

I was taking night photos with my hi-end camera for use in a poster. I took some photos with extra high exposure time and ended up getting some flying objects not visible at naked eye (multiple shapes). Maybe they were invisible and got caught only because of the extreme exposure time. I don&#39;t know. It can also be a camera&#39;s fault, but is very unlikely because this is a high precision camera and only some regions of the sky show this thing.

I had noticed a large number of planes in the area (I think this was in the approach to the Austin Airport) and at first I thought it was a helicopter as it was much lower (about 30 degrees elevation vs 45+ where the planes were) and it seemed to be hovering over the town of Elgin. It was so bright though I just kept watching it. There was a full moon and it was clear - I could see the strobes and nav lights on the planes clearly but this had none and the light was shifting in color as I watched it. At this point it was probably 5 miles or so away. After 10 minutes I was directly south of it and within a mile. At this point I could see it had no strobes, was alternating between a hover and very tight circles and the light had a color that just didn&#39;t look normal. If the planes lights were the size of a pencil the light(s) on this were the size of the pencil itself (a little bigger). I saw several cars pulled over and the people from them standing outside watching the object. When it would circle closer to my car the radar / laser detector in my car would begin alerting every signal type and strength. (I had pulled over at this point and sat in my car watching). I noticed one of the planes in the area begin descending sharply towards the object and realized it was one of a few military jets when it came closer. When it was about a mile or so away the object suddenly dimmed and then it just kind of blinked to a spot 5 miles or so to the north west. It began it&#39;s bright light show again and moved off slowly until I couldnt see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a vapor trail forming in the upper atmosphere. I watched a silver disk like object desend at the tip of the vapor trail. The trail formed a billowing in the middle of the vapor line and continued towards the ground. After several hundred feet a second billowing cloud formed in the vapor trail at which point an object  made a 45 degree angeled turn towards some very high clouds in the west.Towards the setting sun which reflected off its surface.  The object turned twice more and  then speed away into a nearby cloud bank at a very high rate of speed. leaving only the vapor trail.which it was no longer making. We then drove about a half a mile to the Buckhead Ridge Marina  and watched the vapor trail disapate and see if the object would emerge from the clouds,  which it didnt.

5/10/06 01:00|Moscow|ID|Triangle|4 hours|I was otside studying for a final and was looking up when what was a light at first darted and then instantly came to a stop.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50501.html|207|ndxe200605| I was otside studying for a final and was looking up when what was a light at first darted and then instantly came to a stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first i was laying on the hood of my roomates car cooling off and studying for a final.  looking at the paper while lying on my back on the hood, what seemed to be the brightest star in the sky just moved.  i was on the phone with someone and i said, &#34;O, my god... i swer that is a ufo.  i&#39;ll call you right back.&#34;  i tried to get someone from my roomate and my girlfriend to come out but they just got pissed and complained about getting up early for finals.  i called my best friend who said, &#34; whatever, i believe you, now stop calling and let me go back to sleep.&#34;  i called the neighbor who looked out the window and said the couldn&#39;t see anything.  well i explained that it was almost directly over the house.  about that time her baby woke up and she was fed up with that idea.  at this time i was going nuts.  i thought i was loosing it.  i was brought up in the lds religion and i have never believed in ufo&#39;s of any kind... untill i saw what i did.  i went to a friends house a few doors down and nucked and rung the door bell.  her roomate came down and i could barely get the words out.  it was baffling... i couldn&#39;t even begin to tell her what i was seeing.  so she came out and i pointed it out to her.  she saw the light, said she saw it move a little, then claimed it was a satalite.  i had to tell her what i saw.  the thing moved at incredible speeds and didn&#39;t slow to a stop, bot instantly came to a stop.  then she asked if i had smoked anything.  i realized this was going nowhere.  i let her go and tried to figure out what to do.  i tried calling my best friend again to see if i could barrow his camera because all i had was my cell phone and the video quality isn&#39;t the best.  he got mad again so i flipped.  i need someone to believe me and see what i am seeing.  i recorded almost 3 minutes of this light on my cell phone which was barely visible, but it is still there.  at this time i saw two more lights moving with every motion that the first light was.  it was definately a triangle.  i thought to call 911 and maybee get an officer out to my house to file a report or something.  as you could guess... bad idea.  the wierd thing was, i tried to dial 911, it failed?  kinda wierd.  so i tried to dial my neighbor again and then my best friend, and on top of it tried to send a text message to the person i was on the phone with to begin with.  i couldn&#39;t dial out.  i just got this phone this week.  so i run in and grab my old cell phone which still worked.  i dialed 911 and requested an officer to my house.  i had to call back again 10 minutes later to see if he was coming.  another five minutes passed and he showed up.  once again i could barely explain myself.  i paointed at it as it was moving and he wouldn&#39;t stop staring at me.  then he turned on the flashlight to my face and asked if i had consumed any lsd or if i was under the influence of anything.  at the time i wasn&#39;t (lucky me).  so he starred at it and couldn&#39;t tell if it was him moving from standing there looking almost straight up or if it was the light.  the next words out of his mouth was, &#34;wow. i saw a shooting star... hey, another one.  that&#39;s kinda odd.&#34;  i looked at him like; you&#39;ve got to be kidding me.  where the few shooting stars came from was exactly where i pointed to the ship.  i tried to say, they came from the ship in three different directions.  officer, you have to believe me.  i swear i am not crazy.  odly i said that line a whole lot throughout the night.  he got a call and said he had to go.  he tried to saw it was probably some airforce testing.  i could tell that he was in denial of what he had just seen.  said he had some where to be and left.  at this time it was around 2:30 am.  where does a sheriff have to be at that time, and why was he so jumpy.  none the less i was still going crazy.  no one honestly believed me.  i laid back on the hood watching the bright light almost twinkle to a red, then a green, then a blue, and then back.  all of a sudden i got this terrifying feeling throughout my body.  for some reason i was frightened.  it takes a lot to scare me, but when i was thinking why am i scared, because physically i wasn&#39;t but i had one bad feeling, i snapped to realizing that i was shaking and already starting to run towards my door.  i had to go somewhere.  i drive into city limits around 4:45 am.  there was a hince of light coming up over the palouse so i hurried into town.  the first place that i saw was conoco.  thankfully it was twenty four hours and i saw two employees inside.  the lady at the door mopping looked at me funny... probably the expression on my face.  i was hoping for someone that recognized me from shopping in there all of the time so they wouldn&#39;t be freaked out and would actually give me the time of day.  behind the counter in the back room was a newer employee that i had only seen once or twice before, but the person who had trained him the first night i saw him was a good aquantance and told him that i was a cool person and was in there all the time.  of all people, the only person that would recognize me and was around my age was him.  i tried to explain but nothing came out.  just come outside quick, and if you can think of anyone with a camcorder, call them.  he comes out of the store throwing on his jacket and i point to the sky.  he was like, what?  so i pulled him out of the front of the store to the side where there was less light and i stood close to him and pointed.  i didn&#39;t even have to say it, he said, &#34; wow, that bright light right there isn&#39;t it.&#34; he knew what i was talking about.  he didn&#39;t know what i meant but looked right where i was.  i told him now watch.  give it around thirty seconds.  i saw it randomly jolt to different sides and suddenly stop.  every time i was all, you saw that right?  he really couldnt tell if it was him moving from standing up or if it was his eyes grabbing focal points or what.  so i laid on one of the tables and told him, &#34;please, give me two minutes of your time and just lay on that other bench at stare at it.&#34;  he was supprisingly willing.  once again i had to state, i swear i am not crazy.  after about fifteen seconds of this thing moving around and me asking if he saw it... he took a wierd gasp of air.  the next thing i hear is, &#34; o my god... you arn&#39;t kidding are you.&#34;  finally.  i pointed out that there was dimmer lights on the other two points.  he struggled but adjusted and saw them.  as we bothe watched it move and come to frantic instant stops i notince you couldn&#39;t see stars behind it.  i followed the direction from the bright light on the front to the dimmer lights that formed the triangle and there was still blackness with no stars continuing down the ray that the lead light and the dim light formed.  together we both counted between 4 and 5 lights down each side.  we watched it move and saw by the way the lights moved together that the tip (wich i designated to the bright lead light) was wobbling not only side to side, but corresponding with the other lights, up and down also.  it looked like the lead star would randomly point down, then left, then right... by now i realized that this wasn&#39;t just the bright light that i saw before.  this was an outline of some sort of craft that seemed like it was struggling to hover in one place.  by focusing on the outline of the craft and not on the lights themselves, i understood that it wasn&#39;t just darting and stopping, it was turing from side to side, from front to back trying to counter the way it would randomly move.  i had to pull out my phone.  the second phone that i grabbed would dial out, but i hit the capture video button and the screen showed a brief flashing triangle and went to static.  as i am typing this, the video or the camera will no longer work on my old phone.  so one could dial out, and one could capture video.  i grabbed my new phone out of the car wich couldn&#39;t dial, but we stood there and captured 43 seconds of the triangle moving around randomly flashing lights.  once again, bad quality, but we could make it out when we watched in the dark.  i tried watching the few videos again a little while ago, but with sunlight up now, and no dark rooms in my house i figured i&#39;d look at it later tonight to show anybody and everybody who will give me the time of day.  with this mind boggling site over head we both laid back and watched the evasive movements.  out of the corner of my eye, the was quick movement.  there where random &#39;shooting stars&#39; in the sky every couple minutes.  and then none.  as the sun started to come up to the point that you couldn&#39;t see stars, we saw that there was only a handful of lights in the sky.  the one we were watching, and now, other movements just like the one before.  we tried to count how many actual clusters of lights there where instead of trying to make out all of the individual lights.  it was amazing.  he ran into the store to grab a coat and i waited at the door, then looked at the lady who was mopping when i walked in and told her she had to see this.  we all walked outside and looked up to a hazy dark gray sky with random stars in the middle of nowhere with comparison to the other stars.  i looked to the east and saw the light blue peaking out from the rolling hills of the palouse.  &#34;does anyone have a good video camere?!&#34;  no body will ever believe us.  we all laid watching the sky, with evasive manuvers from many different areas.  i saw a wierd formation with all of these.  for a couple seconds it seemed like all of those lights were one huge ship.  with the way they moved so scattered across the sky covering almost half the distance from horizon to horizon, i couldn&#39;t focus on them all at once because there was no longer an outline formed by the stars behind it.  i quickly dropped that idea when i saw the light furthest to the east move sharply towards the sunrise and stop where i could barely see it against the lighter sky.  it was wierd, there was no shape, there was no outline, just the lights that formed the triangle with the blue sky showing through as if it was only a few lights hovering there.  it sat still, darted a couple times, sat still again, and we looked away to see the other ones.  when we looked back we couldn&#39;t find it again.  now we all laid there and saw now less than 3 different triangular star cluster moving independantly.  there were random lights moving around behind these three wich were obviosly the closer ones, but we could&#39;t make out triangles.  just that main light that seemed to lead it.  we looked to the west to see if there were more, and against the western sky, wich was still dark as night, was a twinkling red light.  it went back and forth from red and yellow and white but mainly stayed a reddish twinkling color.  at first we just though it was a star, or maybe one of the nearby planets that reflects a red twinkle.  and it moved!  we watched that one now because the color on it was easy to spot and the contrast of the red on the black made it easy to depict motion.  it was very far away though and it was barely above the horizon, so we decided to lay back down on the benches.  as it got lighter, customers would come for gas or for the convienance store and on thier way out, i couldn&#39;t help it, but i got their attention and pointed to the sky which seems to come out a lot better than my words.  some people would walk over tawards me and ask what about the stars.  as it got lighter, these were the only stars in the sky.  i told many people who were curious to just watch for at least 30 seconds, that&#39;s all i ask.  a couple would say they really had to get going, but a couple of them stood there with me, watching.  costumers would leave and come and a couple would be interested but not believe or whatever they were thinking, but me and the conoco employee stayed out on those benches slowly watching the clusters dissapear into the daylight untill the only one left in the sky was the first one that we had seen.  it was geeting light comming up on 5:30-6:00 in the morning and with clear skies, there was an odd haze, or fog, or maybee a random cloud cluster.  slowly the stars forming it&#39;s shape vanished in the light, and the last light wich was the first that we saw blended in the the daylight.  it was one long night.  there are a handfull of us who can&#39;t deny what we saw, and a couple breif video clips on my phone to prove it.  i hope that in the next couple days i find of other people who saw this.  i&#39;ll tell you what, i know exactly where i will be tonight between 1 and 6.  out on the hood of the car, hoping i see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/9/06 23:40|Lewiston|ID|Triangle|10+minutes|3 sets of  lights (changing color) in a triangle formation moving slowly over Lewiston valley.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51359.html|208|ndxe200605| 3 sets of  lights (changing color) in a triangle formation moving slowly over Lewiston valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way to work noticed 3 sets of unfamilier looking lights moving slowly over valley W/NW (towards Moscow),they formed a triangle formation . I stopped my vehicle and got out to get a better look. It was hazy and the ambiant light from valley was making it hard to see any detail other than the lights that were changing color constantly. I got the feeling it was one object at the time but was not sure ,I could not see any mass between the lights. The sets of lights appeared the same color with a white center light changing to a light but bright blue, with what apeared to be rotating or flasing lights around it (they were changing from red ,green, yellow ).I got back in my vehicle and headed on to work , this was the same general direction the lights were moving. I parked my vehicle and walked to a wall that blocked a lot of the light surround my work facility.  I again could see the lights which had moved on farther towards Moscow (and above the Snake River Canyon). The perspective of the lights seemed to change but it was from the greater distance (I still believe it was a triangle shaped object but at a greater distance from me). The distance was greater and so was the haze but the direction of the object changed slightly as almost following the river. For a moment I thought the lights broke formation or atleast changed formation but I think it was the object changing dirrection. I watched as the lights faded out in the haze and lights .Just before it faded out I was able to guess altitude at about the same as the top of the Snake River canyon . The object was first seen by me just past and above the Lewiston airport(west) and was last seen above the Snake River past the port facilities that are on the north side of river and west of Lewiston. In 10 plus minutes the object moved about 10 miles in around 10 minutes at best.      I had not reported this until reading report of students sighting in Moscow just over an hour later, it seemed that the sightings might relate????<n>

5/9/06 05:06|Los Altos Hills|CA|Light|15 - 20 min.|apparent aircraft develops comet-like tail which grows steadily, eventually losing its fan shape, becoming a luminous cloud|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50895.html|213|ndxe200605| apparent aircraft develops comet-like tail which grows steadily, eventually losing its fan shape, becoming a luminous cloud<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I had reported this event immediately.  Finally checking the NUFORC log today, I found 3 reports around 5am of May 9 that share elements of my sighting, but I believe that I witnessed a more complete, longer duration event.  Returning home after a very late night at work (normal for me), I had just pulled off I-280 at the Foothill College (Moody Rd.) exit when a bright light in the southern sky caught my attention.  I am thoroughly familiar with the constellations and celestial bodies, so anything &#34;out of place&#34; is immediately evident.  This object was at least Sirius- or Jupiter-bright, in the constellation Ophiuchus and somehwat east of Arcturus.  Jupiter had already set or was obscured by the coastal ridge.  The object was moving very slowly north- or northwestward and at first I took it to be an incoming aircraft.  Expecting its brilliant, steady white light to begin strobing any second, I was astonished when instead it sprouted a &#34;vapor trail&#34; on its left side that mimicked a classic comet tail (I noted the time [5:06] on my car&#39;s digital clock about now).  This trail was highly structured and almost perfectly triangular.  It then began to grow steadily but maintained its geometrical shape.  As I continued to watch (I had parked my car on the periphery of Foothill College by this point) it was as though the mass of the original object were being converted into this growing exhaust trail.  Eventually, the object was completely &#34;consumed&#34; and no longer visible, leaving behind a glowing elliptical cloud with a very long major axis.  This cloud easily covered the area of a small to mid-size constellation, perhaps larger than Ursa Minor or about half of Hydra.  It faded gradually but I could still make out traces of it 10 to 15 minutes later when I arrived at home.  As far as altitude and location, I would estimate it to be somewhat higher (2000-3000 ft.) and closer to the coast than the San Jose observer.  I fully expected some mention of it to be made immediately on local radio (there was nothing subtle about this!), but KGO, KCBS, and KQED-FM were all silent.  Nothing could be found in print the next day.  I have been intending to check the NUFORC log all this time, but the more usual weirdnesses of life have kept me distracted.  By the way, I am a CSETI member and have witnessed a wide range of UFO phenomena, but nothing before quite like this.  I am willing to discuss this incident with anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were walking in the flight deck to ensure all the planes were secured when i looked to the sky and saw what looked like a shooting star and i told my other buddies so we were looking at it and the &#34;UFO&#34; started noving in a weird pattern going to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the red light then made a spiral and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> like 2 minutes later we saw a fast aricraft making rounds in the area where we saw the object.  we know its not one of our aircraft because all the planes were grounged. Then, like 1 1/2 hours later we saw the same red light only that this time the light &#34;exploded&#34; leaving a bright white light that looked like an asteroid &#34;whit a tail&#34; that dicipated in a &#34;cloud&#34; but there were no clouds in the sky that night.<n>

5/8/06 23:10|Bloomington|IL|Unknown|1:10|Noiseless, motionless, seemingly shapeless object hovers over rooftops around midnight.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50503.html|217|ndxe200605| Noiseless, motionless, seemingly shapeless object hovers over rooftops around midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:10 pm on 5/8/06, I had just arrived at work.  I heard my fellow employees calling for another employee to come outside to see something.  A few minutes later, another employee came in and asked if me and a few others if we wanted to see a &#34;blimp.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked outside, and approximately 500 feet in front of me, and approximately 500-1000 feet in the air (about the height of an average radio tower), we saw three lights in a triangular formation (one green light on top, two white lights below).  On of the lights might have been flashing slowly.  There was no silouette or object that we could make out for them to be connected to, it was as black as the night sky.  Below, but from our view unconnected to the lights, was a flat, bottomside of a rectangle, which was not necessarily illuminated, but had a grayish tint to it (like it was reflecting the moon, kind of thing), and it didn&#39;t appear to be connected to anything.  The object was motionless.  We watched it for approximately 10 minutes without it moving, and the night was silent.  It seemed that the employees who had called it a &#34;blimp&#34; were assuming that&#39;s what it was because there was no solid shape, outline, or reflection (other than the previously mentioned rectangle) to be seen.  It did NOT look like a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside to call my husband who was working at another worksite about 1.5-2 miles north and east of me, and asked him if he could see anything.  He informed me that others were already going outside to look at something, and that he would go check as soon as he could.  He was unable to go out for apprx. 30 minutes, but when he did, was able to see a &#34;side&#34; view of lights.  I assumed what I was seeing was a &#34;rear&#34; view because when I went back outside to check on it around midnight, it was about 1000 feet away instead of 500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to find a website that had blimp schedules for 2006, and there were no scheduled blimp flights in our area for May at all, as they were all in the South for golf tournaments and the Kentucky Derby.  There was no sound or motion to indicate a jet or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having grown up on a Navy base in S. California, I am quite familiar with all kinds of aircraft, and the sounds that they make...even the Stealth fighters and bombers make some noise.  This object made no noise, had little to no movement, and had no form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those of us who observed this object at my workplace had mixed opinions as to what this object was, ranging from a military experiment to UFO&#39;s, but we were all clear that the object was NOT a blimp.  I did not see it leave, although an employee that works with my husband reported seeing it, looking away for a moment, then looking back at it, and it was missing from the sky.<n>
5/8/06 23:10|Bloomington|IL|Unknown|1:10|Series of stationary lights in the sky, unmoving and constant for apprx an hour and ten minutes.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50502.html|218|ndxe200605| Series of stationary lights in the sky, unmoving and constant for apprx an hour and ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:10 pm on 05/08/06, I was at work and my wife phoned me from her place of employment to inform me that her fellow employees, and others at her place of work, were looking at an object in the sky.  She asked if I could see the object from my worksite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to leave my station for about 15-20 minutes, but other employees were already outside observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 11:45 pm, I was able to leave my station and view the object.  What I saw is as follows:  I saw what appeared to be a configuration of lights that you would commonly find on a commercial passenger jet.  A vague light at the front, much like an illuminated cockpit.  A white strobe light underneath was pulsing.  At what I considered to be the rear, a slightly larger constant light, not very bright, was the color of a slightly yellow moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although there was nothing spectacular about what I was seeing, the most remarkable aspect of this sighting is that there was absolutely no motion or noise.  The object did not appear to hover because this would infer that it was making adjustments in horizontal and vertical attitude.  This object seemed to be set in the sky much the same as any radio tower or water tower light that you might observe.  But, as my collegues and I were aware, there was absolutely no tower or fixed light in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between my colleagues and me, we viewed this object for about an hour and ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the first person at my site had to leave to go home, they saw the object as they were driving away, they looked down at the road, and looked back towards the object again, and it had disappeared.  He then called us, we went back outside, and there was absolutely nothing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I phoned a local radio program, and asked if there were any other reports of sightings.  They informed me that somebody had called at the same time that night, and reported seeing a &#34;blimp.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on three occasions about the sighting, and about his subsequent investigation of the event, and he sounded quite credible to us.

At first I thought they were planes in a holding pattern. As I got closer, another light appeared and they appeared to fly in formation. As I took a left turn onto Lancaster Pike, these three lights flew fast over Silverbrook Cemetary and headed into the Town of Elsmere. I lost sight of them over the trees until I got onto Kirkwood Hwy. They flew over the Elsmere Bridge and into the City of Wilmington where I lost sight of them. I called a friend of mine and he also spotted them over Alban Park on Maryland Ave outside of Wilmington with 2 USAF Trucks following them.<n>

I looked up and saw a floating black V shaped object drifting just below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over and stepped out of my car and watched it for about 10-15 minutes.  It didn’t move erratically.  It just floated, back and fourth, slowly ascending into the sky while heading eastward, maybe south eastward, towards Mount Si, and North Bend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, it was low enough to see that it wasn’t a commercial airliner, it moved to slowly.  It definitely was not a paraglider, I hike Tiger mountain on a weekly basis and I see Para gliders take off all the time, I’ve even spoken to some of them about what it costs and what the conditions have to be like for a good flight.  They ride thermal pockets, and this day was far too windy and to cloudy to see any Para gliders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just cruised, it seemed as if it was slowly gliding back and fourth, because the V shape was clear, then it flattened out as was just a black line floating through the sky.  It had no noise at all.  It was more curved than a B-2, which has sharp angles along the back.  The floating V was smooth, and it had no glimmer at all, no glint from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it ascend and get further away, until it was a black dot far away in the sky.  As it got further I saw a slightly orange/brownish glow around it, it looked almost like a sunspot in the eye, that’s the only thing I can think of to compare it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was about it, it wasn’t fast like a jet, it was too big to be a para glider, and it was definitely not a bird.   A black boomerang shape just floating through the sky casually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite credible.  We are familiar with the hang-gliders that frequently can be seen on the windward side of Tiger Mtn., and they probably would not venture as far away from that mountain as the east side of Lake Sammamish, and as far as Mt. Si.  PD))<n>

It was white, glowing dimly, moving straight across the sky; at an arm&#39;s length, it was about the size of a pinhead.  A few seconds later, it stopped in the middle of the sky, and I asked my friend if he could see it too.  He said he could, and as I looked back the object quickly grew in size. I am unsure if it came closer or it just grew at the original distance, but it became equal to the size of a basketball at arm&#39;s length.  It stayed like this for about 2-3 minutes, then it vanished in an instant.  There were no sounds or additional light sources, and I have seen satellites in the sky before; this was no satellite.  Afterwards I do not remember how much time may or may not have actually pasted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was facing west when I noticed a light moving from a westardly direction that was very high in the sky.  If it were not moving, I could have easily mistaken it for a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It followed a slightly arced pattern in the sky, heading in a south east direction.  When it was directly above me I called my wife to come outside and witness what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first she thought it was an aircraft, then I pointed out how high it was and how fast it was moving. There were no flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She then realized that it was unusual.  As we were facing south east, at about the ten o&#39;clock position the object stopped and started to fade.  It appeared like it was going straight up.  It then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen meteor showers and this did not look like a meteor.  Right after the incident, we saw a high flying aircraft and realized from that reference that what we had seen was not an aircraft.  We&#39;ve never seen anything like this.<n>

Now I&#39;m an A+ student in High School and i&#39;ve researched UFO&#39;s before, but this really had me confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 9:30 and we noticed 3 red lights that were in the sky.  At first I suspected it to be an aircraft coming in for landing, but then I noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving fast enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at it further, we could see that they weren&#39;t separate aircrafts either, because the area between the 3 lights was a different shade of black than the rest of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a regular airplane came over, it looked to be on an intercept course.  We could then see how big the UFO actually was.  It had to be at least 20 times the size of the airplane that intercepted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried following the UFO but it seemed to be traveling faster and faster, finally moving too far away to see.<n>

I thought it was a plane, but it didn&#39;t move. I asked my father to look at it. He went in and brought out his binoculars, and the lights were still blinking. Planes were flying way above this thing that looked like a star. After thinking it might be a low satellite, we turned and walked back toward the house. In the sky accross from it, was an identical star, blinking the same color. We looked back at the first one we saw, and it was still there, only not blinking any more.

It appeared in my view directly overhead at 12:00 o&#39;clock position and continued East Souteast in a straight line and then appeared to leave the atmosphere and I lost sight at that moment. It was difficult to view precisely the objects shape but it appeared somewhat globular. Briefly after viewing the UFO, another aircraft of recognizable shape appeared in the same area at an oblique angle of interception, heading East Northeast. That&#39;s all I saw. At first I thought I was seeing a large satellite but satellites don&#39;t leave the atmosphere, do they?<n>

He asked excitedly if I remembered the video of the Mexico City sightings on tv?  (A UFO surrounded by numerous white lights in a formation in the sky)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes was my answer, then he stated he was looking at that type of sighting from his home.  He described a craft with about 40 white lights in formation and gave me a local landmark for a reference point so i could confirm what he was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside only to find a large tree was blocking the location of the sky this formation was observed. However, I continued to talk by phone, getting updates about the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 5 minutes, I too noticed a bright white object about 30 degrees above the horizon just seemingly hanging in the sky to the east of my location, I confirmed with the original witness where I saw the object and concluded that we were viewing the same craft, (Except I could not see the dozens of starlike objects) very slowly drifting ESE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note, that the sky condition at the beginning of this sighting was a high thin overcast with numerous breaks and as the observation continued to its conclusion, from west to east, a more solid condition developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so excited I forgot for about 10 minutes that I had a pair of binoculars in my car, so I ran for them hoping for a better look.  With them, I now could see dozens of white starlike objects moving independently but in formation around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I just wanted to concentrate on watching this and terminated the phone conversation.  As I focused on the 1 main craft, the largest object, I could see it was a saucer shaped white object, rotating, that seemed to change shape streching vertically with odd shaped structures on it.  It seemed to dart around at times, forcing me to search for it, eventually turning to the west and started to track towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the time it just appeared to hang in mid air rotating, but as it eventually moved closer I had better resolution on it, noting that the bottom seemed to have a yellowish glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, several times I saw air carrier jet aircraft tracking N-S or NW-SE in the area above 10,000 ft. wondering can they see what I see?   I was so awed by this craft, appearing to change shape as it rotated, banking and wobbling at times.  At one point only, I saw what appeared to be brilliant crystal like lights on the parimeter of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft eventually moved to a point about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon when I lost sight of it in the overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned home, I made notes, checked for the 4 and 5 PM METAR weather at the local airport, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Int&#39;l. (KAVP), both report were, no clouds below 12,000 ft., also the winds aloft for the area, noting that at all altitudes a west (260degrees)wind was blowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was an Air Traffic Control Specialist for over 16 yrs.and hold a private pilot certificate with instrument rating.  I know what all types of aircraft, civil and military look like and this was not an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contact information for the original witness will be furnished on request.<n>

It was very direct and at a pretty good speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood up and kinda walked along to watch it because i&#39;ve seen something similar here in Largo a few years ago (someone else actually reported seeing that here in Largo, FL).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a jet flying south east and i could compare the two. This object was perfectly round and looked nothing like a plane/jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was kinda strange and i can&#39;t explain it. It might have been from the orange glow of the setting sun. It looked sorta pale orange/gold or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And just like the last one i saw a few years ago, it just disappeared. It didn&#39;t get smaller or anything it was just gone.

I woke Sunday morning with a scratchy sore throat.  I had a recital to give, and had to go forth.  By evening, I was very ill.  I had a horrible sore throat - the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Monday afternoon, I noticed that I had a terribly sore spot on my left arm where it junctions with my torso.  I was confused as to why it would hurt.  Being as ill as I was, I never undressed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, May 9th, while dressing so my husband could take me to the doctor he noticed this triangular shaped bruise, one ince long, with three red lines going thru it horizontally!  I looked and said, &#34;That&#39;s where the pain has been.&#34;  I know I did not do this by hitting or bumping into anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While at the doctors, at Kaiser, I wrote on a pad of paper, Look at this!  The doc said, &#34;Well, we know you&#39;re prone to brusing easily, we could do another test but this looks like you got hit with a three-pronger.&#34;  I have no idea what she meant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I couldn&#39;t even make a sound, I had lost my voice totally. So I just shrugged my shoulders and left the office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, wednesday, I&#39;m a bit better, at least not in bed, and I&#39;m investigating what could have caused this bruise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were standing outside in an area devoid of light so that the evening sky was clear.  We were in Winona, Minnesota.  It was a beautiful night without a cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A loose formation of 4 points of white light traveling from East to West were observed.  The 4 points of light were of equal intensity, remaining constant at about the brightness level of a bright star.  The 4 objects were separate, moving independantly from one another, seaminly to dart about in a loose formation, all traveling together.  As we stood near a tall industrial building, the objects were seen as they came over the roof of the building and then disapeared about 5 seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most unusual thing about the objects was the area around and in-between them.  The space around and between the objects of the formation seamed to ripple as though the light from starts in the background was being distorted.  It was like a large bubble of water traveling across the sky, distorting the light, we could clearly see through it but distorted and rippling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutly no sound, silent.  Our first impression was that the objects were close.  It then appeared that the objects were at very high altitude (or maybe not even flying near the earth) traveling at a very high rate of speed.  Then, as the objects flew to a point about 90 degrees from the initial sighting, they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 60 years old and have seen many strange things in life, but Ive never seen anything like this before.<n>

5/6/06 22:40|Still River|MA|Light|8 Minutes|Bright Yellow/Pale Orange Light in the Northwest Sky over the Former Fort Devens|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50457.html|238|ndxe200605| Bright Yellow/Pale Orange Light in the Northwest Sky over the Former Fort Devens<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, about 10:30pm, I went to go pick up my sister from her high school film festival.  After I picked her up I proceeded to drive on Rt. 110 towards Harvard, MA to bring her to my Father&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I proceeded down the road, I saw a large bright yellow/pale orange light in the sky about 20 degrees on the Horizon, that was far brighter than any planet that should have been in the area of the Northwest Sky. I proceded to drive and look at the moon as a reference point and thought the light was moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This really blew my mind, because I had no idea what this light could be. I broke off of Rt 110, and drove up a large hill towards the &#34;Fruitlands Museum&#34; in Harvard. Since there&#39;s a great view of the Northwest sky from this Orchard hill with many lookout points, we had to get a better look. As we pulled in, my sister and I jumped out of the car to watch this large glowing object varying in lighting intensity in the Northwest sky hovering about 20 degrees over the horizon over the prison hospital near the former Fort Devens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this object slowly move up and down over the lights of the prison hospital for must have been 6 minutes. During this I called my girlfriend to describe what I was seeing and have her call her mother who lives close in the area to look at the sky. My sister also called her friend from her cell phone to look in the sky. As we were watching this object, we noticed lights circling in the cloud cover to the right of the object in the sky. We never saw any definitive objects or lights, but there were lights circling in the clouds making very erratic, then circular patterns.  There were no spotlights shining up from the ground.  There were many cars passing on Rt. 2 which is visible from this point, so someone else driving on the road has to have had to seen this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the light disappeared, just like it clicked off. Just moments after it shut off,  2 fast flying planes came into the area, I could hear them before I could see them. But saw lights on wings fly fast into the general area towards us, then bank around 180 degrees back towards the area we saw the craft. The planes flew around until we noticed there were no more lights shining in the clouds. We watched the sky for about 10 more minutes and saw nothing so we headed back home. We got home shortly after 11:00pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now ontop of this story, I went to check the call time on my phone to see how long I was on the phone with my girlfriend. There was no record of this call on my cell phone when there should have been. There was no record of this call on my girlfriends phone. Then on a separate line with my sister&#39;s phone, she has no record of making this call. I don&#39;t know what this means or even if it is a critical piece of the story, but I found it odd.<n>

I stared at the light (once I spotted it) following it for approximately 30 seconds before it shot up now in a northerly direction, disappearing leaving a tail at the end that eventually vanished also.<n>
5/6/06 22:10|Vero Beach|FL|Circle|00:30|GROUPING OF AMBER COLORED ROUND LIGHTS ALL IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION, SAME LEVEL|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50459.html|240|ndxe200605| GROUPING OF AMBER COLORED ROUND LIGHTS ALL IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION, SAME LEVEL<n> <n><n> <n><n> ON SATURDAY NIGHT 05/06/06, AT APPROXMATELY 10:10 PM I WAS HEADED TO WORK.  I LIVE IN A RURAL PART OF INDIAN RIVER COUNTY IN FLORDIA.  OUR COUNTY IS FAMOUS FOR GRAPEFRUIT AND OTHER CITRUS.  I LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GROVE AREA.  THE NEAREST HOME TO MINE IS APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES AWAY.  THIS AREA IS SECLUDED EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL GROVE BARN.  SOME OF THE BARNS DO HAVE AMBER COLORED STREET LIGHTS SUPPLIED BY FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT.  AS I WAS DRIVING ON 122ND AVE NORTH TO S R 60 IN VERO BEACH, FL.  I LOOKED TO THE WEST.  I OBSERVED THE CELL TOWER WHICH IS LOCATED 3 MILES TO MY WEST ON 154TH AVE.  WHAT I SAW IN THE VICINITY OF THE CELL TOWER WAS A GROUP OF 4 ROUND AMBER COLORED LIGHTS VERY BRIGHT AND AT ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE CELL TOWER. I HAVE LIVED IN THIS AREA ABOUT 3 YEARS NOW AND I KNOW THE LOCATION OF EVERY STREET LIGHT AT THE OCCASIONAL GROVE BARN THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER. I STOPPED FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AND WHERE THESE LIGHTS WOULD BE COMING FROM.  AFTER THAT TIME, I NOTICED A FIFTH LIGHT JOIN THE GROUP OF FOUR LIGHTS.  AGAIN I DID NOT SEE A CRAFT ONLY FIVE BRIGHT LIGHTS RESEMBLING THE SIZE AND SHAPE AND COLOR OF AN  AMBER STREET LIGHT.  BUT NOW THERE WHERE FIVE LIGHTS WHERE SECONDS AGO THERE HAD ONLY BEEN FOUR.  I CALLED MY CO WORKER WHO WAS WAITING TO BE RELIEVED BY ME AT 11 PM.  I TOLD HIM WHAT I SAW AND SAID THAT I WOULD BE IN TO WORK ON TIME BUT WANTED TO TAKE 15 MINUTES TO DRIVE TO THE AREA OF 154TH AVE WHERE I SAW THESE STRANGE LIGHTS.  I WANTED TO SEE IF POSSIBLY THERE WHERE NEW STREET LIGHTS INSTALLED OR SOME EXPLANATION TO WHAT I WAS SEEING.  AS I TURNED MY PICK UP AROUND ON THE DIRT ROAD AND STARTED TO HEAD WEST THE GROUP OF LIGHTS DISAPPEARED. I WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT STILL DECIDED TO HEAD WEST TOWARD 154TH AVE JUST TO SEE IF I COULD SEE WHAT THESE LIGHTS COULD HAVE BEEN.  HEADING WEST SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS APPEARED AGAIN.  BUT THIS TIME THERE WHERE 6 AMBER COLORED LIGHTS ALL IN A ROW AT THE SAME HEIGHT FURTHER WEST AND SOUTH OF WHERE I HAD FIRST SEEN THE GROUPING OF LIGHTS.  I STOPPED MY VEHICLE AND OBSERVED THE LIGHTS FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT.  THERE WAS A GROUP OF SIX AMBER COLORED LIGHTS ALL IN A ROW AT THE SAME HEIGHT.   SUDDENLY ONE BY ONE THE LIGHTS STARTED TO DISAPPEAR AGAIN. I LOOKED TO THE NORTH AND SAW A SMALL PLANE FLYING TOWARD THE SOUTH PASSING IN FRONT OF WHERE THE GROUPING HAD BEEN.  THE PLANE WAS READILY RECOGNIZED FROM THE STRONG HEAD LIGHT AND BLINKING RED TAIL LIGHTS.  THE PLANE SORT OF ZIGGED IN THE SKY AND I WONDERED IF THE PILOT HAD SEEN THE SAME LIGHTS THAT I HAD.  THE PLANE CONTINUED SOUTH.  WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF THE PLANE PASSING, THE GROUP OF SIX AMBER COLORED ROUND LIGHTS SUDDENLY APPEARED. I CONTINUED TO WATCH THEM AND ANOTHER PICK UP TRUCK WENT BY MY AREA.  I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE DRIVER INTRODUCE MYSELF AND HAVE HIM SEE THE LIGHTS.  BUT NOW THERE WHERE ONLY THREE LIGHTS AND THE OTHER WITNESS CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THOSE LIGHTS BEFORE.  WE BOTH WATCHED THE LIGHTS FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN SUDDENLY ONE BY ONE THEY ALL VANISHED JUST AS QUICKLY AS IF SOMEONE HAD TURNED OFF A SWITCH.  I OBSERVED THE LIGHTS FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.  I HAD KEPT MY COWORKER ON THE PHONE THE ENTIRE TIME AND OUR CONVERSATION WAS RECORDED SINCE THE JOB I HAVE USES RECORDED PHONE LINES.  I STAYED IN THE AREA ANOTHER 10 MINUTES BUT THE LIGHTS DID NOT APPEAR AGAIN.  THE AREA WHERE THE LIGHTS APPEARED WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER A GROVE OR RANGELAND OR THE LARGE ST JOHN&#39;S MARSH RESEVOIR.  THIS AREA WOULD NOT HAVE ANY LIGHTING FROM THE GROUND THAT I COULD EXPLAIN.  THE ROUND LIGHTS WHERE IN THE WESTERN HORIZON AT ABOUT 8 O&#39;CLOCK IN THE SKY.  THE SIGHTING WAS TO ME SOMEWHERE BETWEEN WESTERN INDIAN RIVER COUNTY AND YEEHAW JUNCTION WHICH IS ABOUT 20 MILES WEST OF MY LOCATION.  THE GROUP OF LIGHTS ALL WHERE ROUND AND AMBER COLORED.  THERE WHERE SIX IN A ROW AT ONE TIME BUT I HAD SEEN A GROUP OF FOUR AND FIVE.  THESE I WOULD SAY WHERE ALL THE SAME GROUP BUT THE NUMBER OF LIGHTS DID CHANGE IN THE GROUPING.  THE LIGHTS WHERE ALWAYS AT THE SAME LEVEL. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LIGHTS STAYED FIXED IN ONE SPOT UNTIL DISAPPEARING.  THE LIGHTS DID NOT TRAVEL OR DO MANUVEURS IN THE SKY.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The speed that it was traveling and the altitude this object put it at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then slowed and veered from its course from NW to SE back to NW.

So, i ran to get my camera with a 160-480mm zoom lens, and even with that it was still hard to get a clean image of the object.  As I&#39;m focusing i noticed another similar object moving fast toward the first object I saw, and it caught up.  At that point they blended together so it now looked like a single object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, at this point the sky is very clear and blue and the (now joined) single object continued to move until it reached above a cloud (not thick, so it wasn&#39;t hard to see through it)  At this point the object stopped above this very high cloud.  I realized that this could not be a satelite, and I don&#39;t believe weather balloons can be controlled in this manner (go/stop/change direction)?<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object stopped over the cloud, it was there for approximately 3-4 minutes after which it started moving back in the direction it came from, after I looked away to re adjust my eyes (staring hard to focus)  I then noticed another similar object so my guess is it may have been a third one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best description I can give is they just looked like spheres (only shapes i could make out). I did not have my battery in the digital slr, but I really don&#39;t think it would have shown anything of significance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although my wife was home she was aware I was looking at something but she didn&#39;t look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I am somewhat aware of how high commercial airliners fly and am very familiar with seeing them at great heights. I can&#39;t confirm or even saw any details on the objects, just somewhat fast moving objects that looked spherical and I&#39;m ceratain it was higher than what any commercial planes fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never witnessed or reported such events but i figure I may as well.<n>

We stopped our vehicle near the road and my father took a picture of me with the desert sand dunes in the background.  It was very quiet and we were absolutely alone.  No sound of an airplane. When we got home I downloaded the image onto my computer and when I zoomed in on a spot in the background I saw this object, which I can’t identify.  It doesn’t look like an airplane.  More like a metallic cigar shaped object with vertical organic wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My wife remarked that she had been watching it for a couple minutes and it had been stationary with slight movements from her vantage point of leaning back it leaning back in a swivel rocker type of patio chair.  Additionaly she had been observing it where the eaves of the garage and main house came together at a 90 degree angle and and so the object was framed in that view.  She didn&#39;t call me until it began moving and she wanted me to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I couldn&#39;t see it clearly I went inside and grabbed my 8 x 42 fieldglasses for a look.  The obect could be seen very clearly then.  It was all white, with a flat square bottom with radiused corners, and a domed topside.    For all practical purposes of comparison it reminded me of the porportions and shape of a dome shaped 2&#39; X 2&#39; replacement skylight cover if it had radius corners instead of 90 degree corners at a builders center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s course was basically north to south but in a bobbing weaving fashion rather than straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size in my field of view of the field glasses was about the size of the skylight on my neighbors&#39; house which is about 80 feet away.  It was easy to keep it in view and focused there were no control surfaces or propellars or engine nacelles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We traded the glasses back and forth several times and I had to move to end of house when a pine tree blocked viewing.   I thought I would lose view when it went over the moutain but instead it descended in front of the mountain and it was obscured by the foothills in an apparent landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being that we are a few miles from Ft. Huachaca it could be new technology.   It wasn&#39;t &#39;old&#39; technology as I have seen examples them in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The first thing that came to mind was that it was a satellite, but I have never seen a satellite move this fast.  And it seemed to be at a much lower altitude than a satellite. It was obvious that it was in our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And it was absolutely not a plane. Not only was it moving faster than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen, it had no type of blinking light on it at all. I watched it until it disappeared into the northern sky, probably out over Oklahoma City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else from this area thinks they may have seen this, post a report!<n>

I have serious knee problems and I do my rehab exercises at night.  I jogged to the neighborhood park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i finally got there I stopped my jog and streched.I was looking up at the sky because it was an unusally cool night for the Florida month.  About 1 am i looked toward the south towards Osceola/St.cloud County I noticed 5 very bright formations. They almost looked like they were stacked upon one another,yet staggered in a corkscrew 45degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation apeared to be one solid object standing still in the distance. The lights on the object were a bright yellow. Each light at some point faded in and out and had reappeared in the formation very slowly but very bright as it reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this for a good 10mins, the four bottom lights slowly disappeared one by one. The very top light was left it stood alone in the same spot for about 20 seconds. Then like the rest it faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive never witnessed anything like this and im sure there will be other reports on this U.F.O<n>

Since me and sister have affected so much,now we cannot open the curtains as we might encounter with a weird,horrible creature or ship but now we are always looking the place we saw it to see again.Yet nobody has believed us:mum,dad,our close friends.but we are 100%sure that there are sth or sb who is capable of building a ship like this,flying,turning...so mr.davenport I hope you will believe us,then at least you can help us to release ourselves..sorry for my english ,   ((name deleted))     ankara,turkey<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I noticed something up in the sky - there were 4 amber coloured round shapes, hovering around. Amber/orange coloured round balls (is the only way I can explain them) that were lit up, moving around quite slowly. (I really do not know how far away they were or how fast they were travelling.  When I first noticed them they were in a straight line one under the other then one ball of light went behind the another and slowly come back out into view.  We stopped got out of the car to have a better look.  There were already 10 or so cars also pulled up looking up at these strange lit up balls up in the sky. I had my mobile (cell) phone with me so I took a video recording of these strange lights.  (Although, later on when I replayed the short video I couldnt really see anything other than the moon and the dark sky). These balls of light slowly moved away from each other and went up into space getting smaller and smaller to our eyes until we could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one could explain them, they certainly were not planes, helicopters, laser lights or Air balloons.  Really weird, strange!!<n>

This light rose up sharply and split into three seperate lights which can be described as a square/rectangular light,solid on the upper half of this rectangular with the bottom half open with a few horizontal bars goin across. These lights then slowly went out and a similar light would appear just above and angled over, then again fade out and re-appear at another angle. We had binnoculars but could not make out any kind of craft within this outline of lights as of yet. Within a few seconds there began a flurry of small white lights circling this larger pattern of lights and then moving rapidly out of this circular pattern. These smaller lights appras to have 2 rectangular lights that would blink every second or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this happen again a few minutes later in another part of the sky, Same bright orange light with it splitting into some kind of square light. The smaller white lights continued to travel in circular patter throughout the entire sky, Sometimes they appeared to change direction at any given moment. We were speachless for the rest of the evening and did not even speak to eachother about it untill this afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was taking a pic of the moon over my house on the first viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second pic was taken over my roof on the 8th of May 2006.  I was taking a shot of a hawk to blow up and identify later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was surprized when I saw the white dot in the first pic, and after talking with my wife about what it could be, I decided to see if it would happen again.  Although I know after many sighting etc. that things don&#39;t happen the way you might expect it.  They usually are always different and quite the mind trip.  It is hard to explain what is totally alien to ones nowmal life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I took the second shot and there in the pic is a white thing!  What it is I don&#39;t have a clue. But I do know something is happening as I see things like that pretty regularily, but I have never caught one on film. (Ghost or UFO)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some sightings over my home three years straight at around February, I have decided that I need to get some proof for my life.  I wish I could have seen these things with my eye at the time but I didn&#39;t.  It goes with my belief that they (who ever they are or whatever) are able to tell when I see them and hide or move when I try to focus on them.  I had thought that if I used mirrors and took a pic I might be able to fool them!  I think I found a way of confusing them.  My camera takes the shot milliseconds after I push the button.  So my reaction doesn&#39;t coincide with my actions and I can catch them now.  But who really knows.<n>

The &#39;ball&#39; stopped almost directly over my head (it didn&#39;t stop abruptly, just slowed to a stop).  It stayed in that position without any movement at all for approx 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then moved a few degrees sosuth, then north, then south again.  I lost sight of it when it disappeared behind some clouds.  Based on observing aircraft (737 type) landing at the nearby airport at roughly the same height I would estimate the object to be quite small, maybe 10 feet across. There was no sound associated with the ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx 20 minutes later a (i think Tornado) fighter jet passed low over the position that I had last seen the object (It is VERY unusual to see military aircraft in this area  - especially flying as low as it was.<n>

On 5/4/06,  I was in my backyard sitting down,  when I saw (flash) lighting. The whole sky lit up on the horizon, north to west. Nothing out of the ordinary, but there was&#39;nt a cloud in the sky. Told my wife about the event and couldn&#39;t figure it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went online to check local weather and current lighting strikes.  Nearest strike was in Abliene, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not a cloud in the sky. This got me curious, so I was looking in the sky for clouds or a storm.  Looking to the northwest low to the horizon (now about 5- 10 mins later), I saw 4-5 faint star looking objects floating around doing unbelievable manuvers. These objects would be moving slow at first, then at lighting speed change direction.  Sometimes you see only 1 at a time.  Sometimes two or three at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best I can describe it was it looked like a &#34;dog-fight&#34; between stars. They would move up and down, left to right,  figure eights, you name it, zig-zag, at all different speeds. Their speed was unbelievable.  This was not man-made!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notified my wife and woke up my 8 yr. old son to witness.  My son got very scared and started crying, my wife couldn&#39;t comment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called a buddy who lives west of me about 7mi. Told him where to look, he didn&#39;t see anything, but his wife did.  Haven&#39;t spoke to her yet on what exactly see saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted approx. 15-20 mins.  All their manuvers stayed in the general location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notified local UFO hot-line and made a report.  I do not know who to turn to or what?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just wondering if anybody else has witnessed this in the El Paso or Las Cruces, NM, area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n>

I drove my SUV out of the mall and proceeded south on Watson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, about 30 degrees above the horizon, in the southwestern sky, there appeared a very bright, copper colored light.  It immediately caught my attention and I pulled onto the shoulder to watch it. The light maintained a consistent intensity and did not move in any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about three minutes, it suddenly disappeared. I pulled back onto Watson road and drove down to Broadway, where I stopped and made a right hand turn.  I then proceeded west on Broadway and kept looking at the general area where I had seen the copper colored light a couple of minutes prior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light suddenly reappeared, with another copper colored companion light, the second light being about ten degrees to the right of, and about ten degrees above the first light.  Both maintained a consistent intensity, but were brighter than the first appearance a few minutes prior.  I would estimate that they were hovering in the area of the Buckeye Hills Recreation Area, which is about eight or nine miles from where I pulled off of Broadway (at the intersection of Broadway and Apache roads) to observe them further.  Neither light made any movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw at least one other vehicle on Broadway stop and pull over to observe these lights.  After a minute or so, the other vehicle continued on.  I called my wife at our nearby home and asked her to get our camera ready as I was going to come home and try to photograph these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled back onto westbound Broadway and proceed to Miller road.  The entire time the lights were still visible. I maintained visual contact with the lights until I pulled into our subdivision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly retrieved our digital camera and drove back out onto Miller road, but the lights were both now gone.  I stayed in the area for about twenty minutes, but they did not reappear.<n>

A plane caught my eye (I could make out the blinking navigational lights) and then near it I saw a smaller light resembling a star.  I could not make out if it was moving or not until the strangest thing happened. The light appeared to increase in brightness almost instantly and accelerate northward quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed for my friend to see and he watched it with me as it grew increasing brighter, acclerated in speed and then definately moved north and then made a curve off to the left(westard) at steady turn(then moving NorthnorthWest) until we both could only see it with our peripheral vision before it finally dissappeared. The light was definately in a higher atmosphere, because I couldn&#39;t hear and noises and I could not make out navigational lights. It moved rather smoothly to the north on and performed it&#39;s turn with ease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen shooting stars and this was moving way too slow, even when it acclerated and the shooting stars I&#39;ve seen don&#39;t just steady turn, they have a basic straight course.  It&#39;s possible it could have been the afterburner of a jet engine, but my friend as well as myself could see the light dim before it increased into the vanishing white ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing I would like to add was that there was no pulsation to the light, at least from my stand point, in Florida on a perfect evening with the right line of vision you can see miles. There were several planes in the air that night to make comparison to and none were acting in the manner this light was acting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing it we both questioned ourselves because we&#39;ve been out several nights fishing in the darkest of areas and ever seen anything like what we observed that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS did not pass over Port Charlotte, FL, on this date, so is not a possible explanation for the event.

It was also bigger in size, but it was hard to tell exactly how big it really was or the exact distance away because of how it reflected the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noticable sound coming from it or any means of propulsion. I just stood and watched it for a little while and then walked back to the backyard of the house I was working at and pointed it out to a guy I work with.  He acknowledged seeing it and asked me what it was, I told him I didn&#39;t know and we both just watched it continue on the same course for a couple of minutes until it was out of sight.  Because it took so long to get out of sight, I think it was bigger than what I initially thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I thought it was very close and about the size of a basketball. I was a Crew Chief in the Airforce and have seen many different types of aircraft.  I also have a pretty good knowledge of physics and the principles that would be involved to move an object like that, and admit that it had to be something that I can&#39;t explain.<n>

I live in Deerfield Beach, Florida. It was not a shooting star, but more like a comet, but it hung in the sky for a second and then dissappeared. It had a bright tail that remained also, and then faded away slowly. The body looked like it exploded and also slowly faded away. I know nothing about astronomy. I have seen many shooting stars and meteor showers. It was not either. I am 51 years old and have seen many things in the sky but nothing like this. I have been looking on line but cannot find anything except reference to the meteor shower referencing the remaining fragments of Haley&#39;s comet that might appear during this week. I will not rest until I find out what this was, as it was so awesome. Hope you can rest my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background: Curious person, 51 years old.

5/4/06|New York City|NY|Oval||Photos Taken in New York on a Bright Day of Oval Craft Near Statue of Liberty|3/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55551.html|273|ndxe200605| Photos Taken in New York on a Bright Day of Oval Craft Near Statue of Liberty<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing to send along a pair of photos which I think you will find interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother-in-law, a very successful and down to earth woman was on vacation with her mother in New York in early 2006, and as part of their trip they were taking the tour to the Statue of Liberty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before boarding the boat to cross the harbor, they were standing on the shoreline, taking in the sights. My mother-in-law is an amateur photographer with a very nice camera (I’m not sure what kind off-hand unfortunately, only that it is a very expensive camera, and has been used many times for family functions and such, so I know that the quality of photos it takes is extremely high, and the camera is in perfect working order).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While she was taking photos of the harbor and the island across the way, she captured a metallic object hovering just above the water. Her goal was to take a photo of the statue from the shoreline and then take another photo of where they stood on the shore from the island once they crossed (she was playing with the idea of mirroring her position for fun). Once on the island, she took another set of photos, facing the spot they had stood before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In both photos the object can be seen clearly. It was a bright, almost entirely clear day, sometime in the early afternoon and the object was in nearly the same position as before. It appears to have hovered in place for at least the length of the crossing, and if you examine the photos you can tell that it is the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly enough, this appears to be a chance UFO because she states that neither she nor anyone else saw anything the entire time (I don’t know exactly how long the ferry ride is, but I’m sure it’s at least twenty minutes or so including the time between photos) In fact, as she was showing us pictures, she started to skip past these as “silly” because she was having fun with the camera, and never noticed anything unusual about them until I bolted upright in my chair and asked her to let me have them. Once I pointed out the object, she said that she thought they were buoys (which she still thinks) My mother-in-law is not very receptive to things outside the norm (like I said, she’s very grounded), so I think she is dismissing these photos for that reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I have enlarged these photos many times, as far as I could without pixelating them all-together, and the object is not in any way connected to the water, much less floating in it. It is clearly metallic, and vaguely oval in shape, and as I said, it either stayed in place unnoticed for the length of the ferry ride, or reappeared, which seems less likely to me (but that is speculative). There seems to be an off-yellow/reddish &#34;aura&#34; or sheen around the object as well when the photo is enlarged. There doesn’t appear to be a large disturbance in the water around it, and there are definitely not any disturbances or ripples like those that would show up if it were floating in the water, with the water splashing against it; further indicating that it is just above the surface. Also, if you look at the photos, you can get a sense of scale against the images in the background. I’m not an expert, so I don’t want to hazard a guess, but if you look at the object as one point in a vector, or triangulate, it seems to be fairly small, but certainly not as small as a balloon or anything like that, and again, it remained in place far too long to be debris. As I mentioned the camera is in perfect order, and by the photos you can tell that this is not an imperfection in the lens or anything. Anyhow, those are some of my own observations using limited resources.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending scans of the original photos along for your inspection. The first photo is much clearer, and easier to distinguish details in, but the second provides an interesting view of the object against the city in the background, and if you look you can see the dock where they took the first picture off-center to the right for perspective. These are completely untouched, and uncropped. I would be very interested in knowing your opinion of these pictures. Speaking for myself, as someone who has studied the UFO question for over twenty years, I am convinced that this is some sort of UFO, but I’m curious about it because it is very small, and it’s odd for it to be there for so long in the first place, much less without being noticed on such a clear day. It does look somewhat like other objects I’ve seen captured on film, but those have usually seemed larger. Anyhow, if you have another explanation, please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Stopped car and got out to observe.  Was approx. 1500 feet in air, very clearly triangle shaped and absolutely no sound noted.  The shape itself appeared to be deep black, darker than the night sky, almost seemed to absorb any light, and the lights did not appear to illuminate anything under it.  This is in restricted military airspace for Camp Atterbury, which is located approx. 20 miles south.  I observed carefully until the craft slowly moved off to the northwest.  My mother had also had a sighting over our house approx. 3 miles southeast of this location on 11/8/04 of the same type of object.  She notes that during her observation, the craft also had no sound and was very low to the ground.  She had reported her observation to Art Bell by e-mail and still retains a copy of that e-mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first one caught my eye as it flew directly over me at an unknown altitude. I live about eight miles from IAH airport. I watch the planes as they take off and land on a nightly bases. If i had to estimate the the speed and altitude, I would say they were about the same altitude as the planes as they fly over, but moving at a higher speed about double the speed of the planes as they take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moving from south to north this object flew directly over me and was straight above me when i noticed it. It was a pinkish orange in color, appeared to be spherical in shape although it also seemed to have more of a globular shape. The color was strange because Ive never seen a object this color. Almost as if it was a thick translucent color. Completly silent as it moved at a steady speed until it vanished into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i stood there trying to figure out what that was. A few minutes later another one came into view moving at about the same altitude and speed as the first one. This second one was a little darker in color more of an orangish red. Moving this time from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now a person could say that since i live close to the airport that they were planes. These were not planes! They were completly silent, They were of a solid color by that i mean they were not flashing or strobing like the planes do. And these were not just lights either. You could actually see a a shape, almost as if they were lit from the interior with no exterior lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to have blinking lights in an oval shape to one end.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50419.html|279|ndxe200605| We saw a triangular shaped object, that was very far in space.  It appeared to have blinking lights in an oval shape to one end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife saw it first, then she came and got me out of bed and said that she saw a u.f.o so I thought she was joking.  But when I went out side I saw something to the East of my house it appeared to be in space the object was a littel faint to make a clear description.It was clearly somthing so I studied it for a minute and saw a strobe like light shoot away from it many times toward the NW.IN the back ground were stars. The object was still at first, then it moved using the stars as a focal point it moved very fast to another point in space.  Freaked out I went to the neighbors&#39; house to get someone else to conform what we saw. He saw the same thing. While we were watching it, it stopped moving for about 10 minutes. Then it moved again in a different direction.  My neighbor freaked too and went to his neighbor to show him. He and his wife came out, saw it too. They said at first, that it was a sattelite. Then to their suprise it stopped moving and stayed there for about 5 minutes, then moved again in another direction. Every time it stopped we saw the light strobes coming out of it. Then we were standing by the street and a teen boy walked by and we asked him to look and he saw it with the lights coming out of it and said he never saw anything like that. We all laughed and said, &#34;us too&#34;. Then, for more confirmation, I went to another nieghbors house also, to see if they had a telescope to investigate further. They did not, but they saw it too with the lights coming out and away from it but it was stationary at the time. They made some jokes about me smoking somthing, but a few minutes later it started to move again in the opposite direction. It moved, then they weren&#39;t joking anymore. They were freaking out too. We stayed out and watched it for about another hour then it started to move again. This time it headed to the south and in a few seconds it went out of our view and we all looked at each other in disbelief of what we had witnessed. We talked a litte while longer, and went in for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside about 9pm. On the 3rd.  Of may watching the area of the trigo  fire here in new Mexico. I have always been a star gazer , and I do believe in alien life out there. There was a large very colorful  looking star over that area, but it was high in the sky. While watching it, it moved quit quickly about an 1--to the right and stopped . I watched it for about 45 min. hoping it would move again, I did not want to take my eyes off of it in fear it would disappear. Ran inside to get my camera, a sony 5 meg. It was still there, so I steadied my camera on car, set the camera on the moon setting, and held my breath and shot, I have my own digital photo set up so I came in to see what I might have. I did have a very bright star. I enlarged it, and cropped twice, and got a very odd looking and very colorful v shaped something. There are very separate colors, blues, silver, yellow, green, and violet ball looking thing. It is not very clear, but it was enlarged, and against a black night sky. I’m not really sure what to do, somebody should see it who knows photography , this is really a strange shape, like holding up the peace sign with your fingers and bending them in a little, not a solid v shape, you can see the sky between your fingers, best I could for what it looks like. I have been in photography since the navy in 1966.

The object first appeared as a faint star-like object over our condo&#39;s clubhouse in the east. It was very high altitude as I had jet aircraft as well as the moon in the sky at the same time to use as a guage as to its height. I estimate the object to have been at ten to fifteen miles high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to strain to keep the object in my field of vision as I was in the swimming pool and I normally wear glasses. I observed the object approxmately fifteen minutes and during this time of observation the ufo moved only very perceptbly about a 45 degree trijectory from due east, from where it appeared,to south southwest when I was no longer to perceive it with the naked eye at about 18:50 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had originally thought it could be a satelite of some sort but it didn&#39;t have a satelite or a weather balloons flight charcteristics at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer served in the U.S.Navy and the U.S.Coast Guard as a radarman and have had much experience observing all types of aircraft as well as weather balloons it was not either. I feel it was a fairly large contact to have stayed visable for the length of time it did at that height. Two other people nearby asked what I saw But did not come to see what I was looking at. IN my opinion it was a definite unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be quite credible, and quite sincere.

When almost immediately, I noticed an object that looked, to my first thought, like Saturn and it&#39;s rings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly dismissed this as A: the object appeared to be the size of the moon in the morning&#39;s sky, and it was far too low and to the north of us (appeared to be over an area following the Fraser River, or the mountains in behind Mission, BC, well to the north of us).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stopped at the intersection for a left turn, I watched the object closely as it slowly moved through the sky (moving west to east).  Noticing for the first time a single flashing light on the upper ceiling of the object (similar to those found on aircraft).  Other than this one flashing light on top, it was illuminated only by the rising sun (which was still blocked by mountains for us at ground level).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Drving along the main road through the city westbound, I kept watch between buildings for it.  My Fiance, who I&#39;d pointed the object out to while stopped at the intersection, and I saw it continue slowly eastward.  The Second time that I got a good look at it, it had lost it&#39;s saturn effect, my guess is that it had been banking towards us at the time, and you could see the ring edge on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted the object a third time while driving, but we had driven far enough westward, and it moving eastward that the sunlight effect was&#39;t occuring anymore because of the object&#39;s position between the sun and ourselves.  It looked more like a dark blob in the dawn sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Belatedly, about a minute later, I recalled that my fiance had a camera phone and that I&#39;d been too busy watching the object to even think that we could have taken a picture.  I&#39;ve seen enough planes &amp; jets &amp; blimps in the many years I&#39;ve lived in the city here, and I&#39;ve never seen anything remotely like it. It was too slow to be an airliner, nor was it the correct shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the annual airshow at the city&#39;s airport, I&#39;ve seen everything from the Avro Vulcan to the Stealth Bomber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also rules out being some kind of blimp, as I&#39;ve seen plenty of those every time the goodyear blimp has made flybys of the airshow.  We&#39;ve also had our fair share of hot air balloons (Remax typically is the one flying around) but they&#39;re easy to spot because of the flame providing heat for lift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was, hence I guess, the reason why they call them unidentified flying objects. But the usual suspects can pretty much be ruled out.  Short of it being some funky blimp or hot air balloon, which I&#39;ve seen both and neither of which appears or behaves like this object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I know I&#39;ll be keeping my eyes to the skies more frequently now.<n>

The aircraft were travelling west.  The size was about the size of the stars in the constellations which indicated high altitude.  The distance covered during the period of time they were in my view indicated a very high speed.  The 3 red aircraft were traveling parallel ahead of the 2 white aircraft.  The 2 white aircraft would move ahead of each other and diagonally across the width of the 3 red aircraft.  1 of the 3 red aircraft stopped for approx 5 seconds and the white aircraft increased their speed and caught up to the 2 red aircraft.  The 1 red aircraft then quickly travelled towards the 4 aircraft in a zig zag sort of pattern and passed the 4 aircraft.  Just as the 1 red aircraft was passing the 4, all 5 aircraft continued travelling forward but but criss-crossing each other and exchanging the lead position.  The aircraft continued this flight pattern until they were out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

During the day they appear on film and we have them recorded, yet to the plain ordinary eye they are not visible. When my wife and I first seen them we were filming our 6 year old son flying his kite when we first noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same evening when this first occurred we had an experience that is still ongoing. At first we assumed that a child had a laser pointer, we seen a red laser enter into our master bedroom and literally bounced off our walls, our 6 year old son yelled at the same time and had the same red beam of light in his bedroom and that evening needless to say he slept with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We cannot explain this without coming across as insane, yet we are getting no help in regards to whom we have currently contacted. We now see these red beams during the day in our home and after trying to record them on film they disappear. Our son is petrified due to he stated that these red beams were talking to him and after we asked him what he meant he stated they were spelling out words as well as language to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will not go into any detail as to what these beams have spelled out, we are in fear that it will get worse if even possible at this point in time. They claim to not be from Earth, furthermore they claim to do us harm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are at a dead end and ready to move and we are searching for anyone else in or around the Omaha area who has witnessed anything similar. These beams have been everywhere in our home and the troubling thing is what they spell out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, in closing,  we only hope someone here might have had any similar problems with these types of beams and what have you done to stop them? We are one step away from moving. The language they have expressed through writing for a better word has been anything but friendly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When these beams enter our home our 6 year old son knows right away, directly above our home we hear a very loud humming, almost a whirling sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it got higher ,the dimmer it got and then disapeared.It was just a round bright light.Then, on May the 3rd,It happened again.Approximatley the same time and place in the sky.This time it was shaped different. More kike a triangle With bright lights at each point.Lasted for less than 1 minute,and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was very large; I would guess it to be about the size of a very large jumbo jet.  It was shaped like an isosceles triangle, with steady blue-white lights positioned at each of the points. The object seemed to be black in color and not extremely thick for its size, I would guess it to have been about 6-8 meters in thickness.  The most unusual characteristic of the object was a marked lack of engine noise.  I stopped the car, and got out to watch the object. I observed the object for about four minuets at about half a football field’s distance during which time the object slowly moved North East at seemingly moderate and steady pace, still without any real engine noise except a slight whirring noise.  I then returned to my car and went home unshaken by the experience but contemplating the unusualness of what I had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as my background goes, I am a thirty year old male who works retail. I also have a teaching degree in history education from a four year university and work as a substitute teacher in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared to be in  the trees very low to the ground.  We then turned the car around to go back and see what it was but it was literally moving away quickly and the lights turned off.  It seemed as if it was disappearing before our eyes.  We kept driving back and forth trying to spot it but there was no sight of it and it seemed to disappear into the sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So my dad gave me the camera and they left to go to sleep. I was filming the lighting for about 5 minutes and i got bored so i was looking in another direction off and on. When we got home we were watching watching our home video and we saw lighting off in the distance as expected and we saw some stars too. Then came this large light came down over the ocean in the distance. It came down and to the right, stopped hovered and did a little zig and then went back up and to the right out of the screen. That night we were camping i thought i recalled seeing a shooting star that now that i think about it, i probly saw it but shrugged it off as a shooting star. Anyways we have it on tape and showed it to a few people. Theres no way it was a helicopter or a plane because they cant move in the ways that the light did. I then went down to sleep on the beach and was wathcing but i didnt see anymore ufos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the video is at home and on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

(note: it was a perfectly clear and sunny day and i was thinking to myself, i wonder if anyone else is seeing what i am seeing!) as it moved across the sky it seemed to pull way out of shape into long scraggly lines and then come back into shape again.  i had my cell phone with me and i called my oldest daughter to tell her what i was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> she was really blown away by what i was telling her,i stayed on the phone with her for a few short minutes until i could no longer see the object any more.( now i had sunglasses on and it made it very clear and easier to see this phenomenon i would raise up my glasess a couple of times and you couldn&#39;t see it as well so that made me think that this was the reason no one else would really notice it, because there was not alot of traffic on the road at the time). but as i got closer to my destination with my daughter still on the phone with me i saw a round almost invisible circle of lights above the tree tops that would go off and on a couple of times, then i no longer could see the object.  (note when the object was moving and forming those very long scraggly lines and then going back into shape i saw an aircraft coming upward through the object and when it did the object scattered and then came back into shape. i also noticed that there were quite a bit of aircraft in the area of my destination at the time.  i took notes of everything i saw that day and drew a description of it as well, i also told my husband and my son all about it as soon as i got back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I went out back to dump out gray water about midnight. When I looked back up at the night sky --mostly clear -- I saw two, light-flashing rectangles opposite of each other -- and flashing alternately. It was so strange I just stared asking myself what it could be as far as a logical explanation. It was close, the object -- maybe 200 feet off the ground. Total absolute silence. It hung there, those two rectangular lights just flashing. I said hi, so to speak. It began to move, fairly slow -- I think from the sky that was blocked and the way the lights were positioned, it was a curved triangular shape. What was really eerie was the silence -- also the way it moved, gliding -- nothing, absolutely nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. And it was close -- either extraterrestrial, black ops or innerterestrial -- or something not explained. If whoever, whatever it was, I&#39;d kind of like it to return. It&#39;s really scary, but I&#39;m also very curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I saw seemed to be 3 lights in a wide triangle form going off in what seemed to be a pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds, the lights darted what had to be miles across the sky at unknown speed.
