7/31/05 23:03|Seattle|WA|Other|8 minutes|Object seen shot downward from small aircraft in Seattle area, followed by flash and huge discharge cloud.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45381.html|1|ndxe200507| Object seen shot downward from small aircraft in Seattle area, followed by flash and huge discharge cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night at, Sunday, July 31, 2005, at 11:03 pm ( PST ) my friend ((name deleted)) and myself, were at Magnusun Park on the east shore line of Seattle ( west shore of Lake Washington ).  It was a nice night, mild clouds, lots of air traffic up here.. commercial flights, small craft....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was seeing a number of the typical very brief shooting stars.  A friend of mine had called me on my cell phone, and I was talking with him... at this time, all of a sudden, my friend Kyle yells out excitedly.. &#34;did you see that &#34; ?  I can&#39;t remember exactly what he said following that, but I remember assuming that he had just seen a shooting star...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turns out that ((name deleted)) adamantly states that he was sure he had seen something shoot downward from one of two small planes that were in close proximity of each other, flying in opposite directions. I saw the planes a couple seconds after he saw this discharged object.  My best guess is that these planes were possibly flying 3 to 7 miles directly due west of where we were, which is very close in line with N.E. 75th St.  I Couldn&#39;t really estimate the altitude.. average for small craft I suppose. I learned from Kyle that this object he states was shot downward from the plane, was unmistakenly glowing red/orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 15 seconds, in that direction, there was a huge bright white flash, which seem to be more from the ground, than in the sky. It lit up the sky to a higher degree than lightning often would... just as a instant flash.  I thought the flash was quite strange, but was not yet alarmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within another 15 seconds (and this is where it gets scary for me ) I saw a huge ominous dark cloud coming upward from the horizon.  ((name deleted)) unmistakenly saw this too !!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am quite concerned about this ! I am sure many people must have atleast seen the strange and huge flash of light... We were in a unique place ( large unlit park ) to see the cloud ( which was slightly, but unmistakenly a darker shade than the sky surrounding it ) We heard no sounds, not even the engines of the planes in question. No sirens followed !<n>

It seemed to have mostly a heart shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting, there seemed to be a red glow in a certain area of the sky that almost appeared to follow us, because there was always a large red patch of clouds that changed places when I looked out the van window that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe this is the second sighting of my life, because about seven years ago I saw what almost looked like a &#34;shooting star&#34;, only much bigger and closer, and also moving way too slow.   It appeared to crash into the ground somewhere within a few miles, but I didn&#39;t hear a crash, perhaps because it was too far away.<n>

He called me and I went outside to find an oval disk shape with one bright light on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I watched it as it moved up in the sky and the down in the trees.  After a few minutes the one bright light then became two lights with what looked like a beam of light coming from each bright light down towards the ground.  We watched this for several minutes as it moved up and down in the sky and then when it was up in the sky it stopped moving and then just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One hour later my son and one of his friends went down to the next town over and they saw the same bright light oval shaped thing and they watched it for a few minutes but this time there was one bright white light and then they saw red lights like lasers coming from the top and bottom of the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son had a camera with him and tried to take a picture, but he doesnt know if he got it or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> i have more info on the sighting that we saw, we found out that 2 more people had seen the lights that we saw and they were in the west.  I also called the state police and local 911 center and they didnt recieve any reports on it. i have emailed the local newspaper with the info, and i havent received anything back yet.  the pictures that i took of the six lights over my house came out good. we went last night and watch for 3 hours and saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus in the western sky.

The lighs didn&#39;t apear to have moved. There were 3 bright spots, one above the other and the third to the right, all fairly close to each other.  With the binoculars it was plain to see that each light was infact several lights which formed a domed shape with a flat bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple minutes one of the forms dimmed and disappeared then so did the other two.  In another couple of minutes all 3 appeared again in the same place as before.  Then after a short time they all faded and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this ws happening I could see the car headlights coming over the pass and the &#34;UFOs&#34; were much brighter and bigger than any of the car lights.  I gotta tell you that they scared the hell outta me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh the lights were white, no colors or flashing seen.<n>

It was steady than it would flicker bright than normally. Than again bright than normally.  And than it just disappeared.  It was moving horizontally not diagonally like a shooting star.

He came in and asked his older brother (my 20 year old son) if he wanted to see a UFO.  I laughed, said I do and went out on the deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 20 year old followed.  The weather was slightly overcast but visibility was good.  We watched this slow moving dark object for a few minutes.  No one said anything as we studied it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally I said what the heck is that?  It was at the hight of an air plane, moving in an unusual floating maner.  It was too large to be a helicopter, parashoot or hot air baloon.  At first I thought it was a large blimp.  However I have never seen a blimp that large or at that high Alititude.  It appeared to turn and flip over.   As it turned the shape changed to the shape of a donut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The boys said it is a saucer.  I said it looks like it has a whole in the middle.  One boy said perhaps the middle is white. We all watched it until it moved out of site.  None of us could figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local airport this morning to ask if they new anything about it.  hey didn&#39;t.<n>

The supervisor spotted it as well. It was a craft of some kind. It was translucent white in color surrounded by a misty teardrop shaped aura.  It looked similar to a plane with swept back wings but neither of us felt is was a plane.  It was going north to south at a very high altitude.  It was so high it was barely visible; it seemed to blend into the blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A passenger jet was also traveling in the same direction at a lower altitude; the normal cruising altitude for commercial jets in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white craft overtook the jet like it was standing still.  It streaked to the south and then switched direction and shot straight up and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the sky as the jetliner disappeared from our view.  A minute or so later, we then spotted another craft flying along the same trajectory as the first UFO.  It streaked across the sky and then shot straight up and disappeared in exactly the same manner as the first one did. The sky was clear at the time, except for some contrails overhead. The craft were very hard to detect: they were very well camouflaged. If we hadn&#39;t been looking up already we never would have seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both the supervisor and the operator had seen a UFO previously; one in 1989 and the other in the 70&#39;s.  We didn&#39;t report the sighting to any civil authority.<n>

Clear blue skies with no visible clouds was the background to the object we became curious about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too far up or away to make out a shape but, I went to get her binoculars &amp; through them was able to distinguish it as Silver object with a bright Turf Green &amp; red-orange light.  It&#39;s location was North-East of the home &amp; we looked up at it at an approximate 45-50* angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was a hot air balloon but thought it was odd for it to be so high.  It seemed to just hover at the same altitude &amp; location for 8-10 minutes from when we spotted it then it began to get smaller or further away for a couple minutes becoming harder to find when we looked away but, still visible without the binoculars.  A small jet passed flying Northwest almost intersecting our view of the object &amp; then shortly after that a commercial jet flying higher &amp; a similar direction passed both giving us the impression that the object was both further away &amp; at a higher altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 12-13 minutes into the sighting the object streaked out of my sight (One thousand Two) &amp; it was gone. T his really startled me since I had resolved myself to this object being a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its direction of exit was downward to my right at approximately 15-20 degrees which might have been South to South Easterly.  We watched the two Jets fly by earlier from a closer distance &amp; they were slow compared to the speed at which this object Zoomed out of sight. I then called 911.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Smaller than  a 747 plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up at about 7.00am on saturday morning and as was laying in my bed I looked out my window I saw small glowing white ball slowly moving from a northerly to southerly direction in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its strange because I live close to the airport and the object i saw wasn&#39;t following the same flight path as the other planes and no planes followed that path after I saw it because I waited 30 mins after too see if any other planes followed that flight path an none did, they were coming in the opposite direction south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I usually hear the planes as they take off and land,and they are easy to identify because they are noisy and low to the ground....but this thing made no noise,and was much too high in the air to have just taken off from Sydney Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And it was a really intense white light,which made me take notice of it. Also the sun was already up and all the planes that were landing weren&#39;t using their navigation lights as it was daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I saw it pass behind our tree at the front of our house it just disappeared. And it couldn&#39;t have been a plane coming directly at me as it moved horizontally across the sky continuosly glowing (no blinking of lights like an airplane - just an intense glowing white light), and I would have seen the tail and the shape of the plane as well.<n>

I can spot them almost any night I want.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a faint white light, almost undiscernable.

Then saw a definite blue light w/no other colors flying from the northwest to the north.  Within an instant the object turned directly toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft&#39;s blue light was pointed directly in my position, because the degree of light intensity was almost blinding in the binoc&#39;s.  It all happened in 3 to 4 sec&#39;s and it scared me so bad cause it was so close and not a normal phenomenom, that my fear caused me to throw down my binoc&#39;s and i ran inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live w/in 15 miles of an international airport.  The craft was not a plane.  It zipped away in the beat of a heart.<n>

It was moving at an incredible speed, I’d say around 1,500-2,000mph (literally).  The object appeared to be going in circles and blinking its lights rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was literally shocked from what I saw. I said to my friend &#34;I gotta go bye&#34; and hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into my parents room, woke them up and had my mom run out to see it; by the time we both got out there, it was gone.  She went right back to bed, and about five minutes later I saw another one (possibly the same one coming from a different direction).  I didn’t know what to think this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside again, except this time to get my camera. When I came back out with it, it was gone. So... I was hanging out in my backyard after that trying to spot another one (I had my camera at that time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted another for the third time!  I saw this one about 1:45a.m. It looked just the same. I got a picture of it this time. The picture is kind of hard to see, but if you zoom in, it’s a little easier to see. It didn’t look like the typical circular UFO shape, it looks to me like it’s more rectangular or &#34;platform-shaped.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the news came to interview me;  It was shown on the news that day (August 1st, 2005).

At 12:00 midnight, while we were still talking about what we saw, we witnessed about 8- 12 light coming from the east heading west in the same direction the first ship went.  Each lights was shaped almost like a boomarang with a small &#34;tail&#34;,  f you will, at the back end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were weaving and bobbing around and under one another so it was hard to get an accurate count but I know there were at least 8 probably 10 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them till they disappeared( about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We live in the country surrounded by woods and farm fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Northwest sky we the youngest of us noticed a bright light in the sky.  We all turned and watched as the light became brighter and turned orange then went blue and streaked across the sky to the West.  It left a blue line behind it.  It looked like a comet&#39;s tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it later appeared coming from the west going to the north leaving that same blue line as it went across the sky.  We saw it again coming from the north going south.  Almost as if it were circling around us.  It covered a large area in very little time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was never any sound to it. And when it appeared it was only seen for maybe 2 minutes then it moved and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about an hour, then it disappeared to the West.<n>

Sky was dark and clear, dont remember much of a moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:29pm eastern my attention was drawn to a streak of light in the sky.  It was very white, bright and fast, low to the horizon but above the tree line, descending almost perpendicular to the ground (perhaps a slight North/South tilt).  It seemed very wide for a meteor flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The streak terminated barely above the treeline, but exhibited some unusual behavior.  In the last second it changed from a whitish light to a deep emerald green hue, utterly lovely, and then exploded in a shower of golden sparks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked for all the world like a lance of light that struck something in the sky which then exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent as far as I can tell, there was no boom after the streak terminated.<n>

I made this decision as there was a level of movement on the light both up and down and side to side but only slightly so we thought it may have been heading straight at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed another object close by but appeared to be at a different altitude and was not nearly as bright, this I assumed was another plane following in. I was happy with my guess until the first object literally dropped from the sky behind an apartment building blocking the rest of the view, the secondary object seem to get dimmer and completely disappear,<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first reactions from residents has been probably children with fireworks but this was no firework, It was over the mountains not actually in Loveland I don&#39;t think kids will trek into the mountains to have fun with rockets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The sky was relatively clear, some clouds in the distance, but not where we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at the sky, and all of a sudden in the center of it, I could see a yellow round light, about the size if you put your index finger together with your thumb, sort of like a &#34;okay&#34; sign, that was the size of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t going down it was going west to east.  It was followed by a fire trail.  This did not appear to be a shooting star because it was much bigger.  It was even bigger than planes that you&#39;d see at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this was happening, I exclaimed to my friends (&#34;aw, look at that&#34;), my one friend saw it but by the time my other friend got up, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes later, my friend that saw it with me, saw it again, this time going south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that if you were to take a yard stick and put it up to the sky, that is about the distance that it traveled.<n>

There must be more witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside of a building and something in the sky caught my attention.  I looked up in time to see a fireball overhead which I thought to be an unusually close comet because the fire was red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving slowly so it couldn&#39;t have been a comet.  In fact when my brain adjusted on it, I realized it couldn&#39;t have been more than 3 - 5 hundred feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking closer I noticed two circular glowing red holes like jet engines at the back of a dark un quantifyable craft from where this huge fireball was protruding the fireball must have been 50 ft. long once compared to the size and altitude of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Than the fireball completely vanished leaving the two glowing engines and then they vanished and so did the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose it could have been a jet fighter but let me ask a question to people living in Toronto.  How many jet fighters have you seen speeding over Toronto&#39;s downtown sector with their afterburners on?   I bet you it&#39;s never happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also there was no sound at all. not even a delayed rumble that you would expect of something like that.<n>

What was unusual (at least in my experience) was that it &#34;sparkled&#34; - I have been referring to it as a &#34;fast sparkler&#34;. It sparkled in a regular pattern, it seemed to me, in maybe three levels of intensity, over the space of a second or a bit less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My personal explanation is that is is a pulse-jet driven craft (Aurora?) but who knows?  Maybe it was a conventional military craft at Mach+ speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe it was a meteor as it did not appear to change it&#39;s flight characteristics in any way (altitude, sparkle rhythm, brightness) and it appeared to be travelling precisely west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it cross at least 80% of an almost horizon-to-horizon vista over a span of maybe as much as 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it wasn&#39;t for the speakle, I would have assumed it to be a satellite and not given it any more thought.<n>

As I watched, the light began to oscilate or twinkle, then quickly grew smaller, until it could not be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was somewhat stunned, but it appeared that whatever it was moved directly away from me at amazing speed. The object was white as a planet or star, and as large as venus when it is low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a male, 47, professional, and enjoy watching the nightime sky.  I have seen many things in the sky, with most easily being explained as meteortites, satalights, planes, or other conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was unique, and quite puzzling due to the objects speed of travel.  Seeing that it was dusk, the suns rays could have still been refracting into the sky, but the light source was not consistent with a reflection.  There were other stars visible in the sky during and after the event, and several seconds after it disappeared two high flying aircraft moved into the area, but left.<n>

Object over Phoenix July 29th<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was having smoke break outside of my work and noticed a star like object in the sky on a bright cloudless day. It was almost directly over head and moving on a heading of 180.  It appeared to be very high ( 20,000 feet or more) and left no contrail.  Moving very slow and took about 5 minutes to move about 20 feet across the sky. It then stopped and held its postion for another 5 minutes or more. I had just bought a pair of polarized sunglasses and could only see the object cleary with them on. When I removed the glasses the sky was extreamly bright and it mad it almost impossible to see the object. The object appeared to sway back and forth slightly so I steadied my head against a wall to make sure I wasnt the one doing the swaying. And it was swaying or appearing to sway from the heat rising or atmospheric conditions. It then moved on a heading of 270 slowly and I watched it for a bit longer then was forced to go back to work. I have been searching the net looking for other reports of it. But due to its  unimpressive movements and subdued lighting maybe I am 1 in 3 million but I doubt it. My Friend also saw it but then shrugged his shoulders and went back into work.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were round but the sky wasn&#39;t clear so the lights were slightly diffuse.  They converged to a single point and then diverged out to 4 endpoints creating a square if you were to connect them. The paths travelled by each light from the converged point out to the endpoints were not perfectly straight, but the complete motion was very symmetrical.  The convergence and divergence of the lights repeated many times.  Finally, the lights converged to a single point, which remained for 15 - 20 seconds, and then the light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably advertising lights.  PD))<n>

They were in a triangle formation.  Curious, I went to get my glasses.  When I got back to the window one of the &#34;stars&#34; started to move towards me, and another went up towards the moon.  The third one stayed in a hovering posistion.  The one closest to me took on an oval shape and was bright orange.  As it got closer, I could see red lights around its perimeter.  This one was traveling across the skyline and soon out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am a 16 year old male.  I was working in Pinnacles national monument.  One night, my fellow crew mates and I decided to go on a park sponsored star hike. we hiked one mile to an outlook high above the base canyon.  when we got there, we observed stars and various formations.  THe ranger leading the tour had a high powered laser pointer of sorts which was capable of projecting and extremely bright, concetrated beam of light that he used to point out stars.  The presentation passed without incident.  The encounter happened on our hike back down.  A we descended, i was looking at stars when i noticed a strange formation of what looked like 3 sattelites.  However upon further examination, i realized that the lights we set in a perfect triangle formation. The 3 lights that i saw were much too far spaced out to be an airplane.  Further more, the  was no true body connecting the dots.  You could see straight through whatever was connecting the lights.  Finally i said &#34;Hey, what&#39;s that thing?&#34;.  The group looked up.  THe ranger replied, &#34;i have no idea.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like that.&#34;  My leader suggested that the ranger use his star pointer to try and signal the object.  The ranger pulled out his pointer and shot three short burst of light at the object.  Upon being signalled, the object banked sharply down and within that second, dissappeared into thin air.  It was the strangest thing i&#39;d ever seen. contact me by email only and i can give you other witnesses to the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I first thought maybe they were military helicopters but they didnt make any noise they would dart around strangely  and then after watching them for about 2-3 minutes there was a white flash  ball shape that came over the tree tops and then left straight up and north, then the red flashing light objects dispersed in a crazy criss cross  pattern and then  appeared to chase after white ball of light .then they were gone in a second,  So I dont know what I saw, but it was not like anything i&#39;ve seen before. Is the military testing new aircraft?  it was too fast and quiet.   Would like to know if anyone else noticed the lights.  I told my husband and my son. but the objects never came back we watched the sky for about 20minutes then went to bed..<n>

Unfortunately, it turned out to be a flaming bag of some sort attatched to a large balloon, probably released by someone in this neighborhood.  I had seen a similar one a few weeks ago.  I felt bad about bursting his balloon (of excitement), pardon the pun, but I recognized it right away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re still, however, on the lookout to see a real one.<n>

He said the white lights were as bright as &#34;stadium lights&#34; and the objects looked like a huge &#34;two by four&#34; with lights in the center and on each end. The lights were so bright they could not see the shape of the vehicle. One of the objects was stationary farther back and the closer one was moving across the highway and came to a stop above their car.  They did not hear any sound and they became very nervous and accelerated away from the objects and continued to observe them out the rear windsheild of the car.  They also noticed the other object starting to move and went parallel with the other object.  About a minute later they saw a police cruiser with it&#39;s flashing lights on heading north at a high rate of speed towards the UFO.  There were three cars behind the observers car also heading south but no cars heading north during the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My oldest daughter and I were arguing back and forth. When she gets madd she likes to turn away and stare out the window. It was at this time we saw these lights flip on in the sky they were bright but they really didn&#39;t shine down on the ground, they were a very bright orangish yellow color. I asked her and my youngest daughter that was sitting in the back if they see what I see, they both screamed yes and asked if it was an UFO. I told them that I was not sure but it had 3 light in a row then 3 more in row underneath it just hovered up over Skutter Hill, Then just like flipping off a light switch the lights went off. I really could not tell if it was still there since I was trying to look and keep the car on the road. We continued on south down highway 67. I told the girls to keep looking out there window and I would watch out mine. We did not see anything until we got through the town of Edwardsport on the south side of town about a little over a mile from where we saw the first lights the lights appeared again on the right hand side of the road this time they were a little different. There seemed to be one in one row and the 3 in a row underneath. It again just hovered there for about 10 sec then like turning off the light switch it was gone. We kept our eyes to the sky for the rest of the trip home but we never seen anything again. My husband is on the fire department so when I got home I asked him if he had heard of anyone reporting that they had seen lights in the sky. He said that he had not heard anything over the radio. He thinks the girls and I are nuts but we know that we seen something, something that can not be easily explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He was lucky to get a pic of it because he was taking random pics in a sort of panoramic view and when he was done, he started looking at them through the lcd display and thats when he noticed it. He looked all around but could not see the object any more. I am submitting the photos.I took a look at it and it is very strange.When I zoomed in and cropped the picture, and it seemd you can see some sort of faces in it.

It began to rain very very hard and it was a bit dark as is typical with a hard thunderstorm.  As I drove past the county line, I notice something strange perhaps 500 feet or so in front of me and covering the road and also to the left side into the grass.  It was raining hard, yet I noticed an oblong spot, about 20ft at the widest and 50ft long that seemed darker to include the grass side on the right.  It visibly was wet, yet I could clearly see it was not raining in this area.  Further, as I drove into this area, it stopped raining as if I had driven under a bridge during a rain storm and the rain resumed as soon as I exited this small area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The impression I got was of something hovering in this area.  There are no bridges etc in this strip of freeway north of Kingsville.  I looked in the area above the &#34;non raining&#34; area and saw nothing, but storm clouds.  I did not hear anything at all as I passed into this small are, only the end of rain and then the begining of rain as is typical of driving under a bridge during a rainstorm.   I am convinced something was hovering over this spot on the freeway.... just have no idea what it was as it was not visible to my eye, yet could see above and saw nothing unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then spotted a white disk crossing the path of the jet contrail after the jet had passed the object. The white disc was in the southern sky moving to the north. It was moving slowly so I went just inside the house and got two binoculars so we could observe this object. The sky was mostly clear with only a few white clouds. The object could be seen very easily since it was reflecting sunlight. It was very high in the sky but looked like a white disk through the binoculars. We could see the shape of the wings on the jet but not on the disk. It moved slowly north to almost directly over us and then stopped and remained stationary for about five minutes as we observed it. It then looked to be getting smaller like it was climbing straight up and eventually vanished from our view<n>

At first, I thought they were planes.  After watching these objects in the sky I discovered they were not regular planes with lights on.  Under these objects were bright almost strobe light effects of yellow, blue, green and red constantly flashing in a strobe like fashion.  Particles of Gold sprinkles were being dispersed from these flying objects almost as if they were spraying different areas of the neighborhood.  In the morning, I called the non-emergency police # for Mt. Prospect and asked if any other calls had come into the station regarding my sighting.  The dispatcher said he was not aware of any other calls.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was difficult to determine the distance but I would guess a couple of KM at least. Almost as soon as I noticed this object it starting to become dimmer, but I then realized it was travelling away from me but at a very fast pace. It then begain to travel even faster and in a upward position.

So I attempted to follow it got out of the car and listened it had no sound. So we drove to a place you can see pretty much all the planes etc for miles It was gone with out a trace. It flew very steady and had 4 lights all together they were like amber one in the middle and three on the points of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Distance between lights was about 25 feet.  There were no strobe or green/red lights normally seen on air craft.  Object crossed I5 heading east at about 100 feet in a steep descent to an open field.  The object then turned back to the west and crossed in front of my vehicle at about fifty feet and descended into and open field on the west side of the freeway.  I was traveling north on I5 and I turned my head to look back at the object in the field to the west and it appeared to be hovering at about 20 feet off the ground and the lights were bright enough to illuminant brush on the ground.  Object traveled at about 60 miles per hour as it flew over the freeway and maneuvered in a manner which can only be discribed as extremely nimble.  I was close enough to the object to see structure between the lights although I could not make out its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we were at the end of his drive way, i noticed a strange light in the sky, to the west. It was wooded around his house with a few clearings. The light went behind some trees. Then it came out looped around and shot straight up in the air and dissapeared. After that we couldnt see it and we were looking for it. Then faceing south i noticed a small light moving directly upward very slowly. It was moving way to fast to be a star and too slow to be a plane. Also the craft made no sound. So when it got approximelty to our Zenith it shot left and turned into an oval shape. Then it went east and disssapeared. During the time we saw this, The wind stoped. We couldnt here any traffic ( and we were near a busy intersection traffic wise.) And most of all, Time seemed to stop. So we ran inside and got my friends mother. We waited aproxximetly 20 minutes before we came outside. When we did we looked around for about 5 minutes and saw notting, Until behind the trees, in one of the clearings a huge Oval light that almost looked like a fire ball apeared.IT was white, it was about the size of the moon. THen it seemed to have Exploded. Then the light got smaller. After that it went behind the trees to the north. Then we never saw it again. The whole time there was no sound. Everything seemed to stop. The airconditoner stoped working. and the phones did too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn&#39;t above the trees or right below the clouds, it was about halfway.  It had been a full moon about a week before, and a quarter moon the day after I saw the craft, so it was pretty bright out.  It was also clear, no clouds in the sky at all.  After I heard the noise I ran outside as fast as I could to see what it was.  I about ran over my dad, so he wondered what was going on and came after me.  He was in the Navy for about 20 years, and said it sounded just like a helicopter, but it sure didn&#39;t look like one.  The craft seemed really big, bigger than a helicopter would be on the ground..maybe about the size of a rectangle-shaped airplane.  There was a big white light in the front middle of the craft, and a big red light on the back left corner, and a big green light on the back right corner.  None of these lights were flashing or doing anything, but they were really big and seemed too far apart and too big, even if it was a helicopter.  Like stated in my last UFO post, I&#39;m an avid believer of UFOs, but I&#39;m 100% open to explanation.  My town has a population of around 25-30k, and the only airport we have is municipal so airplanes aren&#39;t widely seen around here.  The craft was flying south, and was out of my sight fairly quickly.  Like I stated before, it was quite large, and it was like a silhouette..the corners and shape were very distinct.  I drew up a recreation of what I saw using MS Paint: http://ballz.ababa.net/exetergirl/ufo2.txt<n>

Out first thought was that we were seeing Mars, although  it appeared to be too bright to be Mars.  The object then appeared to be moving closer from a westerly direction.  As it slowly approached it changed directions to a northeasterly direction.  It had one very bright central light and two red blinking lights.  The object then moved almost directly overhead at an altitude of roughly 1000 feet.  This particular night was perfectly clear with no wind at all.  As it approached we waited for some type of engine noise, but as went overhead it was absolutely silent.  It then proceded to the east and out of our sight.  The three lights on the object outlined a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There were two lights in the sky.  The sun had set only a half hour before they were noticed.  The setting was river beach with tall trees and many foothills cresting about the horizon. As mentioned before there existed two lights, one nearer to us than the other I&#39;ll refer to that as 1.  The second craft seemed to be tailing by what would have been about a hundred miles if these had been planes and I&#39;ll call it 2.  At first these two lights were seemingly airplanes as far as the pace and motion go, but at second glance the behavior became more peculiar.  When I first looked up there seemed to be a gaping distance between the two blinking lights-  it should be noted that the lights were red in color.  Without a moments comprehension, the tailing light blinked off and reappeared right next to 1.  Then 2 blinked off again only to reappear where it was before.  Then 1 zipped back and forth for only a moment, blinking off and reappearing in a different spot.  2 zipped across the sky to meet up with 1 once more.  2 disappeared and 1 did also a second later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/27/05 21:00|Norfolk|VA|Sphere|10 min|Norfolk UFO watches a storm?|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45314.html|66|ndxe200507| Norfolk UFO watches a storm?<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO witness report Wednesday, July 27th 2005 Norfolk, Virginia  USA 9:00 PM	     Oh how I love storm watching.  The rumbling thunder and spectacular lightshows, to the pouring rain and endless candlelit games of charades during power outages.  On the evening of July 27th, 2005 at approximately 9:00pm, my girlfriend and I witnessed an object flying that was, and remains, unidentified.  Was its purpose to view the storm, or for the storm to help view it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The anticipation of an ending record breaking “heat wave” had been felt all day. Finally these 100+ degree daytime highs were going to be crushed by a cold front, resulting in large, severe thunderstorms.  In fact, weather reports earlier in the day were claiming that the huge ban of thunderstorms (from Texas to New England)  were producing wind gusts up to 60mph, and large hail stones.  As soon as I heard the emergency broadcast alerts by means of television, I knew it was coming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few rumbles of thunder were heard, I decided to head outside to spectate. It was about 8:45pm and the sun was set, yet there was still a shimmer of light in western sky coming through the clouds of the oncoming storm.  I sat in my usual spot on the deck steps.  Our deck is roofed which provides excellent storm watching without getting wet.  My eyes were wondering back and forth between my 11mo old puppy playing in the yard and the inconsistent flashes of lightning reflecting off neighboring houses. As I looked to my right, I noticed a bright star in between two parallel power lines from my vantage point.  It flickered violently between white and amber colors, just as a star rapidly twinkles in the distance…the object didn’t appear to be moving at all and I thought to myself, maybe this is a planet because it seems much larger than even the largest, brightest star. So there I was trying to decipher the object and realized that whatever it was seemed to be under the veil of storm clouds.  There was no clear patch in the clouds to peek at the humbling vastness of space.  So as I watched this mysterious light in the sky, it became clear that it was moving.  I performed many visual tests with stationary objects (power lines) to make sure the object was moving.  This went on for about two minutes before I decided to ask my girlfriends opinion and grab my video camera. I began recording for a total of 6 minutes.  The glowing object ever so slowly hovers to my east and descends. There was approximately 4 more min of viewing before the object descends below the treeline and out of view. That are not in this footage.  As far as the objects actual size and distance I have no idea. At approximately 9:45 pm I decided to call the non-emergency line of one of the Norfolk police depts. I asked the officer (or whomever answered my call) if there had been any reports of unidentified flying objects in the area within the past hour or so.  He said not at that particular station, but inquired about my sighting.  I explained and his response was that a logical explanation was that there is always a high amount of helicopter traffic from local tv stations etc in the area.  I thanked the man for his time and hung up.  This object was NOT an airplane (although Norfolk International Airport is within about 7 miles from my location).  The object was definitely NOT a helicopter (my sister flies CH-46 helicopters for the navy and my father is a retired commander). There were no signs of any flashing beacons. The object was NOT a star or planet due to its movement and location under the clouds.  I am not 100% sure on the following topic of balls of light appearing in storms due to the electrically charged atmosphere so I cant rule it out.  More personal research will tell.  Here is a video capture in mpeg format from the original, non duplicated hi-8 sony video camera tape.  The transfer appears darker than the original tape, but I didn’t want to edit the picture quality in any way.  The only editing done is a layer of text with date time location and my name.  The most exhilarating image however appears when I took a still photo of the image during the illumination of a lightning flash. I challenge all of you to dissect this footage with my full cooperation to help in ANY WAY NECESSARY.   I was privileged to witness this event and hope this footage can provide some stepping stone closer to truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=31TEUO5W  sorry about the filesize.

I decided to continue to drive unil I reached an area where there was parking along Dallas road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here there was a much better view of this object that was continuing to fall from the sky.  I did notice 5 other men watching the same object I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to be on fire and falling through the sky very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon it was all over and the light vanished into the horizon, sinking into the ocean.

I cannot say if I simply saw an airplane or if it was something else.  The reason I find the &#34;sighting&#34; odd is because of my location.  I was not near an airport that could have handled a large plane.  This object was further away from the small airport than it should have been were it coming in for a safe landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove home around 8am Wednesday morning, I glanced towards the sky as I came over a slight hill and noticed a metal glint against a cloud in the sky.  It caught my eye because it was so clear.  I pulled over to watch it.  The object was definitely several miles away and would have been visible from the interstate.  It didn&#39;t move very fast.  There was no vapor trail.  It appeared to be oblong shaped and silver in color.  I watched until it passed behind a cloud.  At this same time I had my window rolled down and heard nothing.  I didn&#39;t expect to being so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I really can&#39;t say if it this was simply an airplane or something else.  It was odd enough for me to find it out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flashing slightly (in multiple colors) and against the dark sky I could clearly make out it was a disk shape. I could easily tell it wasn&#39;t an airplane but some form of U.F.O. It seemed to hover in a single position for a few minutes then it dropped and remained stationary on the ground, held up by some form of retractable legs, for about ten minutes. The legs then retracted and the space ship rose vertically and then disappered almost immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following the landing of the ship a red station wagon sped directly from the road I presumed the U.F.O. had landed. The car was being driven very carelessly, well over the speed limit. Whatever the driver had seen it had caused him a great alarm and he wanted to get away quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Soon after i noticed a light gaining size rapidly and it grew to be the biggest light in the sky atleat 3 times the size of a star and then it was the brightest shinning light in the sky for about 2 whole minutes.  Then short after everyone drew their attention to it.  It caught off as if someone had flipped a light switch and turnned all power off.  It wasnt the first time i have seen something supsicious like that in the sky.

I stood up and looked to the Southeast direction from where I was and noticed a star like light tracking across the sky. I watched the object get brighter and expand then it got smaller and dimmed moving in a horizontal direction. The town of Vernon is around a 10 minute drive in the direction the object was observed. The object moved steadily in a northwest track then vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 7:58PM according to my pictures, I saw something very bright due southwest of me and pretty high in the sky.  The sun was going down in the west, and I&#39;m not sure if the brightness of the object was a reflection from the sun or not.  I began taking pictures of the object and I believed at the time that it was heading directly northeast toward me.  It seemed to be moving slower than a passenger jet.  Rather than getting larger like it would have had it come closer to me it seemed to be getting smaller or dimmer, and then it disappeared altogether from my sight, but not before I got six pictures of it.  It was in view for approximately 30 seconds.  In retrospect I believe that rather than moving northeast toward me it was moving possibly straight up in altitude.  It made no sound that I could hear (even though the wind was up a bit I had no trouble hearing a couple of jets earlier).  From what I saw with my eyes it looked to be only a single object, but after reviewing the pictures there seems to be some sort of vapor emitted from the left side of the object.  My camera is a Fujifilm Finepix 2800 and it was zoomed in at 6X optically.  The six photographs will follow via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Every evening just about the same time I walk my dog. But this time I saw something that I never seen before and I still can&#39;t explain what it could of being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a very bright light reflecting all around me. I automatically looked up to see what it was. I didn&#39;t get to see how it started it. All I know is that it was nice and dark and out of no where everything got really bright.  It started flying from the left side to the right on a straight line. Never flew up or down, never changed direction. This didn&#39;t look at all like a falling star. This light was very close to me, I would say about 1 and half to two telephone poles tall. From this distance it looked to be the size of a basketball or a little bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I can describe it to is a ball of fire flying super fast. But, the light that it was emitting didn&#39;t look like fire at all. Picture a basketball on fire flying to one direction at a high speed, the flames thickly trailing behind. But instead of being fire it was all light. It got brighter and brighter as it picked up speed till it disappeared with no trails or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color in the center was so bright it looked almost white. The closer it got to the surface the more yellow it looked; the actual surface was a bright electric blue. The light was leaving a thick trail, as it got to the end it was small yellow sparks.  It flew about 150 to 200 feet, when it disappeared. This happened in about a minute with no sound what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a drawing to help you understand what I&#39;m talking about, hope it help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

It was a clear night and the stars were visible in the sky.  As we talked, she noticed a bright fluorescent light shining down to the front yard on the grass.  She said “what is that light?” I looked and followed the light up into the sky until I was looking almost straight up.  At that moment the light in the front yard that had been 150’ away, suddenly flashed all around us, when it did I saw the outline of a craft of some sort.  The light had been projected to the ground from this object.  It was no more than 200’ from the ground and made no noise what so ever.  As soon as I made out the shape of the object it went dark and disappeared from our sight.  I asked my wife to turn off the porch light so we could see better.  When the light was out there was no sign of the craft and we gazed at a clear night sky.  I went directly in the house and drew an illustration of what I had seen.  My wife never looked up so all she saw was the incredible bright fluorescent light all around us. She describes it as an enormous camera flash. Here is my drawing of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Maybe 100 feet above the tree tops in the back yard a deep black chevron shape was very slowly moving from W to ENE. Everything around was very still and quiet and the shape made no sound that I could here. It was a cool clear night and there were stars in the sky. As the shape moved (very slowly) it blocked the light from the stars that were directly behind it. I looked back and forth at the washing and then back at the shape several times thinking this was a odd experience more so because I remember thinking that I wasn&#39;t scared at all just curious. After about 3 minutes, it moved out of my view behind the trees. I note that we own a dog as do the neighbours behind and to either side of our house. They were barking in an agitated manner before the event and again after, it however seemed that there was no sound at all during its pass over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to be moving the exact way we were going on the Interstate-south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the circular object turned to the side and I noticed it was really cylnder/cigar like shaped.  I then told my fiance to look up but he was driving, and he decided to pull over, b/c I was really going off, I knew this wasn&#39;t a normal craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he was pulling over, my eyes stayed fixed on the object.  Then-it just disappered-right in front of eyes!!  It just faded away!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, we got back on the road, and a half a mile or so down the road, on the opposite side-there it was again!  That time my fiance could see it perfectly through the sun roof as he was driving.  It seemed to be going pretty fast-almost keeping up with us as we were driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, we BOTH seen it disappered/fade away again!  I say faded away b/c you could literally see it getting lighter and lighter, and then gone!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it had to be the same object as the first time, unless there was several out that day.  But, both times I only seen one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reading other experiences on here sounded just like a similar object we had seen so I had to post my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll never forget it!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/25/05 09:00|Woodland|CA|Disk|1-2 seconds|Here's what I THINK I saw:  a part(the leading edge) of an airborne, dinner plate shaped object, camoflaged|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45262.html|87|ndxe200507| Here&#39;s what I DID see: Weather was clear, no clouds, temp maybe 78. While driving south (about 75 mph) on I-505 at about 9 a.m, a few miles northwest of Woodland CA, near Cache Creek and near large power lines I saw, through my front windshield, a partial disk quickly appear about 1 mile ahead and maybe 500 feet off to the right of the road. Altitude (guessing) about 200-500. It was as if a round dinner plate had tilted slightly, and then returned to its original position. I did not see anything before it tilted nor after it &#34;untilted&#34;. When it tilted it appeared to be off-white and I could only see the &#34;leading edge&#34; which was off-white. I never saw the entire object, just the part that tilted and &#34;became visible&#34;. The object then apparently tilted back to its &#34;original&#34; position and became not-visible. It did not seem to be moving when I saw it. I heard no sound, nor did I expect to at that distance. The object, or rather the leading part of the object (off-white), arc shaped, was visible for only about 1-2 seconds. I took it to be a small plane making a turn (lots of cropdusters in this agricultural area - however they are always painted yellow) or maybe a white heron bird which are fairly common to the area. I kept my eye on the space in the sky where it had appeared and expected to find the answer to what I saw. I saw no planes or birds at all. There very few trees in that area and none that would have blocked my vision. I have no explanation for what I saw - which is why I am reporting this here. Male, age 65, well-rested. I drive that stretch of road at least 8 times a month, every month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s what I THINK I saw:  a part(the leading edge) of an airborne, dinner plate shaped object, camoflaged - at least on the bottom to appear as if it was just part of the sky (invisible). It tilted slightly for some reason and ONLY that tilted part became visible for a very short period of time - 1-2 seconds only. Then the object resumed it invisible position.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/25/05 03:45|Huntsville|AL|Oval|1-2 seconds|Intensely illuminated, sphereoid object moving far too quickly at a 70-75 degree angle into the sky.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45269.html|88|ndxe200507| Intensely illuminated, sphereoid object moving far too quickly at a 70-75 degree angle into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was observed in the night sky at the foot of Brindlee Mtn. roughly above southbound Hwy 231.  At first site, the object was located above the trees about half a mile east of the road (estimated perhaps 300 ft. above ground level on the slope of the mountain).  The object appeared to be roughly round, very slightly elongated, and from my vantage point seemed to be composed of bright blue-white light.  The intensity and color of the light was inconsistant with all fireworks, street lamps, yard lights, and other such sources of illumination that I am aware of.  Within the 2-3 seconds I had a good view of the craft, I observed it to hover above the tree line for an estimated 1/10th of a second and then rapidly moved upwards and westwards, crossing the sky in front of my vehical in approximately 1 second.  From my vantage point, it is my opinion that the object moved in three dimensional space in the same way that an aircraft takes off a runway, only much more rapidly and at a much sharper angle (I estimate the angle would have been roughly 70-75 degrees and the trajectory did not change as it moved).  As the object moved, it also changed color.  The blue-white quality of the light changed to a greenish color and then to a reddish orange color as it gained altitude, and decreased slightly in size proportionally to it&#39;s altitude.  The object seemed to vanish completely at the end of it&#39;s approx. 1 second trajectory, and the final location of the object I estimate to be at a substantial altitude (at least 5,000 ft, though that is a very conservative estimate) and probably at least 1 mile west of southbound Hwy 231 (also a conservative estimate).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A slightly audible sound followed about one second behind the object, and I can only describe it as a Doppler Effect-type sound, though very faint and high pitched (I would compare it to the scream of a fighter-jet engine, only much higher pitched with a very unique undertone).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my opinion that this object could not possibly be an airplane or other man-made craft, as it began too close to the ground and progressed at an extreme angle and speed that I have never seen or heard of in a human aircraft.  The only object I know of that could travel from close to the ground to that alititude at anything nearly approaching that speed would be a rocket of some sort, and the intensity of illumination and the speed of the object is not consistant with any amature rocket.  So far as I know, there are no housing or human habitation sites in the area that the object was hovering over.  The local area is nearly completely covered in hardwood forest.  My geological survey map of the area shows no unusual geological phenomenon.  There were no powerlines or cell phone/radio towers located in the area where the object originated.  The atmospheric conditions were humid, but clear.  There is no chance that the object was a star or planet, as it appeared closer than the horizon and was too close to the ground, and from my moving vehical, the object changed perspective in the way that a three dimensional object would be expected to.  The object could not have been a meteor because it ascended into the sky, while a meteor would have descended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my background, I am a native to this area and I am an archaeologist, currently investigating an excavation site on the Flint River flood plain.  When I saw the object I was returning home from visiting friends in Huntsville.  I had not imbibed any alcohol, nicotine, narcotic, or any other mind affecting substance.  I was not affected by fatigue and I have no history of mental illness, nor any physical or psychological cause for hallucination.  I am reporting this because I can think of no other logical conclusion for what I saw than to label it a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object consisted of a black triangle shape, six white lights (3 along each arm of the triangle) with the &#34;point&#34; angle about 50 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was much larger than a normal aircraft, and totally silent. It appeared to be at about 10,000 feet (I live near a major airport therefore know approximate heights). The lights were exactly the same size and intensity as the stars that were out that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved about halfway across my field of view in about three seconds. In one second, the object appeared to make a 90 degree vertical turn, that is, move from horizontal flight to direct vertical flight. The change from horizontal to vertical happened in about one second, and in a space of about the length of the object, i.e. much faster and more smoothly than a normal aircraft, and without sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remarked to my friend, who was nearby: &#34;Hey, it&#39;s a triangle shaped UFO&#34; and by the time he looked up, the object had vanished. However, while he was looking at the same spot a moment later, he reported a &#34;shooting star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes: At the time of the sighting, a line of hellacious thunderstorms were forming directly to the northwest, the approximate direction of travel. These storms contained heavy lighning, and 70-80 mph winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also: We were part of a bicycle riding event, and there were several thousand campers in the area, so there may have been more sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was pointed north east and had a green light on one of the rear angles, and a red on the other. There was no light on the front, although there did look like there could be one (perhpas it&#39;s just because I would expect there to be).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the object for what seemed to be the longest time.  I&#39;m not really sure how long exactly.  I remember eventually looking away, after what seemed in my head to be the awhile, and seeing lights coming up behind me.  The object had been motionless when I initially saw it, but now when I looked back up the object was slowly flying north east into an area of a thunderstorm (well at least clouds with lightning) and eventually disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There had been a lot of fireworks being shot off that earlier that night, but there were some &#34;fireworks&#34; in the distance that wouldn&#39;t go away. My friend was the first to point it out, but once he pointed I saw them. There were two green lights hovering stationary above the horizon, about 2-3 miles away (estimated).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought they were sparks from the fireworks that were falling to the ground, but they never fell and they were very large at the distance we were viewing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They started to move apart from one another slowly in a horizontal manner.  Then the light on the right moved vertical above the one on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my mind was reeling trying to figure out what this was we were watching.  Next, the lower light moved to be even with the light on the right and very quickly after they were even, the light on the right blasted straight up ward at a speed I have never witnessed before, very very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that one was about half way out of sight the other one on the left took off at equal fast speed. These lights never changed colors they stayed bright green the whole time.  They never left a trail of light either, just a small bit behind the craft as they went up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite possibly being tired we were not on any drugs or alcohol to alter our state of mind.<n>

It looked like a star but not fast like a shooting star, then my husband seen it. It would almost stop, then shoot off again. We watched it move to a point near a stationary star then stop. Then we watched another leave just south of that one and head north, it moved slow then faster, then two more from the north to the south. They looked like stars at first then moved to specific points. I joked at one because it moved in a jerky pattern not smooth like the others. &#34;I said it must be Santa Clause testing new equipment&#34; They all traveled down the milky way. Then two others moved back up to the north. Were they satellites being repositioned? It was like watching the changing of the guards.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the evening mentioned, I went outside to sit on the deck around 9:35 PM. I noticed a bright, rather large light that seemed to be of a golden color on the horizon to the West. I initially thought it was a plane landing at the Asheville Airport but noticed that it was not moving that quickly. Then, thought aha! planet. But, no. That was when I called my husband outside who quickly got his little binoculars that are not too strong (4X) but sufficed. We both watched this object which looked like an upside down rimless cereal bowl. It was surrounded by lights which gave us the shape. The lights seemed to emit a reddish color and a few of them were larger around the bottom. Rather like searchlights. We watched for about 15 minutes and it just seemed to disappear. The craft was hovering and moving slowly and it was almost difficult to get a point of reference regarding the speed that it traveled. Needless to say, we were puzzled and did not know who to call. It needed to be reported and as we do not think that it was an helicopter or a plane I dedcided to go to the &#34;net&#34;. Appreciate any input. As to ourselves we are born skeptics and need proof of existence before we believe. My husband is a chemical engineer with that type of logic and I share the same characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Like our previous sightings in Lancaster, this object dipped occasionally and then eventually &#34;dissolved&#34;.  We both confirmed what we saw: no sound, no flash pattern or lights with the exception of the objects &#34;brightness/ sphere shape&#34;.  We waited a while longer, perhaps 8 to 10 minutes, and the 2nd &#34;star&#34; appeared out of south heading in a northerly direction. This 2nd star was different, however. This time, while it made a slow, almost &#34;hover&#34; like pattern, with slight dips, etc. it made it&#39;s way into our northern view, stopped, hovered, then suddenly became extremely BRIGHT, as if someone turned on a spotlight, while it remained motionless, felt like a signal to us that we see you seeing us. Then it dimmed again, and dissolved into the same spot as the 1st &#34;star&#34;.  We waited awhile longer again, this time it was approximately 15 minutes, and eventually, another &#34;star&#34; came out of the direct west direction, made a slow, dipping, hover like pattern, and again, moved across the sky and &#34;dissolved&#34; into the same exact area of the sky (due north)  As previously stated in our post of last week, we are very close to Edwards AFB, and see many flights of different aircraft all the time and are familiar with private and military craft.  These objects are not airplanes. No sound, no flash patterns, no direct flight path, no usual flight path taken (as we are used to seeing here in the Antelope Valley)  We are reporting this again in the hope that some other people in the valley have seen the same objects in the sky.

These balls were in line and they were too high to be towers or any antenna, afterwards the row of balls stopped. Now every time i go to College Station i look for these balls i dont see them anymore, so i concluded that these were UFO&#39;s. Im not so sure about the exact date, but i know it was between June and August 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

About 35 degrees up from the horizion, directly in front of me was a object, seemingly not moving in any direction I could tell.  It stayed there for about 5 minutes until I turned to head east.  I tried to keep sight of it out of the driver&#39;s side window, but was unable to.  At first I thought it was a plane, but it didn&#39;t have a visible vertical stabilizer or wings that I could see.  Also it was not moving across the sky in any direction.  It was silver, (or white?) much thinner than it was long and high in the sky.  The weather was clear, with no haze and the sun was behind me.  As far as background, I am a former ESL educator with a BA in East Asian History from the Universtiy of Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was fishing for catfish at about 2 in the morning.  As far as I am aware my friend and I were the only ones on the water.  We noticed a large disk in the air.  It hovered about 100 yards above us.  The UFO was directly above my boat.  The UFO was about 50 feet in diameter and 20 ft high.  Before the object appeared there was no wind but when the object appeared the water around me got incredibly choppy it nearly turned my boat over.  Then the water calmed down and the object took off at light speed and I blinked and it was gone.  It left a trail of colors like the northern lights.  The experience felt like 3 minutes but when I looked at my phone it was 5:20 am.<n>

I was traveling along C-470 back to Littleton from Lone Tree. I thought I saw a police car blue light flashing on a flyover and I looked again but there was no flyover. The light flashed again, closer but still seemingly a point light source. It was a beautiful irridescent? cobalt? blue. It flashed another two times seemingly getting closer and then it streaked past like a line of the same blue. Perhaps my emotions got the better of me but I thought I&#39;d document it anyway to see if anyone has shared the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please remove my recent report - determined to be a blue flashing light on a post at the side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please ignore my previous submission.

It was an irregular cigar type shape, that is the shape went one direction, then another, but kept the cigar type shape. It moved at a slow speed, slightly turning end over end very slowly at times. After spotting the object with my naked eye I went into the house to get my binoculars to observe it. It moved to the northwest then turned toward the east while still staying in the general middle part of the sky. I observed it go directly east until it disapeared in the distance. At one point a commercial aircraft went under my view as the object went east. The entire elapsed time was 7 minutes. I have never observed an object like this before. It seemed to have an internal glow, unlike a firery or reflective light. A very clear warm night with no wind. Very slowly turning &#34;end over end&#34; at some points was a major characteristic I have never observed before. The object appeared large and I can only guess it&#39;s altitude as being higher than planes fly. The object seemed to be under some control, and not an object drifting or floating. It was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I got back outside I was able to record the object for a few seconds until it vanished into a near by cloud . I then turned my camera off because my battery was low , then I turned and headed back towards the house when i noticed another object directly over head . I quickly turned my camcorder back on and was able to get this object for about 20 to 25 seconds until it to vanished into some clouds . The second object had 2 bright lights attached to unknown dark craft . Also the first object was far away , but the second was close enough to see it was not a airplane or jet .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a full moon and there was a large cloud formation just blocking the moon, but the upper side of the cloud formation was illuminated by the moon.  It was a great image and we got out and my son started photographing the cloud formation with his camera phone.  The cloud formation resembled a developing thunderhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a fairly avid sky watcher and I noticed an object moving from left to right across our line of sight as my son was photographing the cloud formation.  The object was illuminated an unusual amber across it&#39;s length and there were no blinking lights as a plane or helicopter would have, and the longer I watched it the more obvious it became that it was, in fact, unidentifiable.  There were no wings on the object.  It was travelling a path not normally taken by local air traffic at the altitude it was at.  I wish I could give an altitude, but I&#39;m not well versed in that.  It was at an altitude I normally see the business class of Lear jets travelling at as they leave the airport on the east side of Columbus.  However, this object was flying a straight horizontal path with no deviation in altitude during the time I observed it.  There was commercial aircraft visible in the region higher up, but nothing close to this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I commented, &#34;That&#39;s not a plane.&#34;  My son replied, &#34;What is that?&#34; He then took a picture of it and commented how weird it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of what appears as a faint outline of a series of trees in the background at left is, in fact, the clouds we were looking at.  The object was in the foreground of the cloud formation we were initially looking at.  The object is just about to move out of our view to the right.  The light in the foreground is over my garage.  There is a Magnolia tree visible and the living space is to the right of the garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son&#39;s laptop had to go in for service, and it took awhile to get this photo back from him.  I document our hours so I&#39;m positive of the date.  The time is accurate to +/- 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange, the object appears sightly different than what I visually observed, and looks closer than I recall.  It was better lit visually I also recall.  It&#39;s entire side circumference was a dull amber glow, with a distinct dark border on top and bottom when I first observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trajectory was roughly east to west.  There was no sound evident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll foward the image exactly as I have received it from my son.  Nothing has been done to alter the image.  The camera takes very good images, but a little blurring is evident in the foreground, which may have also affected the clarity of the object. itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/21/05 20:00|Unknown||Cylinder|10-20 secs|A pale orange vertical cylinder object seen on an America West flight.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45548.html|126|ndxe200507| A pale orange vertical cylinder object seen on an America West flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying back from North Carolina to Arizona on July 21st 2005.  The flight took off around 5pm EST from Raleigh Durham on America West.  I think the flight number was 844.  About 3 hours into the trip (I assume maybe somewhere around Texas area but I really dont know for sure) I saw an object out the window.  The sun was still up and there were scattered clouds.  My plane was flying arounnd 33,000 feet.  This object was above a section of clouds (not in the clouds but a cloud bank formed a backgroud).  So the object was definately not on the ground and if I had to guess I would say it was maybe 1/3rd the distance to the ground from us so it was flying at about 20,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared as a cylinder shape, its surface was slighlty reflective it sort of appeared metallic but it was at an extreme range to me so I dont know for sure.  The objects color was sort of a light/pale orange color or possibly light biege.  The color was uniform across the object.  I saw it for around 10-20 secs.  The object appeared to be static.  It did not move and seemed to be fixed in the sky appearing to move at exactly the same speed as all of the surrounding clouds.  The other thing that was very odd was that unlike a plane that would fly in a horizontal positon the cylinder was vertical.  If it was a plane it should have been moving downward at a rapid speed, if it was climbing Im not sure it could have kept that up for 10-20 secs and in either case it didnt appear to be moving at all.  The distance was too great for me to descern any details like wings, designs, etc.  It just looked like a very small cylinder or possibly a cigar shaped object.  There were no visable ballons or anything like that above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most everyone else was watching a movie on the plane with the windows closed so I doubt anyone else saw it.  The pilots probably saw it.  I was sitting on the left side of the plane (if one is sitting down facing foward towards the front of the plane I was on the left side).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a systems engineer for a major semi-conductor company and I was flying on a business trip that day.  I am also an amatuer astronmer and I have spent a lot of time looking at the sky.  I dont know what this thing was but I am pretty confident it was not a standard plane.  It could have been something the government was doing or it could be something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife, daughter and I were standing on an ocean front balcony of a 16 story resort hotel looking east and taking pictures of a rising moon. As I was observing the horizon and people on the beach below, I noticed two objects in the night sky at about a thirty degree elevation from where we were standing at a 1 o&#39;clock position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I orginally thought I noticed two commericial strobes; one moving east to west, the other moving south to north crossing paths at near co-equal altitudes. However, after seeing no strobe pattern and mostly white light, I also noticed that there were two groups or flights of irregular stobe lights. My wife an daughter soon noticed the same and recognized that the pattern of the strobes appeared to move apart, then close together, then elongate and then to a more square or rectangular pattern. All the while, the strobes clearly maintined two distinct formations or groups. The stobes were not always pinpoints of light but appeared to be longer in shape as if looking at a light stick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Estimated Altitude= in excess of 30k feet AGL(est.) Direction = Due east to west Speed = Mach? much faster than commerical aircraft (similar to watching a satellite move overhead)  Lights pased from my 1 o&#39;clock position to my 3 o&#39;clock position moving front to rear as I faced east,in less than 20 secs before disappearing behind the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I an US reserve pilot with more than 3500 hours in both heavy and attack aircraft and have flown all over the world and seen many situations including combat. I have never seen anything like this. My wife and daughter were equally challenged for words to describe the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> + =<n>

Through binoculars it became much clearer.  There were 2 orange lights with a larger yellow light between them.  The craft hovered in the same place for 30 minutes swaying slightly, then &#34;dropped out&#34; of the bottom a much smaller bright white craft that quickly took off, flying on its own, over Belmont.  The larger craft took off over Lake Winnisquam to Meredith and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/20/05 19:54|Avinger (Lake o' the Pines)|TX|Cylinder|20 seconds|I saw a white cylindrical object—the same I saw and reported on 6/23/05—and got two photos of it.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45244.html|133|ndxe200507| I saw a white cylindrical object—the same I saw and reported on 6/23/05—and got two photos of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 7/20/05 I was at the lake (Lake o&#39; the Pines, Texas) photographing the unusual numbers of jets that were flying over our area that evening.  I was taking a few of a passenger jet flying from west to east and I heard what I thought was another flying off to my east.  As soon as the passenger jet disappeared from my view into the treeline I turned around and spotted the source of the sound to my east, and I don&#39;t believe it was a jet because it had no wings, though it sounded like one.  I am certain it&#39;s the same object I photographed on 6/23/05  ( http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44577.html ) as it is the same color, has what looks to be an indention or band in the center, and the rear seems to have a bit of a hump.  The object was flying roughly from south to north again and was to my east northeast by the time I took these photographs of it.  It was low again (maybe 10,000 feet) and moving fairly slowly (I would guess 200-250 MPH) and seemed to fly in a straight path.  I didn&#39;t notice any lights or any other strange behavior.  The time was 7:54PM according to the two pictures I took of it.  My camera is a Fujufilm 2800 (2 megapixel) and I was zoomed to 6X optically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since done some searching and found a fairly complete list of drones, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), rockets, and missiles used by the US military in the past and present complete with pictures, and have found no pictures that matched this object ( http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/ ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two pictures I took of it will follow via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in Exeter, New Hampshire. I am a retired Navy Chief with twenty-two years of service. My job in the Navy was a lot of fun because I was an Instructor Flight Engineer on the P3 Orion  and EP-3 Reconnaissance aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also gave in flight check-rides to fellow pilots and flight engineers. I have twenty-one years of flying experience and I have logged over 10,000 hours of flight time. I also worked for Boeing in Everett Washington north of Seattle for two years as a Quality Assurance Manager leading a team of 65 people in the Systems Installation Division on the Boeing 777 Production Line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve flown over the entire globe and never have I ever seen anything like I saw on the afternoon of July 20, 2005 at approximately 3:15 PM. I was outside preparing my lawnmower getting ready to mow my yard. I had just fueled it and finished checking the oil and had finished installing the grass catcher when I took a drink from a glass of water and was looking up into the sky as I tilted the glass of water back to finish it off. That’s when I noticed this enormous silver cigar shaped object in the sky at about a 40 to 45 degree angle above the horizon. There were very few clouds in the sky and it was about 90% clear blue sky that day with excellent visibility. Below you can see the information taken from the local Seacoast Online News Weather section for July 20, 2005 during that timeframe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time   Condition    Temp  DewPoint Humid. Visib.      Press. Wind  2:55PM Partly Cloudy 90°F  59°F   36%  Unlimited   29.89  From WNW7mph  3:55PM Partly Cloudy 90°F  59°F    36%  Unlimited   29.88  From W9mph  To put the scale of the size of this object into perspective think about this, take a Cessna airplane and park it next to a Boeing 747. Then take the 747 and place it next to this object and the 747 would look like the Cessna does beside a 747 in relation to the size of the object. Another example would be that this object was about twice the size of a modern day US Navy Nimitz Class Aircraft Carrier. On first glance my initial thought was that it was the Hood blimp, which has been flying around in the area recently but I quickly dismissed that idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching this object for about ten minutes I realized that it wasn’t making any sound at all and although I can’t be exact, I thought it was between 2500 and 3500 feet in the air. With something that large it’s hard to really tell but I remember thinking that was about right because the clouds were around 5000 feet that day and it seemed to be below the clouds. There was also a row of large windows evenly spaced around the entire perimeter of the object a little bit higher than center on the object. I did not see anything or anyone in the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving from the West directly toward me heading in an Easterly direction and moving very slowly. Again with something that large it’s hard to estimate speed with something that large but my educated guess is it was moving much slower than 100 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around to see if any of my neighbors were outside but no one else was outside at the time but me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also thought about running into the house to get my digital camera, but I didn’t know how long the object would be there so I was afraid I would miss seeing it the entire time it was in view and I didn’t want to risk that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m glad I decided to stay because not long after I made that decision the object changed from a bright shiny silver color and started to glow a red/orange color. Then there was this strange looking cloud of orange/red flames that started growing and billowing underneath the entire bottom of the object. The billowing fiery clouds reminded me of the way napalm rolls along on the vintage war film footage of Viet Nam I’ve seen on television except that there was no smoke associated with it. At that point I had a shot of adrenalin due to extreme fear because I thought it was going to attack me in some way. It looked as if the air itself had been suddenly ignited in a large billowing cloud of flames. Just as I was about to turn and run into the house due to fear the fiery cloud grew larger and it seemed to be pushing back toward the western end of the object and once it reached its peak (probably about half the diameter of the object) the object seemed to stretch out about twice its original size toward the eastern end of the object thus filling the entire sky in front of me and then in the wink of an eye the western end of the object caught up with the eastern end and it simply disappeared right in front of me. This entire process only took about four or five seconds and the instant the object disappeared so did the billowing fireball cloud. There was no apparent residual evidence that the object was ever there once it disappeared. I was stunned and stood there for several minutes wondering what to do and what had I just seen. I thought about calling the police but because no one else was there to see it with me I didn’t think they would believe me so I didn’t call. I knew I had to report it to somebody so I Googled the words report UFO and that’s how I found the web site for the National UFO Reporting Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t notice any bright lights on the object although that doesn’t mean it didn’t have any because it was a bright sunny clear day and any lights would have been washed out by the bright sunlight and the reflected sunlight off of it’s surface. Also the sun was high in the sky and in no way did it obscure my visibility of the object nor did any reflected sunlight from the object obscure my vision of it in any way. There were no trees or man-made structures obstructing my view. The object made no noise at all during the entire event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was absolutely one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life and I’ve seen a lot. In my opinion this was not something man made and it was far too big to be a blimp or an airplane. I believe it was not of this Earth. Other than that I have no idea what it was, where it came from or where it went. It absolutely appeared to be under intelligent control and exhibited use of technology far beyond anything known to mankind today unless this is some kind of new top-secret government craft previously unheard of. I seriously doubt that though because it would be almost impossible to hide something from the public of this gigantic physical size if it were a secret government project.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Respectfully submitted,  ((name and address deleted)) Exeter, NH 03833<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Source: Seacoast Online<n> <n><n> <n><n> This page has been printed from the following URL:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.seacoastonline.com/news/exeter/07262005/news/54621.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7-27-2005<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO sighting in Exeter - again<n> <n><n> <n><n> By Adam Dolge<n> <n><n> adolge@seacoastonline.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> EXETER - There was something odd in the sky last week, something that caused a Navy veteran with 10,000 hours of flight experience to have his own close encounter.   The former flight engineer, who wished to be identified only as &#34;David,&#34; said of the experience, &#34;this was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the retired Navy chief petty officer said he saw last Wednesday could only be classified as a UFO, an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright and sunny afternoon, about 3:15 p.m., and David was outside preparing his lawnmower. He had filled the mower with gas, checked the oil, and took a sip from a glass of water he had poured.<n> <n><n> When he tilted his head back to get the final sip, through the bottom of the glass he saw a large cigar-shaped object hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> David said windows were equally spaced around the object, however he didn&#39;t see anyone or anything inside. The size of the object was enormous. By comparison, he said, consider what an ultralight plane<n> <n><n> would look like next to a Boeing 747. He said it was about the size of two USS Nimitz aircraft carriers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, through his empty glass of water he thought it could have been the Hood blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;But, the instant I put my glass down, I said, &#39;that&#39;s not a blimp.&#39;&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved from west to east, very slowly for something that size, he said. His initial instinct was that the object was moving at about 100 knots, but something that big shouldn&#39;t be able to stay in the air if it&#39;s going that slow, he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began changing colors from a bright silver to an orange-ish red. A strange cloud of red and orange flames began surrounding the object, and before he knew it the object stretched out like a rubber band. It grew to about twice its original size, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes, he recalled Monday morning, but he is unaware of the specific time because, &#34;it felt like time stopped.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He went into his house and first thought to call the police. He decided not to because he didn&#39;t think they&#39;d take him seriously. So he went on the Internet and searched for &#34;report UFO,&#34; and found the Web site for the Seattle-based National UFO Reporting Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport, director of the UFO reporting center, said David&#39;s report was astonishing because of his history with flight. &#34;I have no question on his reliability.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he gets several accounts each year, but this one stood out. The report was well written and scientific, Davenport said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;In my view, that&#39;s one of the cardinal rules of an account,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The center was founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert Gribble. The center&#39;s Web site, www.nuforc.org, has a large list of UFO sightings.  According to the site, the center&#39;s primary function is to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have witnessed possible UFOs. David&#39;s report, which will soon be on the Web site, will be among dozens of documented sightings to be formally reported to the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not the first time<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Exeter area is no stranger to UFO sightings. In 1965, two Exeter police officers and hitchhiker Norman Muscarello, who was with them, gained national attention after seeing a UFO hovering over Route 101 in Kensington. The sighting was documented in a book called &#34;The Incident at Exeter.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then there was the incident involving Barney and Betty Hill, a husband and wife from Portsmouth who claimed to have been abducted by aliens. The couple was driving from a vacation in Canada in 1961 when they saw a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved directly over their car, and before they knew it they grew drowsy. They later claimed to have been abducted by aliens and gave identical accounts while they were hypnotized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But for this recent sighting, David said he believes that there is life beyond Earth.

7/20/05 12:00|Allegheny State Park|NY|Other|40 seconds|I saw a white dome shaped object with a haze around it and a stripe on it that blended in with the backround|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49032.html|135|ndxe200507| I saw a white dome shaped object with a haze around it and a stripe on it that blended in with the backround<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around noon at a hillside campsite in Allagheny state park. We were about to leave when me and my friend looked up to see a white dome shaped craft come from behind a mountain peak. We all had a very good view at the object because there wernt any trees in our campsite. As it was flying I noticed as it flew in front of a small grey cloud, a stripe in the middle of  the object matched the color of the cloud. The object seemed to have a haze around it so it could have been the same thing as the stripe on the object. After about 40 second it flew behind another peak. The next day it flew back to the original peak and i never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw a light just appear out of nowhere and it flew in a straight line for about 3-5 seconds when it got real bright and then faded away. This happened about 4 nights and I tried to get my mom to see it but she thought I was just mistaking it for an aaircraft, but in all the times I&#39;ve sat out there, there has been no aircraft take the path that this took. I didnt bother to tell anybody except my mom because I dont think they would have believed me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw a couple nights later a bright craft fly in a straight line flying east. This lasted about 10 seconds before it got bright and faded away. There is something that happened also a few years ago in Milan, Illinois around midnight. I was at Camden Park with my boyscout group when some of the other kids ran in and said something exploded around the moon. I went out and looked up and there was what looked like debris floating around the moon. Then there went a bright light going pretty fast, I would have to say about 500 mph?, and it flew by and over the horizon. About 5 minutes later, it appeared again from the opposite horizon. Then when that had disappeared over the horizon again, another one appeared and flew after the first. There was no sound in either of the reports. That is all that happened that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I didnt know where to report it and didnt want to go to the local news so i found your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside for a bit to cool off because of the hot night and looked up and saw 3 dimly lit circular things in the sky. I at first thought it might have been spot lights but looking longer at it I ruled out the possibility that they were the spotlights. They were dimly lit, kind of a light gray and not a bright light it was like a haze over them, and were what looked to be 20 inches wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They also moving in and out of the clouds and they looked like they would follow eachother and then sometimes they would hover apart from eachother for a bit. It wasn&#39;t a pattern to their movements either which made me also realize they couldn&#39;t have been spotlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finished my smoke and went inside to wake up my boyfriend and tell him to come out and look at this. Then our neighbour was coming home and we called over to him and him and his wife also watched these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to give off a very low humm sound. It wasn&#39;t like anything really electrical we ever heard. It was something very very low but yet it was almost loud at the same time. It&#39;s very hard to put into words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching these things for about 20 mins. we went in to get something to drink, the neighbours were already inside their home, but when we retured the things were gone and so was the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> unfortunetly we didn&#39;t have any film so no photo was taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/19/05 22:40|Escondido|CA|Other|20-30 seconds|This was a night sighting of a slow-moving, kite-shaped craft with lights on it, 20-25 miles north of San Diego, CA.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45180.html|140|ndxe200507| This was a night sighting of a slow-moving, kite-shaped craft with lights on it, 20-25 miles north of San Diego, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object: &#34;Kite-shaped&#34;, but shorter and wider than a typical kite-- approximately a 5 to 4 length to width ratio-- travelling toward what would be the &#34;top&#34; of the kite.  The following diagram approximates the axes of the kite shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n> -<n>----  (Direction of travel: &lt;---) <n>  At the &#34;nose&#34; there was one bright light flashing at about one-second intervals, along with two smaller, softer white lights, close together and slightly off-center to the left.  There was one soft white light at each of the other three corners, not as bright as the strobe.  No red and green port and starboard lights.  As indicated in the diagram, the cross-axis defined by the &#34;side&#34; lights was no more than 20% of the total length back from the nose-- too far forward to be at the wingtips of large modern airplane designs.  The lights made it difficult to see the shape clearly, but stars disappeared and reappeared behind it at the edges of the kite shape-- i.e. not as would occur with wings and a fuselage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size: Visually equivalent to a Boeing 757 at 2,000 to 2,500 feet altitude.  That is also our best night-time naked-eye estimate of its maximum altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sound: A loud, fairly high warbling whine, from a single sound source. No jet exhaust roar, definitely not a piston engine. Also, there was no interference &#34;beat&#34; or other indication of multiple engines/sound sources. (I&#39;m a musician, and am used to using wave interference to tune instruments, and used to distinguishing between single or multiple voicings of a given sound.)  Speed:  The object took about 20 seconds to go from directly overhead to disappearing beyond trees and a ridgeline two or three hundred feet high and a quarter mile away. Estimated distance traveled while in sight no more than one mile.  The other witness is an ex-pilot, multiple-engine rated.  Her first comment was that it must be &#34;in trouble&#34;, because the sound was all wrong and it was at or below what would be stall speed for an airplane that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Direction of travel: Northeast, with Polaris in sight for visual reference, observed from a house and walkway oriented within one or two degrees of true north-south. The sky was clear except for some high &#34;mackerel&#34; (cirrus?) clouds off to the south, with a three-quarter moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location:  Del Dios community on Lake Hodges, approximately 4.5 miles southwest of the town center of Escondido, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note: An ex-air force friend, told about a similar sighting in February of 2004, said &#34;it&#39;s one of ours&#34; but would not go into any further details.)<n>

When I looked up, I saw a soft-ball sized or slightly larger ball of light that was silvery and white in color, fairly bright, travelling pretty fast, maybe 50 - 60 mph.  It was against a black night sky and dark trees because it was night time.  It looked like it came out of a treed aread overhead, passed between another tree and near the roof of the house.  It was maybe no more than 20-30 feet overhead.  There was no sound.  It passed by within a second or two.  There was no sign of it after I went and looked around the corner of the house.  When I saw it my first thought was that I was seeing a shooting star.  But, then I realized that it was so closes overhead that it wasn&#39;t a shooting star at all, and it wasn&#39;t arcing, it was going in a straight, linear direction from my left to my right, in a perfect straight line, no arcing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The streak had a bearly visible beginning and end as if an object went by. This appeared to occur about 50 miles above our western horizon at an angle of about 60 degrees altitude, and moved through the sky covering a distance of about 50 degrees arc. It happewned so fast that I wasn&#39;t sure I saw it because of the tremendous speed.  So I turned to my wife and said &#34;did you see that?&#34;.  She said &#34;yes, what was that?&#34;.  I asked &#34;well what did you see?&#34; She sais &#34;a streak of light&#34;.  The weather that night was &#39;electric&#39; with lightning flashes lighting up the sky all around us as we travelled. All of these flashes were behind the clouded skys and bright white. I know what lightning looks like, after living in south Florida for five years, and seeing different types of lightning for fifty-six years.  This was not lightning, but something moving at a major portion of the speed of light. Meteor? Not below the clouds moving that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don&#39;t know how big it was because i don&#39;t know exactly how far away it was.  I&#39;ve told some people about it and they didn&#39;t see anything.  The craft didn&#39;t make any noise at all, it just sat there and slowly moved what appeared to be to the northwest towards me.  I took two pictures on a polaroid camera, but there was a problem with the second picture (connected???).  Just as i was looking to see what the problem was with the second picture that i took, it vanished.  All without a sound, or anything.  It didn&#39;t waver in the wind or anything, no noise, nothing.  It was rather egg shaped and looked a brass/gold color.  I could see that it had an opening of some sort underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Might be triabgular or rectangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving E on 24 towards Walnut Creek CA (mapquest Oakland to Concord CA). At the time I saw the object I was near Lafayette (5 miles from Walnut Creek). Travelling at 70mph i first saw the object near the top of my window. I slowed down and observed the object E in line with 24. The object could have been a couple miles directly ahead of me and maybe severa thousand feet above. At first I thought it was a blimp above Mount Diablo. As I approached 680 North, the object went North in a smooth yet fast rate (100 mph). It had to be going faster than me because it went North and into the distance towards Sacramento and disapeared in the distance in a few minutes (2 minutes maybe?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description. The object appeards to be triangular, but since it was dark I cannot confirm. The most important features were a line of lights along the side. rectangular, long and skinny, something you may see at an arena these days. The lights were flashing in different patterns but the sequences seemed to repeate the same sequence over and over. At the top of he object I observed some small red and white lights (like on a plane). I figure the object was triangular since the small red and white lights were in the middle and above the lower set of flashing white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I walked out it just stopped, like it saw me &amp; was  scared to move, it just hovered about (possibly) 300 meters in the air, then I went in &amp; I went back out literally 5 seconds later, it was gone. It couldn&#39;t have been a star there were to many clouds to even see the moon. It had no sound &amp; it was at a range that you couldn&#39;t have not noticed it if it were a plane. It was heading south when I had noticed it, then it stopped.I suppose it was acending when I happened upon it. So I hope this helps if there is an investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All the object were to our Northeast, at about 75 degrees from the horizon and fairly close to each other. We were located at about University and Atlantic Blvds in Jacksonville, Fl. The objects were reflective of the setting sunlight behind us and had enough definition to determine they were objects in our atmosphere although they had only about the same brilliance as medium bright stars. Several jet planes flew through our view of those objects but may have been at a different altitudes. The eight objects were not in a formation but rather in the same general area of the sky. During about 7 minutes of watching them, they gradually faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was still visible but much farther away he saw that there were no other stars out and this think was getting brighter and dimmer when he saw the video he definitely agreed it was a UFO. It was no plane. Did anyone else in Sacramento see this?<n>

I kept on telling my friend &#34;Dude look theres something in the sky.&#34; He kept on saying,&#34; WHERE?!&#34;, whenever I told him. He finally saw it, but then after a few seconds , it disappeared, not out of sight, but it just dissapeared. My two theories are : #1 it had some kid of cloak so we couldn&#39;t see it. #2 it accelerated at an incredible speed in a blink of an eye. We never saw it again. I am no longer a Montanan resident but i know it wasnt any planes we have around the airport outside of town. I truely believe it wasnt any plane. Just so anyone who reads this knows, my friend and I  whitnessed the ufo for about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object appeared to give off some kind of heat like if you look down a road in the summertime the way the heat from the sun reflects off the pavement this thing appeared to have a circle around it and outside this circle it was giving off waves heat like reflecting the sun so I called my roommate (A Network manager at an architectural firm) and he told me to get the video camera which I did.  It was my first time using my roommate’s camera and after viewing what I had there are parts where this thing has 8 or more orbs in a triangle formation.  this object then headed slowly to the south east at which point I saw a commercial airliner fly right past it the pilot had to have seen this object, around 7:30pm my roommate gets home and I point the thing out to him as it was now much farther away he agreed with me it definitely wasn’t a plane and neither of us had any idea what this thing was. I am a California State Employee of 12 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object would move horizontally across the atmoshpere, but no way to measure depth or speed.   Looked out of our planets atmosphere and looked very bright while moving, but became dim or even transparent when stoppped but process of moving happened while lite then would stop.  For a different amount of time each time.  Was same size as the average star visible to stars size in big dipper.  I am not an astonomer or a good speller but what we saw was definetly not seen before and there was no way to make sense of it.  Not like any comet or astroid I have seen plenty of those.   This was not falling it was traveling!<n>

Saw the same distinct objects as in the last report. Instead of seeing six tonight like last time, I saw 2. I instantly recognized them from last time, this is the third overall sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Same blink pattern as before. White white red. white white red.  Seemed to be just slightly larger than last time and it looked like a triangle wedge shape, but it would be impossible to know for sure without binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sounds, smooth and silent and slow (It seemed they would cross the width of a full moon in about 7 seconds). Crafts were heading Northeast on the same course it appeared.  The 2nd object was about 2 minutes behind the 1st object (2 min to get to same place in sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2nd craft crossed opposite paths with what looked to be a satellite or the ISS heading in the opposite direction, but then that object got dimmer. Again I find myself wishing I had a telescope. Would be interested to hear if anyone else has seen these.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to the sky and off in the northwest direction I could see a glimmering (looked like a sun reflection, rather than lights) and slow moving object in the sky.  It was very small from the distance away, so this object was very hard for me to determine any shape or relative size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved so slowly and occasionally would ascend and descend rapidly at what seemed a thousand feet or so, but would then fall back into it&#39;s snail pace travel across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two other guys came out or the building and noticed me looking up, so they inquired what I was looking at and I pointed it out.  One fellow grabbed onto the object immediately, while the other could not seem to fixate on it. Again..It was pretty high up and small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway...as we were looking up, we saw two orange and black chevron shaped objects fly across the sky into our felid of viewing from the west and turn into an eastern direction at a super rate of speed and a much lower elevation than the other object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects then made a sharp turn toward the west and did not separate or lose any ground to each other during this maneuver.  It was incredible to watch at the speed they were moving.  Total precision is the best way to describe it. Then they ascended to a little higher altitude and made another minor turn (again, perfect precision) and climbed and headed toward the first object that I originally spotted at the higher altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two black and orange chevron objects made zero noise that I or the other two could detect and we looked at each other stunned after and the looks on our faces related pretty much the same question...&#34;What Was That&#34;?  All three objects then vanished from our naked eyes, once the chevron objects appeared to re-unite with the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway..The duration from beginning to end was about 5 minutes..With the &#34;chevron objects&#34; event lasting only about 20 to 25 seconds of the total event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Tonight i was looking up at the sky for about 5 minutes, and I thought i saw a object that was a plane.  But the object of light sped up quick in a straight path, then made a 90 degree turn and shot off! From what i thought it was in beginning deftinly was not a plane, because what kind of plane can do that! I prolly stayed outside for another 10 mins looking and came in to report it. Glad i found you guys! ive been watching UFO tv shows for 3 weeks now and yours came across this same night! Glad i could contribute my sighting, if I see anymore I will report it. thanks<n>

This conversation continued and I remember saying &#34;I think its just a matter of looking up at the nights sky once in a while&#34; and I was looking.About an hour had passed the conversation had changed. I had this feeling or intuition to look and I looked straight at the same three lights. I stood up and yelled &#34; that’s them&#34; and sure enough I wasn’t crazy because they all seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watch the 3 lights move together in a triangle. I said &#34;lets see if they cross over a star&#34; I wonted see if it blacked out the star when the triangle covered it. We followed them to not see them do so when I said &#34; I hope they do something different&#34;. And sure enough the did before I could finish saying it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the front light shut off(disappeared) then a second and the third in a 123 type of rhythm. I was like Woh that’s different, but they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend spotted them again as they reappeared where they started. to do the same triangle thing traveling in the same direction at the same speed. But they didn’t move as far because the triangle stopped moving forward and then in a manor where it flipped and turned and didn’t look like a triangle anymore. we could  tell that this wasn’t a solid vehicle but three individual  lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all was happening very fast and continued to do so. the three lights moved closer to each other to only to go into a chase that was all mathematically perfect. they chased each other in a perfect circle so fast and so tight to form a perfect bright white ring. then they split into three directions in perfect angles from each other and then disappeared after a very short distance, to not be seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we all went nuts and climbed on to the roof of our trailer house. we were all being very loud and hopeful we&#39;d see them again. but we didn’t and I haven’t again yet. I remember my mom getting pissed about all the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain this wasn’t a manned vehicle maybe controlled remotely (robotically).  But again the vibes I got makes me certain that it was not man made. I felt like it was trying to communicate but I really don’t know. I just know I’m a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not lying. I never do. But know one believes tell they see it for them selves. just look up at the stars once in a while an think about it.<n>

I waited and watched until it came back, going the opposite direction with the same fast and then slow speeds, with still no aircraft sounds, until it stopped where it was and disapeared.

Close to the crossover of 20 and 377 I saw a small glowing light appear from nowhere and shoot up maybe 50 feet into the sky (not very high). It grew as it shot up into the sky. When it was shooting up and growing, it moved in a natural curve motion. It left a glowing trail that followed it. Then it suddenly stopped. It stayed suspended in air motionless. Then it suddenly moved to the left and down increadibly fast and perfectly straight. During this, it remained the same size. It suddenly stopped again and stayed motionless. Then it just dissapeared into thin air. This object seemed small...maybe 2-4 feet. It was a bright white-yellow light. I heard no noise nor did my radio or car stop working. The wierd thing was that it happend so close to two highways. Other people must have seen it also! At my job, I look at goverment aircraft all day...including unmanned aircraft. I have seen some wierd aircraft that never made it to full production. I am telling you that this was something I have never seen before. It came out of nowhere and vanished into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear, no storms or rain...although it may have rained earlier in the day.

The light was jumping around and I figured that it was just me, so I when to my car that was in the driveway and used it for a stedy rest for the 7X50s. The light was jumping, you would see it at poit A the next time it would be a point B and so, these were very fast jumps. When last seen it was heading North and when behind some large pine trees.

Belvoir Military Reservation on the Potomac River in the Gunston Manor subdivision. We saw a disk shaped object moving silently and slowly down the Potomac River past Mason Neck which is the peninusula we live on. It was about 100 feet in altitude and about 60 feet in diameter with a top dome and bottom dome. It was maybe 500 feet from us. It was flashing red, white, and blue lights and moving at maybe 3 mph. Totally silent. Our neighbor, who is a retired USAF Colonel was eating barbecue with us and when he saw the saucer said: &#34;They are looking for humans for experiments, let&#39;s get inside.&#34;  We went inside and kept watching through the sliding glass patio doors while the saucer flew South away from us down the Potomac. Same speed. Our neighbor said when the saucer had disappered: &#34;They are the Retriculans, if you ever see a saucer or cigar shaped object flashing lights, run like hell.&#34; This all happened about 40 minutes ago. I have been reading your on-line reports from time to time, but I never thought I would actually see a UFO. We didn&#39;t think of taking photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just below the cloud cover so I estimated that it was approximately around 20,000 feet and about 5-10 miles from us.  I retrieved a pair of binoculors from my truck and focused in on the object.  It was still moving in the same direction and I noted that it was occasionally stopping and turning from side to side.  It was a solid object, no portals could be seen and it was a dark grayish black.  It&#39;s body was solid and it was completely flat surfaced.  It continued in a N/E direction and was almost upon us, still about 20-25 thousand feet and suddenly it disappeared into the clouds.  A neighbor who lives across the street also witnessed the object both with his naked eye and with use of my binoculars.  There was no sound from the object whatsoever.  The neighbors age is around 71 years old.  I am 60 years old and my cousin in 40 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Seattle) store, I noticed an airliner - probably 3-5 miles distant - coming from the south and banking east.  I assumed it had just taken off from SeaTac Airport.  I noticed what appeared to be the sun glinting off of a horizontal object directly above the rear of the plane.  At first I thought it was an unusually large aerodome of the type seen on AWACS aircraft, but the &#39;glint&#39; was fully half the length of the plane, and appeared just above and behind the vertical stablizer.  I saw no actual structure.  The plane immediately passed into or behind a small cloud whose apparent horizontal size was roughly 5 times the length of the plane.  I expected the see the plane emerge from the other side of the cloud in 2 - 4 seconds, but it never did!  This was VERY strange, as the cloud seemed too small to obscure even a quickly turning airliner.  I stared at the cloud for minutes, not knowing what to expect, but saw nothing emerge.  The cloud eventually merged with - or moved behind - another larger cloud, but had only clear blue sky around it when the incident occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking at the northern sky at about a 30 degree angle up from the horizon we saw a object moving towards us. I studied the object trying to figure out what type of jet it was. (I was raised near a Marine Corps Air field in Yuma AZ.) As a young man I would watch the jets go on there training missions and could identify any jet there was, during the Military appreciation days I would go to the shows and the fighters would fly over at Mach 1 and Mach 2. The object approached at least at Mach 1. As it got closer I told the other man &#34;That ain&#39;t any jet.&#34; It was Oval flying just below cloud level, as it flew over head there wasn&#39;t any sound. I tried to get my 7 year old granddaughter to see it but she couldn&#39;t it was an dark oval with a slight aura around it, against a cloudy sky, you could not follow the sound forward to the object like you can a jet. It flew beyond us to about a 55 degree angle from the southern horizon and then turned slightly upward and flew into the clouds and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have an update.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the UFO, I immediately had to turn off the highway and drive down a dark, hardly used road, with nothing but trees and a couple of buildings. I was scared to drive down it after what I had just witnessed, but I did it anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After driving down the dark secluded street, I suddenly slammed on my breaks as there were two huge eyes staring at me. I was frightened and could not figure out what it was. I stared at it, and it stared at me. Then I realized it was a deer. It slowly walked off the road and stood behind the trees and continued to watch me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of days ago, I had my therapist, who is also a nurse practioner, hypnotized me, so I could go back through that night again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Turns out, the eyes did not belong to a deer; I was in fact eye to eye with an alien. It looked just like the typical alien on the front of Communion. I am not a ufo/alien expert. I believe these are called &#34;Greys.&#34;  It did walk very slowly into the woods and continued to stare at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my hypnosis, I had a panic attack, and was extremely scared, crying, sweating, and barely able to breathe, so my therapist brought me out of the hypnosis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a feeling it was trying to communicate with me, so I wish I could go back and find out, but it was a very terrifying experience for me to relive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to send an update. I wish someone could help me figure out what happened, and if this might be a pattern for me, because the alien looked familiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks so much!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as an employee of an aerospace firm.

I had just come home from work and I stepped outside onto my porch along with my husband and a friend around 10:30 PM. I immediately saw a very bright streak of white light travel across the sky and i thought that i had seen a shooting star, so i kept on looking for another one and then I saw one that only went a very short distance and it was very bright..I then started to think something was going on and then my husband spotted what appeared to be a star moving very quickly and jumping across the sky it swirled around in circles very fast and then dissapeared behind what looked like a normal star. Shortly afterwards, we began to see bright streaks of light zoom across the sky periodically and then what we thought were stars in the sky began moving around and coming closer (about airplane level) they were moving in very odd jumpy patterns and each of them had a bright red light. There were about 5 or 6 of them that we could see and they seemed to be playing with eachother. Then suddenly they started following eachother and they were all flashing bright lights in the shape of a triangle and the light started at the top and flashed down to the bottom of the triangle like christmas lights and they were green, purple, blue, red,and orange. They continued to play with eachother and they would periodically stop and hover, when they hovered they looked like nothing more than a normal star until they moved again. I witnessed one of them pass over the highway and when it did, all of its lights turned off. My friend did manage to snap some pictures of what we saw, I dont think that she has gotten them developed yet. The &#34;show&#34; finally ended around 1:00am. Also, when I woke up the next morning, i went to my computer and there was a warning message on it saying that the computer had not been able to shut down that night because other people were logged onto it at that time (we did not have the internet so i dont know how this was possible) I have never been a beleiver, but the things i witnessed that night have definately altered my perception of things. I would also like to bring to your attention that the space shuttle came back to earth unplanned the following day and I think that what I witnessed very well could have had something to do with it....just a theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Every night I witness multiple UFOs at extremely high altitudes. I&#39;m talking about in the stars. These objects I see are balls of white/yellowish/blueish white light. I live a couple miles away from Nellis AFB and I know the difference between the objects and UFOS. Anyway, last night I was sitting in my backyard and saw with the naked eye three bluish white light objects in the formation of a triangle moving from North to South. I grabbed my binoculars and got a closer look. I can see the three objects quite clearly and I can see the stars in between so I know it wasn&#39;t a solid object. They were moving at exactly the same speed. As I was watching them the one in the front dimmed out and then the two behind did also. Shortly after that about 3 mins another two of these showed up traveling the same direction. I grabbed my binoculars and as soon as I locked on them, they dimmed out. Like I said I can go out any night of the week and see these objects. They always appear and dissapear and reappear sometimes showing off by making themselves extremely bright. Sometimes stopping or moving slowly or moving really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you ((name deleted))<n>

I noticed what looked like a glowing star coming from out of the west heading east at a high rate of speed, but not so fast that it couldn&#39;t be tracked with the naked eye, I  said to the others &#34;what is that?&#34; The object was almost overhead and I ran into the apartment building to grab my binoculars to get a better look. After I looked I passed the binoculars to my neighbor to have a look while I was standing there in awe at what I saw. All four adults got to see it with the binoculars. I saw a glowing white object triangular shaped with a metal surface with what looked like black waves in the metal. it was only a matter of minutes and it vanished out over the Atlantic Ocean, Then we saw another object out over the ocean in the distance heading from the north to the south at a high rate of speed, there was a plane in the air to the north that looked as if it was heading in the same direction, but it was much slower then what appeared to be the second object, I also saw the second object with the binoculars. Around these objects there was what looked like a white glow, like a florescent light, the light didn&#39;t look attached to the object, but looked more like it emanated around the object.The object that few over head did not make any noise at all, we all agreed it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter as the airport is not far from here and we see planes all the time with there flashing lights, we don&#39;t know what the closest object we all seen was, but whatever it was, it was quite a sight to behold through binoculars going overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked outside my window and I saw a light, which at the time I thought was an aircraft travelling left to right in the direction of Heathrow airport, but it flew very fast much faster than any other plane, which would not be allowed to fly that fast even if they could because of the distance it is to Heathrow Airport due to speed regualtions, laws etc. It was not a fighter jet because I know and I have seen them fly and this thing flew much faster than one. Also the object was very bright much brighter than lights from planes which I saw near it (next to flight path)  but it was much further away than the commercial planes and it had brighter lights. Unlike the planes it which have several lights, it did not have any it was emitting light from itself; it looked slightly less bright than a star. It could not have been a comet because the object was flying parallel at an average speed and then it suddenly (not gradually) increased in speed. It was definatley not a plane because living under a flight path for all my life I can distinguish between a jumbo jet to a unconventional looking hazy light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other planes were in the vicinity of the object but they were going into land on the airport or had just taken off.

As they moved extremely fast within 10 seconds they were above us; they seemed to pause in midair with no sound.  The lights turned gold and there was no moon out that night. Then, the objects changed shape into golden flying angels.  Some of the neighbors said they looked like flying golden eagles from where they stood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the next second, the three objects flew at a southwest angle and disappeared completely into the dark night.

He said look i sea a plane, and pointed at it.My father said that can&#39;t be a plane because the lights were not blinking. there were 2 lights , and as it moved the lights both staid the same space apart. when it turned one light went under the other. it headed in one dirrection at fast speeds. my dad lost where it went, but I didn&#39;t. I saw it take a dead stop, and went in the opposite dirrection at high speeds. then all of a sudden right in front of the lights appered one other that was headed right for it. then emeadietly the 2 lights stoped and shot off in the opposit dirrection.than dissappered.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/15/05 22:00|Guelph (Canada)|ON|Unknown|15 SEC.|4 reports of unknown objects|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54656.html|198|ndxe200507| 4 reports of unknown objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out on my front porch as I often like to watch the stars at night in the summer and when I looked up right above my home which at that time was right in the center of the city, I saw something just sitting below the clouds above my home. I saw a red light attached to something that was just sitting in the air not moving and then all of a sudden this thing just rises incredibly fast into the cloud cover above it and disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later I was again out at night doing the same thing and this time I was looking at the stars themselves when one of them began to move very fast, it was just a point of light very high up and I thought it was a star at first till it cut across the sky and then turned and disappeared into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first expierence with weird stuff in the sky was in the early 90&#39;s, I had been out late at night and when I got home that&#39;s when everything got strange.  First off I was completely sober and when I went into my home I felt very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also behaved strangely, I am afraid of the dark and don&#39;t like being in dark rooms alone unless a light is on. This night I walked into my dark house never turned on any lights and went and stood in the livingroom, I just stood there doing and thinking nothing and suddenly had an urge to go out the front door which we never used. We always used the back door to go in and out of the house. When I opened my door there was a huge ball of white light in the sky across from my home, this thing was massive and as I watched it I went out onto the porch.It glided or floated, it moved slowly and it passed behind a large maple tree, I remember wondering why it didn&#39;t come out the other side right away, it should&#39;ve because of the size, so I went down the street to look around the tree but it was gone. I turned around and started to walk back to my house, I have no memory of getting to my house and it wasn&#39;t till a year later that I remembered this night.I got up the next day after this event and acted like nothing happened. Very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband also had a sighting involving a large craft with 5 blue lights,I think it was stop sign shape or something like that. He works nights at a factory outside the city and he said that some guys were at a door and called him over they told him there was a ufo but by the time he got there it had passed over so he ran to the back of the plant by himself and saw the craft pass over and a short time later he saw a military jet coming flying through the sky, stop on a dime and turn in the direction of the craft. This was only an hour away from the Toronto airport but fairly high up in the sky he said.This also happened shortly after my first sighting in the early 90&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/15/05 22:00|Nampa|ID|Other|30 mins|July 2005 Meridian "field lights" -- night flights of cropdusters?|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45034.html|199|ndxe200507| July 2005 Meridian &#34;field lights&#34; -- night flights of cropdusters?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live south of Nampa, Idaho -- a community near the recent July 2005 sightings of bright lights over fields in Meridian. I have an educated guess (?) as to what those folks saw, because I saw a similar thing in the fields around my house at about 10 p.m. on July 15.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10 p.m., I went to the sliding glass door of the master bedroom to let my dog out onto the patio. The back of my house, patio, and long backyard face west. I heard a plane flying low overhead, which is not unusual because I am between the Nampa Municipal airport and the Owyhee Mtns to the south/southwest; lots of folks like to take small planes from that airport and sightsee. I thought maybe it was someone returning late from a trip into the Owyhees; at this point, it&#39;s mostly dark, with just a hint of pinkish sunset left to the northwest of us, toward Nampa and Caldwell. (Idaho daylight and sunsets are long in the summer.)  I was surprised to see a plane just RIGHT THERE, heading south along Track Road, arced in a sharp curve and obviously making a U-turn back toward the north (back toward Deer Flat Rd). When the plane was facing me head-on (the plane was now facing east, toward Meridian/Boise), I saw that across the front of the plane there were 3 round, bright white lights, along with a very small colored light on each wing tip. (I believe one was green and one was red, although on subsequent passes/turns, I also saw blue wing-tip lights -- guess FAA regulations dictate which lights have to shine depending on what motion you are performing?)  As the daughter of a retired pilot/cropduster, I realized it was a cropdusting plane. (Although I admit I did not realize you could operate them after dark -- thought it was a safety hazard.) I watched as the pilot crossed Deer Flat Rd -- the pilot then popped on a bank of REALLY bright white (almost pale yellowish) lights on the underside of the plane. When I say really bright, I mean bright enough that I could see not only the tops of the onion plants he was spraying in that dark field, but the mist of the chemical coming out of the spray jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for several minutes as he swooped low to the ground and arced and turned and popped his various sets of lights on and off while he dusted the field -- quite a skilled pilot in a nimble plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was amused to think that it reminded me of some scenes in Close Encounters with the craft zooming down the road and thought, &#34;Well, if you weren&#39;t close enough to hear the engine, you&#39;d think it was a UFO!&#34;  Then I got to thinking about the Meridian reports I&#39;d read earlier that week... At that point, I grabbed a notebook and tried to sketch out the lights in order to compare it to the report I&#39;d read on the NUFORC site. After a couple minutes, I thought about getting the camera, but by the time I&#39;d located it, realized I needed the flash, went back in and located the flash, then went back out to the patio, the plane had changed fields and was spraying fields west of Track Road toward Powerline (where it dead-ends at Star Pass Ridge). That was a somewhat eerie sight, seeing those lights pop on and off from behind one of the rare stands of trees in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back to the NUFORC site today, I see that the Meridian reports are front-and-center and that the folks are going to be on the Coast-to-Coast AM show soon. Now, I obviously can&#39;t swear for certain that this is what those folks saw in Meridian around the first of the month, but there are lots of fields and agricultural operations in the western edge of Meridian/eastern edge of Nampa (the garage farms haven&#39;t taken over all of it, yet!), and it IS cropdusting season (apparently even at night). And if they had burning eyes, it could be from the poison the plane was spraying on the crops. Plus, one witness&#39; drawing DID describe the object as having a &#34;plane&#34; shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that&#39;s just my information to offer as a possible explanation of what might be an IFO instead of a UFO. Please note, if relevant, that I am a MUFON member.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark, but there were low clouds and you could see pretty well under them, because of the reflection of the city lights. I saw at first what appeared to be smoke or two balloons. The color was dark brown or black. After about a minute or so it became apparent that they were something different. The way they moved was unusual. I told my friend to look at them. I thought that maybe these were birds flying in formations. When the objects got closer to us it became obvious that they were not birds. They were moving very gracefully, almost like two giant pterodactyls. They were not moving their “wings”, but hovering and did not make any sound. My friend got a little scared and asked me what I think these things are. She is a strict Christian and does not believe in UFOs or anything like that. After about a minute the fist object disappeared. We were staring at the second one and when it got closer we could see its form. It looked like the letter “W”. It continued getting closer and then vanished. I think the closest it got was about a mile or so. We waited for a few minutes to see if they will “reappear”, but nothing happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know exactly what we saw. They were either giant birds similar to the pterodactyls or some kind of crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/15/05 20:30|Portland|OR|Teardrop|15 seconds|highly-reflective inverted black teardrop over a Portland evening|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45328.html|203|ndxe200507| highly-reflective inverted black teardrop over a Portland evening<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just finished my shift at the bakery and stepped outside to wait for a friend. The sun was beginning to set though the sky was still blue. With a few minutes to wait I looked up and something caught my eye. At first, due to the shape of this object (a black inverted teardrop) I believed it was a black balloon that had been let go, but once I saw that it was moving in a perfectly straight line I began to wonder (if it was a balloon, I figured, it would have had at least a slight variation in attitude or bearing). I was facing north when I first saw it, with the sun setting to the west, and it was travelling approx. East-Southeast. As I turned towards the east to follow it, I saw the sunlight reflecting off it&#39;s west side and realized it was a highly reflective surface in the shape of a perfectly inverted teardrop. Although I couldn&#39;t tell for sure, I received the impression it was spinning at a very high velocity. There was no sound beside those of the city, though I was in a state of sensation during the event. The sighting lasted about 15 seconds over residential Portland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
7/15/05 20:30|Ukiah|CA|Unknown|10 min|Glowing pink object moving through sky at sunset|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45798.html|204|ndxe200507| Glowing pink object moving through sky at sunset<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  just came across your website and wanted to submit this event as best I can remember. About a month ago my friend and I went for a evening walk on the Coyote Dam at Lake Mendocino CA. It was around 8:30pm daylight savings time and the sun was just setting behind the mountains on the opposite side of the valley. As we were walking I looked over at the sunset area where the sky was still glowing a soft pink and saw a brilliant illuminated pink object. At first I thought it was a lone stray cloud that was glowing from the sunset. Upon watching the object I realized that the brilliant color of the glow seemed to come from a super reflective surface that was much brighter than any cloud glow Ive ever seen before. Not to mention there were not any clouds in the sky at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the object out to my friend and we began to watch it. She was as amazed as I was. We talked about it for some time while watching it and debating what on earth it could have been. It was moving very slightly; so slow that you couldnt really notice it at all. At one point it began to move faster, but still very slow... and MUCH slower than any of the planes that fly over the valley. As the sunset got darker the object stayed bright glowing pink. It was sort of a diamond/cylinder shape. It was quite a distance away from us. As we continued to watch the object we noticed it had a red and white light that would randomly blink on the surface of it - not at the same time... each light would go off differently at different times with no obvious pattern. The object moved closer to us in a south/east direction and then began to move away in the direction it had come. It got smaller and smaller and then immediately vanished as if it hadent been there at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a dramatic display but it was unlike any airplanes or craft we have seen before. Not to mention the fact that it was flying in such a strange and slow flight pattern. No one else walking on the dam seemed to notice it or watch it the way we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The objects had a very bright light in the center. What was unusual about this was that a squadron of what appeared to be in line formation of four, 10 (apache helicopters) heading in the direction of the ufo&#39;s. The apache,s were very high in the sky and moving in very high rate of speed. the ufo&#39;s suddenly dissappeared out of the sky without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/15/05 19:00|Port Dover (Canada)|ON|Cylinder|1 minute approx.|Large, bright, metallic, capsule-shaped object disappeared slowly into mysterious cloud or slit in the sky.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49606.html|206|ndxe200507| Large, bright, metallic, capsule-shaped object disappeared slowly into mysterious cloud or slit in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just learned about this UFO Reporting Center today after listening to the Coast to Coast radio program. Unfortunately I did not write the event down on my calendar, but in early September of 2005, my husband and I were sitting on our deck, about 7 pm in the evening, watching birds in our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw a small airplane flying quickly, but fairly low across the sky, from right to left (south-east to south-west), with it&#39;s lights flickering. The sun was behind us and shone directly on the plane. Immediately above the plane (a few miles higher up in the sky) was a very large, capsule-shaped object moving very, very slowly...if at all. The sun was reflecting directly off of it making it shine a very bright gold metallic color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the capsule out to my husband... who does not believe there are UFO&#39;s...and will only admit to seeing a &#39;light&#39; in the sky.  He did not pay much attention to it, but I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear which made the next part strange to me.  The capsule appeared to move slowly  behind a cloud or a cloud slowly covered the capsule and eventually the capsule disappeared.  The cloud&#39;s shape was not defined in any way, except the edge that slowly enveloped the capsule. Because the &#39;cloud&#39; had no definition or color the capsule could have been going into a slit in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the huge capsule was slowly disappearing, the small plane continued to move quickly across the sky under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do not know what it was, but it is seared into my memory!<n>

The object to the far right in the picture showed first. The brightness of it is what got my attention. That spot appeared followed by two more bright white objects in rapid succession. Grabbed my camera and took 4 shots. The sequence of events was from right to left. That was it at the time; they seemed to be dissipating so I drove on. A few days later I downloaded the picture and found when I blew up the 1st two pictures it appears to be fire in the sky with a diamond shape object (the first one to appear) in the cloud to the right and the smaller object (last object) disappearing to the left. The last two shots when blown-up look like smoke rings where in the shots just seconds before appeared fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Well anyways, i looked towards the South in the sky, and saw 2, what i thought to be stars. Except they were bobbling way to much, and were far too close to be stars. The white circles spun in small circles while bobbling, and got real close to each toehr, almost touching, and then backing to their original position. I have no clue what this was, but it gave me goosebumps, and it was very strange. I continually look into the sky all the time now, for UFOs<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I came across it while putting my photos into my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the picture in Alberta Canada about 2005 I will try to describe it for you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a brown and white rectangular above a white V shaped cloud, there are two objects that look like meteorites, both have extended trails, one is traveling from left to right and the other from right to left they are quite far off in the distance and are hard to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I believe to be a UFO caught my attention because it looked like it was a cloud in the shape of a V and very white. It appears to not be moving because nearby clouds are not being disturbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the original picture there is a thick brown line above this cloud, but when I expanded it with the computer, the object is very visible, and this is what you see only half of the V is what looks like a cloud, but it looks like it is being produced by the UFO, the other leg of the V is a solid object. This object looks to be about 40 or 50 feet long, it is only one object but is two different colors, so I am going to describe as two units. The upper portion is brown, the height is less than ¼ of the length and the width is a bit more than ¼ the length The bottom portion is the same length and width and about half the length high. I am not able to tell the size of it because there is nothing for me to reference it to, however I am sure you have experts who are better qualified to determine it’s size. While checking this object I have noticed that there is a second object that appears to be another solid object, when blown up several times it almost looks like it is the same as the main object far off in the distance, but because the main object  has teased my imagination the second object, may just be a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably about 50 to 75 feet to that embankment from where I would have been standing and the embankment is about 5 feet high as are the bushes on the horizon. I am guessing that the top of the hill is about 30 or forty feet beyond the embankment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 73 years old and have never encountered anything like this during all those years, but I have to admit I have always been intrigued with UFOs and the stories about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have just the one photo, and I would send you a copy if you give me an Email address to send it to as that is the only way I know how to send it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This picture has tweaked my interest and I would like to have someone to check it out for me, but I don’t know how to find someone who is qualified to make judgment as to what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Kaladar Ontario and can be contacted by Email ((e-address deleted)) or phone 1 613((telephone number deleted))  Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It appeared about the size of the moon when it is overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear with a few light clouds to the northwest of us but none overhead.  They were the kind of clouds that you see at about 5000-6000 feet altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was featureless and appeared one-dimensional.  Its color was grayish.  The effect was almost like the blue sky had a hole in it with an absence of color.  The object was moving quickly and silently from directly overhead (when we first saw it) to the northwest.  As it moved away from us it appeared smaller and smaller, like it would if it was getting further away.   It traveled underneath one cloud and as it did, the trailing edge turned bright glowing red.  It then traveled above the next cloud and disappeared from our view.  When last seen it looked to be only 20 percent of it&#39;s original size, which I thought was because it was rapidly climbing and getting further away.  Taking into consideration that it was at about 5500 feet in altitude when we last saw it, it was probably at about 1000-1500 feet in altitude when we first saw it.  I can&#39;t estimate how fast it was traveling, but it was a lot faster than the jetliners which regularly fly over from the nearby international airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

At first I thought it was a heliocoptor, but as I kept glancing at it, I noticed that it was a perfect black sphere. It was maybe between 500 and 1000 feet away. I&#39;m not sure because I don&#39;t know exactly how large it was. I guessed maybe between 3 and 7 feet in diameter. It seemed to fly at a speed only slightly faster than I was driving, so I sped up a little bit to keep side-by-side with it. I couldn&#39;t hear any sound but I was in my car and there were several other cars driving around me so I can&#39;t say that it was totally silent for certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After paralleling the thing for about eight miles down the highway, I had to turn into work. I got out of my car and watched it as it slowly flew over the edge of the horizon. It never changed direction or speed, and I had a high vantage point, so I&#39;m sure that it was several miles away down the highway (perhaps 5 miles or more) when it went out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

On my way home from work as I crossed over the mountain at Thorton Gap I could see two large ball shaped objects appr. 2500 feet above the mountains. As I descended into the valley I could see them dancing in the sky above Skyline drive, moving in a North to South direction. At first the two objects appeared to be playing leap frog. After about 30 min the objects started changing colors from blue to green to yellow and then were joined by to other larger orange spheres. When the large two of the objects approached the smaller ones they all became the same color and hovered over the Big Meadows area. At about 5:30 am when the sun started to crest the mountain peaks the objects turned a pale blue and darted at a very high speed first down into the valley before charging straight up into the morning sky, they never slowed to change direction and they were faster then any vehicle I have ever seen. This is the second time I have seen this occur in 30 days, the first time I just thought I was crazy and tired. I will keep a further look out for these objects and report any more sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects looked like they were made of a cloth-like material. Each object had two firing retro rockets that were gold and each had a rectangular shaped L.E.D. screen in it near the same area.  The led&#39;s seemed to be displaying something. They looked like they were approaching Bob Hope Airport (formally Burbank Airport) The objects moved slowly and seemed to float as the sparks were emitted.  This sighting lasted ten minutes and only ended when the objects burned up in the west southwest sky.  It was a very clear evening.  I have been witness to at least two other sightings in the same area.  The last one was a rectangle shape that changed it&#39;s shape into a triangle.

The property behind my house is private, and gated so that no cars can enter.  Further, I am sure that no one should be there at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was concerned why it was there and that if it was a fire I should call for help.  After watching for about 5 minutes I realized that it had not grown larger and appeared to have both red and white lights that seemed to be flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my husband still thinking maybe it was a large electrical item of some sort.  He said he thought it was too large and also saw that it had both red and white lights.  After watching this light for about 30minutes, I got pretty scared and decided to turn off all of our house lights and check our doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After going downstairs, I realized that I could still see it from my downstairs windows and realized it was too large to be a gadget of a camper or homeless person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my two sons and a house guest tried to get a better look from my deck.  We went outside and used binoculars.  Speaking for myself I can say that what I saw seemed to have a pattern of lights.  Three very faint white lights on top, one large bright one in the center and a number of white and red ones below that that seemed to be moving and alternating colors.  The exact shape of the thing I can not say.  I could only see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband whistled out very loudly and nothing changed at all.   My house guest taped the lights with his video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, too frustrated and tired I decided to go to bed.  I went to bed at 2am.  I woke at 6am and as usual there were deer grazing in the meadow and I could see no evidence of anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, my husband and I decided to go back there to see if we could find evidence of a camper or some other explanation.   What we found was no reasonable way to explain it.  I had originally speculated that the only thing I could think of with that pattern of lights would be a tractor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area is very wet, as it is a recently drained pond and there was not only no way for a tractor to get into the area but no tracks as well.  What we did find was a large round indentation with deeper indentations within it about every foot or so and one indentation in the center.  Some of the weeds were dried and brittle (dead) and bent to one side behind where the object had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also certain now too that it was too large to be something someone could have walked into the area with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all as we witnessed the lights and the bugs, frogs and whatnots were all as usual.  I can say for sure that I will be watching tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not wish to be interviewed or my name identified but would like to know if anything like this has been reported previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed quite sincere and credible to us.  We have urged her to obtain photos of the indentation, and to have the other two witnesses submit reports, too.  We hope to obtain a copy of the video.  PD))<n>

I was watching watching T.V. at the time. My husband was out of town and I was alone in the house. At first I thought the cats were in the house and were playing and running around.  But then I looked outside and they were on the porch sleeping.  Then I heard loud thumping sounds coming from my bedroom overhead, like someone was walking in heavy boots and making noise on purpose.  A few seconds later, I heard the side patio door open and close twice. I turned off the T.V. and went to investigate and when I did I noticed a low-level mechanical humming sound that seemed to have no source. The side door was locked from the inside, so no one could have opened it, yet I clearly heard the door open. I decided to double check the doors and go to bed and listen to Coast to Coast AM to hear Peter Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While lying in bed I looked up at the skylight and noticed that it was completely black outside.  There was no rain that night, and even with clouds you can always see some light from the street light across the street.  I remember thinking that was odd.  I was listening intently as Peter came on and was talking about the recent sighting in Idaho on July 8.  I remember looking at the clock at approximately 12:45 AM. I don&#39;t remember going to sleep, but the next thing I knew the radio was on very loud and the clock said 1:30 PM, and I had missed hearing the witnesses talk about their experience. I don&#39;t have an explanation as to how the radio got so loud. I turned the radio off, then looked up and saw that the skylight was not black anymore, and had the familiar bluish glow from the streetlight again. The low humming sound was also gone. I have no idea what happened.  I believe that I had a missing time experience, and that something or someone did not want me to hear the radio, but also wanted to get my attention. They did. Was this an abduction or a visitation? I may need to be hypnotized to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Blinked my eyes to have a better look.   When I refocused I saw an unusual object / objects. It was hard to determine if just one object or more then one because of the glow of lights on it/them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t give you a size because I&#34;m not sure if it was more then one object or just one. There were three lights, in the shape of a triangle/chevron two bottom lights then one top light..in the direction of travel. The shape didn&#39;t appear to be all straight lines, it appeared shadowed in and curved a little on the inside like a chevron. It was a fuzzy outline and it&#39;s overcast tonight so I really couldn&#39;t make out if this was one object or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not blinking like aircraft lights do just illuminated, it wasn&#39;t a search light, spot light or other regular type lighting,there was NO engine/motor sound, no propeller sound, no NOTHING!  At first while I was watching it seemed to be moving at a fast pace like a streak above me which caught my eye...I thought at first it was a shooting star. This craft/crafts, then slowed down almost to a crawl but still moving (slower then the speed you would see a satellite move in the night sky) Then it stopped but not abruptly, very gently and went the left (south towards the lake) then back to where it started from in the same line (east to west), then to the right (north)  It came back to the original spot and began again travelling westward, towards the downtown or main core of Toronto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, I noticed the speed was not consistent, very irradic like fast then slow but never jerky, very smooth but odd speeds. The speed seemed to move steadily after it did that little left right (north south) thing and began it&#39;s way west again.  Eventually it was out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remained outside for awhile looking again and I know I will go back out again and look more.  There was a small engine aircraft and a jet around the same time and area, one travelling east the other south west (Towards Toronto Island Airport)  I&#39;ve seen something almost identical to this with my father , in this same yard on this same patio and same time of year..roughly 22 years ago..I was just a young girl then.  THE ONLY difference, it was travelling from west to east and a bit lower in the sky. At that time there were (3) of them. I remember they were glowing and as I recall they looked perhaps with a green glow but not a dark or deep green rather a pale green , soft green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the other things, the chevron shaped crafts...they look like the formation of how birds fly in a V but upside down..the point is the direction it travels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Just found this website and I&#34;m just so very excited to provide this information and see what others have seen and read their stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t want to over run you with information but I have an additional situation which happened to me in this very house around 1am in the morning, winter time about 5 yrs ago. A beam of light entered my front room window where I was watching tv and relaxing with my mother. We both saw it. It filled our room with the brightest yet softest light that didnt&#39; hurt or harm our eyes. I could see the light originated from the sky but it ONLY focused on our front room. The light did NOT cascade to the other rooms in the house nor did it cascade around the lawn/trees/shrubs or even the driveway or road. It was localized in this house.  I got up to look at it and stared out the window to the direction of which it came. The only thing I could see was this soft but bright glowing light in the sky hovering low, just above the treeline and across the street from us, over a park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch, opened the window all the way then went and stood by the front door opening it to hear if there was any noise NO NOISE no engine no propeller no nothing DEAD SILENT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was eerie but it didn&#39;t scare me.  I wondered what it wanted why just us just our home just here?  After a short while the light immediately faded and the craft streaked across the sky heading in a north east direction. I saw a streak, like a glowing streak behind it for a few seconds then that vanished and it was gone. That was one of the most amazing things I&#39;d ever been witness to.  If it makes any difference, since that time I&#39;d become quite ill. I always thought that that light and craft had something to do with it....but then again it could just be coincidental.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very interested in knowing if there are any other reports and being an avid sky watcher and having seen things like this before I KNOW they are real!!  I am very interested especially because it was the same flight pattern directly above my patio as it was when I was  a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a bright white light, it was going in a straight line and then it jagged over to the left and went straight again then you can tell it was headed out into outerspace because the light faded and then dissappeared all the while it stayed straight. You have to look straight up to see it. There were no sounds from an aircraft. It was not a shooting star. It looked just like a normal star but it was moving. There was only one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The beams were moving in all directions scanning the earth. What made me rule out that they were not helicoptors was that they were extremely high yet I was amazed at the powerful beam of the light to shine dowm from that far of a distance.  I remember it freightened me so I moved behind a shed thinking I was out of the vision of the beams if it made it to my direction.  After viewing the beams for a few minutes a small airplane flew over to the direction of the lights and when it lined up between me and the lights the lights seemed to just go &#34;puff&#34; and vanished away leaving only clouds of smoke where each beam of light had previously been. I stood in awe and a bit dumb struck at the same time trying to figure out how to evaluate what I&#39;d just seen. Oh, how I wished someone had been with me to observe this sight!<n>

Have had many sightings since that date. Have recorded all kinds of overflights by MANY different shaped ships including photos. This observation occured just past 10:00pm last Thursday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a sensitive I have always been able to &#39;feel&#39; the approach of these anti-grav ships quite some distance from my house. This has always allowed me plenty of time to get my camera. But this time I did not have my cam available because its  a 35mm Cannon which is in the shop for calibration and cleaning. So no picks of this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But here&#39;s the sighting info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt the approach of the &#34;anti-grav&#34; engines OR the presence of a non earthly occupant coming my way. I readied myself on my front second floor deck and sure enough.....the ship appeared from out of a clear dark sky entering our dimension or space above the mountain north of my house. My first observation was of the ship, which was approaching my direction slowly just above the hilltop, but far far below the regular airliners altitude. I would guess at approx. 9,000 ft. I said aloud:&#34;Greetings!&#34; and at that moment the sphere turned a deep orange glow and proceeded towards my direction then as it was almost over my house it turned to a south-east heading still remaining orange. It passed over the June Mountain Ski Lift chalet...then on behind the mountain. Gone from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 12 mins later 5 F-18&#39;s most likely from Fallon Air Base came in over my area fast and furious. They had afterburners running which made a deeper than usual jet engine roar, the sound of which fills our small canyon with a very loud sound. These guys were really moving rightin the same direction of the orange sphere. They were 12 mins behind this sphere which tells me the AirForce is getting their look-down sat radar working pretty tight nowadays. I have also noticed 2-3 Airborne Command Centers moving thru this area very slowly like looking for something. These airborne c.cntrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> were in the area alot about 2 weeks ago. Now they are gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have many recorded sightings from over the years, and additionally sighting and confrontations with these ships and beings from during my earlier years growing up in Europe where I was educated till 20 yrs of age. These include on the ground observations of blue globes in the forest in Fountainbleu, FR in 1954, saucers over Lake Geneva in 1964 next to our school, over the vineyards, near Lausanne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And many many more.............<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You<n>

I havent seen &#34;chemtrails&#34; around for two months here but that afternoon there were a few over the mountains and thats why I had them on my mind. The glimmer was coming from what looked like a very bright orange, yellowish, golden sphere, that was very reflective and appeared to be changing colors. This thing was still for about 3 minutes and then slowly started drifting up and to the NE direction until it just disappeared into the sky. This isnt the first time I&#39;ve seen UFO&#39;s over the Santa Barbara mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pulled off the Fort Road (near Robbins Rd.), to show my grandchildren Mt. Adams (Washington State), it was a relatively clear day 95 degrees with only one big white cloud just to the south of Mt. Adams. As we were watching Mt. Adams, there was an in and out reflection of three metallic units. You could look right into the clouds most of the time, and not see these objects, until they moved (or tilted back toward the sun) then they were visiable again. These units were a silver metallic color. There shape was like a giant satelite dish as big as a house with both sides of the dish rectangle (both sides of unit were squared off) the round parts were the top and bottom of the units and slightly bent back. The two outside units were the same height, and the one in the middle was downward about one third in elevation from the other two as it sat in between the other two. It was 6:22 PM and we were looking into the sun as the units were appearing in and out of the clouds. It had the appearence to me as if they were using the clouds as cover to hide? David and I (John) seen these three units as seperate units hovering in the clouds, however, Dusty, my 11-year old Grandaughter seen them as beening connected. These units were about 100 feet apart from each other, and about 3 to 5 miles in elevation above the earth. I also want to mention that there was not any lights,or beams,or fire coming from these units. We were camping on the Yakima Indian Reservation, at an RV Park, with Mt. Adams, and the Cascade Mtn. range about 40 miles to are west, Yakima, Wa. 20 miles to are north, Tri Cities, Wa. 55 miles to are south, and over the ridge behind us to our east about 25 miles is the Hanford Necuelar Site, so if your fimilar with the area you have the lay of the land.I&#39;m reporting this 3 day&#39;s aftering seeing units. I was on vacation away from everything! Seen units early Thursday PM reported units Sunday PM. John<n>

I was awoken by them so i looked out my window into my back yard and saw a pulsing light. The light was pulsing and seemed to grow when it pulsed then would go back to its origional shape.. I wasnt sure what i was looking at so i went to the sliding dorr beside my bedroom to get a better look...as soon as i opened the door the light was gone, not knowing what to think and with a weird chill running thought my body i closed the door and locked it.. I went back to my room and weird noises continued and the light started up again.. As soon as i layed in my bed i felt a weird feeling come over me then i was instantly sleeping.. when i awoke i had the same feeling and now my bedding was completly flipped upside down and tucked in as if someone came in and arranged my room...then i went out side to check what the light was in the morning and there was no sign<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was aprox. 4-5 ft. circumference and about four feet thick. I pulled off the road and into a subdivision to get a better look and saw that it was directly above a house, perhaps fifteen feet from the roof (the house was aprox. thirty feet high). In what I suppose was the front of the craft were two lights and in the back was one longer strip of lights, both changing colors in synch with each other. The craft was completely silent and slightly swayed from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Furthermore, another car drove past on the same road that I had been driving on, and as it drove up the hill its head lights reflected off of the UFO revealing metal panels. The car slowed down, but did not stop. I was too scared at the time to contact the house owners and instead drove to get my girlfriend to see what she could make out of the situation. However, when I returned with her, it was gone. I should also note that I was about 60 minutes from any airpot or military station.<n>

We drove out on HWY 105 away from the city lights and pulled over to the side of the road and found a place to kick back and relaxe near some train tracks. We were looking in the sky towards the constellation Lyra when it appeared as though a star appeared out of nothing, then a second later it disapeared, then a second later appeared and disapeared. Then closer to Cygnus the same type of event occured about half a minute later except that it only flashed once. Then in the constellation of Cygnus about a minute later the same type of phenomena occured again except this time it flashed as such 10-12 times. About an hour later near the constellation of Ursa Major the same event occured again with 2 flashes. We stayed out there about another hour and saw no more activity...it was getting close to 3am and I wanted to go home and go to sleep. I have been researching and studying Irridium Flares for two weeks, what we saw was not an irridium flare. Sattelites move. These things flashed in the same exact spot. These could not have been airplanes, helicopters, balloons, meteors or shooting stars. I have been looking on the internet for anyone who have reported seeing anything like this and all I can find about similar events is on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena sights. I can not call these UFOs because although they were unidentified but not flying or necessarily objects. I will add here that this is not the first time we saw this phenomena at Palmer Lake...on July 6th close to 2am we saw the same type of phenomena also from the Palmer Lake area. The UAP we witnessed on July 6th was reported to coMUFON (colorado mufon) but I have not heard back from them. Something odd is afoot the night skies above Palmer Lake CO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking at the night sky when the 3 crafts popped up from a distance of 45-60ft. even with the tree line,we noticed the ships moving slowly and quietly over our apartment. While I cannot accurately describe the distance 2 craft moved towards us, the 3rd disappeared. I was able to observe the intricate detail under the ship. Lines that had ever so faint outline of what i presupposed was lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lines were cut very deep into the craft as if landing gear might exist inside the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kathy began to feel as if something was moving around her and she froze, I on the other hand noticed the night air was filled with heat normally reserved for the afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this time the 3rd craft appeared and kid you not i felt like the 2 crafts might have been kids and the 3rd was the parent because when the 3rd craft appeared, the other 2 craft moved away from us and move further up into the night sky and towards the 3rd craft, the 2 craft disappeared as if someone enabled a on/off switch, the 3rd craft stayed motionless and silent except for the quietest buzz or hum almost underneath my skin...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Reappeared later, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening around midnight I was floating around on a raft in my pool, just staring into the sky. While I was stargazing afloat, I was trying to remember constellations, and looking to see if any planets were visible, which is something I haven&#39;t done for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 12:15 I noticed a &#39;&#39;star&#39;&#39; I thought was different. At first glance I thought there was a good chance it was Venus. I have no idea what planets are visible right now. I began looking at other stars, but I always came back to check on the &#34;planet-star&#34;. Until about 12:20, after looking around the sky, I turned my head back to check on the &#34;planet star&#34; and no more than 2 seconds after I got it back in my sight, it shot off in a direct angle downward, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This immediately made me jump up, and lose my raft. After looking around in desperation to find where it had gone, and also to make sure I was just seeing things, I saw a light in a spot in the sky where I hadn&#39;t remembered seeing one. It was the exact same size and brightness, and color (white light gleaming with a slight green). When I got out of the pool to look at it, it was gone and I could not see it at all in the sky. I live in western Florida, and was facing the northwestern sky when I had this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness intended to state that the sighting occurred Thursday morning, July 14.

They we&#39;re flying around i don&#39;t really think they had a pattern to them butit was sort of like they were just flying in circles around my crops.  Then the object made a sound.  It had a strange resemblance to a deisel engine.  This went on for exactly 32 minutes when the ships finally passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was over De Soto Missouri on 7/13/2005 around 9:55 PM.  Two pinpoints of lights beneath a mostly cloudy night sky.  Several stars were visible.  The lights seemed to be below or just beneath the clouds, yet they appeared to be somewhat the same size pinpoints of light as the other stars visible in the sky.  I would guess around 20,000 feet.  When I first noticed the lights, they were engaging in a high speed circular chase.  The circle was proportional to a small diameter circle about the size of a quarter held at arms length.  They were moving at about 180 revolutions per minute for approximately 1 or 2 seconds before they split and went in the exact opposite directions.  I believe, near South and near North.  The Southerly light appeared to move away from the circle slower than the Northerly light.  Both lights never did disappear from my view for at least 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Furthermore, we noticed that the area around the object appeared to have a &#34;halo&#34; due to the fact that it was a darker blue color than compared to the clear blue sky behind it. This &#34;halo&#34; appeared fuzzy and did not seem to have definite edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the traffic barely moving along we were able to observe the object for around 10 mins as we slowly moved north towards downtown Seattle.  Also, since we weren&#39;t moving we were able to compare its size to the half moon that was also in that hemisphere of the sky.  Its size relative to the half moon was about 1/5 - 1/7 of the moon.  In relation to the moon it was north of it and higher towards the sky zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we compared it to fixed objects in our field of view it became obvious that it wasn&#39;t moving in relation to us. We lost sight of it when we entered the tunnels and express lanes of downtown Seattle. We saw it again when we were north of the Northgate Mall and just south of the King county line. It seemed to be in the same location in the sky relative to the horizon and moon as before. This time we only observed it for a couple of seconds before it seemed to &#34;vanish&#34; from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the car we had 3 people (including the driver) of which two of us saw the object. All of us in the car have aerospace engineering backgrounds and have significant experience in identifying flying vehicles and their systems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us who observed the object concluded that we had never observed such an object before. We were quite surprised at how it was able to hold station so precisely and the fact that it appeared to have no aerodynamic lifting surfaces to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I spoke with this witness at length, and I found him to be eloquent and quite sincere.

There were no streaks in the sky, no trail left behind.  It all seemed to occur in one small spot, miles up in the sky. Family members immediately attributed the flash to the work of our deceased relative.  Though a meteor might explain the bright flash, the fact that flash occurred in only one small spot in the sky casts some doubt, as does the enormous intensity of the flash of light.  And, that doubt is what makes this flash of light &#34;unidentified&#34;.  I did not see the sky myself, but I did see the flash of light reflected on the ground and buildings, similar to a lightning strike, brighter than the sunlight which was bright that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that the elderly relative whose funeral was in progress, was a witness to at least 2 UFO sightings, one in the 1970&#39;s and one mass sighting in the mid 80&#39;s, both of which she forever refused to talk about, taking the accounts of those sightings to her grave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It appeared to be at the altitude of a commercial airliner, moving somewhat slower than a commercial jet. If it was at the cruising altitude of an airliner it would have been at least one and a half their size. The thing seemed to yaw slightly as it moved from the northwest to the southeast.

7/13/05 00:30|Mora|MN|Cigar|3 minutes|I have seen a UFO from 100 yards away.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68796.html|251|ndxe200507| I have seen a UFO from 100 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In July of 2005 I was living at my parent’s house in Mora, MN. I was in their sunroom that has two windows to the south and five windows to the west. Their backyard backs up to some thick woods. To the south the tree line continues for at least a mile or so. I was in the sunroom watching TV, facing the west wall. Suddenly for no reason at all I turned my head to the south. Just above the tree line, no more than 100 yards from the house there was a large cigar shaped disk hovering above the tree line. I looked as though it had just come out of the woods but that was ridiculous because there was no clearing that it would have fit into that I knew of. And I know those woods pretty well. This object was about two to three minivans in length. It was a silver color with red lights revolving around the middle. It had a disk shape with a dome top. It stopped and teetered for a moment. Then it just zoomed (for lack of a better word) off into the sky. I mean it was just gone in an instant. It was July and the windows were open because my parents are too cheap to run the AC at night. There was a low hum coming from the machine and that could have been why I turned my head to the south. Although there was a hum, the trees sat perfectly still.  I was so scared I ran to all the windows and shut them. I then went upstairs and ran around to all the windows upstairs and closed and locked them. It was hot and humid but I didn’t care. I have never been so scared in my whole life. I moved in with my fiancé two weeks later, but up until then every night I locked my window and my door at night. I haven’t seen anything since then, however recently my brother and his friend watched a bright, non-blinking light move in the sky following the Snake River. At one point it stopped several times and made a 90 degree turn. My dad who is a non-believer also witnessed this from the front of his house two miles away. As an experienced pilot he knows that no planes, helicopters, or satellite moves the way this object did.! I don’t know why we have seen all of these things, but I am sure there are others in Mora that have witnessed strange activity in the sky as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this now as I saw a “stock” photo of a UFO online today and I instantly burst into tears. I feel like a crime victim that is finally ready to confront the experience after years of holding it in. The only people I have told about this has been a few family members and my now-husband. I am not looking for “fame and fortune”, I just want people to know that there is something out there and I have seen it up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I could still see an outline of the craft and the two light were still part of the craft. It hovered above there for 1 minute before something very unusual happened. It shoot down 4 shooting starlike objects down towards the community. They gave off no light except the objects themselves and the tiny shooting star like trail behind them. Then it looked like they shot back towards the craft then back down and repeated.

As I looked further north, there was a flash not once, but a few more times. Formation was heading south from me. Later I lokked to the north, approx. 1 to 2 hours later, and saw the flashes again.

We normaly stay in a hotel in Amsterdam, traveling to places like Haarlem and Beverwijk. This year we decided for a change seeing as we had gone to Amsterdam for the last 3 summers. We went to a place called Den Helder on the Northern tip of Holland. The place was beatiful, we enjoyed the first 2 days of the Holiday greatly. On the 3rd night at about 8:30 we settled down to a lovely specialised Dutch dinner at the wonderful De Yperhof Restaraunt. We spent the night eating and reflecting on the past few days. At around 9:30pm we got ready to leave, we left the building out the front entrance. As soon as we left the restaraunt there was a bright white streak of what looked like flour fill the sky. It was amazing, at first we thought it must be some type of odd dutch firework, but after a minute it started to fade like rising fog. Behind             this &#39;powder&#39; we could see a few little blue diamond/kite shaped crafts wizzing round and round. I didn&#39;t get too good a look through the white streak which went off onto the horizon. I could make out a white light on the tip of the diamond but when i reached for my glasses to get a closer look they had vanished. It was a thrilling experience and one i am likely never to forget. It really shookme and will change my view on alien inteligence for ever. I&#39;m not sure who saw it apart from me and my wife, if you did see something like this that night then be assured your werent seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I went to edit the video at home, I realized, when I fell, there was something that flew behind me in the sky.  After slowing the video down atthe section, I realized the object flies behind a tree, uturns, and flies exccedingly fast untill its out of view of the camera.  Its not a bug because the tree it flies behind is at least 400 yards away and a bug wouldnt be visisble.  ITs not a plane because there is no way it would be able to manuever like this object did.  Therefore it can obly be one thing; a ufo.  I&#39;ve showed my friend and there baffled by the footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This line was not straight, but organic in movement, 3 of the rear lights drifted off a little and one of the first ones drifted as well. Initially I thought it was geese, but it was 2:15am, and they &#39;were&#39; lit up, although faintly, and they were a long distance away - moving like a satellite, except for the &#39;organic-ness&#39;. They faded fairly quickly as the transparency of the sky wasn&#39;t crystal clear. I&#39;m into astronomy, so this was one of the stranger things I&#39;ve seen - and I&#39;ve seen the NOS satellites - the 3 that fly in a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was walking my dog and sometimes like to look at the sky. I was facing southwest as I looked up and to my left at the tea cup part of the Sagitarius constelation which was about 35 degrees high in the sky. I looked down at the dog and then looked up again. This time I looked up near zenith facing southwest. I did not see a craft. I saw some type of strange light effect. I will be able to describe it very clearly but it will take a lot of words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Imagine how this would look in the sky: If you had a plastic zip-loc sandwich bag and you were looking down on the opening as the bag hung vertically, you would only see a thin line of transparent plastic. This is what I saw in the sky. If I held up my hand at arms length and spread my thumb and little finger as far appart as possible it would seem to be about that width. It was translucent white. I could see stars through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this thing apear while looking up at the sky. It was a straight line then the thing got wider in the middle, the same way a plastic bag would look if you started opening it from the middle. Inside of the widening thing it still had a whiteness to it but it was easier to see through the middle than the edges. Inside it there was a line from end to end but it wasn&#39;t straight. It curved a little toward the top line of the light. The line was as thick as the other edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were looking southwest and then tilted my head up this light in the sky was side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what happened and it happened faster than you can read this. I looked up, the long horizontal light then started appearing like someone at a TV station sliding in an effect. It got wider in the middle, reached its maximum brightness (a little brighter than a cloud passing over a city at night) then started fading away to nothing as it started closing and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess I should mention how wide it seemed to open. Looking at the overall length and then comparing the opening to the length of the whole thing I would say it got about one tenth as wide as the whole length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was see-through the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it I remembered to look at my watch and also the position of the stars. At first it seemed to show up almost diagonally in what reminded me of the great square of Pegasus. Five minutes later I looked up again and I couldn&#39;t find that group of stars. I found this very odd that I couldn&#39;t locate that pattern again. Did the sky change on me? It is the weirdest thing. Perhaps something is up in the sky creating some type of camoflage that resembles stars, just the wrong pattern. That would change the pattern in the sky. I don&#39;t have a star chart to do a check. Years ago I had an interest in astronomy and I have some experience with the sky but I am just a very rank amature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC you may contact me if you need more details.)<n>

It was summer and it was pretty hot outside considering it was a little before or after midnight. My house is in a populated suburban area on the end of the neighborhood, making it on the road. Diagonal, but in plain view from my porch, is an orchard. Its one of those random things where houses were just built around. We were eating popcicles looking over there and all the sudden I was overcome with emotion as I saw a glowing white, tripod like figure raise out of the orchard. I knew my friend was looking at it to because she was silent. If you have seen Zenon, the Disney movie, the &#34;aliens&#34; in that movie is what resembled what we saw. The only difference was it was brighter and a little smaller. It proceeded to rise about 12 feet and hover for 3 or 4 seconds. It than began to spin rapidly, turn in to a ball/disk thing and stop. It was so surreal and strange because it looked like those fake ones in movies. A circle with blinking red and blue lights on the side. It kept changing color for about 7 or 8 seconds, shot down a yellow beam of light, sucked it back up, than zoomed across my neighborhood and out of sight. It moved faster than ANYTHING in the air I have ever seen move. When it was behind the trees we heard an almost explosion and ran in the house. We both swear to this story and can each give you the exact same story. It is very strange but, when we talk about it, we get kind of emotional. I never believed in these things but now, i KNOW they are real. I know what we saw and it was real. I still to this day get funny when I see anything moving in the sky at a fast speed. To witness something like that changes the way you look at things completely and forever!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It appeared to be from some specimen of machinery.<n>

Then, about 5 minutes later, my girlfriend tells me to look up and asks me if I can see what she&#39;s seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t at first, but she uses a flashlight and points right at it.  It looked EXACTLY like two stars, very far apart, moving in tandem slowly and methodically across the sky.  We watched this thing for close to 2 minutes before it literally vanished - not over the horizon or out of our field of vision. It just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing had to have been huge.  It would not be exagerrating to estimate at least 400 feet in length. One light at the front, one at the back. No pulsing, no flashing. Totally and completely silent and very high up, or at least it was disguised to look as if it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If we hadn&#39;t been scanning the sky, we never would have seen it.  It looked EXACTLY like two big and bright stars, very far apart only moving together through the sky, obvious to anyone who saw it that they were part of one enormous craft of some kind. It really looked as if it was using some sort of cloaking device or disguise - I knwo that sounds crazy, but you had to see it - it was obviously trying NOT to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a soldier in the bush wears camouflage and greasepaint to blend in with the jungle... that&#39;s what it made me think of. I&#39;ve seen quite a few UFO&#39;s and such in my life, but this was without a doubt one of the most indisputable sightings I&#39;ve ever had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No question that it was up there. No question that it was NOT an airplane, a weather balloon, a meteor, shooting star, bird or swamp gas. And no question that it was gigantic, silent and on a controlled course. Totally amazing.<n>

At approximately 4:30 in the afternoon I looked to my left (north) and noticed an object that looked like a box that was turned on its corner and was rotating at a fast speed on that corner. It changed colors as the sun glistened off of its surface. I estimate that the object was half a mile away. It looked to be about one hundred feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought the object might be a balloon or a kite but the prevailing winds were from the west and the object was moving west. As the object moved to the west it remained level in flight and it neither rose or lowered in elevation.  I watched the object for about three minutes and decided to go inside to get my binoculars. When I had returned to the patio the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I,only me, then heard a voice say &#39; your friend makes us uneasy&#39;&#39;. I asked him if he heard it , he said no, then i heard rustling in the field. the voice repeated. then i became sick and threw up instantly. after releiving my stomach of its contents, i turned around and realized i was about 100 yards from his car. from what i remember i only took at the most 5 steps from the car. How did i get so far away from the car? i cant even comprehend how i got that far away. At this point i knew any further contact was not going to happen because of the presence of my friend. i went home and tried to draw the object, it took several tries, until one made me sick to my stomach and throw up again. i still cannot look at the drawing or anything similiar without getting sick. since electronic devices i have seem to be malfunctioning all the time, one in mind, thats very annoying , my smoke detector, yes i checked the battery, replaced, checked again, but still it goes off with sets of beeps primarily 3 sets of 3 beeps , then 2 sets of 3 and 1 of 2. My tv changes channel by itself ,volume as well. i have talked to a neighbor i hadnt met and he said his tv was actually moving physically, by itself. he said he had marked it and tested it several times,and it still moves. his smoke alarm goes off now too. I can feel when the ship is close , its here every night, just off to the west every evening and night moves , flickers its lights and then disappears instantly. when i saw it the second time from a distance i felt a little sick, but not as bad, i then asked it aloud &#34;please blink twice, for me, just to prove im not crazy or paranoid. i got what i asked for and seemed to engage in a conversation with someone not there.   i have advice for all,  MONITOR YOUR SURROUNDIGS,AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, KEEP AN OPEN MIND. until recent month i have not noticed anything but once you notice, you notice alot of wierd shit happening, everywhere, at all times,. THIS IS REAL. THE PUBLIC WILL EVENTUALLY KNOW, IT CANNOT BE STOPPED. OPEN YOUR FUCKING EYES EVERYONE. OPEN YOUR EYES PLEASE. FOR YOURSELF. i cannot stop the chain of events or the weird shit happening , but i can accept it and not be afraid anymore. no more fear, no more wars,....my ideas,and experiences are the only pure things now, i am at peace for the first time in my miserable 27 years of life , im not scared anymore,. WHY ME? i dont know. if you dont believe in the story , its your agenda, i cant change that. but you will see it like i do whether you want to or not , eventually,..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We first thought it may have been a blimp but the more we watched this object move we knew it was not. This object moved slow at times then fast with sudden stops and would hover for a few seconds then move out of sight then back again. The object was for the most part dark but it was a clear night and we could see the object clearly against the night sky. I would say that it was no more than 500 yards away during the time we saw it. It most surely had a metalic look to it but not very shiney. We watched this for a good two minutes or so and as fast as it came it was gone. The object to me looked to be more of a tube shape like a paper towel roll. This left both of us speachless for several minutes. We live in a small city but at that time of night there were few people out. We were in a well lit parking area and our front yard at the time of the sighting. My friend who was visiting from out of state also witnessed this but for only a few seconds as he arrived at our apartment after we did. He was awstruck with the object and had many questions but we were just as puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object never made a noise.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45046.html|276|ndxe200507| It was at 2:30 a.m. while I was watering my father&amp;#8217;s garden because he was on vacation.  The area is a bit desolent and quiet with the usual frogs and crickets making the only noise at night.  While watering the garden I looked at the stars and noticed what seemed to be a satellite going in the southern direction in a straight line and a good rate of speed.  At the time I noticed this object it became quiet any eerie.  All I heard was the wind.  The object never made a noise.  It flew on for about 2 minutes almost seeming to go up, not out in distance.  Then it sparatically went into a zigzag pattern while flying in a circle at the same rate of speed.  The object never blinked once through the whole encounter.  I became so chilled I ran down to the house, turned all the lights off, locked up and jumped in my car to head home.  For the first mile or so it is a dirt road with potholes.  While driving down this road slowly, I noticed as if the object had started to follow me.  As soon as I hit the pavement I hit the gas.  For the next 10 minutes or so the object got closer and brighter.  At one point my radio volume turned way up for no reason at all.  After that, I stopped trying to keep location of it and floored it all the way home which is about 40 minutes more but only took me about 30 minutes.  After reaching my home, I spent about 20 minutes trying to locate the object which was gone.  The object when I first saw it was about the size of a pinhead if the pin is held at arms reach away. When I last looked at it when it was following me was about the size of a marble about arms reach away that was a little hazy on one side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were watching the object started moving almost imperceptibly to the West, was able to notice it passing other stars. After a little wobble movement it split into two. The Western object winked out shortly afterwards...the Eastern object moved East at first and then reversed corse and started moving a bit faster in a western direction. After a short time the second object winked out as well. Both objects were of a bright ruby red color that had dimmed once or twice and then pulsated to a bright glow once again. The duration of the event was approximately 4 minutes, although I&#39;m not sure how long it was observable before we came out of the house.

After the phone call my Wife, 8yr old son, mother-in-law,Father-in-law,and his grand daughter, all went out on the patio to look. My Wife Immediately called me after deciding that it was not a plane or a star. I was at Our residence waiting for her to come home when I recieved the call. We live aprox. 2 miles east of my mother-in-laws.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up into the sky looking for what my wife was franticly describing to me, I found it immediately to the east of my location. My Nephew, His wife their two little kids, and My 12yr. old daughter all seen this Bright red glowing object that from my location looked to be a little bit larger than a star but much much more brighter, and it was very very red, about the same intensity that a red becon on a radio tower is but it stayed glowing bright red for about 10 min. and did not move. from my wifes vantage point she said it was &#34;f&#39;n huge&#34; she said it was as big as my Chevy Blazer. and also said it was directly over the house. My Father in law also said it was very large, when I asked him if he held it out at arms length how big would it have been? he said about the size of a softball! They wathed it for about 10-15 min. when it started moving off to the west picking up speed as it got farther away. mean while I wathed it from my vantage point and watched it for 10-15 min. and then it slowly moved south, then it blinked a few times, got real dim, then it got real bright again and headed in a westerly direction at a very fast rate of speed till I lost it behind some trees obstructing my view. Mean while the cousin who first spotted the object had arrived home and was out watching it also. His observation was pretty much the same as mine except when it started to head off in the Westerly direction he observed it split into two peices. Which kind of makes sence to me because his street runs east to west and he would not have any trees obstructing his view. Incidently, Brookpark,Ohio borders Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. and My mother-in-law lives less than a mile and a half from the airport. The flight path of this thing would have been within a half mile of the airport. The next day one of the news statons reported the UFO along with a pixelated still photograph. and a report from some local astronomer that what everybody saw was actually the suns reflection off of the international space station. Bull Crap! This thing hovered, moved left to right and then off into the distance. And I know for a fact the Brookpark police were bombarded with phone calls on this thing and they had no idea what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My sister and I were in our back yard looking at the stars and one object caught our attention.  It was bright red and seemed stationary.  I actually thought it was Mars at first and so did she but it was too big to be so and as we soon found out it moved too fast as well.  I should note that three of us saw the object at first but my other sister went inside so she did not actually witness it move away as it eventually did, to our surprise, at about 11:40 PM.  When we first noticed it, which didn&#39;t take long, it was positioned about NNW.  I estimate at about 25-30 degrees in the sky, 90 degrees being looking straight up into the sky between the East and West horizons.  It moved up into the sky seemingly orbiting at first.  Like I have stated it came off as Mars at first but too big.  We were alarmed to actually see it move before our very eyes, again too fast for a planet or a space station which NASA proclaimed.  Maybe a sattelite but no because sattelites don&#39;t move up in the night sky and all of a sudden change directions within a 20 minute period of time seeming to change its mind or course.  Well again it moved up to about a 40 degree angle if you were to say east to west was 180 degrees- 90 being looking directly up in the sky.  Now here is what gets strange My sister took a flashlight that she had and turned it on and off.  At once, as if it was responding, started to blink and moved more noticeably faster but back towards the West moving slightly south as it did so and vanished over the horizon. I did not notice any dancing around, I would just like to add that Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is just a couple of miles away also to our NNW. Coincidence? This is no hoax!  Sorry if this description was too long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was at a cabin resort near Grand Rapids, MN. While walking alone from one cabin to another at about 10:30 PM on a clear night, I looked up to see, between the trees, a set of three white lights in a trangular fromation going overhead. I only got a good look at it for about 15-20 seconds. It seemed very low in the sky and was traveling fairly slowly. There was absolutely no sound associated with it and no flashing lights of any kind, nor any red lights like you would see on a normal aircraft at night. The lack of sound or flashing lights is what made it unusual. The cabin area was quiet, being in the countryside vacationers already settling in for the night. So, if there had been noise from the craft I definately would have heard it. Is there any type of normal aircraft that would behave in this way?<n>

The object was much higher than most aircraft one would typically observe in the area, and appeared almost as a moving star. The object was not moving with particular quickness. The object appeared to wobble slightly from right to left as it moved on its course. We observed the object until we could no longer see the object due to its distance. We all saw it, and the entire event lasted at the very least 5 minutes, perhaps longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interesting thing is that I - along with several of my friends - have witnessed these objects - these white balls of light - moving through the skies of Ocean County on numerous occasions. Often times, they go from dim to bright while moving and sometimes even blink out completely. Sometimes after they blink out you can swear you can still see a form moving thorugh the sky. Sometimes you dont necessarily have that feeling. Sometimes they blink out and then back on. It is very weird whatever it is. My friends and I have observed these objects moving not only south to north (the most typical route of travel) but also north to south, and in the east-west directions. We have seen even seen them several times in one night, and in multiple locations. Whatever these are, they definately are not airplanes. They can only be described as moving stars! Its very, very odd. They are usually seen between 20:00-23:00. I have seen similar accounts of white moving orbs accross the country, and even some where they blink out or on, or brighten or dim, as these do. I am glad to see I am not the only one witnessing these phenomina.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw it moving north to south, almost directly above, at approximately 80 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It was moving steadily at about the same apparent speed one would expect from a satellite, but it was brighter, about like the magnitude of one of the planets.  But as soon as I saw it, we observed 2 other similar objects in the same immediate area (within the diameter of a basketball held at arms length).  Each object was traveling steadily at the same pace but in different directions.  One to the south, one to the northeast, and one to the north.  Within seconds, each one faded out and disappeared.  I couldn&#39;t gauge their altitude, but they were way up there and silent.  Not really an astounding sighting, but unusual.

Recalled  watching the stars when I was a kid in East Springfield, PA and looked at the constellations and a few airplanes between swatting at mosquitoes. Was facing east. The sky was clear.  Off to the southeast  (about 40 degrees) I noticed  what appeared to be a plane with a strobe light taking the general flight path to Cleveland&#39;s lakefront airport. It was heading northeast.  The strobe became more impressive and it became readily apparent that it wasn&#39;t quite the same light as a normal aircraft would use partly because it suddenly grew quite bright.  The craft flew in a slightly erratic pattern slightly zig-zagging, then turned multi colored (red and blue) and disappeared.  Just like that.   Then  perhaps 20 seconds  later it reappeared  much further to the west  about 30 degrees behind my right shoulder  and  started to head east-southeast. No strobe, but it changed colors- blue and red. It flew as if it was surveying, not real fast but at a decent clip.   Then I lost isight of it in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Am an attorney, inactive registered nurse and former high school social studies and history teacher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We, at first, believed that the reports of a red light over the Brook Park, OH, area, might, in fact, be a possible hoax.

During this time I noticed a bright light coming toward us from the south and mentioned it to my wife saying to her boy that would be a neat sight to see fireworks from an airplane on this clear night. As it approached closer I noticed that it was much higher than I thought and thought this was a little strange, since we are close to airport you would see many planes run parallel to airport in the approach or  pattern for landing .But this was much higher and since I have no reference to size I am unsure of height a guess would be 30,000 -40,000 if it was airplane size. As light approached it had slowed and was about 80 degrees from horizon or almost directly above us. It stopped, drifted to right for about 5 minutes then disappeared. 2 minutes later another one appeared followed the same route but hovered above and drifted to right and left and stayed there for at least 15 minutes, but then lost this when fireworks started at around 10:00  or 10:10<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was perfectly clear, some white clouds and it was perfect daylight. There were 5-8 round balls that were trailing behind the main object. The number of balls varied at times and changed positions. The crown object appeared to be changing shape very subtely, but kept its main shape for the most part. I could see it very clearly. It seemed to be radiating heat or it seemed to bpossibly be spinning slowly. It had a &#34;pawn&#34; type structure rising out of the middle, like a pawn in a chess game. Viewed it through binoculars. It was definately not a plane, helecopter, baloon or blimp. Friends and neighbors viewed the objects.

The object was visible for approximately 40-50 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very bright silver/metallic sheen.  The &#34;color&#34; of the object was reminiscent of very highly polished stainless steel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not judge either altitude or speed, but it &#34;felt&#34; like it was very high and quite large based on the appearance of the object...which would also indicate that it was moving very quickly.  It &#34;felt&#34; like it was moving rapidly.  I realize &#34;felt&#34; is extremely subjective, but we see conventional aircraft fairly regularly, both large commercial and smaller, due to being approximately five miles from the local municipal field and also approximately 90 miles from MSP airport in Minnesota.  This object did not resemble either type of aircraft and it is normally very easy to identify the approximate altitude (very high, high, low) of those aircraft.  The object simply did not &#34;fit&#34; with what we normally see here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for the full 40 seconds or so and it initially reminded me of an early 20th century airship or Zepplin.  I have seen the Goodyear (and other) blimps on a few occasions, and this was more elongated like the airships.  It was not &#34;stubby&#34; like a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was blunt and rounded at both ends and was noticeably wider in the center...almost football shaped, but less pronounced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When smaller aircraft pass overhead, we can clearly hear their engines.  Although we cannot hear larger commercial aircraft, the shape is quite distinct, including seeing the wings quite clearly.  This object did not have clearly visible wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, it seemed to move &#34;smoothly&#34; across the sky.  Again, this is a very subjective evaluation, but the &#34;smooth&#34; poped into my head as I was watching the flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I currently work in the quality control department of a national manufacturing company.  My duties include running the test and evaluation program and all government and industry certifications of the products.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to this job, I retired from the military where I worked in an intelligence field related specifically to trained &#34;observation&#34;.

I went back outside and observed the object for 6 minutes until it disapeared. The ground wind was slight to the west as I observed my neighbors flag flying. The object stayed at approx. the same altitude, but drifed very slowly to the east, until it disapeared. It was halfway from the horizon and had the basic relative size as the average bright star or planet that night. It was brighter than anything else, and orange colored.  I had a similar sighting approx. 2 months ago at 3:45 AM, on the second Saturday of the month. I was also loading my car at the time.

My curiosity in the skies of this area has been piqued since the other day when I saw 3 black triangles in broad daylight immediately following a black helicopter acting very strange. I called my brother over to watch the satellite in case of the remote possibility it was more than that. It wasn&#39;t, and he wasn&#39;t impressed. I made a phone call, and maybe five minutes later, I saw another satellite coming from southwest, heading northeast to the same point that the first one was headed. I couldn&#39;t believe my luck --- I constantly watch the sky, constantly watch for satellites, and I&#39;m lucky if I see one every couple of weeks or months. I decided to run to the baseball field across the street in order to get a better look at the satellite, somewhere where it wouldn&#39;t be obstructed by trees. I had to stop several times along the way so as not to lose my bearings on the satellite. When I finally got there, the satellite was fading out in the distance. Immediately thereafter, another satellite came from a more westerly direction, heading in the same direction as the other two. Three satellites in under 10 minutes? Again, I couldn&#39;t believe my luck. I called my fiancee, looking for another witness so I wouldn&#39;t think I was losing my mind again in one week. I watched this &#34;satellite&#34; for about a minute when it started to band to its right --- not subtly, drastically. Then it stopped --- just stopped dead for about 30 seconds. It then started up again at an even greater speed, travelling northeast again now. At one point, it appeared as though a little flash came off of it, perhaps blue/purple like a flash of lighting at night? though relegated to the area directly beside it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was two nights ago. Last night, I spent hours with my fiancee looking at a clear sky for satellites. I did see one, moving west to east, but it disappeared before it even passed over us. This seemed a lot more normal, but I am completely uneducated as far as satellite flight paths go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On another note, my first time accessing this website was on Friday. I was more than shocked to learn of the alarming frequency at which people see black triangular &#34;craft&#34;, especially in groups of three, especially with a haze around it. My first clue was actually seeing it in person. One particular liting from Chicago has the witness mentioning that it looked like a kite, which was my first instinct, but there is no possible way these are one kite, let alone 3 --- not at these altitudes, not at these speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do satellites act like this? What is up with these black triangles? I would love to know more from whomever can supply the knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in the back seat of the car on the right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I love looking a star formations and consolations but I noticed an extremely bright star.  then i thought maybe it was a planet.  I told my friends to look at how bright this str was.  it was stationary I believe. we all kept looking to debate on whether it was a star or a planet.  I bet that it was a planet, anmd the driver of the vehicle thought it was an airplane tower, we all were looking to see a pole and as we drove closer( by the way it was on a highway 285 in Marietta, south I believe) we noticed it had 3 lights i think 2 white ones on either side and on e red in the middle. I was amazed becuase I knew no US aircraft could remain stationary like that. it moved sowly and later as we were passing it we noticed a second next to it. the two were flying slowing near each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Aircraft weren&#39;t close enough to really see a shape but I believe it must&#39;ve been a saucer considering the position of the lights.  we kept driving and then I saw another one a few up the highway.  that was too akward for 3 planes to be that close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept staring at the objects and later disregarded them, but still thinking about why I would even mistake an aircraft for a star. I&#39;ve never done that and seems highly unlikely. I didn&#39;t believe it to be a military aircraft, because that would be too blunt for the military to fly 3 aircraft in the same location for everyone to see. but I really am not sure,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just hope someone else saw this besides my quartet and I to verify it.<n>

It was a red-orange color and it began to change shape.  We stopped in the middle of the road and suddenly it started to move while it was changing shape slowly.  We drove as fast as we could so we could get a view of it as it had gone behind a few trees.  In between the trees, we could see it again but this time it was a perfect circle.  By the time we got to the bottom of the hill, it was gone.  We drove back home and parked the car and looked around some more.  We didn&#39;t see it anymore, but we saw a very small orange light up in the sky suddenly, and as soon as it was there, it was gone.  Thats when something shot across the sky at incredible speeds.

I then lost sight of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed there was another report from this night in Rialto, and I&#39;m sure that many people must have seen the same thing, as there were many cars around us on the freeway.<n>

My friend and I were coming home from a band rehersal in the city of Montclair, CA. We were heading eastbound on Arrow Hwy before Montevista Ave. to our left (north of Arrow Hwy) we noticed a large object with several bright lights around it, moving in radical directions up,down,right,left etc., at the same time it was shooting off what seemed like lazers or flares (bright red &amp; blue in color) as it moved from one direction to another. Arrow Highway was heavy with traffic and we looked over at other cars to see if other people were witnessing the same event in the sky. My friend asked me to pull over; but with traffic so heavy we didn&#39;t get the chance to do so. In less than 2 minutes the object regressed in a westbound direction out of view. It was unbelivable to see yet frightening at the sametime...My friend mentioned he had served in the USAF and commented that the object could not have been an airplane, jet, helicopter, etc. because of the direction(s) of flight and the rate of speed of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was in the distance and was larger than a star. The object did nopt appear to move. After five minutes, the object disappeared briefly. I then noticed it quickly moving to the west and had the appearance of falling out of the sky. The movement was very rapid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We, at first, believed that the reports of a red light over the Brook Park, OH, area, might, in fact, be a possible hoax.  A number of suspected hoaxed telephoned reports from Brook Park, OH, placed by young teenagers, on next day, included profanity and less than serious comments.  However, we are reconsidering our position, given that a television station in the area of the sightings, as well as the local police, received a number of telephone calls, and written reports, about the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This witness reported over the telephone that the object ascended; he reports above that it descended.

UFO!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three of us in the car who witnessed the ufo in the sky. I first noticed traffic slowing down on the 210 freeway East around 8:30 PM. Then we saw it in the sky. Not to mention hundreds of other people on the 210 East freeway traveling the same direction as us saw it as well I&#39;m sure it was hard to miss. It looked like three balls of light stacked on top of each other. Like fireballs with rings of fire around them. As we watched the lights shoot up and down in the sky unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen. Very fast and precise. Then it moved to the right and stopped, disappeared and then returned to the same place it started at. It blinked on and off a few times and then red led type lights appeared to beam hundreds of feet off the sides of the craft. It then started to turn clockwise blinking the red lights up into the sky and down towards the ground. We pulled over and stopped in the center of the freeway derider lane to watch it. Other cars and trucks did the same. As we exited the car the lights went behind a hill. Came into site again and then shot off to the south east and disappeared. My girlfriend who never believed in Ufo&#39;s or Aliens is now 100% a believer. My girlfriends friend was crying from what we were seeing. I am still having a hard time believing what I saw and I have always believed in other life and ufo&#39;s. Please contact me for further details and as I&#39;d like to see it anyone else reported what we witnessed. Thank you. Don&#39;t think I&#39;m nuts but I also have a photo of another UFO I took over a year ago. Please take a look at the speck of what looks like dirt above my dads head in the picture zoom in on it tell me what you think it is. It was taken with a digital camera in Hollywood Ca, in the afternoon. I have the time and date written down somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to us to be sincere about his sighting.

It appeared to be stationary (not moving)and had a very shiney appearance.

There was one large cloud in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just returned from the store was was enjoying a cigarette while I contemplated my lunch options.  I live on top of a hill and have a clear view out over the Forbes Creek area looking out towards the Totem Lake area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden into my field of vision from right behind me a teardrop shaped object shot across the sky.  I had a sight of this for approx. 3-4 seconds at the most steaking to the north east.  It had a silver almost metallic center with a blue outline that seemed almost like a halo or aura.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never known anything on this planet to move with such speed and I have witnessed some very fast planes in person.  I could not really tell if the object was falling to earth as I did not see where it came from, so judging the height that it was traveling at was difficult.  It disappeared in to the clouds and I lost sight of it.  My feeling was that it was moving so fast and straight that it had come from behind me and was not falling to earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The colors were amazing.  Again nothing in my memory reveals any recognition of a color like the blue that I saw.  It was unnatural for this world is all I can say.  I called King 5&#39;s news desk and they gave me your information.  I find myself to be a pretty practical person and I do question many things.  I cannot explain what I saw or the rate of speed it was traveling.<n>

My friend was facing east, threw the frisbee, it went over my head, luckily I turned around to face east to get the frisbee so we both saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Towards northeast,  i saw a tear drop shaped object moving from maybe 40-35 degrees(horizon being 0, straight up being 90).  It looked like it was shooting to Earth, and seemed to snuff out, not going behind the clouds.  It was blue turning into a green aura, moving faster than something at that altitude should have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked up the frisbee. turned around,  and I could tell by his puzzled look, my friend saw the same thing.  We talked about it and both tried to rationalize it as a firework, given the time of year, but dismissed that idea as there was no &#34;bang&#34; and it was full and complete on the way down, rather than reaching an apex and fizzling out as fireworks do.<n>

It was very late on a Saturday night about 2:00am. I live in Dunwoody, Georgia.  It was a dark night with a lot of clouds, and very damp.  It had been rainning alot, due to the hurricane named Dennis, off the Gulf. A bright white light got my attention, above my house.  It was about the same height as a plane would be.  It made no sound.  I looked up at the entire sky, and I noticed this object was brighter than the other stars.  There were only 3 stars in the very dark sky.  But this particular one was over my house, and it was the biggest and the brightest one. I went inside and grabbed my telescope.  I actually compared it with the other stars and it was nothing like them. When I came outside, it seemed to be jumping around in a irratic movement.  Through the telescope, I could see it better, and it looked like a sphere, that was like a mirror ball, but shaped oval.  The object seemed to be revolving counter clockwise, as a mirror ball would do, shinning in different areas, at the same time. After observing it through the scope for a few minutes, it would hide.  It seemed like everytime I really locked onto it through the scope, it would hide behind the nearby clouds. I noticed it would even go backwards.  I guess I witness my first UFO.  Within 2 to 3 minutes of hiding, it would return to the same location.  I would grab the scope and witnessed the sphere revolving as if it had little mirror squares on it.  It continued irraticly jumping around, up &amp; down,  and especially back and forth.  I payed particular attention to it when it would go backwards.  I watched it go backwards for quite a distance, noting that our planes do not have this capability!  But it still managed to return within seconds, pretty close to the same area. I watched it appear and dissapear, in the same area, for a full hour.  The entire time, it rotated and shinned like a mirror ball, bouncing around.  Then I realized it was extremly late, and I had to go to bed.  The mirror ball looking sphere was still there went I left it about 3:00am.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then another 2 changing shape object changed into different colors and sat in the sky for a while. Some stayed in the sky and some others moved slowly around and circles. It stayed like this for about an hour. Then suddenly one zoomed out of the sky and the others followed. It zipped so fast out of the sky<n>

While there I saw a very large bright light at about 12:45am to the SouthWest about a mile away and a few thousand feet above the ground (near) the canyon rim.  The light was circular and very large and bright, emitting a very white light, it had no collision lights like an airplane and it was far to big and bright to be a star.  I watched it for a bout a minute while it sat stationary, I was about to point it out to my wife, when it suddenly shot up and away, towards the West, leaving a sort of trail of white light behind it and it disappeared in mere seconds, before i could show it to my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had been playing our didgerydoos and had just finished. I was looking up at a clear sky about midnight when I saw this object come into my line of sight over my house from the SW. I immediately said &#34;look at that&#34; and pointed to it. He did not see it as it lasted only 5 seconds,however I clearly saw this thing. It was a football shape with what looked like wings or some sort of appendages. It seemed to be self lit and gave off a pinkish light. It seemed to be translucent and I could see the &#34;wings&#34; vibrating very fast. It traveled in a straight line and did not deviate. It disappeared by vanishing.The next morning we looked at the newest crop circle from Silbury Hill in the UK. The formation was discovered on 7/9 and was remarkably similar in shape to the thing that I had seen. I belong to a group that researches crop circles here in the midwest so this was significant to me. Also there is a similar report on the Rense program. Itwas  on 7/6 at 1;30 am from his yard. This event was in San Marcos Cal.  This the second sighting from my yard at night.<n>

I first spotted a slow-moving starlike object to the south west just before midnight at about 45 degrees up from the horizon moving towards me. I assumed it was a satellite although it was very bright (brighter than the dozen or so stars I could see) and was slower moving than most satellites I&#39;ve seen. When directly overhead the light disappeared, as one would expect a satellite to do when moving into the earth&#39;s shadow. With my head bent back as far as it could go I had to wheel round to look for the object as it continued on its north-easterly heading. After a couple of seconds I saw a very dim light moving where I expected it to be and after a few more seconds the light disappeared again as it continued to head north-east in a straight line. When I checked the Heaven&#39;s Above website, the info given for the ISS, or any other object, satellite or booster for that matter, didn&#39;t match the criteria. The ISS was due over at that time but the course was different and it would have appeared at its highest point low in the sky, not directly overhead. Nothing very exciting - entering this sighting just for the record and I won&#39;t be offended if you don&#39;t post it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When it got to the northeast another point of light appeared to travel straight up and meet it.  It seemed like 10-15 seconds passed, then the one i originally saw went straight up as the other one went straight down.  I lost the second one in the trees, but the first one went up a short ways and then appeared to just stop again.  At that point i went in to get my husband who was watching tv and he came out and we both looked at where it was, but it was gone, nothing else was moving. Neither objects had any flashing lights, they were so far away just points of light. I could hear highway sounds, so maybe it had a sound but i couldn&#39;t distinguish one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing satellites.  PD))<n>

The sky was crystal clear and full of stars. The temperature was in the mid seventies and the wind was calm. I live beyond the distraction of city lights and sounds and in the midst of near dead silence and a glorious view overhead,I swear I was a witness to the following;  It was around 10:45 PM when I began preparing to retire for the evening. My wife and Miniature Dachshund had gone to bed about an hour before. My routine includes checking door locks,night lights,oven settings,candles,etc.This also includes a walk through our covered patio area out back where we often spend quiet time outdoors most summer evenings,weather and mosquitos permitting.We have a TV,a fan,candles and other items we enjoy out there just like any other room of our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As usual,I went out to secure the patio.I stepped out onto our uncovered,attached patio where I began to take a big stretch and yawn before heading back in to the bedroom.My stretching motion shifted my head backwards and up toward the sky and.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> there it was! In the sky directly above me,was a perfectly round,silent and still object slightly smaller than the full moons we have here,and not quite as bright,but similar in color.I knew from it&#39;s position in the sky however that it definately WAS NOT the moon!Our moon starts out in the eastern sky and moves east to west across the sky on the southern side of our house,regardless of the time of year,and is viewable ONLY from an area some fifty feet north of where I was standing! My eyes remained fixed on the object for about 10 seconds or less,at which time it very slowly moved off to the west/northwest,and faded away into the clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s distance away from me when I first saw it was impossible to judge.I can only base it&#39;s size on the only object similar to it,the moon.When it began to slowly move away,it moved a distance of about one and a half to two times it&#39;s own size before fading out of sight,never making a sound of any kind.And as usual,you could have heard the hum of a mosquito&#39;s wings that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have waited this long to report my experience because I felt then,and still believe this was a sign from God,to let me know he has heard my prayers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am of sound mind.Alchohol,drugs or any mental shortcomings simply does not figure in to this event in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it was.....unidentifiable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Am I the only one that saw this? Has anyone ever seen this before?  I really would like to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You.<n>

It was dusk but still light enough out to not see any stars yet and also rather cloudy. What caught my attention was that this bright light(brighter than any normal star) was really blue and moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon stopping and watching, it proceded to move about into and out of a large cloud and change color from blues to reds and whites. There was no way it was a plane or helicopter from its flight pattern. It stopped and moved in erratic directions in a way no human made craft could. Also it seemed to traverse vast distances across the city quickly but move like a butterfly with soft motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it seemed very red and got long like a straight line with a hook on one end. There seemed to be 3 bright points, one at each end and one in the middle. Im interested if anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess is that it was over gateway/coburg area, possibly closer to downtown eugene. At one point it almost landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no noticable lights on the object, rather it seemed to completely glow and be made of light itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object&#39;s brightness caught my eye and then after six or seven seconds, the object became darker and entered another large cloud, but it never came out through the other side, it simply did not come out.  Unfortunately my wife did not see the object in the beginning, but she did not see anything come out either.  Now, we live near a military area but this was no helicopter or airplane.  Maybe a &#34;weather balloon?&#34;<n>

I had decided to take my morning break from work and have a walk around the neighborhood, specifically so that I could watch the Blue Angels practicing their maneuvers.  There is a park near the bank where I work that has a large, open field.  I decided to linger a bit longer than normal in the beautiful, clear, warm day and watch the planes work their magic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I was standing in the middle of this field facing North.  The Blue Angels were flying all around the sky, so I was just standing in one position and trying to catch as much of it as possible.  It was a very clear day.  All of a sudden, I noticed an object almost directly above me very, very far up in the atmosphere.  It was something between a cigar and an egg shape and had almost a khaki color to it.  It was moving extremely slowly from west to east.  I have never seen a flying object move this slowly before.  I was astonished at seeing this mainly because the Blue Angels did not seem to notice it at all.  (Granted, its position was much higher than their own.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just continued on its trajectory at the same speed the entire time.  It seemed to be pushed by the wind more than move on its own power; however, that said, it was a very regular speed and constant direction.  There were no windows on the object, but it did seem to have the same shape and indentations as the object sited in St Louis this past summer.  There were some very high cirrus clouds in the area, and the object seemed to disappear and reappear through those clouds, so that might give an indication as to its altitude.  I watched the object for probably 10 minutes (which gives you an idea of how really slowly it was moving), and then suddenly felt very disturbed by it and walked back to work.  No one else seemed to notice the object, though there were several other people walking through the park and commenting on the Blue Angels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I decided to post this report was that the object looks almost identical to the report from St Louis posted on your main page today.  The only difference is that this object I saw was not metallic.  It had a khaki color and no irridescent or reflective qualities at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might be a weather balloon, but never having seen one, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

On this  night i was called outside  to  a police  vehicle blocking off the intersection directly in front of our building.   After a few minutes of watching to see  if anything was going to happen a large number of police vehicle chasing a civilian building flew by the intersection.   About twenty seconds after the chase went by i looked caty corner from our building to the large factory across the street.  About a thousand of feet it seemed a rectangular shaped outlined by an extremely bright lights seemed to hover over the factory.  My first thoughts were that it was a helicopter involved in the police chase.  I pointed the object out to my partner and we began to talk about.  I was airborne in the army and he was a navy seals boat operator in the navy and we were both puzzled because it looked like no helicopter we had ever seen.  I will have to say we couldn&#39;t see any details of the craft due to the brightness of the lights sorrounding it.  However we were talking for about a minute when we heard the sounds of the police sirens coming back towards our position.   We looked around for the police cars and then both looked back up at the object and about ten seconds later, the vehicle seemed to shoot directly straight up at an extremely high rate of speed, faster than anything i ever saw in the military.  The lights dissappeared within seconds.  I was wondering if you had any explanation of what it could be?<n>

I had left Fruitland, Idaho, late on the 7th of July. The distance is about 45 miles one way.  I’m not sure exactly what time we left but it was getting close to midnight.  I took the Franklin exit off of Interstate 84 by mistake.  So I just headed north till I hit cherry lane road.  It’s a back road which heads straight into meridian.  There was no other traffic that night on that road and all we could see was a lot of open fields.  Most of the fields on that road were not in use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From out of nowhere a strange light approached the side of the car at ground level and then flew right over us.  It hardly made any sound at all. I could see 4 bright white lights that were round in shape.  It felt like I was being watched for a split second.  After it flew over the car it dove down into the field next to us and its lights went out.  I saw that it didn’t look anything like a plane.  It looked more like a long wing or saucer shaped.  I saw one light come on after the bright ones went out.  It was a small blinking blue light. After it had swooped down in the field I saw it whip around and jump back up in to the sky.  I felt lucky this thing didn’t crash into us and I just kept driving.  I looked back in my rear view mirror at it and it was just hovering above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and we believe him to be quite credible.

I was right next to Jesse Owens Park and I look up to my left and I see what appeared to be a low flying object...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was headed in a w/nw direction, not too fast moving... I looked at it for about 16s and I was on my cell phone (nope! no camera on it GAH!) and as I was staring at this thing I noticed bright big white lights of course attached to something but the lights were huge and bright and in a triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5 lights specifically not headlights but flat lights...but it also had the normal red and white lights you see on any plane at night so I wasn&#39;t to sure that is was man made or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It certainly was peculiar and I wonder if anyone saw it also.<n>

Worth International Airport in Texas, I saw a light in the sky, it just appeared nearly suddenly, and within 4 seconds it was gone. You could say I saw it, blinked, and it was gone.  It looked like it was at a high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on board American Airlines flight #2262 (a Boeing 757), enroute DFW-STL, at gate C11 awaiting gate departure. It was about 11:30, probably a little before that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew what I saw was too fast for any plane, even a military jet. I could only see a white light, no other color lights. I know it couldn&#39;t of been a shuttle because those have been grounded since early 2003. Whatever it was, it looked like it was going to escape the atmosphere very shortly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no stars that were visible, since there were many lights at the airport, so I know I didn&#39;t mistake it with a satellite. It was too low to be in space yet, but getting close to escaping the atmosphere. The light was easily about 35,000 feet, I would have to say anywhere from 50,000 to 150,000 feet. I&#39;m sorry I cannot be specific on the altitude of the aircraft, or whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to take a guess, I would have to say it was around 80,000 feet. Again, the date was July 7, 2005, and the time was probably about 11:25 P.M. We were at gate C 11 (terminal C gate C 11) on the ground at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.<n>
7/7/05 23:07|Buford|GA|Triangle|3 minutes|NOT A UFO!|7/13/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44853.html|336|ndxe200507| NOTE: THIS WAS NOT A UFO! It was a Stealth aircraft, but I wanted to alert the center in case of sightings related to this craft under mistaken identity. I was taking my trash to the curb in my subdivision which is in a residential/agricultural community. Coming from NE to SW is a regular flight path for commercial aircraft coming into and leaving Hartsfield in Atlanta so the distant lights and noise are normal to me at all hours. We also have a local airfield in Lawrenceville, GA which accommodates helos and twin-engine craft for the private as well as business sector. However when I first took the bin to the curb I noticed in a more northerly direction a rather intense bright white light twice the size of the North Star usually seen. I stared at it for a moment then returned to get the recycling bin which took perhaps 30 seconds at most. When I looked up again the &#39;light&#39; had become a huge light within a vast black &#39;triangle&#39; to include a slowly flashing red light and green light in the respective lower corner angles. In the middle and slightly into the craft was a very swiftly flashing red light. I&#39;m really bad as far as judging distance so here goes my method: Holding my hand up at arms length, and &#34;pinching&#34; the object = the commercial jets way up are about 1/4&#34; but this craft was about 3&#34;! So it was very close to earth in flight. And it was totally silent! I watched it go over the roof of my house in the normal flight route and ran to the back to watch it disappear over the treeline to the SW about 30 degrees more than the commercial flight paths. My husband is in the Navy so I called him before getting excited about a UFO. He told me it was a Stealth Aircraft probably heading out toward Texas. He couldn&#39;t elaborate on anything further and I understood. I have had only one other encounter with a triangular object such as this and when I explained that one to him, he said it was most definitely NOT a Stealth aircraft! I shall report that incident next although it took place in MA back in the early 90&#39;s. I just wanted to let you know that if anyone reported this object from the past week. I would also appreciate the confidentiality of the Stealth flight pattern as it is a matter of national security...just wanted to alert you to mistaken reporting. Thank you!<n>

It was still light out, though very cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter, I was in the neighborhood directly behind my parent&#39;s house when a helicopter streaked by, headed in the general direction of south. I was wearing headphones, and I could hear the helicopter over the music. It made a wide arc to the right, turned around, and passed directly over my head.  It was a black helicopter, which is more than a rarity in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It promptly turned around again, and began to circle directly above me. It circled 15-20 times, getting lower and lower, as if it was out of control or looking for a spot to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then took my headphones off and got my cell phone out to call my fiancee.  At this time, the helicopter was 200 or so feet in the air, very low. It was approximately 7:40.  When I began to dial, the helicopter pulled out of its low circling routine and shot off south again, flying higher and eventually up into cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made calls to my fiancee and my sister, but neither of them was home. I began to run again, out of the neighborhood and on a major road at this point.  With my headphones on again, I could swear I heard more helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To satisfy my curiosity, I took off the headphones once more, and sure enough, several helicopters could be heard, but they were not visible and were likely covered by clouds.  I reached a bypass in the road at a very busy intersection.  Waiting for a green light, I began to here much more air traffic, and I searched the skies convinced that I would see a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 7:45, in the distance, due north, I thought I saw a helicopter headed in my direction. I stood and watched it for about 30 seconds until it was close enough for me to discern that this was not a helicopter.  3 triangles appeared to be traveling in formation, each one rotating on its own axis, all 3 of them rotating around eachother, with seeminly no laws of physics applying to the locomotion of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, since they were headed toward me, I had no real sense of their speed, and I assumed that they were slow moving, perhaps floating the same way a kite might float. The strangest thing was that, the more I stared at them, the harder they were to focus on.  What appeared to be a bubble surrounded the 3 objects, similar to the ring you can see around a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my fiancee and my sister again and left frantic and frustrated messages. I watched for about 2-3 minutes when they began to head off in a more westerly direction. It occurred to me to call my mother, who was back at the house I had just left. She answered, and I begged her to go out in the yard and look in the sky. She had no luck in seeing this object do to the combination of its distance, it being fairly low on the horizon, and the amount of trees surrounding my parents&#39; house. She did, however, say how strange that was considering that she and my father had just witnessed a black helicopter acting very peculiar over the neighborhood behind us. They said the helicopter sounded as if the engine had cut out or gone out of control, as if it was in a spin before a crash. She suggested that the helicopter may have been in pursuit. I suggested the opposite as a joke. We got off of the phone, and I was still stuck in my tracks, staring at three triangles moving highly unnaturally and surrounded by a ring of strange light in broad daylight. At one point, the bottom triangle appeared to push out smoke or a vapor trail but I believe it was most likely a low flying cloud, approximately the size of two of these objects. If I were to make a hypothesis as to the size of these objects, I would have to say they could have been anywhere between the size of a commercial airliner or the size of a football field. It was very unclear, due to the varying speeds at which they moved and the fact that they were fairly distant, possibly a mile or two away, maybe more, maybe less. Not being an expert on judging things like that, I&#39;m not exactly quick to make a concrete analysis. I was very tempted to get somebody out of their car at a red light, but I&#39;m a really big guy, and that probably wouldn&#39;t have gone over so well. This whole incident happened over the course of about 20 minutes, but I was able to watch the objects in the sky for about 10 minutes total. For the rest of my 5 mile run, I heard several more helicopters, which is very uncommon where I live. Beyond that, I can&#39;t say I remember ever seeing a black helicopter around here. I do live 15-20 minutes southwest of Trenton&#39;s airport, 40 minutes north of Philadelphia&#39;s airport. To top it off, Newtown is home to a branch of Lockheed Martin, and the field across from Lockheed Martin played host to a President Bush rally last year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have yet to contact local authorities or local newspapers.<n>

Two faded bluish gray craft that looked more like long speed boats suddenly appeared in a clear blue sky and moved slowly around the still burning flares then disappeared again. All that was left was a smoke trail from the flares in a blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was heavy military aircraft activity in the area all day. Several aircraft released chemtrails during the day. My location was about ten miles East of the Susitna Lodge on the Denali Hwy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was in the yard with three other people, my brother and two friends.  I made a comment of, &#34;do you see that,&#34; and I wasn&#39;t the only one who saw this.  We witnessed four ufos east of downers grove.  The ufos that we witnessed looked cylinder in shape.  At times they seemed to get brighter, or almost glow a orangish-red color.  The objects at times, aligned and moved together.  At one point, they were in a diamond shape and a trapezoid shape.  They moved from the east to the southeast. During time in travel, they looked as though they disappeared and then would be able to catch sight of them but in a different location.  They all disappeared after ten minutes.  During this time also, we live by two airports, O&#39;Hare and Midway.  There were many planes flying through the air, and these were no planes.  At times they would also appear to be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We observed a very unusual event that will transformed our lives forever.  Out of nowhere a neon blue circular craft came in our view.  We immediately wanted to tell our parents, but we were so afraid to move.  So we just observed the object to see what will happen.  The light began to slowly fade away.  As it was fading away it took off across the sky like a falling star..  And it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

As i said what the hell is that we all at the same time looked in astonishment, it was moving very slow and i ran in to get my video camara it shot off we then saw it tonight again 8/8/05 same thing again but it dissapeared as it got close to a plane as we have an airport just behind our houses . it was very weird and maybe nothing but we rang the local ufo people and i thought id let you lot know, Not sure if you deal with places in englan If not no worries.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The drive was uneventful to Rachel other than dodging Jack Rabbits.  On the way back on Hwy. 375, approx. 30 miles SE of Rachel where the road is straight for 7 - 8 miles before the intersection with Hwy. 93, I noticed a single bright light in front of us about 15 degrees about the horizon.  It reminded me of a train headlight because it seemed to be a single light and very bright.  I asked my wife if she saw it and she said &#34;yes&#34;. I watched it as I drove on and another light appeared to the south of the first light at the same height.  As the second light appeared, I noticed the first light either turn or dim.  It looked like it turned but I could still see it only dimmer.  The second light then disappeared or went out and a few seconds later the first light was back to its&#39; original brightness.  The second light then came back on for about 20 seconds and then went out. We kept driving and the lights disappeared behind the hills before we got back to Hwy. 93.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen video of sightings that were dismissed as military night training flairs and such and would like to know if this could have been something like that.  I have never seen anything like this before and the flairs explanation doesn&#39;t make sense if the light goes out or dims and then returns in the same location.  I regret not stopping along the road to watch these lights instead of continuing to drive.  My wife says it was probably something explanable but she did see them also. I see why Hwy. 375 is called the Extraterrestrial Highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I tried a different part of my yard that has a better view of the sky.Most went South to North and appeared to have erratic flight characteristsics; some went very fast.  I simply lost count of the objects. There were far too many to be satellites, and I was out (theorhetically) beyond satellite viewing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was almost like 2 circular shapes on the outside and a blackness in the middle. It &#34;hovered&#34; for a a good 5 to 10 seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it may have hidden behind clouds but there was not a single cloud around. Clear skies and nothing but stars to be seen. As quick as it appeared, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we both didn&#39;t say anything to each other almost like we didn&#39;t believe what we just saw, then finally I said...&#34;Did you see that Sis?!&#34; and she told me exactly what I had just seen.

I looked in the direction of the sound to the west but couldnt see anthing at first. I then saw a bright white light that I first belived to be the aircraft. But as it got closer I saw that the helicopter had a red flashing light and was FOLLOWING the white light!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light had a diamiter of about 1 foot, and was about 100 feet infront of the aircraft. They flew almost right over my head and the light started to fade. They flew for another 100 yards or so and the light dissapeard. At this point the aircraft stoped and hovered for about 30 seconds, before turing to the north and flying off.<n>

There were 4 sets of light/lines across the sky each at an angle of 50 degress or so. At first we thought they might be jet contrails, but they were very defined, without any broken up pattern in the line like contrails leave. Two of us watched the lights and called the other 2 in our group to observe. They moved at the angle they were pointed in, slightly downward and then one moved out of sight. Another appeared to move out of sight and then it started going upward in the same angle and another one above it moved downward, maintaining the same amount of space from each other as they traveled in opposite directions. One line had a bright light off the end of it that appeared briefly. Finally after about 20 or so minutes the light lines disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THEN OUT OF NOWHERE A BRITE WHITE SPHERE SHAPED OBJECT STARTED CIRCLING AROUND IT FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER.AFTER THAT THE WHITE LIGHT STARTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE OBJECT WITH THE RED LIGHTS. THEN FROM THE SOUTH AND NORTH CAME SOME KIND JETS LOUD AS HELL. THE CRAFT THAT HAD THE RED LIGHTS STAYED IN A STRAIGHT COURSE TOWARDS LEMMORE N.A.F.B. MEANWHILE THE WHITE LIGHT BOLTED OFF TOWARDS THE SOUTH IN A UPWARD MOTION THEN AT A HIGH RATE OF SEED IT CAME BACK IN BLINK OF AN EYE TO FOLLOW ONE OF THE JETS. BY THIS TIME THE SKY WAS FULL OF ACTIVIDY. JETS WHERE COMING IN AT SONIC SPEEDS AN SHUTING DOWN TO ALMOST NOTHING BUT AFTER BURNERS AND GOING STEALTH NO RUNING LIGHTS NO SOUND.THEN WHAT APPEARD TO A SATEILITE CAME FROM NORTH TO SOUTH IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND THE WHITE LIGHT WENT A Z SHAPED PATTERN AND THEN JUST DISSAPERD.

I caught a few pictures of it, but then it disapeared in the blink of an eye. The pictures I took clearly show it rising in the sky and elongating like someone was stretching it. Then it simply shrank and disappeared. We thought it may be a vapor trail behind a plane and the sun set reflecting off of it, but it moved too quickly over a large area and there were no lights on it. It was like 1 big light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing a contrail passing overhead.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

It was travelling from east to west in a straight line starting at the horizon to my right and was going at a speed I&#39;m sure that no jets can possibly fly at. Unable to determine how high it was, the city skyline in that direction was very clearand there were few clouds in the sky.  Although there was commercial traffic, it seemed to be higher and much much faster.As it neared  the end of the horizon it seemed to just go out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I knew it wasnt a military craft when it went from slow to stop to zipping in the sky but it never left our eyesight and never disssapeared. We observed the craft for about 45min to an hour and couldnt believe I was seeing it. ive always known they existed and was always waiting for my chance to actually see one which I did and am now telling you guys. They are trully amazing. It was so high in the night sky it appeared as a star would except it was dancing some kinda strange. --Thankyou p.s. My family doesnt believe me and now I am ridiculed for seeing it but I dont care I know the truth of what I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were increasing and decreasing in size, and pulsating a bright inner white glow.  They also spun in clockwise/counter-clockwise rotations, moved at inconsistent speeds, and made split second changes in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first &#34;light&#34; came from below the tree line on the Eastern side of the bay, it literally lit up the trees and the surrounding forest as it moved upwards and then sort of &#34;danced&#34; above the tree tops...it then drifted out over the bay where I could see it reflecting in the water and then it &gt;poof&lt; vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next 3 lights appeared from same area on the eastern part of the bay and moved in a very slow, stop and go fashion over the water, moving up and down, left to right, sort of dancing, and then gradually dimmed out and disapeared, or moved out of my line of sight.  This all occured over an hours time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I hope you will find MOST interesting is that over the past 3 years I have seen these same sorts of &#34;lights&#34; (and other lights) all around Maine; I see them all the time!!!  Each sighting is differant in the &#34;ufo&#39;s&#34; basic properties, behaviors, and duration.  Actually the report listed here on 9/6/02 was written by my mother in North Carolina after a phone call I&#39;d made to her one terrifying night 3 years ago while living in Richmond ME.  Just prior to that night a police officer had responded to a call I made and witnessed my &#34;lights&#34; as well, he then went on to report it to your hotline on my behalf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very simply ~ A 32 year old Mother of three children who simply wants to know the TRUTH.  What are they?  And why are they here?<n>

I drive a convertible so we could see the sky for miles around us. I glanced out the front windshield in the direction towards the passenger seat and saw four lights (three white one red) over a small wooded area slightly higher then the trees (maybe 150-200 feet).  I asked her what that was since I needed to concentrate on the road.  She stated she thought it was lights overlooking a baseball diamond.  I looked again and said there was no pole or any other mechanism holding it up, and besides there was a red light right in the middle.  She looked again as we passed and said she wasn&#39;t sure.  With the top down and the radio off we heard nothing more then road noise, no sound to indicate a helicopter, plane, etc...especially one that low.  We pulled into Burger King parking lot and turned around so we were once again facing the object and studied it for a matter of seconds before I made the decision to see if we could get closer.  I pulled out and headed back in its general direction and before I even drove 100 feet it took off out across Grand Traverse Bay, and seemed to disappear instantaneously.  These lights moved faster then any jet or plane I have ever seen fly over head.  We drove back and forth along US 31 three more times looking out over US 31 before we decided to head home.  We contacted Traverse City Police asking if they had received any &#34;odd&#34; reports tonight and they said they had not.  We both discussed it for the next 20-30 minutes and neither of us could come up with an explanation.  Two days later I did a search on the internet finding many sites that showed and described things similar to what we had witnessed.Therefore I decided to post this account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never been a believer or disbeliever of ufos or et&#39;s until this night.

I believe it was between 8:50 PM or 15 minutes after 9.   I had not long turned off of FM 457 on to FM 2611 which becomes FM 2004 N.  I am not sure how long I had been driving, when all of a sudden the lights in my car blinked twice and then the car went dead.  I coasted to a stop at the top of a slight hill that was a curve.   I was frightened, for one I am female and was traveling alone and I was out in the middle of no where.  I thought that the reason for my power going out in the car was because my brother had been using my car battery early that day and may not have tightened the battery cables properly and the cables had slipped lose.  I didn’t have a flash light on me so I grabbed my cell phone to call home and let someone know what had happened,  then I decided to get out of the car knowing that my cell phone had a  bright light on it and I was going to check the battery cables.  Before I could open my cell phone to turn it on a bright bluish glow started to light up a thick wooded area across the highway from me.  At first I thought it was another vehicle coming up behind me and I panicked for a moment because my car had stopped at the top of this hill in a curve and if the vehicle coming up took the curve to fast it would hit me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I quickly realized that it wasn’t another vehicle I sat still watching the light in the woods get slightly brighter.  The light wasn’t bright like a blue white light bulb, it was more like the light from a giant blue flood light or helicopter flood light and I mean giant and the light didn’t hurt your eyes it wasn’t that sort of light.  I watched it slowly start moving upwards through the trees.  I sat in complete silence and watched it rise up out of the trees until it was above the trees and clearly in the sky with the stars for its back ground.   It was a huge bluish translucent ball of light with the center of the ball much darker then the outer edges.  It made no sound.  The outer edges of the ball seem to vibrate or tremble slightly.  It continuously rose up into the sky at first slowly, but the higher it got the faster it went.  Which was straight up into the sky until it disappeared.   I sat in the silent darkness for a few seconds then turned my car keys which I had never taken out of the ignition switch and the car started right up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a true account of what I saw I have no reason to lie.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m not sure of amount of miles down FM 2611 I had traveled after I had turn off of HWY 457.  “Its pitch black where you could hardly see your hand in front of your face, all I know is I had not made it to the Sweeny left intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky at that time.  Just before approaching a sharp turn of the road the car lights started blinking and then the car just shut off, I coasted in to the curve of the road and pulled the cars parking break.  I am in a 1991 Volvo wagon that runs like a dream.  I thought the battery cable had come loose.  I am female so I got frighten and grabbed my cell phone because I didn’t want to get out of the car with out letting someone know what had just happened, I didn’t want to be alone out in the pitch black and my cell phone has a bright light on it.  Before I could open my cell phone a bluish glow started shining through the trees across from the road where I was parked it would be to my left if you were sitting in my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a car coming up behind me and I panicked because my car is read and black and I was frighten that the vehicle behind me would take the curve to fast and run into the back of me but the light wasn’t coming from behind me it was coming from across the street.  I watched as this bluish light rose up from behind a thick patch of trees in front of me.  The object was a blue ball of translucent light, with the middle of the ball slightly darker then the outer part.  It made no sound and it just rose up from out of the wooded area across from the highway where my car stopped.  I couldn’t move, and that was mostly because I was astonished.  The ball rose up sort of slowly but as it got higher it speeded up it didn’t deviate from the direction it was going, which was straight up.  The higher it got the fast it went until it just disappeared after that all I could see was stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat in my car for a few seconds and I noticed that there wasn’t a sound to be heard at all.  Then I turned the car key which was still in the ignition and the car started right up.  I broke a lot of speed restrictions last night getting home all I wanted to see was my 59 north exit sign heading home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Saw lights above the trees moving and flashing beams on the ground|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45161.html|372|ndxe200507| Heard sounds of humming over the trees for one hour early morning.  Saw lights above the trees moving and flashing beams on the ground<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awaken by a loud but low humming noise.  I thought there were people mowing their lawn so early in the morning.  The window in our room was open because it was particularly hot.  That was why I heard the sound outside.  I am a light sleeper and I can be awakened by any sound that is unfamiliar to my ears.  I tried to sleep through the sound, again still thinking that someone was mowing the lawn.  But the sound went from soft to loud, like it was moving far and near.  I still could not get back to sleep and was already intrigued by the unfamiliarity of the sound.  I decided to check it out.  I looked out the window and I saw in the sky just above the trees bright ligts, white, blue and yellow, moving very slowly horizontally.  That was the one that was making the humming or whirling sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my husband up because I thought I just saw a UFO.  He also saw the lights but he dismissed it as just a helicopter hovering.  And went right back to sleep.  I observed it for some more minutes because I could not believe that it was only a helicopter.  I know how a helicopter sounds like.  But this one was really different.  It hovered close to our building and I thought I saw a light beaming from it down the ground, like a huge flashlight looking for something.  If it was a police helicopter then where are the police cars?  Nothing was happening in the area, no movement of people or cars.  It was just peaceful except this hovering, humming sound getting louder and softer every minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was roughly 2am and we were sitting around the camp fire when one of my friends pointed out the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked up and noticed the objects were flying in formation. As the objects moved West over our position we immediately followed.  The objects came to a complete stop, hovering in the air about 200 feet above our position in a clearing in the woods.  We slowly backed into the forest and hid behind an old fallen log, as to hide ourselves. At that moment, one of the saucers began to decend from the formation. The saucer stopped dead about 3 meters from the ground and two of the overhead saucers emitted a beam of light on the lower saucer. At that moment, the saucer 3 meters off the ground emitted four pulses of light into the ground. The light was blinding and caused my friends and I to look away. When I finally opened my eyes and re-focused the 6 saucers were on their way East of our position. The saucers seemed to be speeding up and within seconds they were out of sight. My friends and I moved back to our camp site and immediately penned down what we had all experienced. I was charged with the task of making the report. 3 of my 4 friends made it clear that they never wanted to speak of the event again, but a close frind and I decided we needed to share our experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Drove up the road approx. 2 miles to a extremely dark and secluded overlook of the valley below. We were there trying to get a broad view of all the fireworks down in the cities and towns below us. As my father and I stood around looking at all the fireworks, my father asked &#34;hey, what&#39;s that up there?&#34; I turn left and look up and spot a very bright, intense, white sphere of light. This &#34;ball&#34; of light appeared to be a satellite at first moving extermely fast from west to south east. Then as we watched, it suddenly started to move about unlike ANY conventional aircraft we&#39;ve EVER seen. It veered left at extraordinary velocity, then right, then arched in a rainbow type trajectory at incredible speed. Maneuvers completely unseen and probably impossible in any traditional aircraft we know of. We watched this &#34;ball&#34; for about 60 seconds after which is darted behind a mountain, not to be seen by us again that night. The &#34;ball&#34; made no noise at all and put my father and I in a state of excitement unmatched by any fireworks. Very remarkable holiday.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then hours later saw exact object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was yesterday the 4th of July. After lighting off fireworks, my friends and i were sitting on the front lawn. I was facing the left side of my house when i noticed a very bright circular, orange colored object in the sky. It was very bright and was just hovering there. At first i thought it was an airplane of some sort, but then i thought airplanes arent that bright and just orange like that, nor are helicopters. Then i thought it was a star, but realized the area we&#39;re in, stars dont shine that bright, and if they did we would have seen this star before. So i realized it was a UFO. As all my friends were looking at it, i ran in the house to grab the video camera. As I was zooming in, i thought it looked like a small bump on the top of the circular object, but couldnt exactly make it out. Because the object was small to catch on tape, it was hard to keep the camera still because i had to zoom in so far. So i turned the camera off. Then we noticed the UFO started to vanish. It just got smaller and smaller. I tried to get it dissapearing on tape, but for some reason i couldnt pick it up. Then it was gone. At about 3:35 PM me and my friends were going to bed. My windows were open and i was kidding around with my friends saying that i saw the same UFO again. They looked and knew i was joking. Then before i was closing my windows I noticed the same UFO, Orange and circular. It was doing the same motions, barely moving then dissapearing. This startled me and my friends, as a joke turned serious. I didnt know what to think. Now it is the next day. And i am typing this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My grandma, uncle, and I were outside looking at the stars. My uncle told us he saw a glowing light about fifteen feet in front of us. We all looked where he was pointing. For about 10 seconds ever 5 or so minutes, an extremely bright light about the shape and size of a softball would glow. It was white and extremely bright. Our cabin is pretty isolated so it is pitch dark except for the stars. After watching the glowing orb for about half an hour, I noticed there was another one in the trees to our left. We began to get a little freaked out and tried to come up with explanations, because we were all hardly ones to believe in UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the orb in the tree and the one in the tall grass 15 feet in front of us, we noticed one far in the distance on the top of Black Butte (the mountain in front of our cabin). At first we thought it was a star, because it was on the edge. But it was so bright and too big to be a star. At that point, it began to inch extremely slow in a straight line across the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really have no idea how to explain the next part of our sighting to you. We had been watching the orbs for give or take an hour and a half. We were frozen there, mesmerized by what was going on. All of the sudden, out of the pitch black, a bright white light swept across the side of the mountain, and across the field beneath the mountain next to our cabin. We could see everything in the light. Everything else was pitch black except for were the light was hitting, it was illuminating every tree, every blade of grass, everything in its path. I ran inside to get my dad and my grandpa, but by the time I got them to come out, everything was gone. We tried to explain what had just happened but it just sounded crazy. I know what I saw, and my uncle (33 at the time) and my grandma (64 at the time) know as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> {This was outside of Redlodge Montana, in-between Roscoe and Elk Lake, if it interests anyone}<n>

I was about 19 at the time, and the other witness with me was about 24. I distinctly remember it being the 4th of July because we had heard firecrackers and fireworks going off all night however I noted to myself that we saw no lights from the fireworks at all and only heard the noises very far off.  The night was perfectly clear and the baseball field had no lights so the night sky and stars were very bright and easy to see, there was no moon that I can recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were lying on our backs watching the stars, comets, satellites and planes for about an hour and during that hour a small pinprick of purple light became visible almost directly above us. It was bright enough to easily track and very obviously purple colored. At first it was the size of a star and almost unnoticeable among all the stars in the sky, however it grew slightly bigger after a few minutes (probably as large or larger as the north star on a good night, with a slight purple glow around it making it just that much larger than the stars, however not quite as bright) and flew around in a somewhat erratic manner. It only moved a matter of inches across the sky from my perspective though obviously it must have traveled much further since it was so far away- though I have no idea if it was within the atmosphere or much further out. It was traveling very fast considering we had been watching satellites go by that night and they are extremely sluggish compared to this lig! ht. The pattern of its movement were strange and all I can really remember from that night is that it seemed to zig and zag around at random the entire time we saw it, sometimes stopping to hang for a few minutes before moving again, it’s size and color/brightness waxing and waning slightly without pattern. It only moved within a small quadrant of the sky, almost like it was circling something. A reference for its speed I had in my mind at that time was that if a plane was at that height and moving across the sky at a steady speed, the purple light would be moving double that speed- not exactly zipping around but still much faster than a plane. Because we were on our backs and it was almost directly over us it looked like it must have been out among the stars, however at a different angle it might have been within the atmosphere and much closer than what we thought. After staring at it for about 15 minutes it simply flew/faded away (with a little bit of a tail like a tiny c! omet) and nothing else happened in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The guys decided to do &#34;intermission&#34; about 9:45pm so they could get some water, and the kids could get something to drink.  My friends&#39; husband said &#34;That bad boy is moving&#34;..we all looked up and thought at first we were seeing a satellite or something.  It looked almost like a star it was so small and far away.  Then we realized, with it being that far away, it was REALLY moving fast.  It was coming from the North traveling toward the South.  We talked about it being a rocket of some sort because it was moving too fast for a satellite.  A few times we thought it zig-zagged a little, but, basically went in a straight line.  It was fairly close to a bright blinking star, and we noticed another one coming straight toward it from the south, we thought they were going to collide. Then, the first one we saw immediately stopped, the one moving from the south darted around the first one, that seemed to be when all of us went into shock.  At that point, NONE of us were sure about what we were really watching. None of us had ever seen anything stop so fast.  We watched the one that was traveling from the south move in approximately the same path to the north the first one from the north had traveled going south. When it got just about directly overhead, we noticed another tiny star/light moving in about the same speed coming from the west.  One of the neighbors started shooting fireworks, and we lost sight of the 3rd one, but, watched the one that was still traveling north until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  None of us drink, and we all knew if ALL of us had seen this we weren&#39;t all crazy.  Since I haven&#39;t ever really thought one way or another about life outside of ours, I decided today to see if I could find anything that would explain what we saw.  So far I haven&#39;t, but, am VERY curious about any suggestions of what we have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I cam see it move up the back behind this mountain just up and down for several minutes. On the fourth of july i saw it just hovering up above the mountain and a bit forward this time. It wasn&#39;t exactly moving just hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/4/05 21:21|Flushing|NY|Cigar|3 minutes|Slow moving Cigar shaped object sighted while waiting for 2005 Macy's fireworks to begin from a distance of 10-15 miles|7/13/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44799.html|385|ndxe200507| Slow moving Cigar shaped object sighted while waiting for 2005 Macy&#39;s fireworks to begin from a distance of 10-15 miles<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on the roof of a building in Lefrak City Queens, NY approximately 18 stories high, waiting for the Macy&#39;s fireworks to begin and I was taking snapshots of the Manhattan skyline in the distance.  I was approximately 15 miles from Manhattan. I can&#39;t guess from the photos how far the object was positioned from where I took the photo. I believe it may be more than 10 miles which would lead me to believe it was a very large object.  It appeared to be moving slowly across the sky.  I took two photos 3 minutes apart.  I believe the speed could be determined by the relation of the object to the rooftops of buildings and the time between shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/4/05 21:15|Scottsdale|AZ|Flash|15 minutes|Three  bright blue lights, fading to lighter blue, turning red when changing direction, flashing white when accelerating.|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44761.html|386|ndxe200507| Three  bright blue lights, fading to lighter blue, turning red when changing direction, flashing white when accelerating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on our rooftop to watch the variety of Phoenix and surrounding area firework shows, and got more than we expected. We saw three bright blue lights, fading to lighter blue, turning red when changing direction, flashing white when accelerating. They looked to me to be playing with each other, turning around each other, chasing, diving and floating. At times the were out of sight due to tree tops, and we presumed they might have landed. This was observed facing South from South Scottsdale, they were probably flying over Tempe.  At the time there was flight traffic in the area and fireworks shows.  I have a photo depicting an airplane, the strange lights and  fireworks.  We spotted a fighter jet flying into the area, and the lights hid and remained hidden.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/4/05 21:03|Santee|CA|Light|14 minutes|One red light over El Cajon during the 9pm fireworks displays.|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44763.html|387|ndxe200507| One red light over El Cajon during the 9pm fireworks displays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my backyard with my telescope (41x mag, 60mm refractor, f/15) and a pair of 10x50mm binoculars to look for this very object(s) as seen last 4th of July at the same time in the same general area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first spotted it a 9:03pm (Sprint time on my cell phone) at approximately 123-degrees magnetic bearing from my location at approx. 7-degrees elevation.  It was a bright, steady red light, comparable in brightness to that of the red navigation light on a small general aviation aircraft, of which there were two or three in the south pattern at Gillespie Field Airport at the time.  The color of red seemed slightly deeper than standard navigation light red.  The object was moving very slowly but steadily from south to north and ascending slightly.  After about 5 minutes, it began to flicker a bit.  The flickering progressed with time to where at 9:15pm it was flickering as if a flame being blown by wind.  No regularity to the flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:17pm, the light flickered out as if it was a flame source that ran out of fuel.  I watched it through the telescope as the last glimmer of its light flickered out...and it was gone.  Last bearing, approx. 107-deg magnetic, 12-deg elevation.  (Based on alignment with Polaris(north star) and subtracting local magnetic variation of about 13-deg.)  Its appearance through the telescope gave no more details than looking at a bright star through the telescope.  There was no smoke trail visible as I might expect from a burning flare.  flares can leave a smoke trail in the air that their own light will illuminate.  There was no parachute or balloon visible that might have been illuminated by the light of a flare.  No falling sparks visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 9pm local airport weather reports: Montgomery Fld - Clear 64/56 75% NW6  29.97R Gillespie Fld - Clear 66/55 68%  Calm 29.97R Ramona        - Clear 59/53 80%  W6   29.98R  Winds aloft forecast for SAN 050600Z (forecast period begins 2 hours after the event, but should be close): 3000 feet  -- 320deg @ 7kts 6000 feet  -- 280 @ 12 -- +22deg C 9000 feet  -- 250 @ 17 -- +18deg C 12000 ft   -- 250 @ 21 -- +11deg C 18000 ft   -- 310 @ 09 -- -4deg C 24000 ft   -- 270 @ 16 -- -17deg C 30000 ft   -- 270 @ 24 -- -33deg C 34000 ft   -- 280 @ 35 -- -41deg C 39000 ft   -- 290 @ 34 -- -51deg C 45000 ft   -- 290 @ 27 -- -63deg C 53000 ft   -- 280 @ 14 -- -70deg C  My guess (only a guess) is that this was some sort of smokeless flare or other high intensity red flaming device carried aloft by one or more black helium ballons.  It may have been launched from the vicinity of Grossmont College and carried to the east by light winds to over El Cajon where it extinguished.  Last year I saw two such objects simultaneously, for the same duration, on the same date, at the same time, in the same general area of the sky.  And those objects appeared and behaved the same.  Someone&#39;s pulling a prank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If we get precise bearings from other witnesses in San Diego County, we may be able to triangulate a ground track for this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object remained motionless and changed from a small red dot to a very bright red light changing at different intervals. After approx 15 minutes the object seem to move westward very slowly until it just disappeared. The object was viewed without any magnifying devices, but seem to be round in shape and just the color red was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It got closer and it looked like a V, it had ~5 bright orange lights on each arm of the V. It moved VERY FAST to the left, stopped then forward and to the right. There also appeared to be some type of dripping orange fire from it, like a flare but this only happened twice. Then the lights went out one at a time on the arms and it just looked like a star that faded out. Sober as hell and still pretty freaked out about it. I am an educated middle age woman, and never saw anything like it. I just cant believe we were the only ones to see it. Im watching the news for it. Most people were watching the fireworks:( Please let us know if anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was reflecting the sunlight off of it self.I then got the binoculars and looked, it was a solid reflecting object that seemed under control.I then noticed a similar object farther off into the distance hovering also.It might have been the international space station watching the comet temple 1 impact,but the space staion does not hover from side to side at 10,000 ft.!It then slowly disappeared as the sun was setting.I know it was not fireworks of any sorts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible planet?

7/4/05 21:00|El Cajon|CA|Oval|1 hour|Red light UFO over El Cajon, July 4th, 2005, for the 3rd year in a row|7/13/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44778.html|391|ndxe200507| Red light UFO over El Cajon, July 4th, 2005, for the 3rd year in a row<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 4th, 2005, at apx 9pm, a red oval/circular unidentified object appeared again this year over El Cajon. Last year same apx time, there were two lights traveling side by side for apx 45 minutes to one hour. This year only one object was present, and it appeared in apx the same location, and disappeared within a couple of miles, and was viewable for apx 45 minutes or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A semi solid looking fuzzy red light (to the human eye), moving along an extremely slow pace that no know man made aircraft could maintain. No running or flashing lights, no noises made either. It looked like it would take 15 minutes to go just one mile. For the most part it maintained a consitant light source, but would on ocassion alter in intensity, and also seemed to vibrate or move strangely for a moment from time to time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened again just before all the scheduled fireworks were to go off, so there should be hundreds or thousands of people seeing what my girlfriend and I saw. I stayed until the object vanished, it basically started to ascend to a higher altitude, and disappeared. I headed back home (we had gone out for a walk with our dog), my girlfriend had already went home, upon me arriving home, she pointed out in another location south of El Cajon, CA, another strange unidentified object in the sky. This one was very far away compared to the one over head in El Cajon. It was only visible to the eye for apx 3 minutes, and was not as red as the one described earlier. It  had the same characteristics as the other described object, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional photographer and graphic artist, and have a good grasp of the visual world around me. I am sure there will be more reports concerning this sighting by others. I believe that this is the 3rd year in a row, that this event has happened over El Cajon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The images I took were done in order, starting with the bottom one first. You can see that the object is revolving from a horizontal position to an almost 90 degree turn. Unfortunately 90% of my images got corrupted in the camera at the time of filming this. My camera was malfunctioning out of the blue, I have heard such things have happened to other people filming UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were sitting on her deck after a BBQ when she looked up at the cloud pattern toward the East and said, Oh, there&#39;s a ship up there, I feel it. She is a practicing psychic with years of good experience so I pay attention when she feels something. I looked where she was pointing and saw nothing. While we were both looking in the area suddenly a bright illuminated golden spot (small circle) manifested there and traveled from East to West at a constant speed. It never changed its course, speed or brightness and went across the sky in about one minute while we watched it. We have a lot of military in the area, Ft Carson, NORAD, Schreiver Air Base, Space Command and we see aircraft all the time. This was not a plane or a chopper. Even though it was the fourth of July, it was not any kind of fireworks I had ever seen. While we thought at first it might have been a mylar balloon, it traveled in the opposite direction to the prevailing wind with no bobbing or wobble we could discern, more like a determined path than one subject to the wind. We have no other explanation than it was a ship, like she intuited.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The woman asked me if I thought it was a satellite and I said that I thought so, except it was moving too quickly.  The light stopped almost directly over our heads.  We both were surprised and she commented that she had never seen a satellite do that before.  We watched it for a moment longer and then - poof- it just disappeared. Vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn&#39;t very high. It had no wings or sound like an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arms length it was approximately half the width of my thumbnail and four times the length.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had two patriotic kites flying for the Fourth which were tied off. When looking at one of the kites my brother saw the object and asked me what I thought it was. The object looked like a planet but was almost at our zenith many tens of degrees above the ecliptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved back and forth in an erratic manner several times. At other times it would remain in one place. The object was fairly bright and about the size of BB held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the object for few munitesI went inside to get some binoculars for a better look and upon returning my brother said the object just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light on top obliterated the true shape of the craft wnw from the town of Davie. It appeared top be watching the fireworks and left before they ended. I noticed the craft when I looked outside to see the fireworks and wondered what it was. I had never seen a craft in the air that was stationary for so long It was about 15 degrees north of where the airliners come in for a landing to Ft. Lauderdale airport. I checked every half hour or so to see it sitting in the air at exactly the same place. When the fireworks slowed down, I looked and it was gone. I did not see it leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was similar to fluttering debris of fireworks, but could be clearly distinguished in that it remained nearly stationary.  The object seemed to tumble in place, showing irregular geometry.  The object was sighted from the beach at an angle of about 45-60 degrees above the horizon.  In this order it very gradually: 1. increased in altitude and distance, 2. approached the beach while retaining relative distance, taking an angle of about 75-85 degrees, 3. receded into the sky and was lost as the sky darkened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After we here this occur three time we go out to see whats going on.  We see two F/A-18 in an orbiting pattern over to the east of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aircraft were in a lag formation with wing 1/2 mile back with an altitude of about 4000 Ft and an orbit radius of about 5 miles.  I look to the center of there orbit and spotted a glowing silver ball.  I pointed this out to relatives and three others witnessed this.  I would estimate it&#39;s altitude at 6000-8000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball would flash a golden color every 30 seconds or so in a seemingly regular pattern.  This went on until about 18:30 pm, the location of the ball did not change the entire time.  Two of us witnessed white streaks appear within proximity to the ball, and a haze happened to appear arround the location of the ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The F/A-18s continued to orbit until we lost sight of the ball.  We didn&#39;t really start to think seriously about what the ball could be until about 18:15, and took one film photo that may contain a picture of the aircraft and ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked 4th of July celebrations for Mission Viejo and Lake Forest but found no evidence of military fly-bys for any of the festivities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think we were not the only ones to spot this, so we checked with local CBS affiliates to see if there had been any reports of objects in the sky and military airpower present and were told nothing was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first i thought it was the one we just saw, as me and my boyfriend wathced the one go past his family saw another one following it and then another one. we watched it for a good 10 to 20 minutes until we thought it was kind of weird and freaky and went back into the house. I don&#39;t know when they went away but I know there were at least 3/4 of them that me and my boyfiend saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don&#39;t hunt UFOs or even believe in ghosts.  I have seen questionable lights in the sky, even 6 of them 30ft away from me but I still question those and can&#39;t confirm they were alien or UFOs.  But this one is different,.  It had dimension and reflected the ground.  Plus it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on the 4th of July 2005. I was at a holiday party, in the back yard of the house next to a swimming pool.  Ever since I was a kid, I usually like looking at planes take off and land.  So when I was in the back yard and heard an approaching plane, I instinctively looked up.   While I was facing north. I heard to the left of me, a plane approaching.  So I looked at it and thought, &#34;cool, a C130 military plane is approaching&#34;.  Which made it even more interesting to look at.  Right behind the plane was a small round object. My first thought was that the lane was towing something.  As it got closer and closer, I kept looking for a tow line, a chord, a rope, a wire,... something to make sense that it was towing this round object.  Then as it was almost right above me, I saw that the object was shiny with a chrome-like reflection.  That&#39;s when it hit me that this is the orb stuff I&#39;ve heard of in the past.  So I opened the sliding back door and yelled for people to come out! and see this cause I didn&#39;t want to be the only one seeing this.  They all tool their time to come out cause they thought I was crazy.  While they were coning, I tried to pull my Iphone out to take a picture or video, but the stupid phone took a long time to boot up and initiate the camera.  While I was waiting, the plane had already past me and moved on to my right.  So I&#39;m looking at the back of the plane now.  I can still see the orb behind it, but it started to move slowly to the left of the plane.  So I naturally freaked out some more.  By the time I got the camera working, the plane was too far to see anything and the people who came outside to see couldn&#39;t make out anything themselves.  That&#39;s my story of what happened.<n>

We filmed the event.  In the film, and unknown to the naked eye, at least two UFO events occurred.  The first was at the 7 second mark in the video and the 2nd event was located at the 20 to 21 second mark in the video.  The craft moved incredibly fast and were only seen on the video.  The first craft at the 7 second mark was disk shaped and the one at the 21 second mark is shaped like a hockey puck.  These craft were brought to my attention this year after someone viewed it and alerted me to the events on the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video can be viewed at:  http://youtu.be/WzupM69np2E<n>

It flashed once in the first position.  I then flashed again once, but as if it were headed north.  About 3 seconds later it flashed again, but back to it&#39;s original position.  It proceeded to flash once in a different position about 8 seconds later.  The next flash was dimmer (magnitude 5).  Then it disappeared for about 30 seconds.  Another single flash happened.  Then it disappeared.  This single flash was a white color, almost like a star, except there was no briliance to it.  As a pilot for 10 years, I can tell you, this was no general aviation strobe, nor a commercial strobe light.  My wife, who was star gazing at the time also saw this erratic flash of light, at first she thought it was a shooting star, but after it reappeared  a few times in the same position back an forth, it was clear this was not that either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately called my friend who was out at the same time as me from Sammamish an saw the same flash, but only once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no shape or detail obsereved, only a single white flashes....and it was no flare, fireworks, or anything of the sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were on Panoche Rd. approaching 33. The kids were asleep in the back seats. It was past midnight. My husband was driving and I had just opened my eyes after nodding off a little. There were vegetable fields / farms on both sides of the road. That was when I noticed what looked like small planes flying around the fields, taking off and landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my husband which airport it was and he said that there was no airport there. He said he has been seeing those lighted things flying around the fields for a while. He thought that they were lighted windmills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked carefully, I realized that they were free flying aircrafts. They all had amber lights underneath and very bright white search light like head lights turned on / off frequently. We assumed that someone was practicing night flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it didn&#39;t fly like regular planes or helicopters. 3 of them were V shaped and flying one behind another with perfect sync. The most peculiar thing was that it appeared to be landing but taking off almost immediately with great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never stopped as we were still thinking that the night sky and the distant lights were playing a trick on our eyes. After 5 minutes or so, we saw them again. My husband said that they are all over the fields, flying round and round for a while. This time I asked him to stop and he just refused because he thought I was overreacting to something that could be ordinary. (We are both elec. engineers and believe there is an explanation for everything!)  5 more minutes later we saw them again, this time we saw colored lights. My husband says that he saw green lights right away when he spotted them. We never saw them again that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am really confused becuase they behaved like fighter jets in miniature doing manouvers but at the same time like a flock of birds circling and settling down and circling again1<n>

It was about 10 to 20 miles NE from where I was observing it.  The blue and red flashing light acted sporatic in it&#39;s shine and also movement.  It would go left in a hurry, and then up, sometimes down.  It would do this in a quick manner but it seemed to move not so much to where you could really notice it at my distance.  I would have to stare at it to notice that it was not a star because of the movements.  It then faded like it turned around or something.  It seemed to bright and to high in the air for it to be a hellicopter, and the movements were very akward.  After it faded, it came back stronger, and kept on making strange movements.  Eventually it seemed to move to far north for me to see, and I went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

We were in camp site 19 of Green Ridge State Forest when I got up to go out of the tent at about 11:45 pm.  I observed what I thought was a firefly going directly back and forth, back and forth and then bouncing up and down.  It could move at enourmous speed and sometimes simply blinked out then appeared in a new position.  It looked a little like the &#34;follow the bouncing ball&#34; thing from old cartoons, but with the light of an arc welder.  It&#39;s distance was impossible to really guage, but it was directly between us and the lights of comberland MD. which was approx. 25 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It increased altitude and decreased altitude a number of times during this kind of random set of movements.  It was the lowest observable light in the sky, because of a ridge that was between me and the Comberland skyline.  I got out of the tent, watched it for about 10 minutes, then I went back in and woke up my 8 hr old son and forced him to be a witness for about another 10 minutes.  I kept waiting for it to zip away at some enourmous speed, but it suddenly just faded away in uder a 2nd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was crystal clear and it was not much brighter than a really bright star, but it has a kind of bluish intensity that made it more than sparkle.  It was no larger than a good sized star, but its movements were reallky significant.  It was covering what would have been about 6 inches of sky between my outstreched hands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone had to have seen this. It went on and on and it was very easy to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

As soon as our last artillery shell went off 3 of us saw a single bright white light shoot across the sky just above where the firework went off. One hour later while driving past Washburn we saw a single bright light wobbeling across the sky heading east, several thousand feet up. At 1 am two more bright lights were seen near Bismarck, one traveling faster than the other, racing towards the north northwest. I made two attempts to photograph the wobbling light but it was too dim for the camera to pick up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was about 11pm. We were standing there watching the stars and all of a sudden I saw one of the stars moving.  It was moving all over the place in one area.  It would move up and down and side to side, and in circles. Its movements were very fast whatever it was. The person I was with had noticed it as well. SO we grabbed some binoculars to look get a better look at it.  When we looked at it, I saw a trianlge with bright colored lights outlining the edges all around the triangle.  The lights appeared to be flashing.  It looked like christmas lights.  Blue, green, yellow, red, purple, etc.  It moved around above the lake for about 15 minutes and then it just took off and it was gone. That night it was clear skies, and this is in the northwest so the lake we were on is in a wooded area.  The lake is pretty small.  We have family that owns the house we were at when this happened and we were staying with the for the 4th of July weekend.  We both are unsure what it was we were seeing, but I have never seen anything like what we saw that night.  It was really weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Toronto. The sky was clear and some motion from above caught my eye. I noticed a formation of 9 or so Oval shaped objects flying in a V, completely silent. They had a very dim dirty white/yellowish glow. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. At 10:43 (according to my call cell phone call log) I called my uncle to report what I had seen. As I was on the phone describing the spectacle, I saw a large V flying towards me (headed north). From a distance It looked like a yellowish/white V but as it passed directly overtop of my perspective, I noticed that it was comprised of about 20-25 oval shaped objects exactly the same as those in the formation I had seen just minutes earlier. I was quite shocked and amazed. I coudln&#39;t make out any details beyond the fact that each of the objects was an oval giving off dim light that appeared to be a dirty white/yellowish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared on the horizon as a glowing orange ball of light that was traveling from south to north.  I was not able to tell the altitude of the craft, but seemed to be the same as passenger jet airliner&#39;s.  The sky was clear and people all around the lake were setting off their fireworks, so I know a lot more people were able to see the craft because they were all ready looking up at the night sky.  The craft seemed to be twinkling like a star, and it did not change shape, color or even size after it passed directly overhead.  It looked the same going away from us as it did coming towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped for a minute as we watched 4 motorcyclist ride by. My friend said &#34; hey whats that&#34;, I said &#34;what&#34;. He showed me it as he was in a rush. Up in the sky it looked to me as if it was a bright, large, moving star. If i had to explain it i would say that it looked kinda like a fast moving north star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5-10 seconds it was in the other side of the sky and started to go behind trees until we couldnt see it no more. We were fascinated so we stayed there for about a minute. Then all of a sudden my friend said &#34;OMG, look theres another one&#34;. This time it looked exactly like the other one except it was going in almost the exact opposite direction(maybe 10-15 degrees off) and it also came out from behind the trees that the other one went into.It was going a little bit faster than the other one though. At this point we thought that this was just the coolest thing ever. And same as the other, it just was across the sky in mabye 4-8 seconds then disappeared.(Way too fast for any man-made object.) About 45 seconds after that one was gone the last one appeared. It looked the same and was moving the same speed although this one was the most unusual. It seemed to come out of no-where. If you look strait up in the sky, thats where it came from. From where I was standing it was moving to my left. After about 3 seconds it only moved so far then it was gone. It just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

MAYBE A DOZEN FIREWORKS HAD BEEN FIRED UP INTO THE SKY WHEN I NOTICED IT.  AS I WATCHED IT, IT TURNED 90 DEGREES TO THE SOUTHWEST.  THE LIGHT WAS NOT AS FAST FLASHING AS A PLANE.  IT TRAVELED A FEW SECONDS IN THIS DIRECTION AND THEN BEGAN TO ZIG-ZAG AROUND SEVERAL TIMES.  EACH TIME IT CHANGED DIRECTION, ITS LIGHT WOULD DISAPPEAR BRIEFLY.  AFTER SEVERAL DIFFERENT ZIG-ZAGS, IT CAME BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION WHEN IT FIRST TURNED AND RESUMED IT&#39;S SOUTHEAST-NORTHWESTLY ROUTE.  I WATCHED IT TRAVEL TOWARDS THE LAST TWO STARS IN THE BIG DIPPER AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER, IT DISAPPEARED.  MY WIFE SAW IT AND A YOUNG BOY BEHIND US.  THERE WERE MAYBE 60-70 PEOPLE SITTING ON THE HILL BUT NOT MANY SAW IT AS THEY WERE WATCHING THE FIREWORKS.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was only one star in the SW sky noticable as the sun had not fully gone down. Neighborhood fireworks were starting to go off.  While I waited for my boyfriend to finish filling waters in the stalls I looked up at the single star and noticed another bright &#34;star&#34; moving quickly from the SW.  It was a solid bright light (brighter than the visible star) that appeared to be large, high, and moving very quickly. It thought that it was moving far too quickly to be an airliner and as it got closer, I noticed that there was no plane nor were there any flashing lights, and called to my boyfriend to come look- joking that I was seeing a UFO.  He stepped out of the barn, saw it immediatly, and we watched it as it was passing overhead.  It continued going NE through the sky and then made a slight curving arc toward the NNE, continuing in that direction until it passed out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At times it was eradic.  I spotted the lights on three occassions during an hours time.  I can&#39;t tell if they were the same group or different groups.  I couldn&#39;t tell the shape because of the poor power of my binoculars (7x35).  I can&#39;t imagine any aircraft that I know of that could do the manovers this craft was doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of my viewing evening I could see a simular group of lights that were stationary in the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didn&#39;t appear to be dropping from the airliner, since it was moving away in an almost horizontal line.  It was white or silver in color, and appeared to be round in shape.

7/3/05 14:00|Springfield|OR|Disk|1 hr 30 minutes|Saucer shaped reflective object moving and hovering with chasing Government Jets and a Helicopter/Photos taken|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44725.html|427|ndxe200507| Saucer shaped reflective object moving and hovering with chasing Government Jets and a Helicopter/Photos taken<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were working in the yard this afternoon.  At 2:00 p.m. we heard and spotted a huge Coast Guard helicopter flying from the west into the east, as if it came from the Oregon coast line.  Right in front and above, at approx. 20,000 feet of the helicopter was a bright reflective saucer shaped object moving very, very slowly.  It was backdropped by a clear blue sky without a cloud behind it.  It seemed to be reflecting the sun in a type of pulsating, rythmic display of extremely bright light.  It may have just been pulsating with intense light.  It was moving very slowly and then stopped moving.   At approximately 2:12 the UFO did  a vertical ascent and disappeared.  The helicopter did a sharp turn right/south when the object stopped moving and did a 180 degree reverse path heading straight back west.  The helicopter turned south, running along what seemed to be the west side of the Cascade mountains.  We live on the east side of Springfield as you start up the pass to cross the Cascades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within two minutes we saw a large white jet coming from the south (maybe Klamath Air Force Base) heading north.  It had radar unit on top of it.  It was headed north into the exact spot from where the UFO hovered and disappeared.  That jet was first noted at 2:35 p.m..  Another radar jet appeared, following the same south to north path that the first jet traveled.  At 3:14 a third jet appeared following the same path from south to north into the same space where the UFO disappeared.  At 3:17 and 3:19 the same type of jets appeared also, following the same path.   Using our digital camera we took several pictures of the UFO.  We now have them downloaded from our camera and burned to CD&#39;s for safe keeping.  Note:  Today is the day that the USA NASA probe will hit a comet at 10:52 p.m. West Coast time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought I was looking at one of the stars. All of sudden, the star or craft was glowing white bright light to about 5 or 6 times of Venus and its size. It shaped like a big cross due to its size and brightness for several seconds. The light was diminished to tiny yellow dot, flying zigzag pattern form to north and finally disappeared. It wasn&#39;t a shooting star for sure but I am not convinced that this was any astronomical phenomena either. I wish this report brings more witness to clarify the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/2/05 23:30|Spencerport|NY|Triangle|2 minutes|Black Triangular Craft with Seven Dim Lights Sighted Over Spencerport, NY|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45370.html|433|ndxe200507| Black Triangular Craft with Seven Dim Lights Sighted Over Spencerport, NY<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening was unusually cool and very clear, so my husband and I decided to go out onto the back patio to enjoy some relief from the heat and relax while looking at the stars.  We sat in our loungers watching the sky for about a 1/2 hour or so, but only saw the usual satillite or two, and a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, just before we were getting ready to head in, I caught something out of the corner of my eye moving in the sky toward us from over our house, coming from the South East, headed North West. As I focused on it, I could see the outline of a black, triagular craft, with seven yellowish, very dim lights on the bottom.  Three of the lights were along the bottom left, three along the bottom right and then one light at the tip. The body was very black against the sky and the underside lights looked just like round, recessed lighting you&#39;d put in your house, but with the dimmer turned way down.  It blended so well with the sky that had I not been staring straight up, I probably would not have seen it.  As it moved, the bottom of the craft seemed to always be facing us, since you could not see any depth to it...it looked very thin and flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I started pointing up and yelling for my husband to look ...he did and to my surprise, he saw exactly what I did...a big, black triangle, flying quite low, at what appeared to be just a few thousand feet.  It made absolutely no noise and moved very smoothly like a glider through the sky.  It came from over the front of our house, passed over our backyard and then disappeared as it moved behind the trees at the back of our property.  As for the speed, it was moving moderately fast, but slow enough that we were able to view it for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen something very strange in the sky many years ago, but was alone at the time and had no one with me in order to do a &#34;reality&#34; check.  This time, though, I could not believe that my husband was actually seeing the same thing that I was.  Those few minutes were very surreal. The whole experience was quite exciting, yet very disquieting at the same time -- what was it that we saw?????  My husband and I are both well educated, respected technical professionals in our mid-30s, with steady jobs, a stable home life and we own our home.  We very rarely drink, if ever, and do not do drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up at the sky and a light was moving in the southeast direction of Marietta.  My mother and a friend saw it at the same time.  As we were watching, it suddenly shifted to the left at a right angle from its original direction.  It then continued to move in its original southeast direction.  As we watched, it did another lightning-fast right-angle shift to the left and then continued to the southeast.  Shortly after this, it disappeared.  All that was visible the entire time was a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They seemed to come out of the middle of the sky in groups of 2, 3, 4 (it varied).  All were going at a fast rate of speed.  All we could see were the lights.  They weren&#39;t planes because there were planes in the sky and the planes were not travellling as fast.  All the other (besides the 1st 3 went in the exact same direction - only this time southwest.  The night was very clear.  I am 50; my friend 59.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are very level-headed people.  We were sitting on my friend&#39;s  deck observing what a nice night it was and watching the stars and the planes.  In all we saw at least 30 of them, all going at the same rate of speed.  All with lights resembling stars only bigger.  The lights looked like they were in a row beside each other whenw there were 2, 3 or 4.  When there were 7, it was 1,2,2,2.  I am a small business owner;  my friend is a foreman.there was nothing reported the next day.  At aproximately 11;45 we stopped watching.  These were not planes and not birds.  Other people must have witnessed this if they were looking at the stars- there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was just above tree-top level so if it had been an airplane one would have heard the sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my dgtr what it was and she dismissed it as a plane.  However, a few mins later another object exactly like the first came through in exactly the same direction as though following an imaginary road in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then a few mins later yet another object came through, although when this last one came through it got to a certain point over the house so to speak and it made &#34;contact&#34; with a moving &#34;star.&#34;  The object flickered on finally in the same direction as the first two and then the &#34;star&#34; moved on in another direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These same objects came back from the direction that they went and then &#34;disappeared&#34; after a certain point. The moving &#34;star&#34; appeared again and then we seen another &#34;star&#34; and it went in the same direction as the first &#34;star.&#34; We could not tell the shape of the flickering objects until we seen it for the last time.  After awhile there was a &#34;break&#34; in activity.  And then an object just appeared in the sky just above tree-top level and it was really visible.  It was triangular in shape with the point of the triangle being the front of the craft with flashing red, green, and white lights all around it.  Since we have seen these objects - the first sightings Sat - over Independence weekend - we have seen these same objects every night since.  Although, the one that was really visible and shaped like a triangle - we have not seen one quite as clear as that one since the first sighting - yet.  We keep seeing flashing lights moving in and coming from the same direction as the first night (or approx vicinity.)  And we keep seeing moving &#34;stars&#34; that appear to maintain the same directions/movements as well.  These objects make no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> We attempted to enter the date in the form required but it would not allow us.  However, the date of the first sighting was Saturday, July 2, 2005 at approx 10:30p.m.; and we have been seeing the same objects, i.e., objects with flashing lights and moving &#34;stars&#34; since that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

What appeared to be a star, slowly started decending toward the Southeast horizon.It slowly changed from a small bright light, to a bigger redish orange. It would fall real slow and then pause for a few seconds, then continue to fall looking like a magnetic fiery ball, with distorted wavy trails beneath it , instead of behind it. We watched, until it finally disapeared into the horizon, which was a tall row of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also noticed four more lights, 2 were stationary one to our left and to our right. They were moving up and down, and side to side, when looking into binuculars, i could see bright blue lights going clockwise, and bright red lights going counter clockwise. The lights were moving so fast,causing it to pulse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other lights we seen, were small solid white lights that were very fast. One came from the west and went straight north.

I looked once and saw nothing then noticed him looking up again.  I looked up and saw a object that seemed more like two cones fat sides together (roughly diamond shaped from directly below) moving steadily across the sky.  There was a steady white light from the center and I also noticed as it traveled across my view (from west to east) twice a sort of light purple wave (sort of like a corona) flash away in different directions from the craft.  It made no sound that I could hear but my dog could obviously hear it.  It was seemingly pretty high (mile???) but it&#39;s shape was still obvious so it must have been pretty large (guess of more than 100&#39; from tip to tip??)  It dwindled out quickly to the east (did not disappear behind a mountain, just suddenly dwindled) and that was it.  It was very obviously not an aircraft (light because I could discern it&#39;s shape and there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In total there were three oval objects moving around in awhat seemed to be a standard search patern. Just to the right of the full moon If that helps anyone who knows the stars and planets this time of year. The objects seemed to stop moving once I got it in view of my telescope. Then The one object just bobbed back and forth. Through the telescope it had a red fire flare look. then returned to bright light. the light was to bright for me to focus the telescope. At that moment the other 2 objects continued moving in there previos patterns. The one I tryed to focus on got bigger almost like it was descending downwards to get a better look. then in a flash it became small again. It is still out side in the the sky as I Type this note. On July 1 2005 In the same area above the school across the back ally Was the first night I observed these objects. On july 1 there was only one object but it followed the same patterns as the 3 I saw tonight. Its quite a rush. Tonight I started thinking and I got the strangest feeling the object was listening. For example during the time I was trying to get it in the telescope It would not stop moving untill I thought to myself I wish You weren&#39;t so fast.

7/2/05 00:30|Lawrence|KS|Light|30 Seconds|I went out back to have a cigarette and saw a group of lights flying in a V formation. There were eight or nine on each side. At first|7/5/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44703.html|444|ndxe200507| I went out back to have a cigarette and saw a group of lights flying in a V formation. There were eight or nine on each side. At first I thought it was a satelite breaking apart but they moved together down and then up. I called the nearest air force base and asked if they caught anything on radar. They treated me like a nut. This was between Topeka Kansas and Kansas City. If anyone else saw this can you let me know? Thanks, ((name and e-address deleted))<n>
7/1/05 23:00|Bridlington (UK/England)||Light|Approx 5 to 10 minutes|Balls of light|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45217.html|445|ndxe200507| Balls of light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this thing on two separate occaisons. The second was roughly the date i gave above the first time i saw this was about 2 months before that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time - Me and my boyfriend were by the beach where I live. We had been out with some friends but they had gone home and we were just chilling out laying one of the benches near the beach so just looking up at the sky talking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a really clear night so lot of visible stars. It was him that first noticed it and he pointed it out to me. It looked exactly like a star..just a ball of light travelling pretty fast and very high as it was about the size of the north star so just a little bit bigger than the others. It wasnt a plane or helicopter we realised because it made no sound..was way to high up and was travelling way to fast. Also they have flashing lights on the wings etc. This did not flash. My first thought was shooting star/comet but we followed this thing across the sky watching it then we noticed another (previously stationary star) move and follow the same flight path. Then another 4 did the same they were still..and then they moved. We eventually stopped looking as i had to go home and we werent exactly liek &#39;wow&#39; we were just like hey thats weird etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second time - The second time was early july. I had been at my boyfriends house  that night and he was walking me home. We were on my street about 100 yards from my house and I saw this thing again..looked like a star again but this time it seemed closer as it was bigger. It was definatly the same thing as before..no noise no flashing etc. It moved pretty fast and then it stopped it then moved again and then it changed direction and seemed to go back like it was getting further away. It got smaller and smaller and disappeard within about 3 seconds. No other lights follwed this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

7/1/05 19:56|West Seattle|WA|Light|4 minutes?|Bright light in broad daylight, moving slowly over the puget Sound, West Seattle area.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45079.html|446|ndxe200507| Bright light in broad daylight, moving slowly over the puget Sound, West Seattle area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening just before 8:00 pm I went out on the deck to relax and just as I sat down I noticed a bright light heading in a westerly direction, above 10,000 ft. would be my estimate of altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was an airliner heading west and reflecting massive sun. The sun was up quite high still and well above this craft.  It was still full daylight at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my binocs out of curiousity and what I saw was not an airliner in my opinion.  This craft moved very slowly, had no blinking lights that I could see, and no discernable shape. Just a bright shining light.  At one point a Cessna flew through the field of vision (flying North) which made it very clear that the light I was watching was NOT an airplane!  It did dim a few times after this and then seemed to veer to the left (South) and when doing this, became even more intense of a white light.  Just after that intensifying, it disappeared.  I continued to look with the binocs for several more minutes before giving up. I noted the time, 8:01.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, this is where it gets more curious.  I went inside at this time, took care of some things and went back out to the deck at 8:55.  I watched the same area for a few minutes and ...damn if I didn&#39;t see it again!!  This time it was orange and illuminated from the bottom (apparently) due to the sun being much lower and the sky becoming more orange with sunset.  It again moved very slowly in a different direction, more northwest I would say. I watched this time for under a minute before it disappeared, it got funky and hard to focus on with the binocs, like it was shimmering or something.  Then it was gone. Just thought it was strange enough to write in about. Perhaps someone else saw it too?   Thanks.<n>

I was so shocked I couldn&#39;t believe what I&#39;d seen than it changed back to a cigar shape &amp; flew faster than any thing I&#39;d ever seen in my life,it flew over the lot beside our house &amp; there came another one from the opposite direction came to a stop changed into a round tennis ball shape circled each other than took off so fast &amp; disappeared in a flash this happened in late July or early Aug. of 2005.I told my family &amp; they said,sure you did, When I seen they really didn&#39;t believe me I didn&#39;t tell anyone else because I figured they would think I was nuts.I don&#39;t care who believes me I know what I seen &amp; I know we are not the only ones around.I seen a totally different type of spaceship last year during the Tenn. Walking House Celebration in Shelbyville,Tn.2006 There were 4 of us in the car going to the Horse show coming in from M&#39;BORO,about 1/4 mile from the main street in Shelbyville &amp; I was driving,I noticed something lit up to my left in the sky not very high up,I first thought it was a Goodyear blimp,until we got closer to it I seen it was&#39;nt &amp; it was lit up inside, I got excited &amp; pulled the car over to the side of the road so I could see better, this thing was about 2 stories tall &amp; Hugh &amp; just still in mid air not moving &amp; I thought maybe it was something related to the TN.Walking House event ,Than all of a Sutton it started moving slow &amp; I could see under it and it was in the shape of a triangle with bluish lights only 3, one at each corner under it,than it took off like lighting , this really surprised me something this Hugh traveling at that speed,first not moving than slowly moving but not for very long t! han zoom gone out of sight.I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before nor since.I&#39;ve been watching the sky since my first sighting in 2005.I stay up all nite some nites if there&#39;s activity.I have taken pictures of some-things I have no idea what they are, maybe you guy can.thanks(contact email-((e-address deleted))<n>

I was looking at the lightning and the storm clouds, and it occurred to me that I saw something silvery or flashing either on the edge of the thunderstorm of in it. So I kept looking, and there were two silvery unidentifiable objects flying with one another, kind of dancing around, not in a pattern I can describe (except with my hands), but not in a way that planes can fly. One man had pulled to the side of the road to watch the storm too, or something else - since he was looking in the same direction as I was, I assumed it was the storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no camera to take a picture of the storm over the open fields. I kept driving, wanting to stop but there were cars behind me. I almost did a double-take so it was a delayed reaction, like holy crap! And I looked for them at every opportunity I got, but still trying to drive safely, but I lose sight of them and never saw them reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In BROAD DAYLIGHT 3:00.. in Braintree<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 15 my brother and I were walking the train tracks from Quincy point into Braintree.  We got to the back of Skyline apartments where there are a good size dense wooded area.  So were walking along and notice a basket ball size metallic sphere suspended in mid-air. Nothing holding it or propping it up..  Just still about 40 or so feet in the air maybe 10 ft. above the trees. It seemed like it knew we were watching it. Then I looked away and my brother looked down or something and it was just Gone..... THIS WAS IN BROAD DAY LIGHT... And the weird thing is when we got to the end of the tracks we didn&#39;t even care about what we just seen like it wasn&#39;t a big deal.. Obviously now I know it is.  But then we didn&#39;t at all. .... Btw were both healthy not crazy people<n>

Speed and sounds never heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were out in the mountains looking for rocks and minerals one sunny afternoon and we decided to take a short rest upon a rock. As we were sitting alone out there and talking there was a lull in the conversation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 1 minute into that lull an object &#34;flew&#34; right next to the left side of my girl&#39;s ear and made a loud buzzing growl type sound like we, or i , have never heard.  This was on her blind side and we both heard it and it caused me to look over due to my angel I had a better view than she, however, we both saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned it was flying straight back to the trees and made a 90 degree hair pin left turn like nothing i have ever seen move that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a country boy from ILLinois who has traveld for 10 years and been in every state and i have never seen nor heard anything like this before.  The closest way to describe this motion was like a giant hummingbird on steroids.  From about 20 yards it was still the size of a baseball.  We heard nothing until it was on the retreat, almost like it went right to my friend to scan or investigate and then hit a thruster to move at such a pace, and then we only saw it for a moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any leads or sights for me to investigate I would be very appreciative.  I have been searching for some theory or info and am at a loss. I&#39;m not crazy. I have a need for answers. If you had been there you would be at a loss as well.

I had my digital camera and just started taking pictures of where it had been as I kept driving. I saw nothing except traces in the sky like smoke or rocket trails. When I downloaded the pictures I found 5 or 6 photos of the UFO with two pictures showing smoke circles and a zig zag pattern in the sky. It must have been traviling real fast because the camera caught what I could not see. It was a ball of fire with a black object in the center. I am very pleased with these photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was between 2-3am and there was about 6 of us. Before we all jumped the fence (getting into trouble), we sent two people over first to check out the area and make sure there wasn&#39;t any one around.  The building is very old and is next to a lot of bush and farmers fields but yet close enough to town.  Security and the cops would check it out once and awhile to make sure it&#39;s not being vandalized, so we were always cautious.  Myself and a friend were chosen to take a quick look, so we hopped over and headed for the building.  We stuck close to the walls so we weren&#39;t in the open, we walked, talked and goofed around like the usual, but at the same time being very aware of our surrounds and ready for anything.  Coming around the back of the building, suddenly we heard t! he bushes move to the left of us.  My friend and I turned to the left and I swear to God.... a 4-5 foot greyish blackish stalky creature or something was standing there looking at us. It looked at us for 2-3 seconds then we ran the fastest we&#39;ve ever ran. I was very scared and It all happened so fast, but we both saw it...  It had a head, a body, arms, hands, and was standing straight up.  The head looked like a huge mushroom with eyes on the lower sides, we only got a 2-3 second glimpse before we ran.  When we got back to the guys we were freaking out ALIEN ALIEN but of course everyone laughed there butts off.  Knowing what we saw we started to walk back home through the field when suddenly lights as bright as LED lights started going though the field.  They were very low to the ground and very fast, and you couldn&#39;t hear a sound which ruled out a quad or a farmers combine.  We kept low in the grass and hurried our way back into town, never thinking anything of it, except for my ! friend and I. We saw something that night, something not human! nor animal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never spoke of this to anyone besides my parents until now.  Believe this story or not I know what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was no drinking or intake of drugs whatsoever. We are guessing this took place around 1:30 am but do not know the time for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular in shape. The object hovered about 50 yards over a house in Henrietta. The middle was dark red (lit up) and the outside trim changed from light blue to dark blue. It stayed in one spot for about six seconds and then moved to the left for about six seconds then right for about five or six seconds and then it took off to the northeast which is where it came from and was out of sight. This all happened at unbelieveable rates of speed. When the object took off it did wake birds that were in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
