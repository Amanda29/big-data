The sky was very clear, no clouds. The object was a very bright white light. The size was approximately 4 times bigger than a regular star in the sky on this night.  It also seemed to have beams of white light coming off of it, and traveling in a southeast direction going about 40 to 50 mph. The object was silent, and moving in a straight line for about 2 minutes. Then the object shot straight up in to the sky at very high speed and then vanished.  As the bright light shot up into the sky, the light also faded and it vanished within about 2 seconds.<n>

While in my front yard I looked up at the stars for awhile.  I looked towards the west at the Big Dipper, and noticed a star that began moving west to east.  It passed through the Big Dipper between where the handle and pot meet, or between the 3&#39;rd star of the handle, and the 4&#39;th star (where pot starts).  It continued to come closer to me, and as it did it became bright, then back to the brightness of the rest of the stars, and bright again.  It continued to get bright and normal bright as it got closer to me.  It almost was overhead when another light crossed behind it going south to north.  This one changed colors, red, white, yellow, blue, not necessarily in that order.  This one was smaller compared to the white light I first observed.  After the smaller one crossed behind the white object that remembled a star moving, the white round object simply disappeared!  It was if it turned off i! t&#39;s white light.  The smaller round object disappear about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/31/11 21:22|Castro Valley|CA|Light|Approx 5 min|Moving from the west in a south or south east direction - small single white object dimmed and disappeared|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83618.html|8|ndxe201108| Moving from the west in a south or south east direction - small single white object dimmed and disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 9:20 pm tonight,I was out front on our driveway waiting for my wife to come home from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As usual while out front, even though we have a street light in front of the house and there&#39;s a lot of light from Castro Valley and the surrounding cities like Hayward, San Leandro, San Lorenzo and Oakland, you can still see most of the brighter stars in the sky - like the Big Dipper, Orion&#39;s Belt and some of the Zodiac signs.  There&#39;s been a couple times over the last several months that I&#39;ve seen something strange, but I am not about to say it was a UFO - as I was alone with my dog and I know it was not a meteor or a plane.  At any given time you can see on an average of about 7 to 8 aircraft at any given time in different parts of the sky around the SF Bay Area, most have just their navigational lights on and a few occasionally have their landing lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, like before, I was looking up towards the west (approx 264 degrees) and I saw that I thought was a bright star or possibly be a planet, then I looked down and saw my wife&#39;s car coming down the street and turn and start to park out on the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While she was doing this I returned and looked to the west at this &#34;object&#34; but it wasn&#39;t a star, it was small like one of them but it was more of a bright white color and appeared closer than the &#34;normal&#34; stars, and it was moving sorta towards our general direction (which I later determined to be towards the south or south east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife walked up the drive way I didn&#39;t turn to look at her, instead I kept my eye on the object and it was continuing to move - not real real fast, but appeared to be maybe the speed of a plane or a little faster. When she asked what I was staring at, I told her I don&#39;t know that that is up there, I told her I didn&#39;t see any navigational lights on it and she looked up and with her typical doubt she said it&#39;s probably a plane. I was just about to agree when it started to get dimmer, like someone hit a switch and it dimmed real low and you could still see it but there was a definate difference in brightness.  I told her look, it&#39;s getting dimmer and as we both watched it seemed like it was going up and got dimmer and then totally disappeared. We both looked for about 15 to 20 seconds trying to find it but it was not there - this was at approx 9:25pm. She then said mayby it WAS a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was NOT a plane, the only plane that I have seen that would do something similar to his is the U2 Spy Plane and Nasa still uses them, I&#34;ve seen them take off numerous times at the old Navy Moffett Field in San Mateo County over the years - saw one not more than mayby 1 month ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was NOT a meteor, I&#39;ve seen hundreds, if not maybe a thousand, over the years in the US, Korea, and Germany, I&#39;ve seen them do all kinds of different things but they do NOT go up!<n>

You could see six to eight square windows a lot like stereotypical Uris.  They moved silently and smoothly such that they appeared over the lake and travelled across in about thirty seconds.  They travelled in pairs.<n>

The object seemed unusual as it resembled a ball of orange/yellow fire traveling very quickly and gave off no sound.  I hurried inside to call my family to observe this “phenomenon” but before they could come outside the object disappeared. Less than 30 seconds later after explaining to them what I had seen, another object of the same description was sighted, followed by several others all moving in a straight light with a 10 second interval between each of them.  About 10 of them were sighted.  My sister managed to get video footage of the sighting. With zoom the object looked like an orb with rotating lights about its axis as it moved across the sky. We were not afraid, just amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This evening as we were walking my wife Saw an object moving very slowly and very low (150 feet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was unlike anything reported anywhere else. It had a large red light on the front of it which was also white in the center and it was diamond shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a vertically oriented disk that the light was mounted to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft of approximately 15 feet in diameter moved at a constant rate of about 3 meters per second from right to left of us for distance of about 100 feet and stopped.  It rotated on its vertical axis and commenced forward heading away from us.  When it rotated it difd so with precision.  It traveled a short distance, stopped and rotated 90 degrees making a square and traveled past the tree line and we lost visual.  The conditions were: clear night, temp was 75 degrees, wind 0 - 3 knots, range of 800 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire duration of observation there was absolute silence except for some crickets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal note:  This observation was close and provided such unaided detail that I could see the edge of the vertical &#39;backboard&#39; and could estimate its thickness to be approximately 8 inches thick.  That craft being that close scared the heck out of us.  I&#39;ve worked in the military and commercial engineering field for overy 30 years, manned and unmanned and I know it&#39;s not terrestrial.  They&#39;re definately eatching us.<n>

We were up there for about an hour or so just looking at the view and when it started to get dark we decided to head back.  We were just about to get on the ATV when a Bright light in the sky caught our attention.  At first we thought it was a star, but it wasn&#39;t dark enough yet for stars.  Then the object started moving fast and silently. It had no tail behind it, it was just a bright Star-like object.  It also wasn&#39;t blinking at all it was one solid light. Just before the object got to the Horizon it changed directions, and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then tried to start my ATV and couldn&#39;t. It was making a sound like a bunch of rocks spinning in a metal fan.  Then we saw a plane heading off in the same direction that the object was in.  These two things were probably a coincidence but it made the event a lot stranger.<n>

Worth via Tulsa, Ok.  This witness was on vacation in Oregon for a week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arrival in Klamath Falls, Oregon... this investigator was surprised to hear that his old USAF friend had witnessed a UFO about an hour out from the arrivial at Portland International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is the email that was sent on 14 Sep 2011 by the witness;  (WITNESS EMAIL; UFO was flying SE @ about 30,000 ft. at an incrediable speed, was white in color and elongated like a missile shape maybe 100 ft. in length.  Sitting on right side of plane and saw UFO to the right and below me approx. 1 mile away at about 4pm.  Skies were clear with some clouds UFO entered clouds and vanished from sight.)   Because of the time change, this would have been 3pm Mountain and 2pm Pacific time.  This investigator spoke in depth with the witness, who was not only a USAF veteran of 4 years as a firefighter, but a former city police officer from California.  This investigator also served 3 years with witness in the USAF at the same base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some addtional information. Witness was flying in from Dallas/Ft. Worth on American Airlines flight 453 which was to land in Portland, Or. at approx. 3:05pm.  Which would of put the time of the sighting Pacific Time about 2pm. Witness was amazed at the speed the object was traveling, which would of been SE to his NW direction of flight.  His duration of the sighting was about 4-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This investigator showed the witness a still photo of the Salida, Co. UFO. Witness confirmed that his sighting was simular to that incident, as far as shape and color.  Witness stated that the speed was too fast for any conventional aircraft, including military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This investigator calculated Flight 453 was flying at an estimated speed of 500-570 mph which at the time of the sighting, the witness was over the Idaho/Utah border just north of Salt Lake City, about 500 miles from Portland, Oregon, plus or minus 100 miles about in the area of Interstate 84 and 15 at the Idaho/Utah border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Investigator also noticed from the UTAH map, that the Utah Test and Training Range was also in this general area, as well as the Dugway Proving Grounds. Most of this wide vast area is under the control of the U.S. Military.<n>

There are two military bases close to us..  One being an army base less than a mile away the other an Airforce base 70 miles away... I would like to have an answer on this.

It was coming from the east and heading west.  It started heading south and then turned back to head east.  It stopped and hovered over my porch.  It was lower than a normal airplane and made less noise than an airplane would.  It did not make the same sound as a helicopter. When it stayed above my head, higher than my house, but lower than a normal airplane for a moment, I noticed that the one bright light was three.  It was shaped like a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside briefly to grab my son and husband.  We came out side and watched it hover for a moment and head back southwest.  It went towards the main city, but moved back southeast.  It circled an area before it became out of sight.<n>

It was relatively low in the sky considering the size of the craft. It had a large circular white light near the each tip (so 3 in total) and had a medium to small sized red light in the center.  If I had to guess its size I&#39;d say it was at least 150 to 200 feet across.  It made a sound like thunder, no where near as loud as thunder and it was a constant rumble but thunder is the closest sound I can compare it to. It absolutely was NOT a jet engine nor a propeller engine. My father was in the Air Force, I was born on an air force base and have been to more air shows then I can count.  I am also an avid night fisherman however I have never seen anything like this.  It was in view for only 20 to 30 seconds because of the tree lines on each side of me.  Its speed was slower then I would have thought something that big should have been going without being much louder, at max it was g! oing 100 to 200 mph.  It moved in a perfect straight line and never changed elevation.<n>

The light one the right side rappidly decended out of the sky.  I mean straight down as if it were dropped.  Minutes later the one bright light was still in the sky, I got my cousins and there friends and we watched the object for 20 minutes.  I called some friends who also saw the object. We tried to take a camera phone photo and video, but the only thing that showed up on the video and photos were planes.  The remainig object object slowly pulsed light and would occasionally dim. It appeared to be slightly turning. A friend of mine who was closer to this object said there were multiple lights on the object, from my vantage point it was just a big bright light.  The brightest light I have seen in the night sky.  The eastern sky was clear of any clouds and stars. The object slowly moved upward and down, but did not drop as the other object did. Regrettably we stopped watching it after 1 &amp; 1/2 hours.  When I went to look again around 2am it was gone. A few other people have told me that they too saw it that night. On a side note I do not believe in aliens or none of that, so there has to be a logical explaination for what we saw. I have not seen any news reports on this occurance.  We are fairly disturbed by this, hopefully you have some answers for us. Thank You<n>

The report that I am referring to is the one that is sited below...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 8/15/2011 22:00 (Entered as : 08/15/2011 22:00) Reported: 8/15/2011 9:15:19 PM 21:15 Posted: 8/21/2011 Location: Boise, ID Shape: Circle Duration:5 minutes high flying thing  I happen to go out in the back yard and watched this thing. It was moving from south west to north east. No blinking lights and it was just between a plane and a satellite. What moves like that? If it was a satellite it would have changed its brightness and be in a polar orbit. No way it was a meteor. No plane flies this fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note: ISS over-flight at 21:57 hrs.; SW to NE. PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also live in Boise, Idaho and have seen these lights as well on numerous occasions.  The reason that I am disputing the claim that what was seen is the ISS, is due to the fact that on the evenings that I witness these lights I sometimes see multiple lights within an hour of each other, or sometimes within minutes of each other.  They are not always traveling from the Southwest to the Northeast.  Over a period of about two years I have seen these same objects, and I have also witnessed them traveling from due South, to due North.  I have also seen them bend their trajectory, and alter their velocity from slow to very fast.  These objects appear at first as a very bright white light, (sometimes amber in color), and appear to be intelligently controlled.  They travel along at a steady velocity, and then fade in their intensity, then just simply blink out and disappear.  These objects are moving far too slowly to be a meteorite, and far too fast to be an airplane.  They appear! to be above the upper atmosphere, as there is absolutely no sound associated with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects are one solid color.  (As I mentioned above, white or amber).  There are no FAA lights on them whatsoever. (Red,Green, or strobing). I usually see them between 22:00 and 24:00 Hours.<n>

It was quite large, about 1000 feet hovering NO noise at all...after I got out of car it started to move slowly away and then abruptly disappeared.  Very weird.  It was cubical in shape and the whole thing pulsated from yellow to orange to red...no blinking or individual lights. Whole thing glowed.  Don&#39;t know what it was but it sure was not an aircraft, balloon, helicopter, flare, meteor, or planet etc<n>
8/30/11 21:45|Bridgewater|MA|Chevron|1-2 seconds|chevron object with lights north south path in Bridgewater MA almost invisible and really fast|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83579.html|25|ndxe201108| chevron object with lights north south path in Bridgewater MA almost invisible and really fast<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was triangular and about 3/4 of an inch when hand held straight out to the sky. This size was estimated immmediately after the object left view. First spotted at 12:00 position and took about 1.2 to 2 seconds to be obsructed by a tree at about 45 degrees from 12:00.  Travelling north to south (roughly 187 degrees-measured after sighting using the tree as a fixture).  It was triangular and had about 5 lights in a v shape flying point forward.  Was going very very fast with no noise at all.  The sky was perfectly clear with stars.  The object had a traingular shape but it was difficult to focus on any lines or even the lights, I had the impression it was shimmering.  Only had enough time to say &#34;What the **** is that?!&#34; and grab my brohter and point to it before the tree blocked the view. He saw it as well. My brother said it had a glow to its edges but was not &#34;streaking&#34;. It was not very bright at all, almost invisbible, I was just plain lucky to be loo! king at the exact spot where I noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bridgewater is south of Boston and on an approach to Logan. Very hard to tell how high this thing was but it was much higher than the trees and much larger than an airplane and going about half as fast (maybe more) as a meteor would streak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll never forget this or doubt others who have seen similar things. It just left me dumbfounded and not doubting I saw something that did not belong here.<n>

It had what looked like three circular lights in a triangle formation in the very back of the craft and almost seemed to propel the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first seen the craft was overhead in the sky (appeared as high/large as most planes) and silently over the period of roughly 60 seconds disappeared before our eyes.  Normally, planes fly out of sight in the horizon, this craft just continued in a straight flight pattern through the sky, not near the horizon until it was so far away it couldn&#39;t be seen (into space i would describe).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What drew my attention to the craft was it seemed to be traveling faster than the planes we see all the time.  Also their were no blinking lights but three solid lights that were brighter than any plane i&#39;m used to seeing.<n>

I looked up and I said to my friend, &#34;What the hell is that!?&#34;  She said,  &#34;That&#39;s just an airplane.&#34; I said, &#34;That don&#39;t look like an airplane.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m saying this I&#39;m hitting my brakes in my car and trying to watch the road while watching the flying object.  About this time I see a car coming from the other direction.  They hit the breaks and slowed way down as if they were looking at something as well. About that time I pull off a side road to watch it further and my friend yells &#34;THAT&#34;S NOT AN AIRPLANE!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, my friend and I both watched this flying object (which at this point didn&#39;t seem to be getting any further away from us) do a complete 90 degree turn to the right off of the path it was &#34;flying&#34;.  Another characteristic we noticed is that it was squared off in shape and had an arrange! ment of lights at each corner of the square and was noticed by both of us to be moving in an odd way like rolling or tumbling as it flew.  Also, when it did it&#39;s 90 degree turn, we both realized at that moment that there was no possible way that what we were seeing is an airplane, helicopter or anything else of that matter.  It literally scared both of us and sent me home in tears. It was overwhelming.<n>

However it was moving way to slow to be one. It could not have been a helicopter or plane because there was no sound or color lights.  While we trying to figure what it was the bright light started to dim.  The light just went out slowly but the UFO just kept flying. We could just barely see the light and the UFO just stood still for we seconds.  Then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The best way I can discribe it a circular shape of light and a stream of light that looks to he hanging below.  Flashes of color (red and green) can be seen at times.  They hover without hardly moving.  Last night my husband Reyes to convience me it was an odd looking star, but then it began to move (he lost it and startedjumping up and down).  It looked as if it went thru the atmosphere because the light dimmed and disappeared. It was moveing extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know we can&#39;t be the only ones that saw this. Incredible!!<n>

I looked out the window and glanced at the night sky before i started looking at stars and i saw a few stars and a very bright one, i glance at the other side of the sky then look back to the other side to realize the bright star moved from its position a bit so i started looking at it and i saw it was moving. I called my mom over to see it and she saw it as well. What i thought the object was a plane or a helicopter.  The object was as bright as a bright star but a little brighter.  I noticed it didnt have red/green lights or blinking lights like aircraft should have.  I know it wasnt an airplane because im very very interested in airplanes and kknow alot about them of how they look during the day and night and how they sound.  The object was moving in a straight direction (Moving from West to East). I opened the window to hear nothing coming from it.  Then i said in my head &#34; UFO?  Alien life?  Government Test?&#34;. What i felt was anxiousness to know what it was that was just a moving light with no sound. What i did during the sighting was just stand at the window with my mom and watch it till i couldnt see it anymore because of my buildings shape. so the building got in my way to view it longer. After the sighting i went online to search if anyone else saw this before or even when i saw it. A tweet on twitter said &#34;there was a strange light in the sky tonight, not a star but not a helicopter, had no sound just slow moving ball of fire.&#34; Angle of elevation: 75-80 degrees above me Elevatio: About 400-500<n>

It flew faster than any plane or helicopter we have around here.  We saw the lights at about dusk, with mostly clear skies.  lights we bright and at first we thought it was a led kite or two.  Once they turned and started moving, we couldn&#39;t keep up with the direction they were headed before they disappeared over the next town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to get a short video, but it&#39;s such a small glimpse once we found it.

After slowing moving across the sky from South to North.  There was no lights visibly blinking, just an ominous blue glow to it.  Once it spanned a considerable portion of the sky that was visible, it seemed to suddenly accelerate at an alarming rate after a shift in direction, and disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked for binoculours and took a closer look.  The light emitted seemed to be brighter than a star, and larger than anything I have ever seen in the sky, at the distance it was at.  We jumped in our kia soul, and drove to the hilltop, where we seen a plane in the area, which seemed to be going towards this light.  Came back home, and drove to our field, where we took multiple pictures of the light.  We caught it being still AND in motion.<n>

We went out side to take a look and saw two fighter jets moving overhead but not away from the area.  They seemed to be moving around what looked like maybe a plane with no wings.  We could easily make out the details of the jets, but the craft they seemed interested in was a super bright white.  As long or maybe a little longer than the jets, but without wings. The only marking I could see on it was a grey spot at about the middle of the length of the craft that went from the bottom to about half way up the side. The white color was really unusual and really bright.  I didn&#39;t believe in ufos, am ex military so I&#39;ve seen aircraft before, but now I&#39;m not sure what to believe.  Other than myself and my coworker the pilots of the two jets and the pilot of a small single engine plane that passed overhead but below the craft and jets! would have seen this, so I know it was really there.  The white color of this craft may have been the brightest I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

The sky was still dark, dawn has not yet begun.  In the South-East sky, I noticed a bright peculiar light I have never seen before in this region of the sky at this time of night/day. I have observed nighttime skies since I was a child as I have always been fascinated with astronomy. I am familiar with the difference in characteristics between observing a planet, stars, satellites and other celestial objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I observed consisted of a bright, solid, white light with less intense, flickering red and blue lights. At first I thought it was just an airliner, but it was not moving in any direction.  I thought maybe it was flying towards my direction, but after 5 mins, the lights showed no changes in intensity, height or direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe it was a star, as it did not have characteristics as such. I know for a fact it was not a planet, as Venus was high in the Southern sky and very bright.  I continued to observe the object and it appeared to make subtle motion in a back-and-forth looping pattern, but maintained it’s general position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my binoculars to see if I could get a better view.  The object had no direction, but I could see red and blue lights flickering amongst a solid white light.  With the binoculars, I had the depth perception and believe this object was not within our atmosphere, but within the near distance of our solar system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife outside and she observed the object as well and watched through the binoculars.  She said she witnessed a single white light with flickering red and blue lights as I described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch through my binoculars, the object separated and became two lights moving in a horizontal direction from each other.  A few minutes later, the two lights moved back together to become one light again, with the red and blue flickering resuming.  Moments later, the light separated into two lights again and this time they moved vertically from each other.  Then they slowly moved about each other and eventually came together to become just a single light again and resumed the red and blue flickering once more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slowly, the light began to become dimmer and appeared to get smaller as if it was moving away from the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to go get ready for work so could not observe any longer.  I will go outside again tomorrow morning and see if the light returns.  I am not sure what it was, but it was not an object commonly seen in the night sky.<n>
8/30/11 03:30|Pasadena|MD|Flash|7 to 9 seconds|BLUE FLASHES, LIEK CAMERA STROBE, IN PASADENA SKY EARLY TUES.AM/3:30AM/8.30.11|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83586.html|39|ndxe201108| BLUE FLASHES, LIEK CAMERA STROBE, IN PASADENA SKY EARLY TUES.AM/3:30AM/8.30.11<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very early on the morning of 8.30.11, around 3:35am, I saw the same flashes someone in New Carrollton MD saw back on 6.24.11 at 3:00AM.  What struck me is that the individual who posted their description saw word for word exactly what I saw.  That person wrote: “Set of sky flashes lit up entire sky with out any radar anomaly or storm...It looked like the whole sky took a picture, for what seemed like seconds there were two sets of flashes with a pause between the two….There was no sound or bolts of lightning, nothing on the radar, just looked like someone with a really huge planet sized camera took a picture of our planet with flash….flash was bluish- white and looked exactly like a camera flash…”&lt;- Okay, the only difference in that person’s experience and mine is that after I saw the blue flashes, there was a very brief red flash, just one, but it was almost as bright as the blue flashes. This is not he first time I’ve seen anomalies in that area of the sky he! re in Pasadena; this is the 4th time in 5 years we’ve lived here that other-worldly objects make themselves seen to us.  We’ve also seen the same red/orange orbs someone else here in MD described, floating down our street moments after a terrible electric storm in June 2010.  My husband had the presence of mind to grab the camera and have me take pictures.  I chased them down the street until they floated up over the tree line and out over the waters of Stony Creek.  In any event, the encounters have been more frequent and varied, i.e., we’ve not been limited to just one type of experience since moving to Pasadena, and after seeing those huge flashes in the sky last night, I can honestly say I’m uneasy and really want to take the photos to an expert and have them analyzed, but I don’t know to whom I should forward the photos. I didn’t get a photo of the flashes last night, but I have plenty of the other photos….<n>

What my fiance and I saw I still cannot get a full grasp on. What we saw seemed to be rounded with a group of three bright, non-blinking lights in a v shape at the view we had.  It was moving very fast for about 10 minutes and stayed steadily in front of us as we were driving down M-6.  After about a span of watching the craft trying to figure out what kind of airplane it was I pointed it out to my fiance. He was just as confused as I was.  After I had been watching it for about 10 minutes we seemed to be getting closer to it so I assume that it had slowed down.  At the point in which we were almost horizontal from it, it suddenly dropped from the sky. I don&#39;t know if it suddenly landed being that it was not that far off the ground to begin with or just went invisible.  That is what I am entirely confused about. My fiance thinks that it was a ufo and to us it most definitely was because it was unidentifiable to anything we had ever seen.  I, myself believe that it might possibly have been a military aircraft being that the stealth fighter jets are coming out this year.<n>

At first I thought it was a plane because it looked similar in size and had flashing lights.  I then thought to myself that the object, if a plane, was moving at an enormous rate of speed across the sky and then suddenly it came to a complete stop and just hovered there for approx 10min before suddenly disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Growing up near an airport I&#39;ve seen prob 1000&#39;s of planes and have never seen anything with that kind of speed nor have I ever seen anything come to a complete stop like that.<n>

We assumed it was a plane, or helicopter, or cell phone tower. However, it appeared to be moving.  The night was completely cloudless and we had a very good view of the object. At one point it looked like it was right beside us and very low in the sky.  I told my friend to pull over so we could see if we could hear helicopter propellors, but when we pulled over it disappeared suddenly.  We pulled back onto the road and continued for approximately 3 minutes when the object reappeared very far away in the distance near the mountains.  We know it was the same object because it was much brighter than any stars in the sky and seemed to be nearer to the earth.  Again, we seemed to get right under the object, but it completely disappeared and we didn&#39;t see it again.<n>

While looking at the stars I observed a Y-shaped or triangular object in the sky overhead, traveling westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had four lights, one at each tip and one in the center.  The lights were not particularly bright but they were steady, not blinking, and appeared white-yellow in color.  The lights were on a solid object that blocked out stars as it passed.  The individual lights were not separate objects.  The object made no sound.  It was difficult to accurately judge size, altitude and speed, but it appeared to be very high and larger than a jetliner. The speed was faster than a normal jet aircraft but slower than a satellite, and much slower than a meteor.  The object did not leave a contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for about 15 to 20 seconds, then went in the door and grabbed binoculars from the table. I was back outside in less than ten seconds but the object was gone. There were some scattered clouds but that portion of the sky was clear. The moon was in its new phase and was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a scientist and an avid stargazer.

I usually take a smoke break at about 10. I, in fact, looked at the clock before I went out.  My job runs on keeping track of times, so I know it was 10. I usually like to go the the roof of our building so I can stargaze and the roof offers the least amount of street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking in the direction of the big dipper when I saw a large orange light (orb?) floating upwards.I thought for sure it was a star, then I kept watching and it slowly started floating up. I could tell because a star to the left of it was a reference point I used. It was floating very slowly-if I didn&#39;t have that star to the left I wouldn&#39;t have thought it was anything but a star.  There were some clouds in the area and it seemed to go into a cloud. -or vanished.  I stuck around and lit another smoke to see if I would see anything else-or to see it pop back out of the cloud-I could see the top of the cloud. It never came back out of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a solid light, no flickering or pulsing. I got very excited during the sighting, I was hoping to watch more.  I gave myself another 10 minutes to look but never saw anything in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did go back out to the roof about an hour later to see if I was just looking at a star, but the clouds had moved and there was no stars like what I&#39;d seen.<n>

I had just passed Ave L and a small house on the side of the road to my right (in the direction toward 60th).  Through my peripheral vision I could see an object moving quickly toward the ground in a straight line. I turned to look at it since it caught my attention. The object was emanating many colors, I couldn&#39;t tell what color it was exactly, it was as if it was cycling through many colors at once. There was no point from which lights were coming, the whole object was THAT color or colors all at once as it moved, it wasn&#39;t SHINING and it didn&#39;t project any beams of light.  The object looked to be round in shape however not a sphere, more like a donut shape or a wheel but no hole in the middle or at least I couldn&#39;t see one it moved too fa st. Once it reached near the ground I lost sight of it for a split second as if it disappeared completely. Then it reappeared and moved straight back up. Not at an obvious an! gle like a plane or any angle I could tell.  Simply straight back up.  I was still moving toward the object the entire time (which was about 3 seconds).  Once I saw it moving up toward the sky I tried leaning forward to look and see if I could catch it again but it was already gone. The object had only been gone for a second when my phone started beeping low battery, that scared me further. I had also heard a static noise when I first saw the object, I was talking over speaker phone and over my car&#39;s speakers so when I heard the static it was quite noticeable.  The distance from me in my car driving toward it at around 65 mph to where it was is probably about a football field in length, it wasn&#39;t very far but it wasn&#39;t close enough that I could see many more details and it didn&#39;t linger. It was a very scary few moments.<n>

It went out of site again and from the southwest, two fighter jets were then seen flying due west, then turned north over Lake Huron.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light moved about 1 mile north (which took it about 2 minutes), and then stopped moving.  After about 4 minutes, the light changed to an orange/pink colour, and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It makes no noise at all and travels not as fast as a satellite much higher in the sky.  They have been moving West to East and you can view them for about 5 minutes when they start losing their brightness and then gently disappear from view.

One or two hours in the flight when it was still quite light outside (I can’t remember exactly but I think it was around sunset time however it was hard to say since we were travelling through time zones).  We were flying over the USA and I’m not sure exactly what state we were over at the time, but my brother and I were casually looking out the window on the left hand side of the plane when we were at quite a high altitude and spotted a foreign object quite a bit away in the distance, towards the right hand side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot remember the shape exactly but it was a dark colour, possibly black.  I had originally assumed it was another plane however, it had quite a jerky motion.  It puzzled me a bit, but then I saw something very astonishing: It had a beam.  It was a dark coloured shadow type of beam and it was changing direction quite rapidly.  The angle of the beam kept alternating, moving towards the left at an almost 180 degree angle and then straight away moving to the right hand side at an almost 180 degree angle. It kept this up for about 20 seconds, and then the object zoomed across the sky till it was opposite the centre of my window, and then continued to move in a direction away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was witnessed by my mother, my brother and quite possibly a few others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went to the bathroom, checked on my son and then proceeded to close the window in my bedroom that looks out onto the St.Croix River.  I marveled at the sounds from the storm and watched the tree next to my deck sway in the wind.  Then the sky lit up where a cloud was over the water, it glowed red in a circular shape and a sound came from the direction of the cloud 3 times.  Then it stopped.  The sky lit up 2 more times after this with the same glowing red and same sound.  Then the power went off. This occurred around 5:15am on August 29,2011.

When i looked up i saw 3 lights that were blinking red, white, and green. they were zipping back and forth up and down so it couldnt have been a plane or helicopter. at one point all 3 stopped and formed a triangle in the sky and each had two white lights blinking with a red one at the top (thats how i could tell it was triangular) and did this for about half a minute. i then ran inside and grabbed a coworker and pulled him out to look at it. when we got back there were two still there and they were zipping bakcand forth blinking again. then the third showed up again. at this point it was about 9 o clock PM central time and my coworker had to clock out. he went home, but then about 5 more of my coworkers came out and watched it as well. after a while they just stood in place!  2 of them dissappeard gradually one by one until one was there and it was blinking red and white. it then dissappeared as well.  Then we all went inside again. I clocked out of work at 9:30 and did not see anything on my drive home.As for the description of the witnesses,  -  One female about 45 - another woman about the same age - 16 year old male - another 16 year old male - 18 year old male - middle aged male - another middle aged male   The two women in there 40&#39;s and the two middle aged men have all had some sort of further education to the best of my knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more detail is none of us had cameras and could get a video or picture. we tried with cellphone cameras but they werent good enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we started seeing these the street lights in the parking lots started going out.<n>

I was walking through the public park and noticed half a dozen or so white lights, which I initially presumed where stars, even although they looked strangely close, say no higher than a helicopter would fly and were in a perfect horizontal formation.  So, I stopped and paid closer attention to them using my binoculars and noticed a red glowing light in the middle and that it was clearly some kind of stationary silent craft.  My dog was pulling on the lead, so it was hard to stay focused on it, but I did see what looked like a shooting star shoot down vertically beside it, just before the craft/ufo slowly started moving in a North Western direction behind some trees.  Honestly!!!... I really couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing, hence, coming on here and trying to make sense of it ?<n>

My best example of this would be when a really strong hurricane, or gusts of wind knock out the transformers and you see large,green flashes of light.  That&#39;s basically what I saw(and trust me,we deal with the Santa Ana&#39;s out here) one after another, but they weren&#39;t green. They were a light bluish hue,and dimmed to white on the outer edges of the flashes.  Lasted about 2-4 seconds?

I continued to watch the object as I drove down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I stopped at a light, I opened my windows to see if there were any more objects in the sky.  Behind me, approximately a block away, I saw two more of the same objects traveling in the same direction as the first keeping a steady distance between them.  The first object that seemed to be leading the way looked about twice as big as the other two and twice as bright.  It did not keep a constant speed the entire time.  It did seem to almost stop on two occasions and also accelerate very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then seemed to hover for about 20 seconds, drop down slightly, it got a little brighter then I guess you can say it faded out very quickly. I could not see it travel away; it just got smaller and smaller until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The o! ther two objects we still in the sky when this happened, moving just as they were before. I then turned around so that I would be able to see them better.  Unfortunately they did travel to where there were buildings in the way of my view so I did not see where they went from there.  I was able to get a very short video of the one. It is not a very good quality since it was on my cell phone and I was also moving at the time.<n>

We knew it was not a plane because it was not flashing!  As we follow it we see a smaller red light fly to it and flash, then they both vanish. Now this was odd right?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, last month we saw the same thing from our porch along with our children and there friend, but this time the small red light went underneath the bright white one and made a flash, then the bright white one shot up in the sky and both vanished. Tonight we will be watching the skies around 845 pm to see if we can see it again.... I am now a believer.. I was before but this just really made our mouth drop! Anyone else that saw this please write about it.. Thank you Oh one more thing, down below these crafts were a jet liner and wow was it slower and smaller in comparison....<n>

It can be confirmed by the fact that I made a facebook posting about it immediately afterwards asking if anyone else had just seen the sky. I just happened to go to this website today, (almost a year later) to see if maybe anyone had reported something. I typed in &amp;quot;Perkasie 2011&amp;quot; and I saw a post and the date. I did not remember the date so I went back and checked my facebook postings. I posted my comment on August 26th 2011. Same date. I never thought about ufo&#39;s prior to this incident- so it did not occur to me to contact anyone. However, it has been bothering me ever since. I was sitting in my living room and I saw something at the corner of my eye which my first reaction to was, &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot;. There is a small airport near here so my first thought was that perhaps a plane was on fire nearby. I said to my husband, &amp;quot;what is that?&amp;quot; He went to the window, stood there for what seemed! like a long time and then said &amp;quot; I have no idea what that is.&amp;quot; This really scared me, and I went on my front lawn and looked up. There were multiple lights spaced varying distances from each other that would appear and disappear. I first thought they were independent of each other against the sky, but to my total astonishment they suddenly all moved together at a bizarre speed to the right. When this happened it was evident the lights were all within the same object -that only became visible because it moved so suddenly to the right. It then just seemed to disappear, perhaps backwards at an impossible speed?? Whatever this object was would have had to been gigantic - I had chills and was completely frightened. Flood/search lights came on at the airport- or from somewhere, for about 10 minutes following this... if anyone can explain this, I would really appreciate it- because it makes no sense to me. Thanks!<n>

Noticed a very bright yellow/orange object moving east/west. Thought it might be a plane, but it was too bright.  Light was emitting from the front, but not the sides (like the wingspan of an insect).  As it proceeded to fly overhead, the light suddenly went off. It was high enough that it was momentarily lost in the clouds.  Still could see a small faint red light circling around the dark object.  Then, it started to &#34;fall&#34;, descending closer to us. The faint light disappeared. Now the object appeared to be only a few hundred feet above.  This time it looked like the object was atom-shaped.  There was a dark mass in the center, with three &#34;spheres&#34; orbiting around the object.  It also seemed to have condensed into a 4 x 4 foot object (which is strange because when it was higher in the sky it looked like it could have been a plane).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it could potentially land somewhere, so we started sprinting towards the direction of the object, but lost it in the house lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried walking around the neighborhoods, but because it is a suburban area, most backyards are fenced and we couldn&#39;t see.  There was also a wooded area nearby where it could have possibly landed.  We couldn&#39;t find anything and no one seemed to be outside, which was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object moved back and forth at a fairly good speed, much faster than we drove which was about 70 miles an hour.  The object was multiple colors, at times all blue with a few white lights, sometimes mostly red.  We could also see the shadow of the body which was disk like.  As we continued to drive I watched through the back window with my 11 year old son.  We noticed it jet straight up in the air and then drop like a rock toward the ground before stoping and then moving in other directions.  We continued to watch for about 5 minutes until it was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As Hurricane Irene approached NY I found a cctv camera that is about 5 miles from my boat to monitor the storm, flooding, wind.....  The camera i was monitoring is at Defeo Marina and can be viewed live at their website.  At about 2:30 pm on Sunday i logged into the camera to check the flood conditions.  I witnessed a large silver round disc type object in the sky over the flooded bay. I watched it live for a few minutes as it hovered in the same spot rotating around.  My first thought was that someone might be launching a weather balloon but i soon realized that the object had lines and a structure that didn&#39;t look like a balloon. I took 3 screenshots of the live camera view. the 3 screenshots were taken about 10 seconds apart. It appears in the pictures that you can see the craft rotating toward the camera.  I spoke to the marina to see if the live cam is recorded but it is not.  At the time of this sighting m! ost of the area was evacuated and no planes were flying in or out of ny airports.<n>

This was during a hot summer day, the sky had no clouds, the perfect day for swimming. As I managed to keep myself afloat with a poorly performed backstroke, I was gazing up at the sky. Swimming closer to the shore on my back, I continued to gaze upward, when something once again, an orb like UFO caught my eye. It wasn&#39;t like a light orb, but rather a gray solid mass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a plane or jet or helicopter, as it made no sound. It moved slowly, but was not a balloon or anything and was quite far up there to be a balloon. Plus it was entirely round. I took another moment to look at it, but became immediately unnerved – I didn&#39;t think it was dangerous, I, like most humans, just get a little creeped out by the unknown – and turned over to swim on my stomach back to shore. This is going to sound weird, but I did not point it out to my sisters once I got back to camp – I didn&#39;t want to freak them out, but even more than that I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d believe me. But again, I was just creeped out that I tried to push it out of my mind for the time being and didn&#39;t see the UFO again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With all of the UFOs I&#39;ve seen, I&#39;ve had no missing time, no weird marks on my body, no weird “powers”, no strange memories or dreams. I have no clue what they were or are, only what they were not and through process of elimination, those objects were either nothing that we – we being humans – have, or that we – we being the general society of the USA and the rest of the world – know of. They could have been natural phenomena that I cannot explain, but I personally think that these objects did not seem organic or natural and that at least one – if not all – of them even seemed to be controlled by an intelligence. The only thing I can think of is that they are either of these suggestions, or a combination of the following conclusions: they belong either to a certain group of people in the government who isn&#39;t letting the rest of the world in, on their technology, or the objects are from someone or something else.<n>

The colors were red, green, blue and yellow,  It looked like a christmas decoration.  The two of us couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.  We woke up our tenants and asked them to come out and look in the telescope.  They saw exactly what we saw.  It was moving very slowly.  We had to keep adjusting the telescope.  We all watched it for about an hour. There were also some smaller red lights moving around it after about 45 minutes of watching it. I did call our local police department to ask if anyone reported this sighting.  The police dispatcher said no. The night was clear and we did see many stars.

Around 2am I went outside our tent to use the restroom.  I was star gazing for a few moments and noticed one of the &#34;stars&#34; was moving slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rubbed my eyes and cleaned my glasses and watched for a good 5 minutes.  While intensely viewing the star I quickly began noticing two separate faint blue lights flashing in and out in an orbit like way around the &#34;star&#34;.   Yet, the slight movement of the start that that originally caught my eye was in fact darting towards each flash of faint blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this for several minutes before going back to the tent.  The &#34;star&#34; was extremely high in the sky, perhaps in space itself or the upper atmosphere.  For as high as the light objects were I believe that the slight movements the star made towards the blue lights must have been extremely fast, as it was moving back and forth, stopping, and then shifting toward another blue light repeate! dly.<n>

I saw a reddish bright something and wondered what it was, real low in the sky over the sound.It then appeared to get brighter and there was three distinct areas of light, flashing red to green in no pattern,I thought it must be a satellite, but then realized it was motionless.  I turned to look away to readjust my eyes after staring at it for a few minutes and when I looked back at it I turned my head to the side and the plane of the object then moved in the same direction.  This kind of freaked me out and I decided to test this out by moving my head to the other side and the object turned again to the side I turned to.I then decided it might be a good idea to go inside and I grabbed my keys and went to see some friends.When I went outside to get in my car,  I looked again and it was no longer there.I was not doing drugs, have 20/20 vision and had only 2 drin! ks earlier in the evening.I am not sure what this can be. It was very strange and I have never seen anything like it. I was wondering if anyone else noted this.<n>

The brightness and color of the object was what first caught my attention.  It was brighter than an aircraft landing light would be if the aircraft was moving directly toward the observer.  This object was moving from directly overhead of us when first noticed, to due south, until it flickered a few times and disappeared approximately 45 degrees above the southern horizon. The color was a brilliant red-orange and never faded or lost intensity as it moved away from us.  The object was silent.  The color and brightness was absolutely striking. I live two miles from the airport and landing aircraft pass directly over my home several times per day.  I am very familiar with landing aircraft and this was not an aircraft.   I also enjoy amateur astronomy and seldom miss an ISS flyby or a meteor showe! r.  This was not a meteor or satellite. The comparable size of the object was approximately that of a large aspirin tablet held at arms length.<n>

He thought it was a helicopter, but had no sound.  He came in the house to get me and by the time I reached the out door a object was a couple of miles up in the air.  All I was able to see was this orange light with a halo effect around it.  It stayed at that height for about a min. another one appeared from the west at about the same height.  A friend of ours took out his camera phone and by the time he was able to try to get a picture, it was too far away.  The lights went straight up in the air until you couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  It moved silently and very fast.  There was no drinking or drugs involved in the evening.  We had as a matter of fact just had a late dinner.  And my husband went out side to see his friend off.<n>

Those lights had no sound like a plane and we estimate an altitude of 2000+ feet.  We never seen something like that before, at first we thought on military aircraft on formation , but later we discard the theory due the lack of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted other family member that were at about 3 miles from our position and they were able to spot the lights as well.<n>

The stars were positioned just like a colon : they smoothly and quickly rotated in a clockwise fashion, very uniformly and ended up looking like two periods ..  then they separated away from each other simultaneously.  At first I thought it might be aircraft but the lights where not blinking.  One headed easterly and the other westerly and then disappeared. It was too high in the sky to be the road. Any astronomical phenomenon that sounds like this?<n>

It looks like a bright star in the sky but has bright lines coming down from it.  Moves in the sky darting in different directions but within a 2 hour period it disappears.  We have seen this quite frequently this summer (probably about 5 days out of seven).  It has just recently changed in appearance from just darting, to having streaming lights coming down from it.  On 3 occasions, the sky below it vibrates a light that looks like a white flasher.  It flashes like a police car light and is in the area below it.  Sometimes it is all white and at other times viewing it with or without binoculars it has red, blue and green coming from it.  If you look at it from another area, you would think it was just a star.  I think our location with the trees makes it visible to see how much it moves in the sky.  Would welcome someone to come look at it.  It&#39;s out there frequently ev! en when there are clouds and no other stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Very rural area of Ohio.  No significant airports in the area.  No other aircraft seen in the area at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our position – in back yard of residence seated looking generally westward.  Not totally dark yet but nearly.  Weather clear, low humidity day, light winds generally out of the west  Witnesses 4 adults ages 53, 51, 51, 50. Two male/Two female – All four of us with college degrees, one a city councilman, 2 males corporate business owners.  Myself – I am an engineer who worked for McDonnell Aircraft company for many years.  Well versed in historic and modern civilian and military aircraft as well as astronomy and meteorology.  This was unlike any explainable night flying object I have seen.  The creepy part is that it made no sound and there were 3 lights/objects in a series.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shape/Color of objects (3 of them) - and bright red/orange glowing color and seemed to be changing/flowing but not pulsating, nor were any specific lights seen on the object, ball like shape.  There were no typical aircraft lights seen (ie like the typical red green or white beams, beacons or strobes)  Event – occurred at ~21:05 eastern time 1.	Noticed bright light but still distant light coming into field of view off to our right front (Northwest) and assumed it to be an airplane of some type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  Continue to observe increasingly brighter light and started to notice its shape and color (red/orange and seemed to be changing/flowing but not pulsating, ball like shape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  Next noticed a second and then a third object appear the same shape size and colors.  All then appeared to be equidistant from each other, but one following the other ( ie 3 in a row).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  They continued to track to the south getting to a due west position from our vantage point.   At this point the 4 of us were rather mystified by the shape and color of the objects.  They made no audible sound either propeller or jet.  There was ~ 5-7 seconds of time between each object 5.	The objects continued to track due south and toward the southwest of our position until we lost sight of them behind trees.  General track of their travel seemed to be from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.  Managed at the last minute to capture a cell phone photo of the third object before going out of our view (sending via email)   The objects traveled a steady pace/speed as would a light aircraft if following the same pattern.  The altitude basically level/constant the whole viewing.   Possible altitude of 4 – 6,000 feet.  Believe that distance from our position at closest to the west was between 1-2 miles.<n>

I then looked in a more southerly direction and they were over in that direction also.  Most start at a point in sky and angle down from right to left.  Some were going straight up and some actually did loops.  A couple of times I&#39;d see them appear to stop and turn sharply and go the other way.   Trees still block lower sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I went out into the yard and to my surprise I was able to pick them out almost everywhere I looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This made me think that maybe they were bats or birds with town lights reflecting but bats wouldn&#39;t and they just don&#39;t fly like birds.   Tried to imagine they were moths but they sure don&#39;t fly like moths either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t know how many nights it may continue<n>

I automatically assumed it was a firework due to the richness of the color and it was descending just above the top of a wooden fence that separates his property from the next.  I stood up, and informed my friend, who immediately turned around to look. The entire sighting lasting 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was asking him what it was it changed course and began to increase altitude and rapidly descended and ascended in successive fashion, too fast for me to count how many times.  All the while, the object changed color in a very fluid motion from red at first, to gold, green, amber and possibly blue, but not too sure.  While the object was changing colors, it was also changing shapes, going from what I would describe as a teardrop, to a sphere, to almost seeming to flatten out. It then proceeded to head west away from our location towards and probably past CA-99. I caught about 10 seconds or so of this object on my cell phone camera, although by the time I began recording, It was already heading away and had stopped changing colors/shape. I could not identify the object, and it was COMPLETELY inaudible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the event, other witnesses that had gathered, along with myself, saw multiple conventional aircraft with flashing lights following the same general flightpath of the object.<n>

I looked up into the eastern sky and I seen a metallic orb traveling south. I had a pair of binoculars with me and took a look.  What I saw was a round metallic orb moving slowly towards the south. I kept looking at it through the binoculars until I lost sight of it.  My girlfriend happen to come out at that time and also seen it. We weren’t sure if it was a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to read my book when ten minutes later I saw another orb from the east traveling towards the south again.  I grabbed my binoculars and observed it.  What I saw was the exact same thing I saw the first time. It was a shiny metallic orb moving slowly towards the south.  I observed it again until I lost sight of it. I was getting excited so I just began to scan the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten to fifteen minutes later another orb appeared from no where in the eastern sky and traveled south. It followed the exact same route as the first two.  I followed this one with the binoculars as well but what I seen next I will never forget.  What I saw was 15-20 metallic orbs stationed in the southern skies.  I thought I saw a couple of black orbs as well.  They all held their position and resembled star constellations only this was in broad daylight.  My girlfriend was present at the time and seen them with the naked eye and did not need binoculars.  It was an incredible sight and I watched them until I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that incredible event I was watching the eastern sky looking for another orb.  Maybe twenty minutes later I saw one final orb traveling the same route as the other three from east to south.  My girlfriend and I will never forget this day.<n>

My husband and I and our dogs were sitting on the patio enjoying the evening air and looking at the star view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband went inside the house and I was sitting on the patio facing North. As I was looking at the sky I noticed an odd colored ball of light coming from the North, going South, it appeared to be orange/red. As it got closer I realized this was not a usual aircraft and ran to the door to call my husband to come out right away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He did and he also saw it. It continued flying, not fast, and in a straight line. As it got closer over our head, I realized it was not round but triangular, with the point facing North, and very bright orange/red glowing light in the middle,there was a white haze surrounding the object,there was no sound,and it was traveling in a straight path, North to South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not going real fast, so the whole incident probably lasted about 3 minutes. I ran inside to get my camera and ran back out and it was already over the tree line. We both have never seen anything like that and were just stunned at what we saw. I called 911 to report it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be about 4 times smaller than the moon. I couldn&#39;t really tell how close it was, but it was close enough for me to recognize that it was triangular shaped. I saw planes flying after it passed and they were much much higher than the object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking straight ahead when it seemed that out of nowhere something appeared. The sun was very bright and it seemed to reflect off of some kind of object, which is why I noticed it. It was large and very bright....it looked metallic with a very odd rectangular shape with sharp points in different spots....almost like a diamond shape. It appeared to be &#34;rotating and hovering&#34; somehow..but did not look like it was &#34;flying&#34;. It was not a plane banking and did not look like any known aircraft that I could distinguish.  It was a very irregular shape. It did not appear to have any lights on it, but it seemed very bright due to what I thought was the reflection of the sun. Our windows were down and could not hear any type of sound or see any type of exhaust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My children were with me and they noticed it also. We watched it for about 30 seconds and as I was just getting ready to pull over to take a picture of it with my cell phone when it &#34;disappeared&#34;. It was literally that quick. There and then gone. I haven&#39;t heard of any other reports in my area lately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should add that I live within close proximity to the &#34;out of operation&#34; Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome...that still has &#34;air traffic&#34;.  That and being within an hour of Syracuse...I see all kinds of planes all the time...and this was NOT a plane.<n>
8/27/11 03:00|Manchester|TN|Light|3 hours|Moving Star moved fast,shot across the sky and came back,hovered and then moved almost like how a snake moves.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83543.html|116|ndxe201108| Moving Star moved fast,shot across the sky and came back,hovered and then moved almost like how a snake moves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 27 2011 flying object witnessed by 5 people from 3 AM until about 5:30 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in the backyard,the sky was very clear and so many stars were out so we decided to get a blanket and lay out and stargaze. We seen 3 shooting stars in about 10 minutes time. Then with 30 minutes we seen about 7 to 8 shooting stars(maybe more) as I lost count because it was really something to see.  I began to question was this normal? Next we witnessed a star moving,the light looked different from a regular star,it&#39;s hard to explain because I have never seen a light source like it.  Possibly similar to the cars with the blueish halogen lights,if you take away the blue hue it was something like that,very vivid,very clear unlike any light I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it moved across the sky in almost a serpentine motion and very fast,we have 2 acres of treed land here so we had to run through the yard to follow it as to not lose it behind a treetop.  It then stopped and hovered and then shot across the sky at a very high speed,like a shooting star,then it appeared to be sea! rching with the snake like movement going side to side as if it was looking for something.  My mind couldn&#39;t believe what my eyes were seeing. Now I think that some if not all of the shooting stars that we witnessed may have been this object all along.  We ended up watching it and running all around the yard for 2 hrs+ It was almost as if the thing was playing with us I know that sounds weird,but it would hover wait for us to run over across the yard and then zip off stop and wait and then move... just very odd to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There seemed to be 3 of these,sometimes they would move so fast it was hard to keep up with more than 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was extremely clear that night,the moon did not show up until just before sunrise,not sure why that is? But I believe it was about 6% full when it did show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, we were all tired from this event so we said our goodbyes and I went in to sleep not long after that a military jet the ones that make the sonic boom noise went over and shook my house.I suspect they were looking for these object(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched all weekend trying to find a video of something like what we witnessed and I came across one that is exactly like what we seen on Youtube. The man known as (Magnetflipper) uses a high powered camera and has actually captured 60+ video&#39;s of these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes* -The moving star stayed high in the sky maybe slightly under the stars -Time seemed to speed up, it seemed like we were outside like 45 mins to an hour we had no idea that it was 5:30ish am until it started getting light outside and we lost the object and someone looked at the actual time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Object(s) moved at incredible speeds with precision movements -there was no sound -we did see 2 planes go over during this time, but they were much lower in relation to the object we were watching -Sometimes it looked like a aura was around the object when it was just hovering -When it would zip off it left a slight trail like a shooting star but the streak would hold a little longer than that of a shooting star giving us time to see where it zipped off to, the trail looked blueish white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -For the record we were not drinking nor doing drugs,we don&#39;t do that anyway but I suspect someone will ask...I know I would if I read this. Just saying.<n>

This semi-orange light did not move, but simply blinked brighter than a normal star and disappeared.  The blink appeared again almost overhead, then after a second or two, appeared again about halfway back towards Jupiter.  It blinked two more times, pausing about a second or two in between, and finally vanished for good.  A review of the photos did not capture the lights as they were just off camera.   Entire duration lasted less than 20 seconds.  Movement was too far and too fast to be a firefly or a conventional aircraft.<n>

I looked up to the south and saw a large aircraft hovering there at a very low altitude close to where the 5 freeway and the 118 freeway meet. It had red and green lights that encircled it so that we could make out the shape to be like a disc and in relation to the landscape it appeared to be much larger than any commercial airplane or helicopter. The lights flashed in a random pattern with an occasional couple of white lights flashing as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to stay stationary and then “jumped” around a few times within a close proximity of itself then began slowly flying north west increasing altitude as it went along. We were able to see it clearly    the whole time and as we approached the McClay Street off ramp the craft accelerated to an incredible speed and within a few seconds was gone from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took as much pictures and videos I could of it.  The object was blinking different colors like red, blue and white.  It moved up and down and sometimes to the side too.

At one point around 10:30, we began walking back to the car. I looked up and noticed three dim red lights ascending slowly into the sky, all in line in an arch.  They seemed all very close to the ground.  Neither of us could figure out what they were since they had no white blinking light or noise to show that it was a legitimate aircraft. We watched as the red lights climbed in the sky, and soon a fourth appeared.  The first red light in line suddenly flickered and disappeared into the sky, followed soon thereafter by the second, third, and fourth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude of the lights were estimated to be around 1,000 feet or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waiting outside the car until nearly 11:00 at night and seeing nothing else, left.<n>

I had never before witnessed any type of a UFO sighting before in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone at my cabin the evening of Fri, Aug 26, 2011.  I had been there all day doing some outside work, and then started a small fire in the late evening.  As my fire died out, I decided to look up at the sky for any shooting starts.  About 10 secs after I looked into the eastern sky, I did see my first shooting star.  I then looked into the western sky and I saw another shooting star, or so I thought. This star was moving west to east laterally, and then just stopped and faded out.  After about 2 or 3 secs, it got bright again, and then moved again, and again faded out. It did this at least 7 or 8 times, moving at a equal distance each time and then fading out again.  It then moved at a upward and outward angle from me, again getting very bright when it first moved, and then fading o! ut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then moved upward in a straight line, then stopping and fading out again. Then in moved inward and upward toward me, forming a backward letter &#39;C&#34;, then it just shot straight up into the sky until it dissappeared.  I then looked at my watch, and it was approximately 10:35 pm.  I would say that I observed this star/object for about 3 mins. The stars in the sky appeared to have a blueish hue to them, but this star/object appeared to be more of a bright gray color.  Also of the 12 movements that I observed, the last 5 of 6, the object seemed to have a redish/orangeish glow to it after it moved, and then got gray again.  Like I say, I had never before seen any type of UFO in my life, but I will leave you my contact info, if need be, feel free to contact me, and I&#39;m also very curious if any one in my area reported anything similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

I stayed for 3 to 4 minutes until it slowly started to move south eventually disappearing.  It was as if it was backing away in a upward angle<n>

It was clear out, no clouds around and no wind. it was around 9:20 p.m. when my fiancee and I were sitting on our deck observing the sky and airplanes. At around 9:25 p.m. I saw from the big dipper constellation, this bright yellowish light, much brighter than the planes and any of the stars. I asked him,&#34;what is that?&#34; and he began to watch it too. We saw it going south-eastward, and if you watched it carefully it appeared to be moving not in a straight line but slightly moving left to right and vice versa. He suggested it might be a plane but it didn&#39;t make any sound as it flew over. As it went further it started to dim and eventually just blinked out with a flash of red light. It just disapppeared. I don&#39;t know what that light was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were going north on Haligus Rd. Lake in the Hills,I L. we looked to the east and saw these seven bright round yellow /  orange lights hovering in the sky. They had a bright center with a halo around them.  We first thought they  were lights in park.  As we got closer to the park at Haligus and Miller we stopped to get a better look.  The formation was three in a cluster to the north and four spread out what looked to be on a slant to the south.  As we were watching the formation they started moving to the north, merging two by two, and then disappeared.  The last light then went into the distance and disappeared.<n>

We continued our vigil for about an hour after the third sighting, but did not observe any further sightings of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The near-dark sky was absolutely clear, there was a southerly breeze, and the object was about 60-65 degrees off the horizon at a nearly due east location.  It was very slightly horizontally oval and about the size of an English pea held at arm&#39;s length.  It was as bright and luminous as a vehicle head lamp with no observable structure in or around the object; no sounds whatsoever were heard emanating from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend on the deck with me observed the final 2-3 second interval and confirmed the sighting was indeed an anomalous bright silvery-white light, inexplicable in origin, with no sounds associated with the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He called a friend about 40 miles inland and she stated that she saw the same consecutive trio of lights that I saw and was able to confirm that the sighting was at about 60-65 degrees and at a nearly due east location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this same location a sighting was reported to the N.U.F.O.R.C. on August 12, 2100.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The difference was it was traveling from the East towards the West. It caught my eye because it was a very bright white light and moving much like I have wittnessed the ISS move in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw did not move in a straight line and did not disappear over the horrizon.  It made a swooping move that reminds me of the Nike logo in reverse.  It was very bright right up to the arch portion and progressively dimmed moving away from us, yet remaining visible in the night sky.  There was no discernable shape, noise, or flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I and my Wife did see returned three times with approximately 20 to 45 minute intervals. It was clearly visible with the naked eye. We live in the flight path of Seattle and Everett Airports and know what aircraft look like in the sky. This did not appear to be any type of aircraft, just a bright light. We both wittnessed it three times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I brought out my night vision monocular and watched for it for about 3 and a half hours. Each sighting was with the naked eye and twice I was able to track it with the night vision. As it swung into the upper swoosh of the arch and became dimmer, I was able to see it become almost stationary for short times then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, with the night vision I tracked several sattelites crossing the sky in South to North lines.  What I call sattelites could have been a UFO siting as well.  On two sitings I saw a singular motion enjoined with a second moving almost parralell tracking in the same direction except for one.  The one unusual siting I tracked from the North towards the South which was enjoined by a second that had been heading in the opposite direction. When I claim it &#39;enjoined&#39; tracking the first, I mean it turned in behind the first I was tracking and they traveled for a distance across the sky and then both stopped. I watched them for a short time and brought the night vision down and lost track of their location in the mix of stars.<n>

I am totally shocked!!  It hovered-like for about minute although it could have been up there before i looked, I took 2 picture with a 5mp blackberry, once pic wasn&#39;t centered into object so all i see is black sky, the other pic show a triangle shape object like a funnel with some type of lights in corner parts.  This object disappeared in a blink of my eyes, must have gone up so fast or simply went transparent in front of my eyes. I have never seeing anything like it in my life, that&#39;s 37 years.  This was no plane or aircraft, nothing can possibly move that way that fast... unless an aircraft exploded in the air tonight above upstate new york and pieces are falling from the sky as we speak.  This is the most amazing thing I have ever seeing, ever.  I intent to have my picture zoomed and cleared somehow, it&#39;s definitely a funnel-triangular shape in picture yet it looked to me like a flaming bubble.  It disappeared so damn fast I still can&#39;t believe it, it was there and then it was gone.  This object was possibly around same altitude at which planes fly or possibly higher.<n>

I live beside two schools with two very large fields in between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting under the tree about 300 yards from my house.  I looked up and saw in the dark night sky two shining lights.  They looked like streetlights.  Yellowish/orangeish.  They seemed to be a couple of thousand feet up.  There was no sound from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving slowly to the left then they merged together. I leaned down and rubbed my eyes to make sure I was seeing properly and looked up.  They were still there.  They moved apart and I watched for a couple more minutes then remembered my two cats were still outside.  I went to get them in and grabbed my flashlight.  I went back out and got to the edge of our lawn at the birch tree and looked up.  They were still there.  I watched for a few seconds and then went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,  ((name deleted))<n>

From where I stood, the ball of light would have measured about the size of a large, fully blown beach ball, reflecting the purest white light on every part of it.  The object moved in a north pattern, then instantly course corrected to the east and then quickly north again to move behind another.  When I saw it again, the object moved again instantly to the east, then north moving behind another cloud.  I lost sight of the object after the last course correction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object stayed stationery for about 25 seconds then made a bright white flash and was gone in a blink of an eye.  This is my second sighting this year and I&#39;m not sure if its coincidental or what, but after both siightings, a small private plane circles the sky in the area that objects appeared. It seems on botg occassions the small plane was chasing and/or looking for unknown object.<n>

I turned and looked at the light and figured it was a hovering helicopter.  I placed the TV on mute and could not hear it.  So I ignored it for a while when the object kept on glimmering with three colors White, Red and Green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I got out of bed and grabbed my pair of high-power Binos and went outside.  I focused in on the object which was maybe 10 miles away, North-East.  It looked like a Disco light, High Alt. maybe 5 - 7 thousand feet AGL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fingered it was a star because it was not moving and is was a hot night and just glimmered from the heat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly it was gone.  The light was out.....!  Strange.....1230 AM and no airports in that Direction....No sound either....However Edwards AFB is 60 miles to the North of me.<n>

So I was looking thru the open sunroof.  Then I saw a light, I thought it was a plane or a very slow shooting star, but it was too slow for a shooting star.  I mentioned this to my date too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It first flew straight for about 5 seconds, what caught me off guard is it changed course very rapidly, going sideways and then the other way and then it disappeared.  Right then I knew it was not a plane, not a shooting star or anything else that can make turns that fast at that distance.  The light was yellowish to white, it was far, at least a few miles high in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My date didnt see this because she was laying on my chest cuddling, I did mention it to her as soon as it happened.

But after the ISS disappeared, we looked again to the north and this object was still there.  It was about 15-20 degrees off the horizon, and completely stationary for the 30-40 minutes that we watched it.  It appeared to be triangular in shape, and there were at least 3-4 lights blinking erratically - red, green, and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to get my camera (your basic Canon point-and-shoot) and set it to video mode, and ended up getting a pretty good video of it.  In the video it appears to have multiple lights, of different sizes, and possibly some smaller! lights blinking nearby.  My son has a high-def video camera that we tried to use, too, but we couldn&#39;t get a good shot of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for about 15 minutes I went inside and woke up my husband, who is a pilot (and who is very skeptical about UFO&#39;s).  He came out and took a look through the binoculars, and watched my video.  After watching for several minutes said he had no idea what it was but was sure it was not a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD))<n>

They got really bright and disappeared in five different locations that were in relatively close proximity of each other.  One flashed, then 3 flashed at one time and one final light flashed.  Similarly, they brightened and dimmed like a flare, but much faster.  I know how to read the big dipper to find the north star, so I can tell you it was in the south-west.  It was one of the most unexplainable events I have ever witnessed.  The event left three Air Force personnel, including myself, speechless; as well as, all others on the flight line who must have seen it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was a clear night with many stars out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the west I noticed a large circular object that appeared bright orange in the distance, heading in our direction.  As it got closer my friend and I immediately noted there was no sound, no flashing lights, just a large luminous orange ball. The object seemed to be moving effortlessly in a straight line across the sky at about the height of a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed over our heads, with no other distinct shape, but circular.  It quickly disappeared traveling eastward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, 8/26/2011 our wives joined us at the campsite.  That evening at approximately 10:00 pm we again noticed this orange circular object in the sky.  Except this time, it was traveling straight up the river heading northeast.  At about the same height just further away from us.<n>

I am shocked I did not hear anything on the news about this! It was flying northwest to south east mainly heading south.  It was fairly low flying. like helicopter height.  I can&#39;t believe no one else is talking about this! I know this is a UFO sight, and I was convinced it was a burning airplane because it looked to be engulfed in flames.  Nothing like the blinking lights of normal aircraft.  Anyways, if you have heard anything, I&#39;d like to hear about it.<n>

It was approximately 9pm in  Brier WA.  It was a white flickering light no pattern to the flicker not following a direct line.  It caught my eye because it was not moving like a plane would, it was moving erratically from west to east and dropping altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t think a plane could drop altitude that quick and then return to where it was while at the same time suddenly moving west to east and then back again.  It didn’t make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s  altitude was about where a high flying plane would be. It was in the north sky moving east.  It flickered and then move east then drop down, and then back up to approx the same area  and move east then drop down as it was flickering and I saw it make that maneuver about 3 times  before I turned off and lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the arrangement or track of the lights: * * * 	   * * *           * * * *<n>

It was dusk but not quite dark to the west. He pointed to the East/Northeast and said, “look, there’s Jupiter”.   I knew it was not Jupiter since Jupiter is rising after midnight lately.  Then he said, “or maybe it’s Venus?” (probably because it was so bright).  Then as we both watched, it started descending slowly down toward the treeline.  Its movement was wobbly, not straight. It kept descending until it was out of sight and we were both quite incredulous.<n>

My 1st thought was Venus because it was the same size and brightness of Venus.  I continued taking photos of the sunset when I felt compelled to look at the object again and that&#39;s when I quickly remembered Venus is located further south and is a different color I also noticed this bright, amber colored light was drifting near me and then it arched slowly and drifted off on a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the 6th time to see this in a year.  I always think it&#39;s Venus at first for some reason!  I was able to point my camera towards this object and take a time exposure of it as it glided across the sky away from me.  It&#39;s low in the sky, though it appear to be high up in the photograph.  I live in a military fly-zone so I&#39;m pretty sure this is not a civilian craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have one other photo of this image that I took back in June of this year...I will gladly post it too....<n>

My 3 year old son pointed at the sky and said there was a plane.  I looked up to where he had pointed.  In the sky, was a stationary object.  It was a great distance away.  There had been no smoke, jet stream, or anything else near the object.  It was a very clear evening and no clouds were around either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, I thought it was merely a jet at high altitude.  But as I watched for a few seconds, I could tell it was not moving or leaving any sort of trail in its wake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancee looked up to see where it was, but was looking a different direction.  I turned to help her pinpoint where it was in the sky.  When I looked back to that spot, the object was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As stated, it was a very clear night, so no clouds were in the vicinity.  I scanned the sky for a couple of minutes thereafter, but saw no sign of the object anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The appearance of the object was silver-white in color.  The shape was of a saucer variety, though &#34;upside down&#34;, as compared to what one normally thinks.  The &#34;rounded&#34; portion of the object was on the bottom, while the &#34;flat&#34; part was on top, giving more the appearance of a bowl shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 2:00  I was crossing the Bonneville Salt Flats and was about 1 to 1 1/2 mile from the eastern edge. The sky was basically clear with broken clouds at 30,000 feet.  I looked to the left, north, and noticed an object in the sky.  It was white and irregularly shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to tell with the clouds moving all around it if it was moving or not. I watched it as best I could while driving and lost sight of it for a moment when the freeway left the Flats. I looked for it again and found it. It appeared to be in the same position it was in when I first noticed it. I got off the freeway at a rest stop and got out of the car. The object was still there.  It struck me how it vaguely resembled a Boeing “Pudgey Plane”, a caricature of a Boeing airliner that one sees from time to time, except it was all white. I found a spot where I could lean against a wall to see if it seemed to move and in the time I watched the object ! did not move. Clouds passed behind and above it, which suggested it was below 30,000 feet. I tried taking several pictures of it but the pictures didn’t really turn out. I could not see the viewfinder very well and was guessing a lot about how well in focus the picture was when I took it. Still, the object is in the pictures, just really, really fuzzy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on I tried to work out where the object was hovering, how high it was and how big it might be. I used simple triangulation from the point I first saw it and from the rest area. One map noted a military reservation on the salt flats and my triangulating put the object over the south end of the reservation. It was between 15 to 20 miles away and I guessed it occupied 2 degrees of sky. My arithmetic suggested it was 1,000 feet long, but, given how much estimating went into that, I’d be skeptical it was that big. I finally had to leave and it was still there when I left. It didn’t seem to be a balloon, it didn’t move like an airplane, it was too big to be a helicopter, so, what was it?<n>

The jetliner was rapidly approaching the position of the triangle aircraft and they all were heading generally eastward though the triangle aircraft group course did appear to be converging on the airliner&#39;s course and after the bank to the south they appeared to be diverging and dropping altitude.  None of these aircraft were above 20000ft AMSL.  From my location the aircraft were in the northern sky and 50-60 degrees above the horizon (less than 8 miles away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had not noticed the triangle aircraft until they had changed course, when they banked into the down and to the right curve, the apparent color of the underside of the triangles brightened enough to become visible against the clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle aircraft were large though the jetliner was larger and moving faster.  They did not make a visible exhaust trail and I didn&#39;t hear anything.  The flight path and mode appeared to be ordinary gliding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the triangle aircraft leveled off again, they disappeared to my eye by once again becoming the same color and brightness as the sky.  It was as if it were possible to control the brightness and coloration of the underside or entirety of the aircraft.  I would have dismissed my observation as being motorized hang gliders if not for this fade-away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch that area of sky for a few minutes longer and didn&#39;t see anything more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 12:40 CDST  August 25 2011<n>

I know all the flight patterns of the airplanes that always fly over head.  I looked directly over head and saw a small light looking exactly like a star.  i thought it was a shotting star so i watched it. it was moving pretty decent speed. the next thing i know it is taking a zig zag pattern very sudden sharp turns. It proceeded to make these patterns for about 15-20 seconds.  It stopped a time or two then got dim but still visible but then dissapeared.<n>

From the north came a bright orange light, maybe a fireball, but I did not notice any flicker or tail. It appeared the light was chasing a much smaller bright white light, which moved in various directions.  The little bright light looked like a faint star in the sky but clearly moving.  The big orange light seemed to follow but maintained it&#39;s overall southern course.  I am certain I have never seen a light in the sky like this before. It appeared to go to slow to be a fireball like you see in videos.  Clearly faster than a plane though.  I am not good with distance, but the orange light was above the clouds and I have no idea how far away the little white light was it may have been at the same altitude as the orange light, but because of it&#39;s small size (very small) I could not tell<n>

On August 25th and 26th at approximately 5:30 am, my brother-in law, who was staying at a remote cabin just south of Lisbon, Ohio, was looking out of his bedroom window when he spotted a disk or oval shaped object moving slowly above the tree tops of the surrounding woods.  The weather at the time was stormy, with thunder and lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a ring of bright, rapidly flashing, multi-colored lights(red, green, orange, yellow) as viewed from approximately a 45 degree angle.  There was a round spot which protruded from the bottom center which emitted an extremely bright white light. It was more of a flood light than a spot light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved slowly and did not hover or stop.  The sighting lasted approximately 1 minute and 45 seconds. It made no sound,  but there was thunder, so any sound might have been covered up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning at about 5:36, he saw the same object, but it was higher up and was flying a slightly different path than the morning before.  It was extremely foggy but he could very easily see the bright white light at the bottom of the craft.  This sighting lasted about 45 seconds.  He did not make a size estimate because he could not tell how far away the object was in either case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother-in law would like to know if anyone else reported the same object, and if Lisbon has had ufo sightings in the past.<n>

I&#39;d closed my eyes for a few seconds, and through the skin of my closed eyes I could see this brightness.  I opened my eyes and saw this bright white light.  It was like a helicopter spotlight or a flare, but utterly soundless, falling slowly out of the sky until it winked out and then turned into an orange pinpoint of light and unnaturally sped at a 90 degree angle to the right.  Then it completely vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I walked to the furthest spot in the backyard never taking my eyes off of them.  As I reached that spot they began to descend slowly below the tree tops until I could no longer see them.

As I gazed at the sky I noticed a strange bright light, brighter than a star in the South Southwest Sky just under and to the left of the Big Dipper.  It seemed as if it may have been 10 to 20 miles away.  It had multicolored lights  moving around the bright light horizontally while the bright white light was pulsating in a rhythmic fashion.  The multicolored lights changed color almost as if the colors were smoothly changing from color to color like a prism or color wheel.  This immediately got my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch for 15 minutes and noticed that it did not move, at least not that I could perceive. I then went and got my wife whom saw it herself and made me aware that there were 2 additional lights pulsating in unison with the initial anomaly.  The other 2 lights were smaller and only white with no other colors like the initial anomaly.  A three formed a triangle. The other 2 were only visible for 10 – 15 minutes.  When my wife and I confirmed at 22:30 hrs that it had not moved I called my friend who lives 20 miles away and in the direction of the object.  While on the phone with my friend, I described the area of the sky it was in and he was able to locate it.  We were very excited as this is a topic we are interested in and have been sky watchers for some time.  The points that compelled our belief that it was a UFO were as follows:   1. they did not move.  2. No conventional aircraft has lights that are blue, green, red, yellow, etc. &amp;  3. It seemed way too high of an al! titude to be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went inside the house and ended the phone call with an understanding that he would continue to watch it and call me if he saw any changes.  At about 23:30 I took the dog out and noticed it was gone. I scanned the sky and noticed it was now resting in another area of the sky.  If it were originally at 7 o’clock it was now at 11 o’clock and not moving. I observed for 10 – 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where it gets strange. I consciously focused on the object and asked a series of questions in my mind. “What are you?”, “What are your intentions?”, “Where did you come from?”, “I want to know”. Immediately, my son came running out the front door in a panic. He told me when he came down stairs for a drink he saw a white hooded figure out of the corner of his eye. He said it looked like a white towel floating in the air and it moved. He said when he turned to look at it, it vanished. He was visibly shaken. I listened to his description then comforted him and tucked him in bed. Bear in mind my wife was sleeping at this point. I played around on the internet and went to bed at about 1 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning my wife tells me she came downstairs in the middle of the night and saw a hooded white figure with no face in the same spot in the office as my son had seen. They had not spoken of this to each other. The difference was that she saw it facing her with just a black area where a face should be. She was visibly shaken and had goose bumps as she recounted her experience. She said that although it was very real and bizarre, she felt at peace and it did not scare her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not talk about this around our son as he is too young for these things. The possibility of one of them contaminating the other’s memory was very small as I made every attempt to control my personal investigation of the white figure. I had them go into separate rooms and draw what they had seen. They drew very similar pictures. The figure had human shape and only visible from the waist area up. It stood approximately 6’ tall. It moved when my son saw it. It seemingly looked at my wife. Obviously this incident shook us up a bit. I don’t know what the significance of it is is but I do know they are related. We have never, in 7 years in this house, seen anything out of the ordinary. We are sane people. We are confused.<n>

As I watched it picked up speed and arced behind the trees.  The distance seemed to be substantial but I could not hazard a guess.  I’m guessing because the object was very small and faint and could easily be missed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw another one and then another and another.   Probably happened 7 or 8 times when I went inside to have my wife look,(to make sure I wasn’t crazy).<n> <n><n> <n><n> She came out but we only saw one more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked again on Thursday night but it was after 11pm and I saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday night, I went out at about the same time that I saw them on Wednesday and sure enough, I started seeing them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seem not to move fast at first but then accelerate rapidly and usually arcing either north or south.  At least one did go in a straight line from approximately north to south.  Whether one craft reappearing or several I do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I went out and checked my landmarks and came in and brought up goole earth.  When I run a straight line from my position through the direction I was looking, I end up over McChord afb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights did not look like planes to me.  I saw no blinking lights and if they were over McChord, they were much faster than any type of plane, military or not, that I’m aware of.   Maybe some kind of flare but that doesn’t account for their pattern of flight nor speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a skeptic on ufo sightings but do think there are real sightings of things that cannot be eexplained.  I think these probably have some sort of military hardware explanation but I’d like to know what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continued from my other report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went out about 10 after 9 tonight and they were there again.  I then looked in a more southerly direction and they were over in that direction also.  Most start at a point in sky and angle down from right to left.  Some were going straight up and some actually did loops.  A couple of times I&#39;d see them appear to stop and turn sharply and go the other way.   Trees still block lower sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I went out into the yard and to my surprise I was able to pick them out almost everywhere I looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This made me think that maybe they were bats or birds with town lights reflecting but bats wouldn&#39;t and they just don&#39;t fly like birds.   Tried to imagine they were moths but they sure don&#39;t fly like moths either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t know how many nights it may continue<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

The event lasted only 5 seconds, as the wing was traveling at a very high speed.  It looked like the craft was banking hard and I was seeing the top profile.  It could have been a B2 out of the base in Staten Island, but it was not solid black.  Tiny lights on the craft made it appear orange and red.I estimated it to be flying at 12,000 feet.<n>

The light got closer and moved at a very fast pace.  I said to my husband “what is that? What is that?” We both got up and went outside to my back porch.  It was a very large UFO, perhaps the size of a football field, I am guessing.   Even though it was very high up it was still massive in size and relatively low as we could make out that it was round in shape.  We observed the UFO coming out of the North and heading towards the South.  We stared in awe for a moment as it came towards us.  There was absolutely no sound and it just hovered, then it made a wide U turn towards Tontogany (Northeast) and at that time we were able to see the lower half of the aircraft which had, what looked like to me, at least four circles on the lower half of the UFO.  Each circle appeared white but when I got my camera and took a video the white light came up on my camera screen as being multicolored and blinking o! r flickering, although it did not appear this way to the naked eye only on camera.  In person it appeared solid bright white lights but on camera is was a range of colors blinking.  I have a couple videos, one is very descent but I am somewhat disappointed that I didn’t capture it at its closest range in which we first saw it.  At one point it seemed to lower or drop rather suddenly, which I also have on camera. I only caught about 30 seconds of it before it disappeared above and beyond the town of Tontogany.  Interestingly, we also saw and heard a airplane on the North and opposite side of the sky so we could actually compare how loud and how little that was in comparison to the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it moved incredibly fast and I believe it had the potential to move a lot faster than we witnessed, maybe even lighting fast.  The first sighting was at about ten minutes til 9 o’clock pm so it was still somewhat light out but dark for the most part.  We live just outside Tontogany, Ohio which is a very small town in the rural area outside Bowling Green, Ohio.  Also, there was an extreme amount of lighting just prior to seeing it and during the sighting as well. Even though there was mass amounts of lighting in the sky, the night was clam and still, with no rain or thunder yet just lighting every 5-10 seconds or so.  Not too long after it disappeared, maybe 10-20 minutes later, we saw it again!  This time it was much higher up and moved at a much faster speed as if it were leaving and no longer observing or hovering over the land.  It went from the North sky to the South sky in a matter of seconds and then it disappeared.  About 10 minutes after it disappear! ed there was a severe thunderstorm in which rain and thunder accompanied the lighting and the lighting even intensified.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I still can&#39;t believe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9AM, I was headed SE on Highway 30. I was running late for work due to sleeping in and my having to stop to get gas. Before I reached the Sauvie Island bridge, I saw what looked like a plane in the sky -- white, glimmering, about the right size.  This may sound unusual, but since I was a kid I&#39;ve looked at planes and always waited to see their wings. This time, however, it remained sort of roundish and slowly turning, since the light reflection looked like it was changing. So I started to wonder if it was a helicopter but very high up. As it turned, it slowly got darker -- and suddenly it was gone. Since I was driving, I really couldn&#39;t scan the sky much to find it. I kind of smiled to myself that it was sort of like a UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to Linnton, however, I saw the thing again! The experience was the same only it took place over about 10 seconds instead of 30 or so. Again, it started out glimmering, then &#34;turns&#34;, goes dark, and was gone. At this point, I was curious. Did I just lose track of it before? Because I was driving slow this time, I was able to search the sky a bit. Nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my first stop of the trip at the Kittridge intersection. I look up again and I see the darn thing a third time! This time I had a better chance to watch it while the streetlight was red. There were clearly three lights and a Y- or T-shaped frame that looked like a gray plane without its nose. The lights made me think of the classic &#34;triangle UFO&#34; for a moment, which I thought was pretty weird. All of a sudden, the lights on it go out one by one. At first, it seemed like it had disappeared again. But I squinted and I realized that I could see it flying away SE -- a little more East than I&#39;m facing. It was fading away into the sky&#39;s haze and moving very fast. I&#39;d say fast like a jet, but the horizon haze gave me the impression it was higher and faster than jets I&#39;ve watched. I eventually lost sight of it in the distance. The light turned green and I didn&#39;t see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hadn&#39;t thought to take out my iPhone to snap a picture. Each time I saw it, it was a surprise. And obviously I couldn&#39;t take a photo while driving. Nonetheless, I saw it clearly and my head is spinning a little bit thinking about what it was!<n>

It began slowly moving in circles, but it was like jerking in circles.  Like making a hexagon circle. Almost like it was scanning what was below. I ended up staying out there 45 minutes watching the UFO move a big chunk across the sky; a big chunk as in the amount of time I was there.  With my peripheral vision of staring at the main object (I didn&#39;t say this part when I called) I began to notice 3 little red lights moving even slower in sporadic directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, I go inside to mop the floor and I had this urge to go outside and I look directly up and there was, what I think, is another UFO- but more mechanical looking than the bright light still in the air, but at first I thought it was a plane cause it had multiple lights (red, white, yellow) and they flashed, it kept going to the heading toward Duluth, mn.  I ruled out plane because it might sudden side swipe while still going straight; and as far as I know planes don&#39;t do that. I haven&#39;t seen this one since it went out of my vision  Now between the mechanical looking UFO and the other light kind they didn&#39;t interact with each other in anyway, just passing it. It&#39;s currently 5:40am now and the UFO is still going in mini circles just in a different area of the sky. I assumed it would probably leave before the sun comes up, but it&#39;s still roaming. and there&#39;s really not a star in the sky anymore but you can still see it bright as day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first sighting and it wasn&#39;t super eventful but its got my attention like a motherfucker. I even tried calling coast to coast am so I could tell them LIVE while it was happening but I didn&#39;t get through. Also I did take a video on my iPhone, but the camera is shitty so it looks like just a dot of light, but what&#39;s interesting the video could see the stars and you can definitely see the light. It&#39;s pretty much the only thing u can see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

MY MUSCLES WERE NOT RESPONDING. I WAS MOVED FROM MY BED TO THOUSANDS OF FEET ABOVE MY BED- GOING THROUGH THE CEILING OF MY ROOM.  IT WAS LIKE IT WAS TRANSPARENT. I COULD SEE SEVERAL RED LIGHTS MOVING BACK AND FORTH AS I WAS BEING TRANSPORTED UP THERE.  I FELT THEM TOUCHING ME.. AND I COULD HEAR NOISES LIKE CLATTER SOUNDS... I COULD NOT MOVE TO MAKE ANY SOUNDS FROM MY MOUTH. I AM STILL SCARED. WHEN I AWOKE..  I REMEMBERED EVERYTHING.. BUT WITHIN A FEW HOURS MY BRAIN WAS CLOUDED.  THE STRANGE THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING IS MY FRIEND AND HIS NEIGHBORS, EIGHT OF THEM SEEN THINGS IN THE SKY AROUND THE SAME TIME- HOWEVER THEY WERE ABOUT 75 MILES SOUTH OF ME.  I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS UNTIL THE NEXT DAY- WHEN MY FRIEND SAID HE AND 8 OF HIS FRIENDS SEEN A STRANGE LIGHT SHOW IN THE NIGHT- AND IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE.<n>

We were watching sattelites about an hour after sunset when I noticed a star like light in the sky traveling very fast from north to south.   As I pointed the object out to my nephew and sister in law thinking it was a satellite, the starlike object came to an immediate stop as if it struck a wall. Immediately following this, the object began to fly side to side and in irregular patterns within a narrow area.  It eventually came to a stop between a bright star and a dim star that were just to the left of a pine tree branch.   After about a half hour and no movement again, we eventually stopped monitoring the light as it was also getting very cold outside.  The next 3 nights we used the stars and tree branch as a point of reference to look at the spot where the light had stopped, but it was gone.  We all saw the same thing and have no idea what it was.  I can! tell you it was not a helicopter, made no noise and appeared as a solid white light just like a star.<n>

It seemed still for about 15 seconds .My husband and I were driving home from our son&#39;s house going west on University Ave.  It was about 1000 - 2000 feet above the ground, approx 1 block west of Barnes and Noble Bookstore.When we tried to turn the car around to get a better look, we lost track of it and did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a professional photographer, but did not have his camera on him and I am his studio manager at his business.We are both artistic:  I also tap dance and I enjoy live jazz music when I can.<n>
8/23/11 21:24|Auburn|WA|Light|3-5 seconds|Really Fast light heading due South|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83395.html|179|ndxe201108| Really Fast light heading due South<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my son&#39;s room and heard a commotion outside. I looked out and saw that there were some kids messing around and they had taken the balloons that are sometimes outside of the office, across the parking lot. They ran west in front of the office and around the corner and then south away from me. As they did this they let go of the balloons which floated up into the sky. I was watching the balloons float higher and higher and lost sight of them, and since I was already looking at the sky, I decided to see what stars I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time is when I saw what I first thought was a satellite. I quickly realized that this was about twice the size of what a satellite usually looks like, although it was the same brightness as the typical satellite, maybe a tad brighter.  The other thing that I noticed was that it was the fastest satellite that I have ever seen. I have seen hundreds of satellites in my years of stargazing, but nothing this fast. It wasn&#39;t anywhere near as fast as a shooting star, but for anything else, it was fast. I would estimate that it was going 2-3 times as fast as a quick moving satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away from it for just long enough to raise the blinds the rest of the way up, they were half way down, when I looked back where it should be, it was either gone or turned off.  Almost forgot to mention, it was heading due south.  I also checked on Heavens Above and didn&#39;t see satellites for the time I saw it or any going from North to South. It also was not the ISS. I&#39;ve seen it many many times and know that that was not it.  The ISS is much brighter than what I saw and also much slower than what I saw, not to mention that it had already passed by this area at at 9:07pm, and went from WNW to ENE, so it was well to the north of me.<n>

I was sitting in the front passenger seat, my mom was driving, and my brother was sitting in the back, directly behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving he asked if there were always three stars &#34;over there,&#34; as he pointed south into the trees. My mom and I ignored him and told him he was probably just seeing parts of the Big Dipper. Then suddenly he said, &#34;There it is again!&#34; Shortly followed by, &#34;Now the trees are in the way!&#34; I turned to look and see what he was freaking out about and just seconds later we passed a break in the trees and there were four bright, circular lights almost in the formation of a boomerang. They were just hovering above the trees. The lights were almost a white-yellow color. Nothing like the lights on your typical airplane, they were much brighter and a different color. My mom told us they were probably just jets or helicopters, so she rolled down the windows, but we heard nothing but the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As quickly as we saw the lights, the trees were in the way again. My brother and I convinced my mom to turn left at the light near O&#39; Brady&#39;s in Dollars Corner, so maybe we could get a glimpse of the lights again. When we turned, there were only two lights visible.  Then just seconds later there was only one.  When we turned back to head east again, my brother and I watched out the back window only to see the last light completely vanish.  When the lights disappeared, we couldn&#39;t see anything visibly leaving, the lights were just simply gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my mom and I were driving home, heading west on Battle Ground Highway, I kept my eye on the trees the whole time to make sure we hadn&#39;t just seen some sort of street lights or something, but there was no sign of the lights.<n>

After a couple of minutes I saw what looked like a dim star moving very fast from North to South. I showed my son and we both saw it with the bino&#39;s.  A few seconds later we saw a jet which has lights on the wings and you can make out the shape of the plane.  While looking at the jet we saw another moving point of light and I thought for a second it was the first light but maybe it turned around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, within 5 minutes we had counted 15 and the were all over the sky and going all different directions.

He said the object was silent, very very bright..much bigger and brighter than the stars around it and it was multicolored.  He says it stayed motionless right above the tree line for about 10 mintues.

We noticed what appeared, at first, to be a plane moving Northeast to Southwest.  Approximately 90-seconds into our observation, it abruptly changed course, going Southwest to Northwest for about another 60-seconds.  We had continued to watch it, because we noticed a very bright white light that would pulse on and off while two, equally bright, red lights did the same at opposing intervals.  Although there were several other lights, identifiable as planes, also moving in other areas of the sky, we could not make out a definite shape of this object, even when it moved closer as it changed direction.  This first object disappeared after a time, but not into the horizon, it just seemed to be gone.  While trying to locate it again, retracing the path it had taken, we noticed three other small orbs of light had appeared.  They did n! ot pulse or waver in color or intensity, were star-like white, one being brighter than the other two.  Or, perhaps it was closer making it appear brighter, it was hard to tell.  They appeared to be higher in altitude than the first object, but no higher than Cessna, or light aircraft, can fly.  They had no sound and disappeared, as oddly as they had appeared, after approximately 2 minutes.  The brightest light, and one of the dimmer ones, moved at a fair pace from Southwest to Northeast.  The third light, a short distance from the other two, moved at a same pace from South to North. (Directions approximated.)  It was as if all of these objects simply went dark or vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I happened to be looking at the clouds and noticed approximately 10 silver/ iridescent/ spheres set up in a formation flying approximately in a southerly direction.  These were very high in the sky, far above the clouds, and appeared small due to their high elevation in the sky.  The formation was a slight variation of a typical &#34;V&#34; as seen in bird flight, but with a couple craft filling in the center notch.  I watched the crafts move south at a steady speed, then begin to diverge, and then simultaneously speed up and slowly disappear .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with one other person that did not see the event, but remembered how I reacted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not explain what I saw as being neither bird nor plane nor satellite.  The craft were far too high in the sky, displayed far too much variation in velocity, as well as showing sudden and seemingly choreographed changes in direction to be any of the above listed.  Was motivated to report this after reading about the NYC sighting yesterday, and of course the occurrence of the 5.9 earthquake in Virginia yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The path is directly overhead and quite low. Looking up I saw something that is very hard to explain. It started out drifting from the same direction that planes normally fly to land. They were higher than normal planes and it was too high to land and it did not look like that was the purpose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5 round metallic looking structures all drifting together. They changed shape and direction but kept going on the same straight upward path over the airport. The 5 silent objects circled each other and did weird crazy 8 like movements all while changing shape and color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away and looked back 3 times and wiped my eyes trying to figure out what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally lost sight of it when I could no longer look into the sun. It seemed to fly into the Sun or at least in that direction so it could not be visible. They were floating in the same straight path the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not balloons and it was not planes flying in formation. I cannot explain much further but I have seen enough to know what it NOT was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted about 4 minutes from the time I saw it to the time it was not visible, but it seemed much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not scared nor am I now. I am just confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One triangular unlit object passed overhead followed by another about 15 seconds later. They traveled from horizon to horizon going from north to south in about 15 seconds each. They appeared pitch black against a silvery dark sky and blacked out stars as they passed over. It was impossible to estimate distance, speed or size. The shape appeared to be approximately triangular with one of the points leading. I got the impression that they were fairly large and covered about 40 degrees of sky. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I quickly went home and got my girlfriend to ride a few minutes back up the road to a place that overlooks the lake.  We have seen the sphere before two weeks ago our bedroom window hovering over the treetops making absolutely no sound and being able to change course at will.  This time I had my camera charged and ready to go.  After observing the sphere, we decide to get closer, so we returned back to our road which dead ends into the lake. I drove to the lake edge where I took additional footage.  I had a small flashlight which I used to signal the craft to see if there was any intelligence or it would possibly get a response.  We then returned home and after only a few minutes the craft was in site from our driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been used to flashlight several more times thinking that possibly it followed me from the end of the road.  I got addit! ional footage from my driveway.  I noticed what appeared to be of red reflective light coming from the woods adjacent to my driveway.  I believe there was possibly three ET observing me.  I shine the light on and they would respond by moving out of the light. Although I could not get any good video because it was pitched black I did get some video and I did obtain audio.  I left my video camera outside recording for about 20 min. and seem to have been able to get some audio from what I think were ET&#39;s in my driveway possibly. DDTs seemed like were only wanted to observe me possibly the whole experience was scary although the curiosity made me want to run into the woods} and possibly catch one. After checking with a few neighbors it seems that this area is a hotbed for siding.  Even the people who don&#39;t believe in extraterrestrials believe that the objects are hovercrafts.  I can assure you these objects are ET&#39;s. My camera will always be charged and I will be looking for more sig! htings.<n>

As I went to unlock the door I looked towards the west to catch a glimpse of the night sky which I do often, and saw numerous (I estimate at least 100) dim, pulsing lights silently moving across the sky from the south to the north.  I stood and watched for a good 5 minutes as they all passed, each one glowing and pulsing at the same rate, some grouped together, but also  many by themselves, all traveling the same speed. I have never seen anything like this before, the speed they were traveling didn&#39;t look like any aircraft I have ever seen, not to mention the amount of lights I saw would be very unlikely for any airplanes or jets to be traveling in a group that large.  If anyone else saw this or has any idea what it is, please tell me because I&#39;d really like to know!!!<n>

One was shaped triangular and the other was oval shaped. They were flying slow at first, then sped up fast perfectly in sync with each other. I said to my friend wait what is that and she replied I was just thinking the same thing. Next I said to her look there are fast blinking lights coming from them. The triangular one appeared as if it was rotating. It was apparent they were not air planes or helicopters. I asked her for her phone and started taking pictures. Then told her to follow them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were large about 400 feet in diameter aprox 75 ft from the ground.  They were headed north west  in the same direction as we were. After five minutes They both went off to the east and higher into the sky. Then they just stopped and hovered there. We pulled over on to the side of the road and took pictures and video. The lights were extremely bright, and white. They stayed there for ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went running off the side of the road to get a closer look and then they started coming closer to us. So I stopped and then the two objects separated into six flying objects. The one shaped as a triangle became three little objects flying. So did the oval shaped object. They were much smaller (maybe 55 ft dia) now and traveling faster. Because they were rotating fast in a triangle shape they appeared as if it was one large object which is not the case. The same goes for the oval object. Then they started moving further away we got back into the car to try and follow them in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before they disappeared they were now  headed north east. We turned our car around and proceeded that direction looking for them. We have video of our lights and electronics turnig on and off. They were nowhere in site anymore.  I looked over and saw a police car just sitting on the side of the road.  This was now on E. Cypress and Seller st. I told my friend we have to tell the cop and report this. She said no he will think we are crazy. I said to her he’s facing the direction of the objects maybe he seen them to.  She pulled up next to him and I said hello “ Im not crazy or on drugs but did you just see... and he interrupted before I could say another word and he said “ The flying objects in the sky,  Yes I did”. He then told us he called Travis air force base to see if they had anything in the air and they told him no. He gave us his card with all his information he was actually the sergeant and then said “ Well if I disappear and am not hear tomorrow make sure you report t! his”.  As we were driving off another car pulled over and we overheard them starting to tell him what they saw in the sky.<n>

It first appeared as a black dot in the sky, so I thought it was a stray balloon floating.  As the object got closer I realized that it did not move as a balloon would, It did not vary its course or altitude, or move left or right,  The object remained stationary in flight with no rotation of it’s body,   A balloon would tend to rotate, dance, and move with the wind.  There was a slight breeze of  about five m.p.h. in the opposite direction the object was heading at the time. As the object approached and passed directly overhead I estimate the speed it was traveling at about fifteen or twenty m.p.h. or about the same speed that someone on a ten speed bike would be moving at. When the object passed overhead It was absolutely silent.  I would describe it as being shaped like a loaf of bread.  The color was a very dark bron! ze, almost charcoal color with a metallic copper base. As the object passed overhead and went behind me, I noticed that  it had a  circular indent in the rear of the craft that resembled a crator. About two hundred yards behind me was an apartment complex. When the object flew over it,  The object was about two times the height of the apartment complex.  That would equal 24 stories.  Based on the size of the outside deck of the apartment, the craft was  the size of a full size truck.<n>

Object was white in color and having 2 window like openings to the left and right divided by a single bar.  The color of the windows and bar were bluish grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we proceeded down Bennet Lawson we drove under a large tree limb with leaves and after clearing the branch the object vanished.<n>

As it flew around I could make out that it had a boomerang shape to it.  Out of nowhere came a second white light and the two began flying like paper airplanes all around, dipping down low and coming back up.  I lost sight of them as I was driving away.<n>

In glancing up to the North/East, two unusual objects were clearly visible resting in the night sky.  Each object was about a half a hand outstretched and a hand apart.  The formation on the left had two large white lights - which looked almost like a car headlights to an invisible car. The object to the right looked something like the Pleiades but upon standing stationary and staring, there were white dots of lights grouped in a boomerang shape.  Both objects seemed to have a shape blending with the dark night sky to which the lights were attached.  The two-light object on the left had brighter lights than the one on the right.  The lights were white or whitish blue.  The lights did not blink. The objects made no detectible sound. Both objects appeared to be still but upon closer observation were moving in tandem of! f to the north/east.  While trying to follow the trajectory of the objects on bike and upon crossing the intersection, the objects were suddenly no longer visible.  If the objects were aircraft they would have still been quite visible from a farther distance but it appears as though they vanished from the night sky.  There was a lot of air traffic during this evening but these objects looked absolutely nothing like air traffic and appeared quite large. No air traffic appeared to be nearby these objects.<n>

Get this, they didn&#39;t make a sound!  The sound they gave off was like driving with a sun roof open and a passenger window open.

After the show we went back to the campground we were staying in, which was also packed with thousands of other people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1145pm, sitting around our campfire, we both noticed one or two orange lights in the sky. Clearly far away, they seemed to be from an airplane. The movements didn’t seem quite right …they seemed to be moving with a speed/motion not consistent with their apparent distance…but all in all didn’t seem like anything so remarkable, so we both forgot about it. But something happened a few minutes later that made me remember those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat in our lawn chairs facing south, I noticed something floating up in a southwesterly direction, apparently from a close-by campsite. A couple/few feet wide, it was mainly orange like a Dreamsicle, but also had a round, very bright orange center. It started off low to the ground and just floated up. I thought to myself that it was a plastic bag that was on fire and caught in an updraft, didn’t seem like a big deal. But it kept going; it did not burn out as something like that should.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “What the hell is that?” I asked my uncle. “I dunno” he said “I thought it was a bag on fire, but that should have burned out a long time ago.” It just kept going and going and going and going until it became a point in the sky…seemingly quite very far off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems most likely that someone at the event set something off. But I have no idea what- it was not a flare or firework that shoots a light trail in the sky before exploding. This thing started off bright close to the ground and just kept floating up. Plus it didn’t move quickly at first like something ignition-propelled should. The image of a jellyfish floating up in water is the best way I can describe it…but then it became a point that seemed quite far away, yet without taking a long time to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle and I were drinking a good few beers that night, but not to an extreme point. We both have 20/20 vision. We did ask some of our friends there if they had seen anything; they did not. We were not inclined to go walking around interrogating people…this is a pretty crazy show, it’s a very festive environment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I just thought I should reach out, see if anyone else saw anything there/then. We are both down-to-earth people but cannot explain this thing at all. I am 43, live in NYC, and work in advertising. He is 53, lives in Ohio, works in excavating. Neither of us can remember seeing anything quite like it.<n>

We just happened to be out side seeing our visitor off.  It was hard not to notice an orange glowing object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not a believer of such things but now I am.

To our suprise this was not seen visually by our family the night prior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After, careful review and magnification using out adapater to the t.v. we saw in slow motion this object moving around and changing its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then once that object left the screen and second object followed.  This object was also orange but then changed shape into what looked like two separate diamond shapes.  Those shapes bounced around the screen and then disappeared.  Then a third object appeared in the middle of the screen and was the same as the other two.  I am a mother of a seven year old boy, and my fiance is a former Navy Submariner.<n>

I was looking up at the sky like i usually do when im outside at night to look at the stars etc. I happened to look north east and noticed very high in the sky there was a light about the brightness of a star moving very quickly, faster than any of the local planes that usually fly over.  The light was not blinking any lights and there was no noise to it, there was a plane to the south east sky (blinking lights were visible and it was lower than the light I saw), the single light started to make figure eights. I quickly reached inside to shut off the back deck light to see if my my eyes were playing tricks on me, keeping my eyes on the light I hollered at my boyfriend to come outside.  The light then began to make cirles in the sky and as it finished the second circle it headed east and disappeared.  I went to the east side of my deck to check if maybe it had just ! been blocked by the trees, but it was still nowhere to be seen.  My boyfriend came out a few seconds later and I described what I saw and he agreed that he had never seen any of the local planes do something like that either.<n>

There was a group oh maybe two dozen or so small but bright white lights that were sort of swirling around another stationary light that was more orange and maybe three times the size of the others.the smaller lights swirled the larger one for a few minutes and then broke away from it left a few at a time slithering across the sky after each other in a snake like motion.the small lights followed one another but still moved around randomly.  Organic movements no sharp angles or major speed variations.  It was a clear night and lights were very very high up.<n>

They kept moving further away until they dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what it was but it was quit amazing to see it.  It looked like 3 glowing chinese lantterns in the sky, but there was NO sound and there was no smoke form a candle.  My camera will be with me at all times from now on.<n>

I was star gazing with my feline friend Silvia on an exceptionally clear night and the only other thing  I can somewhat compare this to is the last space shuttle launching 4/13/11.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This difference was that this object was much more of a pulsing light with a slight haze around it without the fire tail moving at least 20x the speed.  Not as fast as an average meteor but much faster then anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It first appeared out if nowhere and continued to pulse quickly directly above me as I was laying in the sand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object was flying directly North crossing the entire sky before it diminished with a last pulse.<n>

In the sky to the southeast, at an elevation of about 45 degrees, I saw a single reddish-orange point of light moving at a constant speed from south to north, eventually fading out and disappearing.  A few minutes later, I saw a second, identical light do exactly the same thing.  I was able to look at the second light through binoculars, but couldn’t make out any detail.  There was no sound associated with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d say their speed was roughly the same as that of commercial jets.   In fact, I often see airplanes (from Reagan National Airport, I assume) with the same point of origin, elevation and speed as these lights, but they’re always readily identifiable by their bright white landing lights, red and green wingtip lights, and their sound.   We have a lot of air traffic in the area, and I’m quite familiar with the appearance of various types of aircraft at night.  These lights got my attention because they didn’t match anything I’d seen before, and because I didn’t hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no wind and the sky was overcast, with the temperature around 76F.<n>

We watched for approximately 30 more seconds and until it disappeared into the sky at which time it was the size of a star.

I could not believe what I was seeing so I ran onto my deck and up the stairs where there is a landing that gives me an unobstructed view of the northern sky, north of my residence.  Sure enough, the lights were still there and were moving slowly in a northern direction at a slow speed.  I hurried back down the stairs and into the back door of my residence and called to my wife, son and daughter to come outside and look at what I was seeing.  We all went back up the stairs to my previous location, looking north and sure enough, the lights were still there, continuing to move north however, during the time of our observations, another light emerged just over the horizon and seemed to be following the previous three.  There were five more obj! ects that followed and all four of us stood there in amazement because there was no sound to be heard, there was no pattern to their flight together at all and over the next few minutes, all of the lights faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife captured a short video of the objects on her HD cellphone video camera, however upon review, it was nearly too difficult to see the objects given that the ambiance of the city street lights quashed anything that could clearly define our observations. For argument sake however, I asked her to keep the video for reference if questions were ever raised about the four of us seeing all of the same occurance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came into the computer room and went online and observed that these objects had already been reported by someone in Martette, MI, but they observed 15 of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes I have to be a skeptic because we do live close to the Selfridge ANG base in Mt. Clemens MI, however on the Canadian side and the orange lights would be indicative of jet engines in after-burn taking off, however, Selfridge ANG, 127th Wing only has the A-10 on location at this base and they are a subsonic aircraft, their engines have no afterburners so the typical orange glow could not have appeared behind those aircraft, even if there was a full squadron taking off, but yet, there was no sound to the movement of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was a very cool experience for my entire family and myself simply because we are hoping there is intelligent life in outer space and in some cases more intelligent than any of the life on this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cheers!!

They moved across the sky in the west from north to south then faded.  I could still see a black dot where each of the lights had been, then they disappeared.<n>

My husband saw in the distance 3 small colored lights close by each other heading east towards a small local airport.  At first he thought it was a plane, but he soon realized it was flying too low to be a plane.  After keeping an eye on it for a minute or so they came closer to our location and that is when he asked me to look at them too. At that time they were located just on the other side of the interstate and we were directly across from them.  They had started moving very erratically, up, down, sideways, zigzag, circles, etc. in a very rapid manor. You could hardly follow them with your eyes because of their speed of movement.  Each colored light was moving in sync with each other.  The lights were blue, red and green and were very small, possibly the size of a baseball.  We continued to drive southbound as I looked back and watched them for a few more seconds until we could not see them any longer.<n>

On August 16th, 2011 at 17:00 in Kansas City, I was looking out my sixth floor window, facing N.E., when I noticed an unusual object. This object was higher than most planes I see.  This rectangular object appeared as a two-story building, but on its side, not tall as a building.  I remember thinking how it was not very long.  There were evenly spaced rectangular, well-lit openings which I thought at first were windows, but later I realized since they were far away, they had to be more like doors.  Although I did not count them, it seemed there were only about 8 of these openings on the first layer, then below them there were identical openings.  This &#34;building&#34; was very still, not moving for about 15-20 seconds.  Then it moved slowly and disappeared.  This object bothered me, but I decided not to report it since I did not have a picture or video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on August 20th, at 21:15, I looked close to where the “building” had been, just slightly west of there and I saw 8 orbs, almost like stars, but in a loose group together.  They were a little larger than stars, all the same size.  None of them moved at this time.  After around 10 seconds three of the orbs on the outer edge of the entire group started to move slowly as the others remained motionless.  Taking turns, the first orb of the smaller group went behind a neighboring orb and disappeared.  Of the smaller group this left two and again, an orb went behind the other and disappeared, leaving one and then it disappeared.  They did not leave, they just ceased to be in my sight.  As soon the last orb was gone, the remaining larger group of about 5 orbs moved slowly at the same time but did not go very far.  Then they all repeated the same actions of the first group, going behind each other until they were gone, although they went more than one at a time as before, disappe! aring quicker than the first group.  Wondering how these orbs disappeared, perhaps they were actually going into something that was cloaked, thus disappearing from sight.  Since there were two sightings of mine, I deemed this significant so I am reporting them, though I have no pictures or video.<n>

Kept thinking they were lanterns with reddish to then orange like flames like a hot air balloon because it either died out the further it went away or went behind some low lying clouds. They flickered as they went past, no sounds. Each one took about several minutes in between each pass. Thought it might have been some type of  hoax and or advertisement for a beach nearby. Crazy things can be bought online nowadays. Saw something during the daytime a couple of months ago. It was black/oblong and found out it was a kids solar powered balloon that can be bought online. It’s a mystery until someone finally spills the beans on what these objects can be or the FAA finds out that these objects are getting in the way of  airplanes. God help us if they do.  Lets’ hope it doesn’t lead to that. It was definitely something cool to see. Of course, once the binoculars were located they stopped going past.  Oh well.<n>

It appeared to be very bright, and moving in a formation.  It was not as high as a normal airplane would be seen.  As it disappeared it appeared as if the lights went out.

It ascended slowly at first like an aerial fire work in slow motion.  It was as bright as a star but more of a yellow-orange color, like a street light.  However it was as big as a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, a pilot, even suggested that it was a helicopter with just it’s under lights on, however the lights were not flashing as they usually do.

An orange glowing light caught my attention in the SE sky.  It seemed to grow in size then all of a sudden there were two more.  The 3 lights formed a very large triangle.  They were all about the same size and looked to be moving very slowly towards the  NW.  I yelled for my husband to come outside and he also saw the lights.  No sound.  Seemed to be pulsating.  A couple of times one or more of the lights would appear to go out and then reappear.  Then all three lights just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was something definitely weird!<n>

Weather was overcast but still broad daylight- my partner (who was driving) noticed a very, very bright ball of white light hovering in the sky at the top of his eyeline.  The light was too bright to be a star or a plane(a fact he commented on).  The ball hovered stationary in the sky for 50 seconds (approx) and then travelled directly forward (towards Chester) at a phenominal speed being lost from sight in a second.  My partner was visibly uneasy afterwards! I had seen reports the day before of sightings on the M11 and I asked him to describe exactly what he saw (I could see nothing as I didn&#39;t have my glasses and am blind in one eye, shortsighted in the other: the dashboard is hard for me to see let alone anything at cloud level!)  The description he gave exactly matched what was filmed yesterday on the M11 (a report my partner had not seen) and when we returned home I showed him the camera footage- he was visibly taken aback! and explained that what he saw was identical except he saw only one orb as opposed to the four in the footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reported the sighting to the local police 20 minutes ago. I highly doubt it was a chinese lantern due to the speed it was travelling according to my partners account- the fact he shouted &#34;Jesus Christ!&#34; when the orb accelerated was enough of an indicator for me- I only wish I had had my glasses with me.<n>

Globe-Miami is about 90 miles east of Phoenix.  We noted an unusual amount of jet traffic in the sky. As we observed the jets, it became apparent that two jets were repeatedly circling and perhaps chasing 3 to four objects situated low in the east sky at an approximate elevation of 20-30 degrees from the horizon.  We assume the jets were military.  The jets were much slower than the objects they were circling.  By compass, we observed the objects between 90-120 degrees east.  We observed these objects for 90 minutes and watched them make extremely erratic maneuvers across the sky at high rates of speed – sudden horizontal to vertical to diagonal reversals and spiraling and stopping across the sky.  The objects appeared to “dance” in the sky.  The maneuvers were beyond the capacity of any aircraft with which we ! are familiar.  We also noted that the normal commercial air traffic to Phoenix in our area seemed to have ceased.  We observed the objects with binoculars of 10x50 and 7x35 powers.  The objects appeared spherical in shape and emanated a white-yellow light.  With the naked eye the spheres seemed about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a large star.  Three of the objects continued to dance erratically in the sky long after the circling jets departed.  The jets circled the objects for about 30 minutes and left and did not return.<n>

Within a 5 minute span we heard several passes of the familiar sound of military jets (I was born in Globe-Miami area and have lived here 47 years).  We both talked how unusual it was to hear so many military jet passes.  My husband was facing the EAST sky and told me to look.  I saw 2 white-yellow circular lights and 2 objects (white with red lights) in the sky.  The white-yellow circular lights were faster than the other 2 objects in the sky.  It looked like the 2 objects were chasing the circular lights but could not keep up because the circular lights were making erratic moves and were much faster.  One of the circular lights would go right, then make an extreme northern change in direction while the other circular light would go left and disappear and then re-appear.  Then a 3rd and 4th circular light would appear.  Once in a while they would be headed in the same direct! ion and then split off and circle in other directions while the 2 objects (white with red lights) would try and follow them.  At one point, there were 4 white-yellow circular lights and 2 (white objects with red lights).  We continued to occasionally here the military jets (white objects with red lights) over the next 10 minutes and then they disappeared. The next hour we continued to watch 1 to 4  white-yellow circular lights dancing in the sky.  They made impossible erratic movements. A few times the lights would stay in one place, then suddenly race across the sky. The lights would sometimes get larger (as big as a star) with the naked eye, and then change directions and get smaller (1/2 the size of a star).  The UFO’s would occasionally circle instead of making sharp turns.  There was a 5 minute increment that we did not see UFO’s, then they appeared again for another 20 minutes.   By then we were using binoculars and the white-yellow lights appeared more spherical than! circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was unusually bright, like an arc welder.  I ran into the house to get my binoculars because it was so odd to see such a bright light during daylight hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With my binoculars, I could clearly see that this was a perfectly round object or light, there were no wings, rotors, or other visible appendages to the disc shape.  I called for my 21 year old son to come out and look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t determine the distance of the object from my location but my best guess is that it was at least 15 miles due north of us.  The object moved slowly east, behind the wispy clouds and then moved west again out of the clouds to become visible again. The object moved east and back to the west, in front of clouds and behind clouds, and in clear sky.  It moved relatively slowly, it also moved higher and lower by hundreds of feet several times during the hour or so that we were able to observe it.  The object moved north and northwest until we were no longer able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was at a school function and I tried calling her a few times while we were observing the object.  I was not able to reach her.  The first call was made at 6:04pm, the second at 6:19, and the last at 6:41.<n>

They seemed to be very high radio towers and were stationary.  But towers in the area have red or white lights.  The lights then began to move slowly and together up a little then to the left.  2 amber lights (all 4 amber lights seemed to have a downward flare to them)in front about 100 feet apart and angled like this symbol \ were separated by about 350-400 feet from the trailing 2 amber lights which were angled more like this symbol / in a trapezoidal formation with the upper right light back some and the lower right light seeming closer assuming all the lights were equal in size, I would estimate each light to be about 1-2 feet in diameter and emitting a soft glow. I could not see anything between them and afterwards I realized there might not have been any stars between them either on a clear calm night with plenty of stars out.  I rolled the! window down and heard nothing other than road and wind noise since I was traveling about 60mph as it passed directly over head.  I thought it could be helicopters in formation until the lights moved so uniformly in paired formation that it seemed like it was either 2 objects (one on the left and one on the right) or one very large object.  The trailing 2 lights had about 150-200 feet between them. The trailing 2 lights adjusted a bit and the upper more to the rear light came forward about even top to bottom relative to me, with the bottom light seemingly not to change position at all while the first 2 lights on the left did not change relative position either as they moved across the horizon.  The 4 lights moved in equal rates of speed from the right of the highway over it to the left and continued in a westerly direction, one of the lights faded out, I believe the upper right and then glowed back on in a different position.  Then 2 went out and 1 came back on leaving 3 li! ghts then the 4th returned as it gained speed moderately.  It ! seemed l ike one large dark object with the tail portion rotating about 30 degrees around the lower axis.  As I continued down the road I lost sight of it and after 3 minutes I pulled over to see if it was still around but only saw 1 amber colored light flicker in amongst the stars and down low there were security lights and buildings obstructing lower level of view.  When I realized it was not helicopters I felt plenty eerie, and was greatly relieved when it continued onward.  I wonder why it was so low to the ground and stationary in a populated area and felt sorry for whoever was in that area at the time, it could have been an abduction or a return, or…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was perfectly saucer shaped, almost like two cymbals connected at their undersides. It was parallel to the horizon, and descending diagonally.  The lights of the city lit up the clouds overhead so I was able to see the silhouette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew behind a big tree across the road. It took a moment for me to come out of shock to get up and try and see where it went but it was gone.<n>

We all raced outside in time to see it make a coarse correction and to see the flame dissipate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appeared to be falling straight towards us however at some point it leveled off and flew in a north, north east direction straight toward Kennedy Space Center from our point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it was falling the flame appeared quite large, after it leveled off the flame was mostly out however it did NOT lose speed or altitude during it&#39;s flight.  It&#39;s as if the flame was turned off but we could still see the afterglow until it got to far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us saw a craft of any type.  The flame was too bright to see anything around it however there were 2 distinct intensities of luminescence.  The center portion was a yellow(er), more intense light than the outside area.  The outside light while still very bright was almost translucent.  Both lights dimmed at approximately the same rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved completely across the sky in less than 30 seconds however there is no telling how long it was falling as I only saw it when it came into view.  I estimate it was traveling faster than a small plane, even as quick as a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One person described it as a rocket but I don&#39;t think that was likely considering it was descending and made no audible noise though the wind notoriously blows south west here so that isn&#39;t surprising.<n>

Someone noticed what appeared to be a fast moving satellite traveling almost straight overhead from south west to north east.  I was explaining how objects remain in orbit when the object appeared to stop then move in obviously controlled maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch for what seemed like one or two minutes as the object made seemingly impossible changes in direction. It made 90 degree corners, tight &#34;S&#34; turns, circles and at one point seemed to brighten in color just for a second like a spark from an arc welder.  The object then returned to its original trajectory until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amature astronomer, a pilot and I have seen many satellites and aircraft. What we saw was very clear, too high to have been an airplane and appeared to do things that if manned would not have been survivable.<n>

There were three orangish-red twinkling orbs in the sky. I pulled over and got out of my car and noticed others were doing the same as me.  The three orbs formed a triangle in the sky that hovered for 10 seconds or so. then the shape dispersed and the orbs started doing &#39;S&#39; patterns, slowly hovering around the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the three orbs, which were at least 2-3 times the size of a normal plane flashing in the sky, formed what looked like a bird&#39;s wingspan. the orbs held this formation for approximately 10 seconds, before forming a straight line and fading into the clouds one by one.<n>

This location is situated in North-West Las Vegas, Nevada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was approaching Horse Drive, I noticed two very distinctive bright orange colored lights in the sky.  At first I thought they may be special street lights, because they are doing construction work in the area.  As I got closer, driving down Horse Drive, it suddenly became clear that they were not street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued driving down Horse Drive, glaring at these lights and when I was sure of what I saw, I stopped to observe.  There was a maroon colored van, which had apparently been observing the two lights as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights were like fire and shaped like a tear drop or a clove.  The sky was dark (just beyond dusk), stars were visible.  The objects were identical.  The color was pinkish-orange at the bottom, yellowish-orange in the middle, and yellow at the top.  They were very bright.  It was just like fire and they were hovering and behaving like the movement of fire.  They appeared to be much larger than the stars, yet about 1/3 size of a regular full moon.  They were a good distinctive distance between each other, but they were clearly identical in shape and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was observing these two beings, one of them shot away over and behind the western mountains.  The maroon colored van made a U-turn and drove back up Horse Drive.  The speed of the shooting being was a little slower than lightening speed, but very, very fast.  The remaining one just hovered.  As I began to move down the street a little further, the being moved parallel to me.  I proceeded to turn in on my street and I could still see it.  I stopped the car again just before turning into my garage and the being just sat there.  I pulled into my garage and closed the door.  I grabbed my digital camera and went back outside to take pictures, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the police to report it and they gave me your number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and sincere.

Objects appeared stationary for 5-10 seconds then moved erratically over the Palmetto Expressway from East to West, then back to East before vanishing.  The objects changed in color from black to a reflective almost chrome color as it moved back and forth over the highway.  I could not get my cell phone camera open in time to photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was located between Opa Locka airport and Miami International but objects moved far to rapidly to be commercial or military aircraft.<n>

The object moved parallel with the road at a steady speed with no erratic motion. It was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or a bird.  It could possibly have been a satellite of some sort, but the object seemed to change its shape subtly as I observed it, especially toward the end of the sighting, which lasted about 30 seconds. The object reflected sunlight and appeared metallic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the object passed from view, I did a sharp U-turn and parked in a nearby driveway, got out of my car, and looked east to try to see the object again, but I couldn&#39;t spot it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just been talking to my 4 year old son about the moon and how mysterious it is.

I consulted a cell phone for the exact time. Immediately following the original flash,which caught my attention, I looked to the SW and noticed an extremely bright fireball slowly coursing the sky towards the south.  As I watched, orange sparks and chunks appeared to fall away from the main train.  The train stayed a constant length until the object disappeared behind the low hills to the south.  When it reached this point, a brilliant flash appeared, lighting the southern sky, the way it does when a lightning strike occurs some distance away, on a locally clear night.  This was different than anything I&#39;ve witnessed before, and as I&#39;ve enjoyed astronomy for years, I have witnessed many things in the night sky.  It was brighter and bigger, with a longer and more solid looking train, than any other meteor I&#39;ve previously seen.  The train did not! smoke, but was rather a solid sheet of light, as bright as sunlight on chrome, following behind the object or fireball.<n>

This is when I looked to the left (North East) and seen a blue oval shaped object moving at great speed about 10 degrees above the horizon, just above the roof tops of the houses in the distance.  It moved north east to south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about the size of a 20 millimeter bb, it was oval and moved in a straight line across the sky from north east to south west.  It was moving very fast, it took less than 10 seconds to move across the sky and my view.  At this time there was and commercial aircraft moving towards it. The commercial aircraft was much higher in the sky.  It was at about 60 degrees above the horizon and you could see the FAA required lights along with the shape.  Commercial aircraft have to fly at higher altitudes due to the military base I’m close to.  Also, the speed of the commercial aircraft was much slower than the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in front of the storm because you could see the lightning storm and clouds behind it. There also was no sound.  I also could not hear the commercial aircraft either, but I could see the moon, stars, the commercial aircraft, and clouds very clearly.  The storm in the distance was over the ocean.<n>

No blinking lights were visible and no sound of audible, only solid white lights of similar brightness of a satellite or medium bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10 seconds into the sighting, the lead craft accelerated and separated at a high rate of speed.  The trailing craft light became less visible then invisible to the eye at about 15-20 seconds into the sighting, the lead craft which had accelerated away was visible until it disappeared into the horizon.  Judging from the angle, I would have to guess the craft were flying at 60,000 - 70,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amount of time to cross the entire horizon from first sighting was roughly 35 seconds maximum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could they have been fighter aircraft?

At first I thought the light might have been an exceptionally clear and bright Mars, but I realized quickly that the light was too vivid and bright to be a planet and called my cousin outside to witness it with me.  The light seemed stationary at first, at about 50 degrees above the horizon, but then slowly moved northward.  While the light traveled north, it may have changed speed a few times.  It also pulsed quickly all the while, like a star; between slightly more bright and slightly more dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it neared the north sky, the light began an exponential decent towards the horizon and flickered between much brighter and very dim.  Around this time my cousin thought he may have heard a sound like a plane crashing to the earth.  Then the light simply vanished at about 20 degrees from the horizon and was not seen by us again, even though we watched the sky for 5 to ten minutes afterward.<n>

Located 30-40 Degrees above horizon line, moving West to East at relatively quick pace, comparable to 2-4x average jet liner speed at that distance (a jet was visible at the time for comparison – a satellite was visible about an hour after wards for further comparison).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions at time of viewing: Crystal clear night, 9 PM Eastern -5GMT Time. Less than 100 stars visible at time of viewing less than 10 visible in the vicinity of the sighting, no artificial optics (glasses, telescope, binoculars) were used to view the craft, and I had a second witness who believed the legitimacy of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: The “UFO” was a white light sphere type craft, emitting a white light 5-10 times brighter than any star that was visible at the time.  The ship did NOT change color, did not blink any lights - such as common aircraft, and the brightness level did not change for the duration of the viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared 3-5 times larger than any star in the comparable visible area, and moved left to right, with a sort of wobble or instability – commonly attributed to anti-gravity technology having issues in our environment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft did make slight adjustments in speed, and direction, but nothing concrete. They we&#39;re relatively quick adjustments, not a gradual increase or change. The speed was an almost instant increase, of about 10-25%.  The directional change was instant, but only 5-10 Degrees from its original course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance the craft moved is unknown to me, but an easy comparison is 7-10 hand widths when an arm is extended making the “stop” hand motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a number line comparison; 0 being perpendicular to the water&#39;s edge; - being left, + being right, the craft started at -2 hand widths from left (when i turned and noticed it was there), proceeding to +5 or more hand widths to the right  he craft seemed to fade into the sky as it reached the end of its path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not break eye contact with the craft (other than to blink) for the duration of the sighting – which was less than 5 minutes; but completely convincing in every way as to it being extraterrestrial in nature.<n>

At first they looked like they were at a standstill until the highest object began to move down toward the triangle and then the others followed but more to the right.  Eventually the objects disappeared.   All objects almost looked as if they were extremely shinny, almost catching a bright glare from the sun, possibly being lit with a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later we were looking into the north east sky when we saw the same objects again.  These objects started off low in the sky in a large clump then quickly broke off into several individual balls, following behind them two more individual objects.   At first they looked like balloons, but then they began looking like they were too far away to be a balloon, and they also had the bright glare.  As these objects moved toward the east we could see and very small black dot just below a few of them until the objects disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One hour after we seen these objects we drove west of my house to get a better view on top of a parking structure.

Moderate amount of air traffic overhead which is normal.  Bright sunny evening with little to no low cloud cover at all.  Winds less than 15mph and cool temps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen several planes fly over as we walked, all were small single engine craft or large SW Airlines planes. I noticed a plane way higher than other moving from west to east very slowly.  It was a cylender shaped object and looked like it was bright silver which I assumed was from the setting sun.  Several times my gaze was diverted from due to my dogs.  I was able to re-locate it easily as it never deviated course which I found odd.  The thing that struck me after several uninterrupted seconds of gazing was that this object appeared to have no wings what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to state this it moved on a very straight line from west to east and never deviated once from its flight path. I never saw any wings but this could be due to it&#39;s height.  However, I am not convinced this was the case which is why I am filing this report.  Also, all aircraft that passed overheard could be heard yet this silver object was not making a sound I could hear.<n>

When he came to a clearing where there were no trees he could see the lights clearer.  There was a house in the distance and the lights appeared to be over the top of the house.  The center bright light had a blue light circling it.  As it passed in front of the bright light it made it look like it was pulsating.  Off to either side was a smaller white light and above the bright white light was an occasional flash. When the red light flashed he related that he could see a large gun metal gray triangle shaped object.  The bright light appeared to be in the center of the craft w the other two lights being the ends of the craft. He was able to take one photograph by using his cell phone. The photo shows the lights only. He re! lated that the size of the craft was the size of a football stadium.

I was awaken by my child&#39;s baby monitor going absolutely berserk like we&#39;ve never heard it before. The way I sleep in bed I face our bedroom window( we only have one) which is covered with a thin piece of fabric. I was so tired, so I just opened my eyes to stare out the window when I noticed to BRIGHT( throbbing) lights about the size of a grapefruit at the base of our window. I lay still to make sure I saw what I just thought I saw, then the lights &#34;throbbed&#34; or pulsated again. Me being a skeptic, immediately thought that it was an intruder on the side of our house. I immediately sat up and sat STILL waiting to perhaps see the shadow of a human pass by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then got up to check on my toddler who was fast asleep.  I dare not look out the window, in fact it was like the event didn&#39;t even happen because I acted like I didn&#39;t see what I just saw. I tried to go back to sleep but felt CHARGED as if I had 10 cups of espresso.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that! day in Long Beach, we had a small earthquake too.  I felt it because I was laying in the bed, if fact the earthquake centered in Signal Hill, which is just 4 blocks north of where we live ( not sure if it&#39;s related) the earthquake was a 3.2 if I remember correctly.  Anyhow, when my husband came home from work, and started running errands together, I finally brought it up about these two strange lights outside our window, come to find out he saw them too!  But he was trying to rationalize what he saw as well. At the time I saw the lights and thought it was an intruder I completely forgot about the motion sensor that would have come on if it had been a person or animal.  The sensor didn&#39;t go off. I am so spooked. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever sleep the same again.  I have feelings of dread going to bed now.  My nerves are frayed every time the baby monitor experiences even a little static.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I see why people remain quiet or go crazy or commit suicide or something, the range of emotions are over whelming.  I have NEVER had any interest/beliefs in ! extra terrestrial phenomenon nor have I ever wanted to see ANYTHING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d probably be dead if I had see a space craft or actually alien...<n>

When craft moved from west to east, a bright white light appeared to come on at the rear.  The three lights together made a triangular appearance, but I personally could not see any space between any of the lights.  There was no sound from the craft.  The craft did not wobble when it made its exit from field, nor did it move forward to turn.  It simply left.  My passenger said that the craft had a spherical shape.  Conditions were clear.

My field of view is mostly overhead to east south east, and south, with tree blockage to the west of me.  Most of the city light is blocked out in my back yard, but with typical diffuse light to the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I am pretty good at identifying that, which is an airplane in the air, or other having grown up around aviators, and people in the space industry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw tonight was moving not as fast as say a meteorite would, like a streak, nor was it the slow steady pace of an airliner over head.   I am pretty familiar with the flight patterns and speeds of various craft overhead, helicopters or what have you, and with Reno airport nearby, it is easy to tell airplanes around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This “ufo” was orange in color, very high in the sky.  There were lower lying clouds tonight overhead, so I could tell it was above that cover.  It was moving from west to easterly direction, and man, this was not any airplane I have ever seen.   Very fast moving, but with purpose.  It was saucer to egg, to oval shaped, leaving no trail behind it.  There was no noise, though from my location sometimes you can hear very high up aircraft in later evenings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was pretty weird to me, enough to want to report it, but was also wondering if anyone else in the Reno area saw something they questioned tonight.  Were there any low flying satellites tonight in that trajectory and time, that is possible what I saw?   I honestly don’t think it was THAT high, not space high; definitely in airspace air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

Seen of 4 different occasions|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83258.html|298|ndxe201108| Dozens of lights in the sky over Spokane Wa. Seen of 4 different occasions<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 31st of July 2011, my boyfriend and I were outside around 10:30 at night. I saw what, at first, I thought was a shooting star. I pointed it out to him and we both watched it move across the sky and get dimmer and brighter.  It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, but hard to say with no size reference to compare it to.  We continued to watch it for about 30-45 seconds until it completely faded away.  Thought it was kinda odd.  But then another one popped up in the sky, in a completely different spot. It didn&#39;t move in a straight pattern this time. It moved up and down left and right at a pretty steady pace. Not fast, not slow. Almost like a cruising like matter you&#39;d see an airplane travel at. Mind you there were NO flashing lights. Just ONE solid light that was white, like a star. Hence why I thought at first it was a shooting star. We watched it until it faded away as well. THEN AGAIN, a third one pops up in a completely different spot and does the s! ame thing. Gets really bright and moves around until it fades away to nothing. We definitely thought it was strange but didn&#39;t have any explanation. The next night August 1st 2011, around 10:30 again, I was outside and out of the corner of my eye I caught a light flash in the sky. It was exactly like what we had seen the night before. I watched it travel across the sky until it faded completely. I stayed outside to watch a little longer but didn&#39;t see any other lights. THE NEXT NIGHT August 2nd 2011, again around 10:30, I was again, outside when THIS TIME I was looking to the sky to see if I&#39;d catch a glimpse of the lights. And to my &#34;not so much surprise&#34; I seen another light!! By this point my mind is blown and I&#39;m really wishing my boyfriend was out there to witness the lights with me again. I had told a couple people about it and every night I would watch the sky to see if there were any more lights. But there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night (mind you this was at 10:00pm last night August 17th 2011) my best friend and neighbor calls me and asks if I can hear the helicopter outside flying around. Apparently they were looking for someone because they had their spot light on looking in all the back yards. (This is the NW Blvd/Maple-Ash neighborhood) When I came out I looked up and seen what I thought was the helicopter. I say to my friend that I don&#39;t see its spotlight. She then directs me to the south where the helicopter was when all along I was looking at the bright light &#34;flying&#34; around in the northern sky. I am then VERY excited and tell her to come look at the bright light, explaining to her that its just like what I had seen earlier in the month. We watched it fly around until it faded away completely. We sat outside and started talking about how strange the light was when ANOTHER one pops up out of nowhere in the northeastern sky.  Our older kids (10 and 12yrs) come outside wondering why we&#39;ve bee! n gone so long.  So we start explaining to them whats up. When YET AGAIN another light pops up in the sky. My best friend goes inside to get her camera so we can try and capture some of this. Me and the boys see yet another one moving from west to east, the light got REALLY bright, stopped, then descended to what looks like, from our position, to be about the felts field/valley area. Hard to say from our viewpoint exactly. Anyways, while it descended, it started pulsating red and orange. We watched it until it slowly drop out of the sky until it was out of our view. By this point we&#39;re really tripping out! (We never heard any booms though, always silent) We sat out there and continued to watch the &#34;lights in the sky&#34; until about 11:00. There were too many to count. Had to be DOZENS of different lights. Some individual and some in groups. Some travel in the exact same flight pattern as the one before it, some are completely random. Some blink on and off. Some are just really ! dim like the light you&#39;d see when a satellite moves across the! sky, an d some are extremely bright!  To me they&#39;re UFO&#39;s... now that does NOT mean its aliens but it sure as hell DOES mean they&#39;re unidentified!!! The best way I can describe them is, they look like stars at first, then they get REALLY BRIGHT, and travel across the sky in no particular pattern and fade away until you can&#39;t see them with your naked eye anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They do NOT fly in straight lines every time either. Some do, but others move from left to right then up and down then back to the left again. Very strange. Going out tonight to try and catch this on video.! Really hoping for clear skies tonight!!  There were many reports and A LOT of talk on our local news stations facebook pages last night, 8/17/2011 and today, 8/18/2011, about a bright light seen over the Spokane Valley that fell from the sky and a HUGE BOOM that shook people out of their homes to the streets to investigate. The light that we seen descending from the sky, pulsating orange and red is approximately the same time as the reports from the Valley. Coincidence? There is currently no explanation to what these witnesses in the valley experienced.<n>

It dipped below some trees and buildings for a moment then rose back up and started to dance around the general area but never moved out of that particular area.

Object was moving in a steady line across the sky.  The orange color, and lack of flashing lights caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the object out to my husband and son and we proceeded to run outside.  The object had no sound, and moved very smoothly coming from the east and heading north/west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our home is in direct course to Stony Brook University Hospital&#39;s helicopter path, and this was not a helicopter, the height of the object was of the same height as the helicopters fly.  Again, no sound at all, while the helicopters are very loud.<n>

My mother watched as well then  after 20 sec give or take a few poof it was gone!  No clouds at this time around and it was no airplane,helicopter,shooting star nor comett without a doubt!!It was like it hit warp drive.  Not long after i seen airplane pass by then a helicopter headed south same direction the light was heading. Then 10min or so i seen another light do exactly same type thing,going across sky N to the S then poof gone.i seen 2 more.4 alltogether.  They showed up one at a time.Clouds moved in now but i will for sure be watching as the night progresses<n>

I thought it was a helicopter at first but it had no propellers on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sped further ahead of me at least a half mile in just a second.  It hovered for a few more seconds and disappeared.  Two commercial airliners were higher in the sky to the right and coming in for landing at MSP airport.  I looked all over the sky and saw it again higher up and to the right about 5 miles away.  It travelled forward for a brief time in a straight flying pattern and then disappeared.  It was white except for when the setting sun shone directly on it where it turned shiny silver.<n>

I Thoght I would correct it but that dosn&#39;t seem possible so this is the next best solution that I know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In some ways I wondered about how low that plane was flying also and how quiet it was.  I don&#39;t blieve we have any air planes normaly that fly that low over our city.

The source of the light appeared to be above the clouds and showing through the clouds similar to the moon showing through the clouds.   The moon was nearby this light pattern.   The circular shape continued round and round for approximately 15 to 20 twenty minutes before it stopped at the 6 o&#39;clock point on the circle and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not hear any sounds from the area of the circuling light.   We did see a helicopter quite a distance away at a much lower altitude.   We also heard the sound of a jet aircraft on the opposite side of the night sky from the location of the light in question.  Our first instinct was the jet came from Biggs Field, which is part of Ft. Bliss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not see any news reports regarding this sighting.

It stopped and I told my girlfriend to come look. We got the binoculars and saw red,blue,silvery white,and yellow lights spinning around in circles on the UFO.  We saw it very clearly.A few minutes later we saw 2 jets fly near the UFO as if they were checking it out also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend said to take a picture of it,so I got my camera and did.  She also took a picture of the UFO with her camera.  Then I decided to flash my large flashlight at the UFO.It stayed in the same place and moved only a few degrees horizontally to our right.  We observed the UFO for over an hour between the hours of 11:00pm and 12:00am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally went to sleep in the van at midnight because it was just hanging there and we were cold and tired.We took pictures of the UFO with our Kodak cameras.

8/16/11 22:22|Boise|ID|Light|10 minutes|Bright Red UFO Seen Over Boise at End of Hyde Street Fair|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83964.html|318|ndxe201108| Bright Red UFO Seen Over Boise at End of Hyde Street Fair<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event is unique as it is an ANNUAL sighting of what appears to be the exact same UFO over Boise during a specific event.  I have seen several UFO&#39;s since living in the Boise area and have reported most of them on this website... including last year&#39;s event of the Red UFO above Boise after the Hyde Street Fair.  This sighting occurred less than an hour ago one year after the previous sighting and was witnessed by the same person (myself).  The details are as follows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting is of a Red pulsating light type UFO that made no sound.  The UFO was visible in the sky approximately 15 degrees above the horizon from my perspective.  Note that I have many satellite tracking and planetary tracking programs and always check possible sightings against this database to rule out publicly known manmade objects.  This red UFO is not a publicly known satellite, nor planet, nor star, nor did it behave like one.  It pulsated a pure red glow at regular intervals that seemed to repeat; there was a complex pattern to it that I was not able to decipher--I had enough time to run inside and grab a camcorder to try filming it, but unfortunately could not focus on the object.  Oddly, my camcorder which normally functions perfectly, would not focus with automatic or manual operation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red UFO bobbed up and down slightly for about 10 minutes, then suddenly moved (as seen from my perspective in the North End of Boise) at what looked to be an incredible speed to the East.  It then faded out of sight within 2 minutes after it exited it&#39;s hover phase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that the author does not drink alcohol nor is prescribed any medication.  I am a professional engineer and trained as a pilot.  I was completely awake and sober during the observation so nothing was clouding my observation.  I also trained as a Law Enforcement Officer in California in 2005.  So I have training in observation and reporting.  That said, I still don&#39;t know what these objects are but I didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s until I started seeing them with (alarming?) regularity several years ago.  Even after capturing one event at extreme close proximity I still had my doubts; could they not in fact be natural phenomenon?  This event though occurred two years in a row after the Hyde Street Fair in Boise.  The position of the &#34;craft&#34; was different (last year, directly overhead/this year, to the East-South-East) but it appeared after the Fair ends.  Note also that I am outside in my front yard looking at the sky with binoculars or a telescope most nights of the year (appro! ximately 275/365) and have only seen this object in the second or third week of September...<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a good chance it will be seen on September 17th at 22:20.  Look for a Bright Red pulsating object in the shape of a light in the direction of the East-South-East from any location in or around downtown Boise.  Make sure there is a fairly dark area of the sky visible with no lights from the ground, and that no buildings and/or trees obscure the horizon from approximately 0-15 degrees above it, as referenced by overhead being 90 degrees and the opposite horizon being 180 degrees.<n>

After lacing my tennis shoes and listening to ( my girlfriend ) ((name deleted)) speak, I noticed the oven clock registered 8:05 and I patted my thigh for my camera/phone which I did not have this time but grabbed my walking stick and proceeded through the garage anyway.Leaving the driveway and turning slightly right onto Cliffside Road, I became aware of the tapping cadence of my stick and pondered leaving it behind but did not. Turning slightly right atop the 50 yard incline of Cliffside, now on South Drive, I heard children playing and spotted them above the church as I walked toward bustling Fort Henry Drive.  I couldn&#39;t help but wonder why children would play on such a dangerously steep driveway slope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I reached Fort Henry Drive i waited on traffic recanting the irony of ((name deleted)) not tolerating crossing the street for a &#34;quiet&#34; walk.  Tap, tap my stick rings my advance up the steep drive between RHA and the Seventh Day Church drives.  Coming to my usual flat rock,facing South, I habitually stand both feet together while staring down into the craggy boulders beneath, craning to see any life scurrying about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I look up the tree at about 10-12 feet  I am aware of the slight dusk- breeze and the sudden break in traffic noise. Suddenly, I am staring straight at an elongated shiny &#34;craft&#34; resembling a two-piece telescope,with two distinctly different colors of metal, patchwork assembled like bricks, with opposing flat panels mid section about an eighth the width of total craft length.  The schock of its silence, ghostily speeding near mach 1 was mezmerising, I stepped back, leaned on my walking stick as the object glinted on the left mid side, then right mid side before glinting out about 3 inches above the mountain peak behind Wal-Mart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coherent enough to judge the objects scale as 6-8 times the diameter of the Sun, level, and wondered if 20 tractor-trailers! could fill its mass.I stared at nothingness for another 30-40! seconds before traffic noise pulled me toward home, completely avoiding my normal walk route.  My walk this night, a bit unusual, I could not wait to draw out what I&#39;d just witnessed.  There were no clouds, no planes, and no rationale for what just happened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once inside the kitchen I shakily fumbled for paper and pen and hurriedly scratched out a sketch,told ((name deleted)) i saw a UFO over Wal_mart, and logged on to NASA ISS Live Orbit Feed just as the ISS was about to cross over Africa. Looking at its elavation: 245 miles, speed, 17, 347 mph,and azimuth the schedule read it would be visable over Kingsport the 16th of August for 3 minutes.......245 MILES !........I just saw a UFO that resembled the Hubble Telescope!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I was interviewing for a new job and took the time to log this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The folowing day, Thursday I reenacted my walk sequence gathering more accurate details, called the t.v., newspaper and local radio stations asking about other sightings- nothing but laughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called the TriCities Airport Tower and asked of Tuesday anomolies-nothing.Posted an inquiry on my faceBook status:  nothing but criticism.  I&#39;d say I really have seen a UFO now.<n>
8/16/11 18:00|West Seneca|NY|Fireball|two minutes|Strange orange-red fireball moving erratically, almost bouncing, several thousand feet in the southwest sky.|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83272.html|323|ndxe201108| Strange orange-red fireball moving erratically, almost bouncing, several thousand feet in the southwest sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were in our suburban backyard, just southeast of Buffalo, NY.  We just moved into the home one month ago. We previously lived in a country setting and never have I seen anything like what occurred on 8/16/2011. We were talking with our neighbor in our backyard and I noticed what looked like an orange-red fireball in the southwestern sky. It was moving slowly and without sound, it appeared several thousand feet in the sky, it was moving from the southwest towards the east. I asked my neighbor what it looked like, he said it looked kind of weird.  My girlfriend saw it as well, she didn&#39;t know what it was. I commented that it did not look like any aircraft I have ever seen, nor was it shaped like an airplane, it also appeared to change shape and alter it&#39;s direction slightly up, then down, like it was bouncing or unstable, the movement was very quick.  It also appeared that the color started to get brighter, then diminish, but not blinking. I guess you could describe it as looking like something on fire with erratic, non-linear movements.  I would like to mention I was in the U.S. Army, my specialty or MOS was air-defense artillery.  I was trained to recognize many, many types of military and civilian aircraft that were friendly and enemy.  I spent years training for war and recognizing aircraft by the WEFT method, which meant wings, engine, fuselage and tail. I have been witness to many types of flares dropped from F-16&#39;s and other aircraft doing evasive maneuvers.  This did not appear to be a flare or anything I have ever seen.  My neighbor commented that it looked like a Chinese Lantern, but it was way too high up in the sky and too large to be something like that.  Anyway, the fireball moved  out of sight behind a huge cottonwood tree that was in our other neighbor&#39;s yard to our south. I waited for it to reappear on the other side of the tree but it did not.  The duration of our ability to see this object was approx! imately one to two minutes.  I walked into the street to try to! find it again but could not. It just disappeared.  I would like to mention there are not any military airfields close-by or in that vicinity of the sky.  The closest one is in Niagara Falls, about twenty-five to thirty minutes north of Buffalo.  That airfield houses large transport aircraft, which I could easily recognize in the sky.  Anyway, this &#34;Fireball&#34; was surely strange and without any sound.  This is the first time I, my girlfriend, or neighbor have ever seen something like that.<n>
8/16/11 17:28|Coos Bay|OR|Light|7 minutes|I saw a steady ball of light with no sound  about 20,000 feet fly by in a northesterly direction from coos bay|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83226.html|324|ndxe201108| I saw a steady ball of light with no sound  about 20,000 feet fly by in a northesterly direction from coos bay<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the dog out to the backyard and noticed movement to the north at about 75 degrees moving in a north eastern direction.  It was a white ball of light about 20,000 feet elevation moving about the cruising speed of the coast guard helicopters.  My best guess of diameter was about 100 feet. it appeared sheperical.  There was absolutely no noise. i&#39;m in the flight paths of our local airport and helicopters and i can tell you it was not a normal flight path.  I know what i saw because i grew up learning aeronautical information from my uncle who was an engineer for boeing for 40+ years and have always been an aircraft enthusiast. i watched it untill it was out of site. We live on the highest central hill in the area.  The brilliance of the light did not flicker or change in any way, it was steady untill out of my site.  there was trail. no color changes. no landing. no sound. no aura. no haze.  i didn&#39;t grab the camera because i didn&#39;t know how long it would last! .<n>

At 11:55 am I saw a metallic reflection in the Western sky.  The object was VERY distant.  It did not move.  It reflected the sunlight and when I looked at it with my naked eye, appeared to rotate.  I had my binoculars with me and the object was still to distant to discern any tell tale identifying characteristics.  Through the binoculars it appeared to shimmer different colors - red - blue and green.  My neighbor and his two grand kids saw it too.  I pointed it out to another gentleman who saw it as well.  I went into the store and came out and it was gone.  I watched the object for a total of fifteen minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object was heading SW very quickly, entered into a small cloud formation, and did not exit.  No sign of object afterward. Entire sighting lasted about 5 seconds.  It caught my eye because I didn&#39;t see a tail fin, like a plane would have.  Object was flying very fast in a straight line.  Other traffic was on US 60 at the time, traveling in the same direction, so I don&#39;t know if others saw this or not. I know I did.<n>

8/16/11 01:00|Raytown|MO|Triangle|10-15 min|Very bright color changing triangular shaped object floating and flying over small area|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83246.html|328|ndxe201108| Very bright color changing triangular shaped object floating and flying over small area<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I went outside to smoke a cigarette and as I walked out my back door onto my deck I saw an amazingly bright and brilliant cluster of red light(s) I turned to look at it and immediately noticed the way the lights looked was not like a “normal” light.  It is very hard to put into words but the best I can do is say that normal lights shine light but these seemed to glow more brightly than anything I’ve ever seen glow, or maybe a better way to put it would be to say that they radiated colored energy.  Which sounds crazy even to me when I was the one who saw it, but that is truly the only way I can find to describe it.  I asked my husband if he saw it as well. He simply stated yes. I asked what it was, and almost at the same moment he started to say it was an airplane it moved slowly to the left and the lights changed to an equally bright green.  I asked him again “that’s an airplane? Really?” he agreed that it was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch as it floated slowly to the left and then sped up and changed to blue lights and flew upwards.  Then stop moving in more than a slight hovering like instability for approximately a minuet maybe two then repeated the flight pattern and color changing again then slowed again to the hover like movement now with only the red lights blinking at random and inconsistent intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t gauge the distance of the object but it was visible over the tree tops near my home. It was triangular in shape with multiple intensely bright lights that changed colors. And from where we were standing it looked as though it could be rather large in size. We watched this pattern of flying and changing color for 10-15 min at somewhere between 1-2 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then decided to go out into the front yard to see if I could get a better look at it and also to see if there was anyone else that was seeing the same thing.  There were some individuals outside but I could not see it from the front of my home due to tree and houses blocking the area I had seen it. When I returned into the back yard to watch it further, my husband had come back inside and informed me it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband took over 24 hours to allow himself to accept that this thing was not something that could be explained easily and the same night he finally admitted that it was an Unidentifiable flying something or another, (he refuses to say UFO because he thinks it will make him sound like a nut case) informed me the next evening that he had seen another object flying extremely fast across the sky, I however was not home that evening to confirm or deny his sighting, although he is not a believer in any other worldly things or the possibility of them so I am inclined to trust his admittance to seeing something he doesn’t believe in.  I am someone who believes that anything is possible and that it is ignorant and egotistical of us to believe that in the vast unending universe, we are the only beings or living things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what it was, however I know it was something that I have never seen the like of before and believe that the way that craft moved and the manner in which! it changed colors and blinked without recognizable pattern was not any object that I have known to exist yet here.<n>

We see it around 1-3am.  I had a friend over and he told me its probably the space station.  It resembles a star that is very bright. It moves very slow.  I have taken pictures of it and it looks like a ball in a few photos and a few other photos it resembles a v shape.  Im confused about what this is.  I don’t understand why I have not seen anything online about it. It has been in our town for months.  I have also noticed in a few of the pictures I have that if I zoom in really good I can see another light close to it and if I zoom down I can see something red.  I cannot see either one of those with my eyes only the bright looking one that resembles a star.   Does anyone know if a satellites could possible be in our town every night and if they move really slow threw towns?  I really need some help trying to identify this thing in our to! wn. If you would like this pictures please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I looked up directly at it, It has a straight line/row of small color lights, directly down the center, In between the two big lights. It was no plane, It was no helicopter. I could not see a form or craft, Only the two big bright round lights then as I got very close, I seen the row of smaller color lights down the center, The color lights was from the front part of the bright white lights, towards the rear, And past the rear, About 5 or 6 smaller color lights.  The colors was red, I think orange, I dont know if there was more colors or not,  They lighted from front to back, slowly but consistant, On, Off one at a time. There was no sound that I could hear and the size of that should have had noise no doubt.  Anyway I guess it was a mile up or less, Very close, I looked away after about 15 seconds to dial my wifes cell phone and tell her to look up But as I told her and looked back at it, ! It was gone. completle no where to be seen, It was totally black sky again about 10:45 Pm.  My house was only about 1 mile from where I seen it. There was 2 or 3 cars back behind me, I noticed them after it vanished.  I wounder if they seen it too. This this was like I was ment to see it ?. I know that sounds crazy!.  I always believed in ufo&#39;s, Aliens with out a doubt, I just never ever seen anything like this.  This was some type of ufo: I guarantee that....was it military, Maybe but why there.....and If it was military,  Then They Made something out of this world. I am telling you this was no doubt in my mind a ufo: I am 39 years old and never seen nothing close to this.  I alway&#39;s believed, Now I Know.  Was this thing a actual space ship thing ? or A Monitor/Spy Thing ? .  What was it.... Why did I see it....????  WOW....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were out on a private beach in Kittery point waiting for another friend of ours to get home.  It was getting kind of boring, and I was just watching the sky.  At one point I noticed a really slow-moving plane type thing flying away in the distance.  I said something to my friends and pointed up at the craft, and as soon as I raised my hand in it&#39;s direction the object turned on a dime.  It made a very tight turn and flew directly over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was getting closer, I could see that it was not very high up from the ground.  The other strange thing about it was that the craft was sort of triangular with a big green light in the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think I would have believed it was a UFO nearly as much if I hadn&#39;t turned on the T.V the next day and immediately seen a show on the history channel about UFO&#39;s, and the UFO&#39;s the! y said had thousands of sightings over Bolivia and other foreign countries looked almost exactly like what I thought we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shall follow your requests to leave out contact info, but please feel free to contact me if possible.  I would be more than willing to answer questions or here other stories and whatnot about sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

These lights were horizontal but slightly higher on the left.  The lights appeared from right to left, fading in one at a time, then quickly faded out in the same fashion(also right to left). after the first time this happened, I yelled at my father to come look, he saw one of the 3 occurrences of the same thing happen. each time this occurred subsequently, the lights moved to the left(north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the third time, I stared in the area for about a half an hour, before giving up on seeing anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I had my sister bring my phone from inside the house out to me, the camera app would only show blue(which it has never done, and had worked prior the same evening)<n>

The object was far away at first but we could tell it wasn’t moving. It was entirely too high to be a cell phone tower or radio transmission tower.  As we kept getting closer we could see the lights underneath, three of them-shaped in a triangular form with a dim, red flashing light.  The UFO then moved south about two miles. We were heading east so it moved from our left to our right and stayed there in that position hovering high in the sky.  That was the last I saw of the unidentified flying object.  I will be happy to go into more detail but would like to hear that someone else saw the same thing, first.<n>

These flames were not stationary as lights would be, but appeared to flicker, just as the exhaust of a rocket would.  These flames were bright orange in color and are what caught the eye first.  These strange occurrences were observed by ourselves and another couple with whom we were camping.  On the first occasion there were several other campers in the area, who also observed these strange vehicles/craft and commented that ET had arrived.  I cannot provide any additional information on these other campers, with the exception of the couple that we were with.  On each of these occasions the strange vehicles were observed be flying slowly at approximately the altitude that a small plane would be at, but appeared to be moving slower than a small plane would fly.  The unknown vehicles/craft did not make any discernible noises, but m! oved silently across the sky.  During each of the sightings, none of the mysterious craft/vehicles was observed to make any sudden or erratic movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During each occurrence the strange vehicles/craft appeared in the Eastern sky without warning and without making any obvious noise or sudden movements.  The following is what was observed by this writer and three others;  •	Monday, 08/15/2011 – initial observation of the above described vehicle/craft.  Two craft were observed.  At approximately 8:40 PM, a single mysterious craft appeared over the tree line, out of the Eastern sky and preceded in a Westerly direction, when almost over our position on the ground, the craft turned in a Southerly direction.  While watching this craft for approximately 1.5 to 2.0 minutes as it was moving away from us, a second unknown craft was observed to come from approximately the same spot in the sky as the first and followed basically the same route as the first in a Southerly direction.  Both of the unknown craft were observed to simply dissolve or disappear while moving away from the campground.  They did not put on any burst of speed, but simply disappeared at what could have been about ¼ to ½ mile away from where we were standing.  This sighting was totally unexpected as we were not expecting anything like this to occur.  We were just sitting outdoors and! playing cards at the site picnic table.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	Tuesday, 08/16/2011 – Nothing suspicious observed as we were not available to be looking at the sky or expecting a recurrence of the prior evenings sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	Wednesday, 08/17/2011 – second sighting of the same type of the above described mysterious vehicle/craft.  Two craft were observed this date at approximately 8:45 PM.  The first mysterious craft was observed to be approaching the campground from the Eastern sky, in a Westerly direction.  This craft was moving silently and smoothly just as the craft of the Monday night sightings.  This first craft veered off in a Northerly direction and was still in sight when a second craft was observed to materialize from approximately the same area of the sky as the first and then followed the same route that the first vehicle/craft had taken.  In approximately 1 to 2 minutes both of the craft disappeared.  Again this appeared to occur without any increase in speed and the point of disappearance was approximately ¼ to ½ of a mile distant.  Again the four of us were playing cards and not expecting to see anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	Thursday, 08/18/2011 – third sighting of the mysterious, above described vehicle/craft at approximately 8:45 PM.  As described above the mysterious craft appeared in the Eastern sky, heading in a Westerly direction, moving at the same pace and noiselessly as on prior occasions.  The craft turned in a Northerly direction and maintained a steady pace until it disappeared in approximately the same position as the previous evening.  There was only one craft observed on this date.  Due to the two previous sightings we were looking for a reoccurrence of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	Friday, 08/19/2011 – nothing observed, however, it was well past 9:00 PM by the time we remembered to look for any strange occurrences in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	Saturday, 08/20/2011 – fourth sighting of the mysterious, above described vehicle/craft at approximately 8:30 PM.  As previously described the first unknown craft appeared, heading in a Westerly direction from out of the Eastern sky.  This vehicle/craft turned in a Northerly direction and was followed in about one minute by a second vehicle, materializing out of approximately the same position in the Eastern sky and followed the route of the 1st craft.  Within another minute the 2nd vehicle/craft was followed by a 3rd vehicle/craft which appeared in approximately the same position as the first two, followed the same route and all three vehicles/craft disappeared within approximately three minutes, without any apparent increase in speed.  Again we were sitting outdoors, playing cards and not really expecting to see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> •	Sunday, 08/21/2011 – nothing unusual was observed this date.  We sat outdoors from approximately 8:15 PM through 10:00 PM seeking suspicious occurrences, however, without seeing anything suspicious or unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that during the times of these observations there were quite a few airliners and small planes observed in the area.  Engine noises were evident from these normal planes; however, except for the change in course from the first night nothing about the description or actions of the mysterious vehicles/craft deviated in any way, with the exception of the numbers observed daily.  Daily, these mysterious vehicles/craft were very distinctive as due to the flames under the craft, they glowed orange and almost appeared to be on fire, except there was no apparent emergency.  These vehicles/craft were distinctly different from the normal airplanes observed.  You will notice that all four of the occurrences described above happened between 8:30 and 9:00 PM nightly, just about when darkness was falling and making it difficult to obtain a really good view of the mysterious craft(s).  The only viewing device on hand was a pair of 7x35 binoculars which did not provide a g! ood view of these craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, 08/20/2011, I contacted John Ventre, Director for Pennsylvania Chapter of MUFON, (before the Saturday sightings), and he requested that I submit this report and advise what we had seen.  I had contacted him in order to determine if anyone else had reported seeing anything similar to what we had seen and he advised that he was not totally up to date on the reports, as he had been out of town for several days.  I had advised John Ventre that while we were camping Internet access was unavailable and that I would file a sighting report this date after arriving at home and having access to the internet.<n>

There were no other cars around which was strange in itself. I glanced to the right and did a double take because what I saw was unbelievable and it shook me up so much that I forgot I had my cell phone with me. The craft, that&#39;s all I know to call it, was huge!  Black and triangular in shape, 3 large white lights and smaller blinking lights connecting them.  It was hovering about 100 or so feet above the tree line. Just sitting there, no sound at all. It was more dull kind of like a gun metal black color and believe me… HUGE! I watched it until the light changed and tried to keep it in sight until I could get home to get my camera. I could see it well until I turned into my drive when the tree line covered it I thought.  I caught one last glimpse of it as I approached my house. I got out of my car and ran in the house thinking I may be able to see it from t! he 2nd story window but when I looked out the window it was no where to be seen.  I got back into my car with my camera and headed back to the site but it was no longer there.  I will never forget this because even though I&#39;ve sited ufos before, I&#39;ve never seen on of this size nor up that close and personal!

I remember it well cause i was always fascinated by UFO&#39;s and Aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i wen outside to ride my bike for a while, it was about 7pm, sun was going down and there was a nice sunset.  I rode it for like about 10 min,<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i looked up to the sunset and clouds were red,  Thats when i spotted something shiny, The sun&#39;s rays were hitting it. It looked like it was made out of a metal , or something like that.  It was round. I watched it for like 5sec , and i thought... &#34; Its prob just a plane&#34; i kept looking at it for a while, it looked like it was sitting in one area the whole time.  Then out of no-where, I just saw it Zoom Strait up.  At that moment i thought &#34; I did not just see that go up, OMG&#34;  It was sitting still one moment, the other, you just saw a little blur where it just flew up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to go tell my dad, and mom . and as usual, thy would not believe me.  They think its all nonsence.  But.  But i know i saw something different that day.  I never told anyone, cause everyone would just think im lieing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There was black smoke from the flying unit.  Wispy black smoke, not like it was on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed rather low and loud for a private plane or jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It curved around a mountain in front of me and I lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was low; but not so low that it was ‘right on top of me’ My gut was this was some military missle.  I wondered if it was a small plane/jet.  But a)I didn’t see wings (I recognize I could’ve missed this);  b) I usually don’t hear that kind of sound with a small plane/jet;  c)  It seemed to be moving pretty fast as low  as I thought it was compared to a small plane/jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wondering what it was and if anyone else saw it.<n>

The bottom of the craft opened and it look liked a bowl upside down.  It had a slow counterclockwise spin.  The bottom of the craft was grooved with white lights between each groove.  It moved back and forth over the parking lot that was full of cars.  It darted back and forth as it ascended upwards. I would call it a darting movement that was hard to watch as it moved. It was about 100 feet across and 50 feet tall. It then stopped again for a few seconds and came closer towards us and then darted over Applebees where we could not see it any longer. It was seen about 500 feet from us to about 200 feet when it moved over Applebees.  There were people in the parkin lot looking up.

8/15/11 03:30|Wellington|OH|Circle|1 Hour|Bright "star" like object exhibiting erratic movements caught on video, along with possible contact?! Scary, unexplained noise on video|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83207.html|349|ndxe201108| Bright &#34;star&#34; like object exhibiting erratic movements caught on video, along with possible contact?! Scary, unexplained noise on video<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 2 young children, one is 3 and the other is a newborn so when we want a cigarette we step outside.  I proceeded to go outside and smoke around 3 a.m. on August 15th in the rural area of Wellington which is about 45 minutes from Cleveland. It&#39;s pretty dark in this area so looking at the stars is what we like to do considering the good view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up, I saw what appeared to be a star. This star however very quickly exhibited some erratic movement. It would move left slow then shoot really fast then stop.  It would shoot right angles and stop and go.  Very clearly not the movement of a star hopping or any planes or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I grabbed my girlfriend to watch, she also observed the erratic movements of our star. It would move crazy directions and very fast at some points; as fast as a shooting star.  After we observed it for a few minutes and were pointing, it almost reacted to our shock and our pointing..almost as if it were showing off. Now it wou! ld make all the sense in the universe to me that if you wanted to just stay in the night sky, your ship could look like a star.  And if we have satellites that can listen in, why couldn&#39;t this &#34;star&#34; have been aware of us?  On to the best (and craziest) part of the night. About 30 minutes later, I decided to try and film it with our camcorder. It&#39;s a little dated; you can know this because it still uses tapes.  The UFO we observed however did NOT show up on the camcorder. I thought I had failed but when I walked to my car to get something, behind our apartment building (out of sight of my original position), there was a VERY bright star-like object also showing some erratic yet very thought out movements.  This object was way brighter than the north star, almost as bright as a plane, in the SW sky.  This object I DID capture on film for over 30 minutes with a stationary camcorder. It moved in all different directions; not following a traditional orbit or flightpath of anything rational that can fly. I got to zoom in on it and it was a rainbow of colors but very clearly shows the object itself was circling..showing like a stationary propulsion system. I have 30 minutes of video with the camcord! er sitting in place perfectly still and you can observe what the object looks like, and it&#39;s movement in and out of the shot. Also fast-forwarding and rewinding CLEARLY shows the objects random movements. Also, every shot I got has a portion of the awning of our apartment building in it so you can see that the camera is still and the crazy movement of the object. At one point zoomed in, it looks to be powered bya central electrical turbine which the rest of the visible ship spinning clockwise to stay in flight.  The UFO itself doesnt spin just its surface does and from far away it resembled an electric eye or a blue and sometimes purple &#34;death star&#34; if you will. I&#39;ve wanted my whole life to see something like this and even though I was uneasy the whole time, I remained skeptical until the end of my film.  I heard what sounded like a group of women moaning a ghostly sound in unison; it was the most scary and creepy thing I&#39;ve ever heard in my life.  I caught it on camera so oth! er people can hear it but it sounded like nothing I&#39;ve ever heard and contains no explaination that I could even begin to think of.  I felt a chill to my core after hearing this and I know whoever watches the tape will too. It was also loud like nothing I&#39;ve heard before it was as if it were behind the treeline it felt so close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stationary camcorder records its obviously erratic yet intelligent movement, it captures the look and design of the ship, and it captures the most horrifying sound I have EVER heard in my 23 years of existance.  I would rather know I was going to be tortured than to feel how I did when I heard that sound; it sounded like something straight out of the movies; like it could&#39;ve been straight out of the movie Signs when they hear it through the baby moniter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If scientists dissect this tape, I feel that this could be the holy grail of videos for ufologists..the smoking gun. I will not give this tape up unless I know that the video will be taken seriously.<n>

This is a relatively benign wilderness for evening travel with a headlamp and I was enjoying the mosquito free journey through the lodge pole pine and fir forest with the many spectacular meadow rimmed lakes providing wonderful opportunities to see an occasional shooting star or rather (meteorites) from the Persid Meteor Shower.  I usually schedule a trip during this period specifically to see this shower, yet this year, the waning gibbous moon phase eliminated all but the brightest meteorites from visibility.  Upon reaching Second Dinkey Lake at approximately 12:25 a.m., I skirted the west side of the lake, heading south away from the South Lake to First Dinkey Lake connector trail and sat down on the southwest shoreline to take a rest. Looking up in the general direction of the Andromeda Constellation (northe! ast), I observed a red/orange flicker of light that appeared to resemble a meteorite on vertical entry into the atmosphere.  At arm’s length, the length of this flicker appeared to be at least 3/4 inch when compared to the width of my thumb.  As soon as the light faded away, an object, white in color, accelerated at an incredible rate of speed crossing the sky in a southeast direction from the exact location of the flicker. I immediately checked my watch and found it was 12:30 a.m.  Having seen hundreds of satellites cross the sky at fixed rates of speed, this object clearly showed acceleration from the point of origin. This was not a satellite crossing the sky as I would have seen the approach heading toward the location of the original flicker. I immediately stood up, called my resting dog and within twenty feet we were back into the dense forest on the last ascent to Island Lake.<n>

On August 14, 2011 at approximately 11:18 P.M., my wife and I were walking our dog, Chance, down Ishnala Rd.   As we walked, something in the sky caught our eye, it was an orangish / Reddish/Firey object coming over the tree line to our left which was a slightly North-West direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object came over the tree line at a plane like speed heading  slightly South-East .  It slowed down to a complete stop in the sky and started to flicker and fade away.  As that one was fading, a second one started to come over the tree line following the same flight pattern and movements precisely, stopping at the same point the first one we spotted (by that time the first one was gone) and started the same faze, flickering then fading.  This continued at least two to three more times for a total of at least four or five times, then stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching, there was a third person driving down Ishnala Rd at a slow speed.  As he approach he stopped and was in awe as my wife and I were at seeing this.  We both tried to figure out what these objects could possibly be and can not come up with a earthly reasonable response.   Therefore, I do believe in extraterrestrial life form from this point on.<n>

At about 22:30 one of the members of the group noticed two very bright red-orange glowing silent orbs floating in the south sky slightly over the water.  At first, they appeared to be miles down the beach but then they started to slowly move towards us at a constant speed, keeping their formation but moving in slightly different directions.  They appeared as if they might have passed directly in front of us, but then stopped and disappeared into the night sky, still a few miles down the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our group stayed out for a while after, continuing to watch the sky. Around 23:45 another member of our group noticed a large white orb in the sky above us that quickly flashed away with a very bright light.  Immediately following this, we saw another orange orb that seamed to appear out of thin air. This time, it was only one, but it moved in the same pattern as the first group of orbs and then disappeared in the same manor.  While all these events were occurring, the family dog noticed the orb and proceeded to growl until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was far brighter than any satellite I&#39;ve ever seen and appeared to be in the middle atmosphere from my perspective.

It traveled directly overhead to the opposite side of the sky in about a minute and a half, quickly dimming and completely disappearing about 15 degrees above the northeast horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was completely silent and maintained constant luminosity along its entire visible path.  There were no blinking lights evident, just continuous white light.  The sky in which I first observed the object was very close to a bank of halide lights from my perspective, which made me have a strong sense that the brightness of the object, its diffusion of light and its angle of incidence put it in the middle atmosphere at the highest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They appeared to be within 1 to 2 miles distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down and rolled the driver side window down. Then the one in the middle got really right. REALLY bright and then started to travel south east; as if to intercept us as we were headed due east. As the craft neared us, it had 3 solid white lights in a triangle form and was solid black. We stopped on the shoulder of the road observe it longer and as it passed over us, it was no more than a few hundred feet up..and dead silent.  A mini-van pulled over going the opposite direction and asked us if we needed help and i replied, &#34;No ma&#39;am, we are just watching this craft.&#34; and i pointed at it. She asked, &#34;what is it?&#34;  I told her, &#34;its unidentified. Its moving WAY too slow to be &#39;airborne&#39; by means of lift. She responded, &#34;I! ts probably those iraqis.&#34;  Jeez are people that lost in whats really going on these days?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, this is the third time I have seen something like this over here in the past 2 months and I figured I should go ahead and report it.

8/14/11 20:45|Houston|FL|Unknown|5 minutes|UFO spotted in 3rd ward Houston hovering over Project Rowhouse community center|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83334.html|362|ndxe201108| UFO spotted in 3rd ward Houston hovering over Project Rowhouse community center<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8:45PM, Sunday, August 14, 2011, unusually cloudy evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 occupants driving south from University of Houston towards the intersection of Elgin /Dowling Street in 3rd Ward Houston. Passenger sights what seems to be a antenna tower with multiple (red, white, blue, green) colored lights high in the distance.  Passenger realizes the source of lights has no tower beneath it. Driver agrees and stops vehicle.  Both occupants of the vehicle realize they are observing a flying vehicle that is directly above the Project Rowhouse community art complex in 3rd Ward Houston.  This realization means the vehicle was at least 90 stories above the art complex.  The driver stops near the intersection (Elgin/Dowling) and observe what appears to be a UFO with the body of a large plane but is thicker and has many uniformed multi colored lights around it. Some lights blink others are static.  The vehicle is also static/ hovering the buildings in 3rd ward. The vehicles surface can be seen due to its flashing lights as dark grey or green/ a muted color. The! re is what appears to be a very long rod, stick or antenna aimed upwards from the center of the UFO. This too has multi colored lights blinking and what the driver and passenger possibly first saw. The UFO also seems to have short wings much like an airplane but shorter/stub like. The bottom of the craft was dark and not visibly detailed.  The UFO did make a humming sound similar to a portable fan running on high speed. The UFO then started moving slowly north while the driver and passenger slowly made a u-turn and pulled out a Cannon 45D camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon making a turn onto Dowling the site of the UFO was temporarily blinded.  The driver and passenger lost complete sight of the UFO at this point in time. The UFO could not have been a standard plane flying so low and also hovering dangerously over the 3rd Ward community.  The UFO was flying in a very dark and cloudy evening and may have been taking advantage of these clouds to cloak itself. The previous night and those evenings aft! erwards showed clear skies. No photos were taken by passenger ! or drive r because the UFO disappeared within the seconds the car turned on Elgin/Dowling Street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There where approx. 5 other cars passing by in a predominately quiet intersection.  A young man ridding a bike was approached by the driver and passenger of the car but he recounted no encounter at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Passenger also understood that NASA has a headquarters in Houston and that there are military bases in the area. The conclusion could possibly include a military experimental vehicle.<n>

I have included three photos of the object, one the original uploaded size of the entire photo and two pics that have been cropped to show the UFO and the silo/trees in relation with one another.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photo was taken looking towards the northeast. I&#39;m guessing it was between 30 and 45 degrees(??) off of the horizon. It moved in a straight fly pattern, no wavering, with no engine noise and no blinking lights that I could see. It simply looked like a gray/metallic Frisbee.  I was standing outside my front door admiring the beautiful rising moon when I noticed this object moving slowly in a descending pattern from the northeast.  I ran inside and quickly grabbed my camera and had time to take just this one phot before the object disappeared behind the silo/tree area of the photograph. That&#39;s about all there is to my sighting.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my Facebook entries:  &#34;I snapped a picture of a UFO last night at around 8:31 p.m. at my residence in the countryside in Dixon, IL. I saw what looked like a gray/silver colored frisbee slowly moving in a decending pattern towards the silo/tree area at the mid-lower left side of the photo. I initially went outside of my front door to look at the cool moon rising and noticed this object moving slowly.  It had taken me a few seconds to register what it was I was looking at and then I ran inside, got my camera and quickly snapped this photo.  I am amazed and excitied that the picture turned out as clear as it did as I was in a hurry to get a pic before it disappeared behind the silo/tree area of the photo.  The object is the gray &#34;line&#34; to the upper right of the silo and directly above the trees in the picture.  I am wondering did anyone else see this object last night?  Use your Zoom features to blow up the photo. I zoomed to about 200% and it started to become pixilated. A cool photo nevertheless..:)<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I watched it disappear behind the silo/trees area in the picture.  It definitely moved as one solid object...no vapor trail or meteor streak, etc.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Hello everybody! I understand the photo doesn&#39;t quite show exactly what I saw the other night, but it&#39;s important for me to note that the object moved in a descending pattern as one object...it looked like a slow moving frisbee..lol..  If you... can enlarge to 400% or as high as you can go without the pic becoming too pixilated, you might see it&#39;s a solid object, not a vapor trail or jet stream trail, and I have had people tell me it looks like there are sources of light on the object when they enlarged the pic.&#34;<n>

There were lots of other aircraft with signal strobes flying in my area for the next hour or so immediately following this sighting, propeller aircraft and rotor aircraft - dark in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My fiance was down a hill about 20 yards away.  He was watering with a hose, and dogs were barking so he could not hear me.  I said several times, &#34;Look at the strange plane.  It has no wings&#34;, but he could not understand me, and kept on with his work.  I kept staring at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a ball not quite the size of a basketball but larger than a soft- ball.  It was red and silver and looked like a crumpled sheet of tinfoil with red places in what appeared to be the indentations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving east about the speed of a slow-moving plane.  (I later saw a plane in that area, and it flew quite a bit faster).  I don&#39;t think I looked away, but suddenly there was a smaller dark ball on each side of the object.  This configuration lasted about 30-40 seconds, and suddenly they all were gone.  No noise.  No speeding away ... they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately wrote down the time and date in case I would hear someone else talking about the same event.  I have talked to no one who saw this.<n>

I was driving with my son on the main road in Grand Bay when I noticed a bright light over a house.  It caught my attention because it seemed like a bigger brighter street light but yet, too high to be a street light and seemed to be directly over a house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching as my son turned up the street directly across from this house when he asked “What are you looking at?”<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then turned again onto a road parallel to the main road.  He was very curious as to what I described and found a spot to stop so he could see between the trees.  By the time I pointed it out to him it was higher in the sky, not quite as high as where a plane would be.  As we watched it, it seemed to go straight up higher and higher until it was no longer there.  I don’t normally post such things but he saw this with me and I am quite curious if someone else saw it.<n>

On 8/14/11 is the first time i saw these circular UFO&#39;s.  The first time it was a bright circular light flying at a lower altitude.  At first i thought it was an airplane but then i saw it pass over and there was still a solid light flying away.  What airplane has lights around the whole airplane? none.  And the object was completely quiete, no sound what so ever.  But it Didn&#39;t stop there.  The next day there were what looked to be military aircraft about 5-8 of them circling around the area of were I saw the object for hours.  I&#39;d say they had a 5 mile radius if not more of just circling looking for this thing.  Then I saw the object again.  Sure enough 2 of the military aircraft&#39;s started following it flying above it then after about 2 minutes it diapered.  Then the day after they are back again. I looked out my window and saw at least 9 maybe 10 aircraft&#39;s flying in the air.  I believe there was only one UFO and the others were military because one of the ligh! ts was much brighter then the others.  The were dog fighting flying through the air for AT LEAST 1 and a half if not 2 hours.  I would see them circling the object then regrouping in formation and fly towards it again.  But after 30 minutes i stopped watching so I didn&#39;t see if the military shot it out of the sky or not. All the object I saw were circular BRIGHT lights.  Not satilights I know what those look like. Please look into this. Lots of wierd objects flying around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Well, I was just about to fall asleep on the couch when I noticed a yellow/white light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a star but then I got up and looked outside and noticed it was completely cloudy outside and there were no stars out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my dad’s girlfriend up to ask her if she was seeing what I saw and she saw it too, so I knew I wasn’t just seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the light for some time before we noticed it was moving/ hovering at the same time.  She started to get freaked out so she layed down and tried to go to sleep.  While she layed down I layed there just staring at it like I was in a daze.  Then the light got brighter then started to dim. I woke her up and told her to watch the light with me once more, and then it was gone, just like that!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after the light disappeared the wind picked up and blew at least 45-50mph. After that, our dogs went toward the area where the light was and came back yelping scared.  Soon after that, something hit out horse trailer hard. It was an experience that I will never forget.  I was so scared I couldn’t even move!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It moved at a steady moderate rate of speed and didn&#39;t vary course.  I thought it was a satellite but it appeared much brighter and much lower. It travelled in a straight direction (east) as a satellite does but after watching it for about a minute or two it went up!  It travelled  at a considerable faster rate as it rose up and eventually went out of sight. It was the same color as a star or sattelite and I assumed that&#39;s what it was till it changed direction. It didn&#39;t change course and rise gradually, it simply reached a point and rose almost in a 90 degree angle. I was stunned and wish I knew what it was!<n>

One of them took a picture of these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched them coming from no where they formed a triangle and then they disappeard again.   Then a couple of seconds later only one came from no where and just stayed in one spot for a couple of seconds and then also disappeard.  There was no sound like you would expect if it were something with an engine and with those many lights, it would have been very loud.  We waited to see if anything else would happen.  We waited for about 20 minutes but nothing happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date above has been corrected.  PD))<n>

Soon the 3 were followed by many more, up to at least 6.  Four of these lights arranged themselves in a diamond figure and hovered in the sky for around 3 minutes before most of the lights vanished.  Out on the horizon we could see faint orange flashes as more of the lights appeared and started advancing towards us before once again stopping and forming a crude “X” shape for about another 3 minutes.  These shapes soon vanished also but this time one remained. More lights and flashes were observed and another pattern was formed.  All the lights but one vanished.  This light remained stationary for about 5 minutes before disappearing.  There were aircraft in the air at the time but these lights were not anything remotely like a jet plane or helicopter.<n>

There were four of us talking and as I talked to two of my family members standing in front of me I said,” what the heck is that- that doesn’t belong there?”   I saw a bright object that looked about four times the brightness of Jupiter.   It just seemed to appear between the people I was talking with I do not know if it approached further away from when I first noticed it.  The night was fair but clear enough to see the stars of Sagittarius and Scorpio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked all very brilliant bright white the shape could have been somewhat round but it didn’t look exactly round but very difficult to see exact shape.   Object made no sound, it was a very smooth like movement the way a satellite might move but it was much lower than a sate! llite –the object looked a little lower than An tares which you could see above and to the right of the object which moved from the Southwest near Sagittarius and came towards us over head moving Northeast through far right of Cassiopeia and on eastward till it disappeared the way an airplane would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to run to the side of the building after it went over –my room was on the end of the motel.  There were no other lights visible and no beam or glow protruding from the bright white object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the president was on Marta’s vineyard that weekend so perhaps it was an unusual new aircraft.  Been an armature astronomer for many years,  know what the planets look like where they are and how they move along the ecliptic etc. this was a craft of some sort moving the opposite way the planets move across the sky - the magnitude about  - 4 and largest overhead about 38 – 40 seconds of arc.   It moved about the speed of a slow airplane but nothing else was airplane like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me ! know if anyone else saw this.  I had my digital  camera right next to me pair of 70 mm binocs close by but it takes lousy images at night did not want to take eyes off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was trying to photograph an iridium flare to the east when later my wife noticed a bright enough light (-2M) approaching from the south.  We though this could be the ISS again, but it was too soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed it in the southeast and it was moving north at the pace that the ISS would.  The only difference is that this light was oscillating in brightness as it was moving and it would fade to about half the brightness before becoming bright again.  I thought this would be tumbling iridium, but from what I understand tumbling iridium is not that visible to the naked eye.  The object made no sound and had no flashing lights the way a commercial plane/jet would have.  As soon as it got almost 90 degrees east it slowly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my camera ready and captured 30 seconds of the final moments before it disappeared.  The original photo will be e-mailed for further investigation.<n>

We were traveling north on US Highway 45 leaving Mattoon, IL when I saw 6 bright red lights.  I said to my husband multiple times, “What are those lights?”   I thought maybe RR Donnelly’s had installed red lights atop of its large building.   I continued down the road and finally parked in the entrance of Alton, a business which is on US Highway 45.  I got out of the car and pointed to the red lights to show my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of the lights were in a triangular shape.  They did not blink and were bright red.  The other three were also bright red and did not blink, but they were in the shape of a large, very open V.  They appeared to hoover over RR Donnelly’s.  Huge!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car so we could get closer.  As I drove we lost sight of the lights because of the line of trees along the railroad tracks.  Once our view was clear again there was only one red light and it quickly disappeared.  They didn’t seem to speed away as much as just disappear.  There were storm/rain clouds to the east and I thought maybe they had moved into the clouds and I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went home and I called the non-emergency police number and told the woman what I saw and asked her if anyone else had called in concerning red lights in the sky.  She said No.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was, what appeared to be, an airplane flying from east to west in the very same area as the red lights.  I say airplane only because it did have blinking lights.  It was below the red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

I looked up to the sky and saw a set of 5 yellow-white lights that seemed part of a larger, possibly rectangular craft.  It passed by quickly and completely silently, disappearing over the roof of the house. I saw it for only 3 seconds or so, the time for it to pass over the pavilion and then disappear over the house.  I am a computer programmer/analyst in my mid-forties.<n>

My husband and I were camping in northern California near Truckee at Prosser Reservoir.  We were watching the sky for the Perseids hoping to catch some before the full moon obscured the viewing too much.  We were looking towards the southern horizon and there was a bright object that appeared to be heading north.  Our first thought as we saw it at the farthest point from us was maybe it was the space station.  However as it moved closer towards us we realized it was lower in the atmosphere than a jet plane flies and it was completely illuminated bright white like an LED.  There was only one object.  There were neither color lights on it nor any flashing/blinking lights.  My perception was that it had a similar shape of an isosceles triangle or maybe diamond shaped.  There was no sound associated to it like an echo you hear of a jet.  It moved generally north almost like it were following alo! ng highway 89 heading in a direction towards Sierraville (not exactly above 89 just trying to give some map reference and direction).  When we first noticed it in the southern horizon until we watched it head the opposite horizon lasted maybe 2 minutes.  It didn’t move very fast and it seemed to use an easy zig-zag pattern.  It’s hard to explain exactly except when we watch satellites their trajectory appears to have a constant (almost straight to the eye) course whereas this did not.  It didn’t lose its brightness at all while we were watching it nor did it dim or get brighter at any time.  When it was in the farthest side of the northern horizon for our view it still looked bright in the sky like a large planet or something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’re avid campers and like to watch the sky for planes, satellites, meteors, etc.  I’m 34 and a business analyst for a company in the area and my husband,35,  is a driver for a waste company.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/13/11 21:30|Forest Park|IL|Changing|30 sec.|Black object tumbled northwest to southeast on 8/13/11, seemed to change shape.  Very quick.|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83231.html|389|ndxe201108| Black object tumbled northwest to southeast on 8/13/11, seemed to change shape.  Very quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, August 13th, 2011, I was outside on my balcony with my roommate, facing east, at around 9:30 PM.  She saw an object in the sky to our left (north) and asked me if it was a bag blowing by above us.  I looked, and at first it seemed like a helicopter without any lights and no blades.  I realized it was not a bag or balloon, but I understood her confusion because the object seemed to change shape.  There was no sound - none.  A very, very light rain was falling and we both agree that we could see rain glinting off the side of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed black or dark - matte black, except for an occasional glint of rain on the side.  There was a full moon that night, which was visible on and off through the clouds.  The object seemed to have what I can only describe as a rudder, because I don&#39;t know what else to call it.  We saw that when the object passed by the moon, but the rudder wasn&#39;t always on top because the object seemed to rotate or tumble.  I can&#39;t describe the shape because it seemed to change shape.  It had weird edges that we could sort of see in the outline of the moon, and the object was moving pretty fast.  It moved in a straight path - northwest to southeast.  I guess it must have been pretty close for us to notice it was wet.  It never changed course and maintained the same altitude, and we lost sight of it traveling southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain it wasn&#39;t a plastic bag or a balloon.  Though it seemed to change shape, it seemed solid and it was not undulating like a bag or ascending and bobbing like a balloon.  The rudder-thing may have been rotating in an opposite direction of the body, clockwise v. counter clockwise.  I have seen strange orbs before, certainly in this part of IL, and I know my neighbors have seen them too - there are some videos on YouTube.  But I have never seen anything like that black object.  That was totally new to me, and I&#39;d love to get a look at it again.  I am terrible at guessing distance but I know this object was below the clouds that evening.  It did not seem large and it happened quickly - I could only guess that it was bigger than a breadbox but much smaller than a commercial jet.  If I had to guess the path, facing due east, the object emerged at 8:30 and moved out of sight at approximately 2:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the object was moving pretty fast and the whole thing might have lasted less than 30 seconds.  As I mentioned, I&#39;ve noticed orbs before so I remained clam as I watched this thing and took brief notes after, and reported them to MUFON.  I would like to know if there is a way to find out if this was a conventional aircraft (flight data?), or what it might have been.  Did anyone else see it?  I live between O&#39;Hare and Midway, and I feel comfortable knowing the difference between commercial aircraft, helicopters, blimps and small airplanes compared to the weird black thing I saw with my roommate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a helicopter in the sky to our right when we saw the object, which is very normal - there is a flight path to O&#39;Hare over my neighborhood.  It is not unusual to see several helicopters at the same time in this area.  We also saw a commercial jet come from (approximately) the same place but well behind the object, by miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a neighbor in Forest Park who posts videos on YouTube by the name of &#34;Guttergawker&#34;.  I have never met him personally, but he has quite a few vids of orbs and things.  I recently came across his vids when I went on-line Sunday morning, to try and find something similar to what I saw on 8/13/11.  He has a sort of s-shaped, boomerang, tumbling black object recorded on a different day.  I don&#39;t think it is exactly what I saw, but the tumbling motion is comparable to what I saw.  I have been noticing some unusual lights in our sky lately.  I wonder why.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;re all satellites.<n>

We were launching small fireworks from the dock, facing West.  There were very few clouds at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone called our attention to a pair of lights approximately 3 miles West by Southwest over the vicinity of Annandale.  At first, the objects appeared to be landing lights of approaching aircraft.  However, the objects were orange in color, had no other lighting (no markers or strobes), appeared about 400ft apart, held an elevation of approximately 2000ft, and did not seem to move.  The object to the south appeared about 100ft lower than its companion, at an approximate elevation of 1900ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later, both objects began slowly moving South.  Both objects maintained their brilliance as they moved, suggesting that their light was shining in all directions.  (An airplane&#39;s landing light should have dimmed slightly if it changed direction.)   At this point, I decided to film what I could of the event using my Google G1 cell phone camera.  Unfortunately, the camera requires ample light to work correctly, and the objects were too distant against the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The southern object traveled somewhat faster than its companion, a distance of about 1000ft, then stopped and hovered again, partially obscured by a cloud.  Then, it slowly sank in elevation about 50ft, then seemed to disappear instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The northern object traveled South about 1000ft towards its companion, maintaining altitude, never changing course or speed.  It became obscured behind the same cloud as its companion.  It did not re-appear from the other side of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The resulting footage shows approximately 5 seconds of the northern object, but it appears only a few pixels wide.  The audio contains brief commentary by myself and one other eyewitness during the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrkNoOL7dgE<n>

Fireball  	Thirteen of us were at a backyard barbecue in the town of Tonawanda, NY in the Green Acres neighborhood with Niagara Falls Blvd. to our East and the 290 to our North.  The full moon was to my back, and I was facing a clear sky with stars. I glanced up and saw a large brightly lit ball traveling across the sky from south to north (slightly southwest to northeast).  At first it had a bright white center that was encased in a red/orange-red outer flame-like rim.  It emitted  a beam of white light both upward and downward in the shape of a paper cup so that it kind of looked like a bow tie tipped on its side.  The downward beam of light was only half as strong as the upward one.  The sides of the beam did not dissipate as would be expected, but had crisp, slightly angled lines.  The top and bottom of the beam did fade as you would expect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the attention of the other guests and pointed at the sky. The beams of light turned off simultaneously as if you would flick a switch, and the center became red/orange-red/ pinkish red.  The fiery ball continued to travel across the sky at a steady rate.  It did not change in size, direction, or altitude. It did not emit any sound. It was about 10 degrees off from being completely overhead, and it did not appear to be as high as an airplane. (We have a large airport a few miles from here and we are used to seeing planes coming in for a landing and taking off.)   It was about the diameter of a pencil eraser held at arms length.  Someone in the group thought that it must be a hot air balloon, but I didn’t see a basket below it or a balloon above it when the beams of light were shining. Also, the fiery ball appeared to be larger than a hot air balloon flame.  The overall diameter of the ball did not change, although the intensity of the “flame” varied. (ex. When it got bright! er, it did not appear to get larger.) We observed it for approximately 1-2 min. It was first spotted at about the 10 o’clock position and we lost sight of it at the 3 o’clock position due to trees obstructing our view. The winds were from the SE at 140 degrees and were 6 mph. The visibility was 10 mi.<n>

The object appeared to be a solid “craft” or aerial vehicle of unknown type. (as opposed to just a set of lights in the sky)  Duration of the sighting was brief, approximately 15 seconds, during which time the object performed various maneuvers, and displayed very unusual lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first spotted, by the passenger (Right, front seat) the saucer shaped object was hovering, or flying very slowly, with it&#39;s circular plane horizontal, or parallel to the ground.  It then tilted, or rotated towards the cars on the freeway, whereupon a single blue and red light (spaced closely together on the forward facing rim) illuminated, and then began “propagating” around the rim, in opposite directions. (Blue lights, clockwise, Red lights, counter-clockwise)  At the same time, it became apparent, the saucer shaped object was domed on it&#39;s upper surface.  Also, at the same time, the entire object, or craft was observed to rotate counter clockwise, while the lights around it&#39;s rim, remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then began moving north, towards the observer&#39;s car, and vanished from sight.  The two witnesses left the freeway at the next exit (Cactus Road) pulling over as soon as possible to try to spot the object again.  While doing this, they observed another couple, apparently doing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver of the witness car produced the attached drawing.<n>

Just then behind the tree line moving at a steady pace almost as if floating were two red-orange orbs followed at a distance by a third.  They did not move like any airplane I have ever seen they were moving at a steady pace but were drifting in a somewhat sideways motion while still moving forward, like fireflies sometimes do.  The moon was full and the orbs appeared to be about 30 percent of its size.  I sent my girlfriend inside to get my grandmother while I watched these three orbs sort of flicker out and vanish.  My grandmother came outside and as we were describing the three objects we saw to her a fourth one appeared and followed the same direction the other three had gone, we all three (my girlfriend, my grandmother and I) watched this last orb until it too flickered out.  However this time as it the light flickered out! my grandmother and girlfriend said that they could still see it moving without the light and that it appeared triangular in shape.

The rest of the sky had no visible stars and we had been  commenting on  this the last two hours of our trip from Columbus, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We suddenly saw an object overhead,  around an 11 o&#39;clock position that was diamond shaped but with a couple of extra short &#34;arms&#34; extending out from it.  At first we thought it might be a plane, but the movement of the object did not coincide with the movement of a plane.  It hovered in almost the same location, moving up and down slightly, for about 30 minutes,  I have seen many helicopters in the sky but this did not look like one.  We were very tired and did not call anyone, just went to bed when we got home.  It was not like any other object I have observed before.<n>

Than my girlfriend pointed and said “Look there is another one” and as I looked it was flying right over my house and over my head going west and we were looking east and when I seen it from the front it looked rounded and as it went over I could not tell the shape of it but there was multiple lights under it flashing red than white than red again.  And eventually it disappeared in the sky.  We also live out in country with not many buildings around us so I knew that the other objects could not be a radio tower or anything.<n>

There was one, maybe two trailing behind, almost looking as if they would speed up and slow down just a little to keep up with the formation. I remember they were traveling northwest, at a very high speed, and flying lower than a commercial airline. I watched them for almost 30 seconds until the tree line got in my way. I realize this is now almost a year later, but I remember this sighting as if it happened yesterday.

He said he has never seen anything like that - move like that - so low and still no sound.

They seemed to be light red paper with some sort of wire framework which gave the object shape and held an open fire propulsion source at the bottom (sort of like on that episode of Macgyver).  2 of the objects were released a minute or so apart and followed almost the exact same path in line with the wind.  They kind of caught me by surprise and I neglected to watch the entire trajectory of the lanterns and didn&#39;t see what happened once they burnt out or how high they were at their apex.  I didn&#39;t want to miss meteors by watching the fireworks!  I witnessed a line of 4 or 5 objects/fireballs of what I assume to be the same sort of firework while I was at a local park in Cincinnati(no firework display in the park itself that evening) on July 4th though they were more distant.  Those were lights/fireballs that just kind of burnt out after a few minutes after a slow ascension in the air on roughly the same path.  While I haven&#39;t read all the reports, I think a lot of people could be seeing these things on part of their trajectory and just don&#39;t realize they&#39;re new fireworks.  I made a report on July 3rd  last year, and while I still think that report could be something else, it also could have been something similar to these lanterns seen at an odd angle.  I think the whole point of the firework is just to launch something glowing into the air and see how far it goes before it burns out.  At a distance, it&#39;s kind of like a slow orange-yellow roman candle (but just one) with no smoke trail that just glides through the a! ir.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The small lighst were moving up toward the other two. Eventually the small lights vanished one at a time, then the left light of the pair of stationery lights began to grow dim and eventually dimish but this time I noticed it seemed to be traveling in a straight line away from my line of sight so there was no perception of it moving in any other direction but just getting tiny going straight away from me and finally disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were observing the behavior of these five ufos two more very bright ones were approaching from the south paired togerher as if hugging the coast line.  The spacing of them and intensity was the same as the first bright pair.  As they approached  a position in a line under the first pair but they the lower slowly ascended toward the position of the first two. Then the top two  began to flicker dim and then move straight away from my eye line like the others.  First it was the left one then the right. Then the two new lights rose up and took the same positions as the earlier two.  At his time another pair just like the last pair appeared coming up the coast from the south.  And repeated the behavior of the last two.  Within the span of ten to fifteen minutes they were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shot video of the event with my phone and you can see the pair of lights and hear the commentary of myself and 5 or 6 other witnesses on the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression of the event was that I was observing an airport runway with planes queing up for take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights looked very similar to videos of the very well documented sightings in Arizona. Orangish yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 08/13/2011 9:10pm. We went to the same sight as the night before at 9:00 to see if the ufos appeared there again. It was more overcast then the night before. Nothing. But as we were leaving about 9:10 a single light appeared moving up from the south again, took the same position as the others did the night before, hung there for the same amount of time and then diminished and disappeared the same as the others had the night before. I shot video again of this ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all<n>

I started out facing south and then ran east. When I started, I looked up at the moon.  The moon was full and very bright. The moon was located directly south of my location.  I noticed a very bright, star like object just below and to the left (East) of the moon.  As I ran east, the object was moving northeast. There was no sound coming from the object.  No blinking lights, just a consistent, bright white light. There did appear to be a red like light on the top, left side, or top front, hard to tell.  After about a minute or two, I turned south, the object was now on my left side. It appeared to be getting closer. It also appeared to be drifting in an erratic pattern, not in a straight line, moving very slowly.  At one point I thought I noticed what appeared to be several directional lights. During my observation of the object, I had stopped and started my run several times. At one point I lost the object behind some trees.  I looked ar! ound the sky, more to the northwest and suddenly saw the object streak across the sky, in a straight line, moving south.  I have never seen anything move that fast. The object went from a slow drift, to disappearing for a few seconds, to a fast, bright streak across the sky. I was so overwhelmed from what I witnessed that I screamed out, almost uncontrollably, &#34;Oh my God, what was that!&#34;.  I also suddenly had a strong urge to cry. Sounds corny, I just want to give you an accurate description of what I saw and how I felt.  I will never forget the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

The object was bright red, fireball.  It was moving to the right coming toward us.  After 30 seconds of the object coming toward us, it changed direction and shot out of sight.  This is the second time we have seen this in Moses Lake in the last month.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Friday, August 12th at around 8:30-9:00pm. While setting on the balcony of the Motel we noticed a bright solid orange light which seemed to be coming from the town of York heading across the horizon out to sea.  As we watched this bright orange object heading out to sea it gradually disapeared.  Just before it disapeared another one followed its path. We were wondering what these objects were. At one point durning the evening we notice 2 objects riseing at the same time but one was smaller and was the color red not orange. We could see a plane that was traveling from one end of the beach to the other at the same time these objects were in the sky. In around 15-20 minute intervals these objects would follow almost the same path as the previous ones and disapear as did the others.  Around 10:00 - 10:30 pm two such orange objects came from the opposite side of town (Kittery) and headed out to sea &amp; disapea! red as did the other ones we had seen coming from York.  Saturday night, August 13, 2011 my husband &amp; I decided to take a walk and as we were heading back along the beach toward the Motel we saw one in the sky but this time behind the Motel heading from South to North where as the other were heading North East to South West.  When we got back to the hotel the couple that were in the room next to ours told us that they had seen two in the sky behind the motel when they had went on their walk about a half hour before we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object continued in a straight line West to East and passed under the full moon which was directly over Gulf of Mexico at that time.  The light went above and in front of witnesses toward Gulf. The bright light was the size of a BB heald at arms length ad as luminous as the landing lights of a jet airliner.  This light was observed by myself with a 20x100 mm astronomical binoculars during the event. At no time was a sound heard and the wind was from the South at 20 mph the light passed overhead to windward of witnesses. No other features were seen at any time comming ,overhead or behind except a bright white oval shaped light. After figuring angle of light when it passed by overhead from 1 mil! e width of Island at this point, which is 16 miles W of West end of The Galveston Seawall, the light was apoximatly 5000ft high and traveled 8 miles in 180 seconds or 3 min.  Speed would of been approx. 220mph. In 20x100mm binoculars the light was as wide as an eraser on a #2 pencil at arms length.  From a mile away I estimate light appeared at least 50 ft. in diameter if not more.<n>

All of a sudden, my husband exclaimed &#34;Whoa! What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned to look in the direction where he was referring to and there were five red lights (about the color of a stop light).  From where we were standing the lights appeared to be approx. the size of a grapefruit-maybe a little bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they were close together but not in any type of formation.  Then one by one, they started to flicker and fade away.  Then within a matter of 4-5 seconds we noticed them on the horizon appearing like they were rising up from the top of the water.  Three of them then formed a triangular shape and the other two just faded out. The triangle formation just hovered for a little while.  The whole &#34;sighting&#34; from beginning to end lasted around 10 minutes maybe a little less.  There was absolutely no sound coming from them from where we were standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to get a very poor picture of the triangular formation with the camera on my phone, which I will enclose as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just curious to see if anyone else noticed these lights as well.  I was surprised not to see any reports of them today.  Just curious to find out what they were.  It was interesting to watch regardless of what they were.  I know that there was a meteor shower that was supposed to occur. But these lights did not &#34;shoot&#34; across the sky.  As I said before they just hovered then slowly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the picture I am enclosing, you can see the triangle just to the right of the little house on the island.

At first I through it was the Border Patrol Flying around looking for persons, but I saw them move toward town and pay no attention to them. The moon was bright as day last night, when something caught my eye and I looked up to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this bright light kind of white blue light fly slow moving toward the northeast.  To me this object looked like it was checking out our area moving slowly, but the funny thing is that there were no blinking lights like regular airplanes and not making any  noise of any kind. I just looked at it for a while slowly moving over the sky like nothing to worry about I didn’t have a camera or a video camera to take a snap shot, but what can you expect . When I’m outside watering the lawn I don’t expect to be looking up to the sky. I’m watering my lawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over to the south I saw the helicopter going in circles looking around the area and not making contact toward this object, it was kind of strange.  This object slowly moved toward the northeast some were the area of the chocolate mountains area and vanishes up to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the fifth time this year, I saw these objects flying past the Imperial Valley and they just past through our area and vanish.  Very strange sightings! The next day 08/13/2011 my sister-in-law calls my wife and informs her that last night there were three helicopters flying over the city of El Centro, California, she said it looked strange that there were these helicopters flying over like looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It changed intensity several times before vanishing.  It was not blinking. I have seen satellites move across the sky before and this was much lower.  It changed direction twice but not suddenly.  It gradually hooked around 20 degrees and then straightened out again. It was so bright initially that my son noticed it through a window in the house.  He got my attention and I went outside to see it, I watched it move slowly about 5 minutes then vanish overhead.<n>

I know I wasn’t the only one who saw it because the other vehicles around me (a car and a truck) were BRAKING just as I was, all on a green light.  So, I’m sure they saw it too. It looked like a small reflective sphere, hovering in the sky, about 50-60 degrees in the sky above the horizon.  It looked to be perhaps about 2 miles or so away, but it was clearly visible on a clear, cloudless sky. I saw it there for a few minutes as I drove until it just disappeared.  I wonder if anyone else saw it.  I wanted to look it up, then found this site, and decided to submit my own report to see if anyone else had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I don’t know if this was related, but I felt nauseous and sick, with a headache, while driving and when I arrived at home.  When I arrived at home, I ate, but the nausea got worse, and I threw up several times (6-7 times) over the course of 2 hours.  I also noticed a pen I had with me had exploded. It’s a pen with a clear case so I can see all the ink inside had exploded from the inner casing. It wasn&#39;t until I started writing this email and thinking back of what happened that day that I also remembered how I was throwing up.  At first I thought maybe I was stressed out from work, but perhaps it was related.  I haven&#39;t thrown up over stress since high school, and that was over 10 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We star gaze mostly on Friday&#39;s because they are in elementary school.  We were star gazing from 8:00 to 11:55 pm at my husband&#39;s employers parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:03 pm eastern central time over Prentis and Collins, Mississippi USA we were looking at what appeared to be a star enter the atmosphere at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it entered the atmosphere it left no signs that a flying plane would (the trail left behind by a jet) or flashing lights on it like a plane would at night and not like a meteor or meteoriod. I noticed it first and told my children to look. Then it changed directions and started flying in our direction slowly. It took about 20 minutes to reach us, stopped less than 20 feet away from the car and about 150 feet in the air.  It just hovered there for about three minutes and we stood there in shock looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I told my children to get in the car right now and lock the doors. Thank God they both did as I said. I stayed outside the car to watch it because it was amazing looking. I had never seen anything like it and I wanted to see where it was going to go.  After about three to four more minutes it continues to hover in the North North-East direction slowly.  The UFO went right over me and my children that were still watching from inside the car.  The UFO flew for about 4! 0 miles away headed East and than took off at high speed again.  I couldn&#39;t keep up with where it was and lost it.  I looked for it and didn&#39;t see it anywhere.  Than got back in the car and locked us in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 12:16 am Eastern Central Time I was driving my husband to take a night deposit to the bank. I had this feeling like I was being watch again so I looked over in the direction the UFO went.  The UFO was there but the shape was different.  It was twice the size of a distant star and brighter than one (like the blinding light above a operating table).  It was the same color as before ( I am not sure if it was the same UFO because the shape changed.  I don&#39;t even know if UFO&#39;s can change there shape?). It scared me more when it followed us all the way to the bank than home at about 150 feet away and 300 feet in the air.  At 12:49 am we got home.  As we got out of the car I looked up to see were the UFO was and if it was still following us. It was still there traveling west in the direction we are (the UFO was following us North on the right hand side of the car on the way home).  I grabbed my children out of the car, went inside, locked the doors and all the windows when we were all in (i don&#39;t know if that will help if something tries to get in but it eases my mind a little so does my 9mm.  I keep it with me at all times, makes me feel safe).  At 12:56 am (the last time I looked at it) I opened the door to see if the UFO was still there it was heading this way (west) slowly.  The UFO was about 100 miles in the air and 15 miles from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description -UFO 1st sighting Aug.12, 2011  The UFO appeared to be only made up of white light the kind thats almost to painful to look at but it wasnt painful to look at( just a comparison). It was a long fat cigar shape.  As it got closer and hovered less than 20 feet away from us, it formed some rays ( like you would see if a child drew the sun) of light coming from what appeared to be the left and right sides that looked like wings for (lack of a better word) but they didn&#39;t move at all though. The color of the wings were blueish white. As it started to fly again the wings of light faded. Than it looked cigar shaped again and took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description-UFO sighting 2ND &amp; 3RD Aug. 13, 2011  When I seen the UFO while I was driving to the bank than home, it looked bigger than it did when it was closer to us. It appeared to be a  round white light same as before but it was father away and moving fast than slowed down almost to a stop. I couldn&#39;t tell if it had wings like the last time because it was to far away. The color was a very bright white (lighting up part of the sky around it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the UFO was following us home it looked the same as the second time but was farther away than it was to us when we left the bank. It moved slower than the other times. It did at one point disaper when I seen the UFO again it was moving faster tordes us (so I went back inside and locked the door) and got bigger as it came closer to us (about the size of two school bus&#39;s  I really hope you don&#39;t think this is some kind of a prank and not report it. It&#39;s bad enough my husband think that me and our kids are crazy and seeing **** (his exact words). We don&#39;t have any mental illness that runs on either side of our family&#39;s. The only reason I am reporting this sighting is one: because it scared the **** out of me and my children so bad that they wanted to sleep in my husband&#39;s and my room. (they never ask to sleep with us not even when they get sick!) Two: My children fell asleep 40 minutes ago (at 2:39am) and woke up twice already. Three: I am not going to be able to sleep at all now that I am worried about us. It&#39;s been almost over two hours ago since the last time I seen it (and I hope I never see it again). This is not a joke and I really hope you report it. I promised my children I would tell someone ( my kids wanted me to shot the thing. Maybe I should have but I don&#39;t know if I would have done any  good anyway. It might have just pissed it o! ff and I can&#39;t fire a fire arm in city limits near a neighborhood). I never play around especially when it come to my children. Hope this is detailed enough I tried remember all I could.<n>

It continued moving northwest to southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer I still could not see a shape other than the shape of the light itself.  It winked out no shape against the background light no sound.  I continued looking for the light, shape and listening for sound.  Nothing.  Other than satellites which cannot be seen with the naked eye over such a large city with it&#39;s light pollution I have never seen that happen.<n>

My girlfriend and I were astonished at what we we&#39;re seeing and my heart dropped because I felt something serious was happening my first that was asteroids but they were movie to oddly then I realized there were human aircraft all over converging to thees figures within 10 minutes of seeing this I counted 15 human aircra! ft as the human aircraft moved in thees figures increased in speed and manuverd away almost got higher into the ski they one bye one disappeared in the groups they were in human aircraft has in creased since then I have counted 30 as of now very high to very low in the sky I asked a someone else to look in the sky and tell me what they noticed and they agreed that there were a were a abnormal amount of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s it don&#39;t know what this was and while it was amazing to witness it was also very frightening I also have video taped this as best as I could on my phone but I don&#39;t feel it is of any credit to what I observed.<n>
8/12/11 07:45|Gig Harbor|WA|Light|1 second|I saw my second UFO ever shooting down to the ground and basically vanish or sink into the ground somehow.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84916.html|444|ndxe201108| I saw my second UFO ever shooting down to the ground and basically vanish or sink into the ground somehow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second UFO I&#39;ve ever seen was a weird object that was witnessed by not only myself, but my cousin as well. It was still somewhat light out but getting darker by the minute. My cousin was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat, dully gazing not out of my window, but rather the reflections of the lights of a store we were passing that was reflecting off my window.  This part is kind of ironic and amusing as, still looking at the reflections of the lights, I said to my cousin, &#34;Wow, for a split second, those lights looked like a..&#34;   Now, the amusing and ironic part is that had I finished my sentence, I&#39;d have said, &#34;Wow, for a split second, those lights looked like a UFO.&#34;  That&#39;s because the reflection of the lights from the store we were passing did look like a large ship, although after that split second when I realized that it was in fact, just the reflection of the store lights, something shot down from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw it outside through the front of the car, and the sighting caught me off guard and I didn&#39;t even finish talking. This was a light or orb-like object, made of a kind of LED-like light with a blueish tint; however, it was so fast, that the sighting itself was only for a split second. It was somewhat funny actually, because my cousin asked if I saw that and I remember saying something along the lines of, “I&#39;m not the only one who saw that? Good!” 	Besides it just being a light orb, the sighting played out like this: just as I was about to finish my sentence, my shock and surprise of the UFO made me hush up and my cousin and I watched as an LED-like ball of light – a large ball or orb mind you – randomly came out of the sky seemingly from nowhere, but instead of like the first UFO where it just kind of flickered in and out from nowhere, this one came flying from overhead, and it fell or shot down maybe three-hundred yards away from us and “vanished” before it hit the ground.  I put vanish in quotes because there was a solid concrete gate or fence blocking our view from the ground where it would have crashed, but because we couldn&#39;t see, we truly don&#39;t know what happened to this object; if it had been any other object such as a plane, helicopter, jet or anything else, we were close enough to not only hear it crash but to see any flames or an explosion, but we saw nor heard any explosion or flames. On top of that, planes! , helicopters and jets don&#39;t just show up out of nowhere, aren&#39;t shaped like an orb or large circle, are not that fast as this thing was – even if they were falling to the ground! – and aren&#39;t made entirely of light. If it had been a shooting star, it would have had a tail, it wouldn&#39;t have looked like it was made of LED light, it would not have come out of nowhere, and one of that size and magnitude and one falling/crashing that close to us, would have had serious even fatal affects on my cousin and I, as in once again, we would have heard and seen an explosion and maybe would have even died from it.  That is why we think this thing either must have vanished right before it hit the ground, or somehow literally went into the ground.<n>

It was hovering but appeared to drift a bit to the south.  No sound was heard, too bright to be an airplane or helicopter, 3 bright white lights in irregular triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A vehicle approached from my rear and I had to proceed as it is fairly narrow road and there was nowhere to pull over.  My first thought was &#34;ISS&#34; and then &#34;blimp&#34; but no structure could be discerned.  Sky was still mostly dark - I cannot begin to say what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pulled onto the entrance ramp for Langford Frwy (166), I glanced back and saw 3 dim white lights moving at speed overhead to the east - I can only assume it was the same object as I had not noticed any other air traffic in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object  initially was approx. 35 degrees above horizon, maybe half mile away, maybe 1500 feet altitude or more.  Lights werre not spaced uniformly.  Diddn&#39;t appear to be any more than 10 feet across, if that much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is difficult to give good measurements as sky was dark and lights were very bright and in a triangular cluster rather than spread out as along a wing.  I have reported this also to MUFON.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted Fulton County Airport (Brown Field) to see if they had a  blimp launch from there this morning (object was to their southeast).  Airport Mgr. replied my e-mail -  he has forwarded my info to the ATC tower and will let me know if they have any info.<n>

It was really high in altitude, much higher than any plane yet at that high above, it must have been really HUGE and it was moving fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called over 2 of my friends and yelled out to look above just to see what i was witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw didnt make any noise, it was moving really fast; faster than any plane or satellite, and the kicker was that it traveled horizontally like a plane and THEN it went diagonally up to the stars to the point were it looked like a far and distant star/planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this thing for about a couple of minutes till it disappeared not over the horizon like any man made machine but high above us at a 45 degree angle.  There were no blinking lights like a plane and wasnt shaped like one either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS at 05:55 hrs., on this date.  PD))<n>

I work out of my home in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina.  I am 51 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 5:30 AM, I went outside to smoke a cigarette, and I eyeballed a large, amber light hovering in the sky above my home.  At first I thought it was a star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Abruptly, the light started darting around.  I rubbed my eyes and shook my head, but the thing was still there, darting around like a hummingbird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s odd, but I felt like the thing was winking at me.  I mean, it WAS winking.   Then, when I made a move, it made a move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t determine the object&#39;s altitude.  It looked like it was in the sky, but it was reacting to my moves, which makes me think it was pretty low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was kind of mesmerized by it.  I could see it rocking left and right, like a pendulum. It looked like a light bulb.  I mean, I could see the filaments, right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it rose straight up  and moved off to the south with a kind of zig-zag fishtail move.  Zip, it was gone.<n>

Newark airport is in the distance and a lot of planes fly by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Plainly said.. a silvery/ white light shot across the sky and disappeared. I&#39;m not sure its altitude, but it sure was as low as the planes!!!  Closest point of interest would be the staten island expressway. It was right overhead.  My balcony faces jersey and the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed comet or cool shooting star...this was way too low to be either or!  All I know is, I&#39;m gonna have a lil trouble sleeping.<n>

I was walking outside 2:25 am friday August 12, the object was flyng from south to north.  The path was slightly curved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didnt see the shape since there were clouds but I saw that it was propelled by a clean light in the rear of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> other peculiarity: a very very small sound reactor sound was heard 60 seconds after.  I can&#39;t described the sound, but it was clean like a jet engine but with 2% of it normal sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the object flying +- 10 km in the sky during about 2 second.

Beside to the right and a little below I noticed an orange red glow.  It was large compared to the usual airplanes in the night sky. So I thought it might be close. It seemed to hover at first so I thought it might be coming toward me. As I watched it, it seemed to flicker.  So I then thought it was a firework or something on fire. I couldn&#39;t hear any noise out of the ordinary. I then watched it to see what it would do.  As I watched, I noticed it was moving right under the moon in the sky. When it got to a location under the moon opposite to the same location I first noticed it, the light became smaller and turned white in color.  It kind of blinked slowly as it finally faded. The movement reminded me of a cursor on a computer screen moving slowly and fidgety. I looked around the sky for anything else and noticed nothing else unusual.  I then concentrated on the point that it faded to see if it would reappear. It did n! ot. I never heard a noise that was unusual or that I could associate with the light.<n>

The lights moved around slightly, back and forth, and then held still for some time.  It is unclear if some of the lights disappeared instantly or faded out as my view was partially obstructed by some trees, but at the close of the sighting I could see only two of the lights, and both moved steadily to the north before fading a bit and disappearing.  Several minutes later it appeared that one of the lights had returned to the same spot and sat still, but as a lone light it would be hard to say for sure that it had been part of the initial formation, or even anomalous to begin with.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were about to turn west onto our street when we saw what looked like a burning ball in the sky about 75 feet above the ground at the next intersection and moving east.   We did not turn but continued north towards it.  The ball of fire looked like it was rectangluar towards it’s lower half and it turned north.  As we got to the next street, it disappeared.  We made a right turn down that street going east.  When we got to the next block, we saw it again, this time it was about 5 blocks south from where we last saw it.  We stopped to take a picture of it and it began going up and disappeared in the sky very rapidly and disappeared in a matter of seconds. The entire sighting lasted less than 2 minutes.<n>

I noticed that behind (and above) the airliner was a white circle following it.  I would estimate that the object was around one eight of the size of the airliner.  I would say the object was also less than 500 feet behind and above the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the circler object following the airliner for about four minutes.

Around 11:30 we noticed a blinking star. Brighter than all the others. We watched it for a bit then noticed different colors being displayed.  We recorded red, blue, orange, green and white. It would dim down then get extremely bright.  As it got brighter it would shoot down about two or three inches then proceed to do what I can only describe as loop-de-loops.  We watched this object for a good 4 hours before we left. We also noticed that there were moments when the object would become red, extremley bright, and then turn into three in the shape of a triangle.  The two extra lights would then be sucked into the one, then proceed to dim down again.  The object acts as if it were a star when any aircraft passed in its direction by dimming down, not blinking and being stationary. The five of us then left to drop of the other three observers that were pres! ent.  The driver and I then went to a friends house to tell him we had seen something strange but needed him to come with us to justify our experience.  We then took him out to where we were and told him to just look at the &#39;star&#39;. He then asked myself and the driver if it was moving.  We asked what he saw and he described to us everything that we had observed earlier.  Might I note that no druga or alchohol were involved.  The observers that i was with including myself are all very credible people.  Tonight will be the seventh day in a row that others as well as myself have seen this object.<n>

Estimated about 12-15,000 ft., moving from southwest to north east, night sky was clear.  I was first to see it travelling in a straight line, perpendicular to any plane routes, no audible sound, no vapor trail.  There was a plane much higher, which was a spec and I could see a slight vapor trail. My wife saw it, too, but said it must be a plane. But, there were no lights or flashers, just intense bright light.  I observed it through a pair of 7X35 (358ft. at 1000 yds.) binoculars. It was the size of the head-of-a-pin.  It flew over, stopped a split second and resumed on course until out of sight.  As it got further away there still were no indication of marker lights/flashers. No photos.<n>
8/11/11 04:15|Topeka|KS|Light|3 minutes|I stepped out of the garage at about 4:15 or maybe 4:30 am, into my three acre heavily|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83059.html|475|ndxe201108| I was working early in my garage this morning,.  I stepped out of the garage at about 4:15 or maybe 4:30 am, into my three acre heavily wooded lot surrounding my house. The morning was crisp, low humidity and temperature probably around upper 60&#39;s.  The night sky was brilliant with no deterioration from humidity -- a great viewing opportunity if I could have set up my telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then observed a bright white light on a slow moving trajectory heading on the flight path I assumed to be to the Kansas City airport (MCI) as their are many commercial planes that use that or nearly that landing / takoff path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked for the blinking red indicator lights that are normally visible on commercial planes about 70 miles out from MCI.  I spotted no red blinking lights on the bright white (round) light moving east - east - south east (EESE).  I next listened for the jet engine noise. Nothing - the early morning was dead silent.  I then moved quickly down to my pond about 90 foot north of my garage door to get a better, unobstructed view and confirm this was a commercial aircraft (it was moving at what I considered a commercial jet landing speed but two to three times brighter than what I normally note as jets on their way to and from MCI).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I ran to my small pond I became convinced this was not a commercial aircraft and started shouting &#34;Hey - Hey -- Hi - Hello&#34; and with my arms above my head began waving my arms toward the moving bright light overhead.  I was very excited and almost pleased I was seeing this light disk in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the round light passed overhead I changed my opinion to the probability that this was a satellite circling the earth and catching the early morning sun from below the horizon.  There were no lights blinking from wing marker lights and absolutely no sound emanating from an internal combustion source and the path of the light was on a straight and constant velocity path to the EESE.  I had tracked enough satellites to be convinced this was another satellite and I turned around and headed back to the garage - a little disappointed - but satisfied by the brief, no harm, diversion from cleaning an autofill combo supply - check valve for my hotwater heating system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I reached the paved parking area next to my house and in front of my garage I decided to scan for the satellite on its trajectory again (and enjoy the refreshing cool, dry morning air again) before entering the garage to continue work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise the light was moving very slowly to the SW -- as it had moved past me about 30 to 40 seconds (on same initial EESE trajectory) after I had shouted and raised my arms and waved them in the pitch black that is rural Topeka, KS.  As I popped into the open of my concrete parking area in front of the garage the light came to an instant stop also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light had also moved back to the north in those last few seconds but was not quite overhead - but about 15 degrees south of straight overhead.  I listened for a propeller blade wash noise from a parked helicopter (the local city poilce have a helicopter that is very noisy and easily identified by its very loud engine and prop noise).  Again - absolute quiet reigned - with no normal or unusual noise being heard from this now stopped light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to observe the light and did not think of yelling and waving my arms as I noticed I was now very nervous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The now still round light - if it had not sensed my presence - at least gave the highly coincidental indication that it was now going to track me.  I stared at the light in the sky (much brighter than a bright star) for about 10 seconds and the emotion grew to get away into the garage as  soon as possible -- I logically did not expect the light was anything to fear -- but the fear and seek cover emotion ruled and I could no longer control it and could not continue to observe the light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this happened in a three to five minute period.  Looking back on this incident both the emotional states I experienced seem highly unusual for me -- overly happy /pleased as it passed overhead the first time and then overly distraught a few minutes later with the creepy felling it was going to observe me and / or do something I would not like.  Neither emotion seems like a normal response for me. I am a engineer, naturally curious, and open to observation without emotion as I seek to analyze situations and events and not let my emotions rule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previous events / sightings -- I have now observed this style of light flying in the sky three times that I can remember.  One as youth, one at age 41, and now this morning as a 56 year old man.  When I observed a similar style light as a 41 year old there.............dssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss were also 10 or so witnesses observing the light with me on a wilderness river boating and camping trip, one of them was my best friend.  My best friend and I discussed (for about 5 minutes or so)  the &#34;wierdness&#34; of the unusual light (flying craft) that night and then he as well as the other 10 campers went to sleep almost immediately.  I stayed awake for about 10 to 15 more minutes wondering why someone was not continuing to discuss what we had just seen -- I will just say it was repeated for us and was very, very remarkable what the light (a flying craft of some type) performed with its near infinite acceleration and agility relative to a fighter aircraft i! n the area.  When I brought the matter up with  my best friend in the morning to continue the discussion he told me that he knew of no such event had happened the night before (and I believe that is now his memory) - in fact I was the only one in the group who had any recollection of the event - everyone I approached (including my best friend) said they did not know what I was talking about.<n>

Laying in bed, I observed what at first appeared to be embers of a fire drifting and swirling into the air through my natural fiber blinds.  It seemed odd for the time and place, so I opened the blinds.  Out of my West facing window, from a vantage point just miles from the East coast I noticed these &#34;embers&#34; did not fade, were white and changed course countless times in the general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to go outside, and observed what seemed to be an uncountable number of these lights on only the West. They moved at an inconsistent speed, changing directions on a whim. Sometimes they would appear to move vertically at high rates of speed, while other times they entangled themselves in somewhat of a shared dance between two. Mostly however they moved relatively horizontal, again at inconsistent speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For hours I watched, and while I entertained the idea of capturing this on my camera phone, I knew it would have been futile. These objects were noticeably dimmer than any stars in the sky, half to even a quarter of a stars vibrancy. They were noticeably thousands of feet high, and I am in an area with no fireflies. The light was a dim white, their paths remained constant when I purposefully changed views to ensure it was not a slight of the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars, possibly??

I walk my dog all around and when she stops to sniff I would stop and look up .most of the time being a young man of 28, I would have the latest song playing on my ipod .Not having my ipod I was reluctant to stay any longer than I needed ,as I had nothing to entertain myself with .Half way across the field  my dog pauses to sniff a recent scent as she does often ,I then look up facing one end of the open field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night sky as clear as can be a normal night sky .And as I said looking toward oneway I saw from one end of the tall oak tree line float silently across one end of the field to the other . I noticed it even though I think It tried not to get noticed  .It&#39;s description was as followed .It had some kind of light bending pannels all over it I looked at it and saw 5 lights small round linning the bottom .but again it was reflecting the night sky light all around it minus it&#39;s lights  one the bottom and I could see the outline of the ship bend light around its long cigar shap like a big white bus but camo buy reflecting the night sky .i viewed it for 20 seconds glide silently from tree line to tree line it was  real I smiled afterwards and thought to myself that I actually have just seen a SHIP.Craft.I do have more details im sorry im not a good writer.the actual size of the ship was 30 to 60 yards in length and maybe 10 ft wide the ship itself was only tree line di! stance to me So I didn&#39;t just see it it saw me it was so close<n>

It had one Red Circle in the center and was surrounded by smaller circles.  (Just like the numbers are positioned on a clock).  I think there may have been 10 smaller circles.  The center circle was about 5 times bigger than the smaller ones around it.  It was moving slowly eastward very steady.  (I captured it on video but it would not stay focused and I was moving the camera which makes the item look like it was moving all over but it was not).  There are many split second spots in the video which shows it pretty clearly at the size I saw it.  I stopped videoing after my friend told me he thought it was an emergency flare, but the item did not distort or grow in size at all.  It stayed perfectly concentric and was moving slowly eastward.    I watched for approximately 2 minutes more until it disappeared into the horizon behind the clouds just like the Sun does.  I am trying to believe there is an explanation of what it could be.<n>

8/10/11 21:30|Trout Lake|WA|Other|1hr+|Light over Mt. Adams|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83187.html|485|ndxe201108| Light over Mt. Adams<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I went camping in the Mt Adams area.  At the camp site we were at it had a very clear view of the mountain.  We purposely went out to look for UFOs and were surprised to see a flashing light on the side of the mountain.   After watching it for about 5mins it started moving straight up in the air and then just stopped.  It was pulsating lights red, green and primarily white.  It seemed as though the lights were moving around in a triangle.  At one time the white lights seemed to arrange themselves in a row of three at the bottom. My brother-in-law kept saying it was a star, but the stars did not move (except for the rotation of the earth).  I was watching the star movement in relation to a tree as a marker.  The movement was not even close to the movement of the object.  My mother, sister, brouther-in-law watched the object for about an hour.  It seemed to stay in one position although at one point it seemed to come closer as we were using a high! power flashlight to signal it.  After an hour it seems to just fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out the next night about the same time, but we had collected a group of people because we set up telescopes.  Nothing appeared, but when the people left the object appeared almost immediately!  We watched in again for about 45mins.  My sister says that a disk like oject formed but when I looked it had reverted to the light formation.  This night it was only my sister, mother and myself.  I started feelong really uncomfortable watching it so we went in earlier. It was still in the sky at that time.  Again I watched the star positioning with relation to a tree from the same spot in the area.<n>

After about 10 seconds, the light brightened and went orange and then appeared to divide into four lights, with a streak of light attaching each light (up to four orange lights, each attached by a line of orange light).  This ended after a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the red light appeared again in a somewhat different area from my perspective and repeated the process described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought at first a satellite had fallen out of its orbit, or a plane had caught fire and was coming apart. But it all started with a stationary red light, and, it all happened twice so I figured it was something else. It was no airplane, I&#39;m sure of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later, I saw a plane go south right down the water line on the beach at low altitude. Ther plane made a returned, and then head out to sea in the extact area I saw the red/orange light phenomena.<n>

I did NOT see this object with my eyes.  I was taking pictures of a thunderstorm in continuous mode and captured on ONE of the frames an oval black blur.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, it could be a bird in flight, but it appears oval.  Unfortunately, the only frame with the object was taken without testing the average white balance before taking pictures of the thunderstorm so the color is off, but the object is clearly present.  I&#39;ve also deleted all the other frames except for the one with the object, but none of those deleted frames preceding or following the frame with object showed the object.  I used a Canon A3100IS to capture something, likely a bird.  I&#39;m only submitting this report because UFOs tend to appear during such electrical activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a bird, caught in flight.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it was a stray balloon floating because it appeared as a dark circular object. The object approached on a course from the south west heading to the north east, eventually going straight above my vehicle.  As it approached I noticed that it did not act as a balloon would, like dancing in wind currents or rotating on it&#39;s axis.  This object stayed on a steady course and did not vary it&#39;s speed, alitude or direction.  There was a breeze at the time that I figured to be appx. five m.p.h going from the west to the east, that I thought would make a balloon go off course.  When the object was about 200 yrds. from me, it was traveling about 20 m.p.h &#34; about the speed of a ten speed bike &#34; The altitude is hard to determine, but I would say that it about twenty stories high.  The object resembled a loaf of bread with a more rounded top and flatter bottom.  The color was of a dark bronze, almost charcoal with copper tints.  The rear of the craft had a concave circle that appeared like a crator but did not display any kind of propulsion system like a jet exhaust and it remained the same color as the rest of the craft.  The object passed by and had no noise at all.  When it continued behind me, it approached apartment buildings that were 200 yards away from me that are twelve stories high and the object seemed th be about twice the height of the buildings.  The object seemed to be the same size as the outside decks on the apartments, that i estimate to be about twelve to twenty feet. Making the craft to be about the size of a large s.u.v.<n>

The disk seemed to be transparent the outer edge was bright metal looking sort of like a large monicle, the interior of the disc you could see the clouds and the blue sky maybe a reflection on the body of the disk?  A person sitting at the bench saw the same object and said to me what ((deleted)) is that so I know I was not dreaming or crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I had just read a person in North Carolina had seen a oval transparent object seen the sky and clouds in the body very similar to my disk but at a different angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is why I am writing this, and another thing it was not ball shape you can count a weather balloon out.<n>

I saw a very large rectangular grid with white (round)lights. There were about three (3) rows of 5 white lights. They formed a very large rectangle. There were 3 red blinking lights wthin the grid as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed my car and thought possibly it was something new that the city had placed there for planes (?.

On one of the very first trips up Mount Rose a little over half way to the summit we both spotted a very bright object to our left high in the sky. I saw it only for an instant because I was driving but my wife saw it for a few seconds and had brought it to my attention.  The road was serpentine and had a steep grade up so I was forced to pay attention to the wheel; but my wife continued watching the object that seemed to be suspended in the air.  I took quick glances at it and it could not have been an airplane.  As we came around another bend to take a better look at the mysterious object it was no where to be seen.  It seemed large and very high in the sky like a capsule type pill and in the air it looked the size of a finger section (tip of your pi! nky).  It disappeared from the sky after we had gone around another bend and we saw it no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was just casually looking at the moon and stars.  After being outside for a little over 20 minutes I saw something in the sky that was triangular in shape with 3 sets of lights.  It moved at extremely high speeds, nothing that could be mistaken for a airplane. It shot off as soon as I had discovered it.  This all lasted under one minute. I was greatly disturbed by seeing this knowing that there was no way it could be technology made by man.  I tried to forget about it and haven&#39;t told anyone because they&#39;d think I was crazy.  However, I do believe I saw an alien aircraft that night and for some reason or other they are observing us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

In a second or two after the light stopped, the bright light faded away at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This tail of light wasn&#39;t thin and did not cover a substantial distance across the sky as a shooting star would&#39;ve.  It had a thickness to it and a short length.  It traveled from right to left (east to west) perfectly horizontal.  I&#39;d say it was 2-3 miles from where I was standing and there were no clouds.

As a third bat flittered close by, we were both completely calm and relaxed.  Then we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say &#34;it&#34; because I am still not positive what it was that we saw. Just a single light, much like the satelites that you some times see.  Or a plane, or helicopter.  But it was no satelite, was no plane or helicopter.  It was for sure a UFO (unidentified flying object), and possibly and extraterresterial flying space craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All it was was a single light, and if looked just like a star.  But it was very faint, then grew brighter and brighter, until it was as bright as the clearest stars.  Then it started traveling around the sky, just a bit faster then a plane.  Much faster than a satelite.  It looped around the sky for roughly twenty five seconds, then eventually flew out of our sight.  It was no shooting star, for it moved around the sky much longer than one would.

I&#39;m also sending an additional photo, though you will probably do this yourself ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second photo is a cropped, enlarged port! ion of the photo that focuses on the object.  I also tweaked the resolution to make the object appear sharper.<n>

The light was different and it did not compare to anything I have seen at this location. I am very familiar with the air traffic at this location because I have been coming here for years and have seen all types of air traffic at all times of day and night in all types of weather.  I sensed something about this light and decided to get my camera.It acted too different so I knew it was interesting shortly after seeing it.I use a Flip Digital camera and was not sure if it would even pick it up.  I filmed it and I became more interested and decided to get my binoculars so as to see if this was something I could identify.  I put my camera down and viewed it. When I finally found it in my viewfinder it rose at a somewhat 45 degree angle and either imitated a planes lights or placed itself behind a plane, it seemed to me it had done something deceptive.  I watched what now looked like a standard flashing plane (jet)lighting pattern and it continued on a lateral course until I became bored and stopped watching.<n>

8/8/11 15:07|Commerce Cityy|CO|Oval|7 minutes|Very hard to see object over east Denver visible on clear days when it's not cloudy, consistently.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83901.html|514|ndxe201108| Very hard to see object over east Denver visible on clear days when it&#39;s not cloudy, consistently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This email is regarding a sighting of a UFO that has been taking place for about a month now.  The object has been seen on “clear” days when not very cloudy and always between 5 and 5:15PM and just simply appears; nobody has seen it arrive in the general area.  There have been about 10 of us in all that have seen the object and 3 of us consistently search the skies every evening.  The object which I first noticed and described as like a little white dot of white-out; the old typewriter screwups repair stuff.  We always see it generally in the same area of the sky and just stays there.  When I first observed the object, I thought it was a white plastic bag that caught some air and was ascending.  As I continued to look, I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving and immediately pointed it out to a co-employee.  I had to point it out to him for nearly a minute before he could see it because it&#39;s so hard to see.  This same scenario plays out every day when clear and twice it h! as moved across the sky from east to northwest.  The first time it moved about 3 weeks ago, something similar in appearance to it showed up in the same spot from where it had left.  The object moved again last Saturday and when we had to go back in from our work break, it was almost directly overhead.  We are located in Commerce City, Co and are just south of one of the regular flight paths for DIA.  As we look due east, the object always shows up between 2 and 3 o&#39;clock, looks like it&#39;s close to the air space for Buckley Natl Guard base, and seems like it&#39;s between 30 and 60,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve seen the object since the middle of August and reported it to MUFON but they want written reports and sketches done independently and nobody I work with trusts the government, our employer (the Postal Service) with personal info so I can&#39;t get them to report it.  I&#39;ve sent several emails to 2 MUFON investigators and they want to close the case now and that&#39;s cool.  I almost consider it a waste of time anyway since there was no real support.  I&#39;ve also attempted to contact some media, but no interest there either.  None of us have powerful recording equipment and the object doesn&#39;t show up on film.  Fox News Denver&#39;s breaking news reporter was out of the office the day I called and the 50,000 blowtorch or the Rockies, so they advertise, KOA radio blew me off saying they probably didn&#39;t have any better camera than we had.  In other words, a big yawn and no follow up, no nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m very disappointed on so many levels.  I am a UFO researcher, reading and listening about the subject for 20 years and still to this day, not sure what to believe but nobody is taking me serious though I&#39;m really nobody; just a Postal worker (peaceful I might add).  There have been sightings around Denver for a long time including some video shot in northeast Commerce City very recently but judged as probably airplanes but I am so sure that what we have been seeing is an anomaly, that I&#39;m dying to find out what it is.  I can&#39;t believe that it is an airplane, air balloon, celestial body or satellite or space station but I totally can&#39;t explain it other than it&#39;s a small, white orb of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to keep this quiet at first and now, I don&#39;t care.  I just want it on record and my hope is that somebody will take me serious and get some serious film on it.  For some reason, I feel confidant that it will still be there for some time, I don&#39;t know why, maybe because I feel like it might be some kind of surveillance vehicle.  There it is, that&#39;s my story and I&#39;d be glad to talk to anybody.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pulled over to examine the craft further as it seemed to fly away in the distance and fade away.  I arrive to my house in the same neighborhood shorty after the first sighting, and the craft was again visible in the sky.  I ran into the house to alert my wife and grab our camera.  We went back outside and begin to film the craft flying about a mile an a half east from the first sighting.  It hovered a bit and flew up and down for about two minutes before I lost sight of the craft and stopped recording.<n>

Also, red irridescent squid like being dances above sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Night fell upon us around 8 and started hiking back up trail around 9.  My friend noticed what looked like two headlights but on the ocean. After looking at them for a while they started to transform taking on the shape of what I can only explain as large red squid like beings that floated on the ocean and changed shapes when it stopped floating above the water.  It formed into a giant human like form still in the red dotted form as tall as the cliff and walked on the water for a couple seconds.  It also seemed to have long tenticles of red dotted light that would take over the night sky by doing shows for us as we watched this mystical thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the show in the ocean we realized it was getting even later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10 we relized we need to hike up that long upward trail, it was so eerie and dark.  Midway up the trail I saw 2 triangular shapes on vivid blue with white circles as eyes the other glowing red with bright yellow accents on top on the top of the trail.  I asked them to come towards us if they were good spirits.  As they came towards us they changed from vibrating light fictures into human form.  One changed into a tall man with pants and a dark face the other became a larger woman with a long blue dress on.  And as they changed form they approached us at alarming speed I felt threatened so I said &#34; STOP!&#34;then started praying the our father n hail mary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stopped in their tracks and turned around and disappeared up the mountain just as fast as they came towards us.  We saw the blue and the red triangular shapes as we drove back towards monterey on the hwy 1 coast as well as a large spot light come of the ocean followed by the red dotted squid like ocean creature they stayed with us until after we past the carmel highlands.  But there are many things that reside there that are not from this world.  I forgot to mention what seemed to be a giant angel that had red glowing wings and a glowing yellow core it also followed us as we drove back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was clear except for a big cloud this morning. The cloud would flash about every 6 - 8 minutes.  After the cloud flashed once....we saw something flash about 2 miles away. We saw one of these star looking flying things fly right into the cloud that was flashing.  It&#39;s like...the flash looked like lightning in a cloud....but it didn&#39;t behave like lightning in a cloud.  The duration of the light flashes were identical rather than varied as you might expect in natural lightning flashes. Once again this morning,  I awoke my wife and she saw them too and in fact pointed out at least three of them.  We saw one go across the sky...stop...and then it went from 0 miles per hour to at least 2 or 3000 miles per hour instantly.  It left a streak behind it that disappeared instantly...meaning the streak did not hang in the sky....it sort of looked like what a fa! lling star looks like....but this was an object we were watching....it stopped and then took of at lightning speed....also...there was no trajectory as you might see with a falling star. It was completely parallel with the ground.  This morning we determined that they also fly at seemingly different heights, they can drop from high altitudes to low ones quicker than anything I have ever seen.  They have a hover type quality in the appearance of their flight. We saw one go directly into the cloud with the constant source light....it would flash about every 6 - 8 minutes.  Once again, it sort of had the colour of lightning...but each flash happened at roughly the same time distance apart and the flashes had the same duration.  There is no doubt that there are unknown flying objects above Lehigh Acres, Florida right now.  My wife and I have seen them 2 days in a row and nothing on earth can fly the way they can.  There are wierd flying stars in Lehigh Acres, Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Come see for yourself at 5 a.m.<n>

As I neared My home, I noticed what I thought to be a bright star or planet in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching this very bright object, I thought I saw a small red dot appear then disappear a distance away.  Thinking that I must have surely imagined it but it was so weird looking I pulled over onto a gravel road, sitting on a hill, parked my vehicle, turned off the lights and just watched.  Object itself seemed to be red in the center with a white field floating around it.  Occasionally, the red point in the center would get very bright and appear to radiate and change the outer field to a red color momentarily.  The detached red light appeared a ways a way twice more in the time I was watching this occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a period of ten minutes or so, the red light in the center got very bright several times in rapid succession.  At this time, the halo like field around the red light seemed to consolidate with the center light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next was what really convinced me that what I saw had no natural or man-made explanation.  The now singular light split into a 3 small points of light, one red, one white, an another appeared to be a greenish, or blue.  Then all three lights in a perfect 60, 60 60 triangle all increase in intensity and went all red, an just disappeared.  There were no clouds near enough to this object for it to disappear behind, while it was very slowly moving southward during the time I observed this, I am sure it didn&#39;t move.

Since we are in the patch of Ohare airport and another small airport, we know the patterns that air traffic uses to fly over our area.  Has not changed on ten years we lived here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were to close to one another for normal air traffic. It also was a clear night and moon was about 1/4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceded outside to get a better look and the three lights (slightly red and not blinking, more like a glow) were not moving for about five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ine on the right then went directly to our right and after a few seconds dissapeared.  Several seconds later the one on the left , went left and also dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds the final one. went straight up and light got smaller and smaller until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at each other in amazement.

Sure enough he seen it to and thought it was strange.  We watched it follow the plane and then veer off in a U shape towards a star where it quickly disappeared into the blackness.

I was driving downhill into the Minnesota river valley.  This area is extremely close to the MSP Airport and the planes that are landing travel right over the highway from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather that evening was about 75-80 degrees and there were thunder storms with lightning in the area. The winds were virtually non-existant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a cluster of about 8 tiny white/yellowish lights over the swamp area/river valley ahead and to the left at about 1500 feet up.  These lights were moving around in small circles and occasionally some of the lights would dissapear and then reappear.  I pulled my car over to the shoulder to watch these lights to try to figure out what they were and rolled down my window to try to listen.  The passing cars were too loud so I just watched the lights move around in small circles and slowly within 2 minutes all of the lights one by one fizzled out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were about 1/8 of a mile away from the airplane landing flight path so I knew that they were in an odd location.  There were airplanes actively landing at the time and it is highly possible that these strange lights could have been seen by either the passengers or pilots of these commercial jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is such that I am 42 years of age, male, in the transportation industry, and have driven that stretch of highway for the past 25 years.  I have never seen any lights or activity in that area before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To my recollection there were four of them heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a strange flight path for airplanes, but as I got closer, all I saw was a ball of light, four of them to my memory, heading westbound, at a fairly low altitude.  Several cars were pulled off the road taking pictures and videos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided today to look on the internet and see if anyone posted pictures of these but I did not find any.  I did find one video on youtube but it was in Hartland, MI and on a different day.  The lights were the same though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached I was between Belleville road and Haggerty, and when I got to the I-275 overpass they disappeared.  I have lived here for 20+ years and am used to seeing airplanes of all kinds from Willow Run and DTW, but I cannot explain this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I also DO NOT believe in aliens or martians.  But I still can&#39;t explain this.  I am surprised based on the number of cars that were pulled over taking pictures that I could not find any on the internet.<n>

The temperature was in the low 60’s, the sky was relatively clear, with a patchy, thin layer of haze forming over the beach &amp; town.  The wind was calm.  I had been looking at the sky because I was aware of the possibility of seeing the Northern Lights.  The sun had set &amp; I was walking back towards my house.  When I got to the promenade at 12th street, I saw a man I had seen earlier.  I mentioned that the Northern Lights might be seen here tonight.  He was looking up at the sky &amp; when I looked up I saw an object directly above us in the sky.  It was quite high.  There was a patchy thin layer of haze at approximately 3,000 feet &amp; the object appeared to be much higher than that.  He asked me if I had seen the others &amp; I said no.  I immediately thought it was something other than an aircraft, as I am a pilot &amp; am familiar with the movement of various ! aircraft.  The object was quite bright with an orange glow.  It reminded me of a fireball.  It moved around almost like it was hovering &amp; then the light began to fade.  It seemed as if it went straight up into the atmosphere.  There was no noise at all coming from the object that could be heard from the ground.  We were both in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were standing there talking about it, a couple &amp; their son walked up from the beach.  We were still looking up at the sky &amp; they asked us if we had seen anything.  When we said yes, they mentioned they had seen 2 other objects that had been flying in close proximity together.  The man I had been talking with had also seen the other 2.  I did not see them.  They had noticed them approximately 10-15 minutes prior while they were still on the beach watching the sunset.  The woman said she had seen them come up from the north over the Gearhart area at a rather high altitude &amp; they emitted an orange glow.  They watched them head south &amp; up to the same area as the 3rd one, which was directly overhead.  We joked around that they went to the mothership.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always believed that other life forms existed.  Now I am even more confident in my belief.  It was truly an amazing opportunity.  I have no doubt that many other people on the beach tonight witnessed what we did.  I hope they will take the time to report what they saw.<n>

Its distinct, glowing appearance seemed to be on fire and was so low in the sky that it would be nearly impossible to miss seeing because it was literally right in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was clearly visible in the western sky and seemed to heading right toward us moving at a slow speed.  No sound could be heard from this object and we quickly assumed it was not an airplane.  We only saw one object and it was so unusual to us that we stopped, frozen in our tracks, debating as to what kind of object it was, because neither of us had experienced anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#34;fire in the sky&#34; moved in an southerly direction and glowed for approximately one minute before fading away.<n>

The object is about 317 degrees NW in the sky, according to my iPhone compass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the object grow closer for about 2 more minutes when we realized that it wasn’t making any noise.  It also appeared to be glowing orange and had a circular shape.  It seemed like it was a glowing fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as it passed overhead at about 252 degrees W, we realized that it seemed to slow down and the glow started to dim.  As it began to disappear out of sight at 150 degree’s SE, the sphere was barely visible but was no longer glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took approximately 5 minutes to cross the sky all together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> t appeared to be flying a little higher that a normal commercial aircraft would fly.  We were located in a suburban area in Campbell, California, that is well lit so we did not see very many stars out but it began as a pretty clear night.  This was very bright! in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it was almost out of view, we began hearing aircraft.  First was a large military, twin-engine craft, then a helicopter with a search light then military fighter jets.  Growing up near Moffitt Field, I know the sounds of the high-speed planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten to fifteen minutes passed and a second bright orange ball headed towards us again.  It had the same bright glowing light, the same directionality and the same silence.  Unlike the first object, military planes were quickly following this one.  A larger twin-engine plane and this time 2 fighter jets.  Noticeably the planes were flying lower than the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, the fog began rolling in from the west and obstructed our view of the rest of the events.<n> <n><n> But before the object disappeared into the fog, we noticed that it had also begun to dim as the first one had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not a technical person but I did record the images on my iPhone to view later.  As I was recording the images I noted that the object appeared to be the size of a dime in the night sky, where my iPhone video made it seem like a pin spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 3 adults and 6 children all together watching this event.<n>

Impossible flight maneuvers...cloaking capabilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in my driveway around 5 a.m. I happened to look up into the sky and i saw what looked exactly like any of the other stars but it was moving. I kept watching it and thought maybe it was a satellite or something because it seemed to be on a pretty steady path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then it started angling downward....it continued on a downward path for about 20 seconds.  I became really confused about what it could be when it appeared to move sideways and then flickered once and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I just stood there for a while, and I saw another one. I ran inside and woke up my wife and said there was a UFO outside.  She got up quicly and we both ran outside to see it.  I spotted it right away when we got back outside and this is what happened......it continued moving across the sky much like the other one did and it also decended....but not like the other one....it decended at a rate that I don&#39;t think could be possible for anything.  On the human body..! .the negative G&#39;s would be intense at best.  I have never seen anything drop that fast and neither has my wife. It then literally disappeared before both of our eyes and we actually looked at each other at the sime time and said...&#34;It just disappeared!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife stayed outside with me for about 5 minutes while we continued to scan the sky....she went back inside to have a shower to get ready for work and I stayed out in the driveway.  That&#39;s when I saw another one. I ran back inside to get her but she said she couldn&#39;t come because she was in the shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back outside and couldn&#39;t find it again.  After this happened...I did some UFO footage research.  What my wife and I saw is an exact match to what some people are posting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was skeptical before about UFO&#39;s but not any more....I know what I saw and nothing can do what we saw.<n>

The craft looked like it was flying on its side with the thickest part of the triangle in the front and the point in the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had three large red lights that outlined the shape of the craft which was a very bright red.  The craft made no noise whatsoever, and flew by so fast, I jumped up and ran to the end of the deck to see it fly behind the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the same time a police helicopter flew over us heading North following the craft, the police helicopter had its search light on and seemed to be trying to catch up with the craft, the crafts speed was way to fast for the helicopter to catch up, and in the distance behind the! hills you could see the police helicopter with its search light and around 3 minutes later the helicopter started flying East with the search light on, the same path of the craft, we saw the helicopter stopped in the Menifee area, and turned around to follow again the exact flight path of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never saw the craft or the police helicopter again.<n>

I thought they were stars, but I felt a little uneasy because I had never noticed them before.  I resumed brushing my dog when all the sudden my dog sat down and wouldn&#39;t get back up.  I commanded him to get up numerous times, for he is a former police dog, but he would not get up.  It was very unusual. I looked up at the sky and I saw nine, bright, bright greenish, purplish lights hovering over the property I own in kind of in a formation like this<n> <n><n> <n><n> o o       o o     o      o o       o o<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Raster image did not survive transfer to database.

I was facing northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was right behind me but was fumbling with her purse, looking either for her phone or for cigarettes.  I can&#39;t remember which.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fireworks are a common sight during the summer in Southern California, and I thought this was part of a fireworks show being put on by an amusement park or maybe even the Orange County Fair.  But there was no explosion.  The bright green light appeared to just hover over North Long Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should note that we were a few blocks from a south facing beach and that we were walking in an eastward direction through the parking lot.  The lights we saw did not appear directly above us but rather appeared about five or maybe even ten miles northeast of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance itself is a bit of a guess.  It was a clear night but I didn&#39;t notice any type of landmark that would help to determine how close or how far the lights really were, though it&#39;s possible that they were near the Long Beach Airport, as it is in the general direction of where we saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend hadn’t noticed it yet so I asked her, &#34;Hey, what is that?&#34;   I pointed to the green light that I’d been observing and she thought it was a plane, but I pointed out to her that it couldn’t be a plane or helicopter because there were no blinking lights on this object.  It remained one solid color throughout the entire sighting, bright green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching this thing we could see that the normal air traffic one sees every night was still happening.  There were helicopters in the distance and we could see planes in the sky, probably making their way to Long Beach Airport or LAX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing we noticed was that the green light was the brightest light in the sky at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it move back and forth (east to west then back again) for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s difficult to say how fast it was moving but I would say its speed seemed similar to that of a commercial airliner moving across the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately two minutes into the sighting we noticed a second bright green light appear below the first green light.  This light appeared to be west of the original light we’d spotted.  We didn’t notice any movement with the second light.  It appeared to just be hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second light appeared in the sky for about thirty seconds and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second light had vanished we noticed a third light appear below the original bright green one.  This light was east of the green light and was red in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This third light’s movement was similar to that of a helicopter.  I actually thought it was a helicopter at first but noticed that there were no blinking lights on that object either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was a solid red. No blinking or anything else that one would associate with a typical helicopter flying over a large city with an airport nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This red light moved faster than the first light we&#39;d spotted.  Not freakishly fast but more like a helicopter than anything else.  It looked like it was moving toward the green light but then it stopped and appeared to just hover near where the green light was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my girlfriend and I noticed that the bright green light we’d originally noticed looked like it was starting to fade.  It disappeared momentarily and then reappeared in the same spot we’d last seen it. As this was happening the red light began to fade and disappeared completely.  This left the green light as the only light we could see hovering in the sky. It remained in the sky for another twenty seconds (approx) until it too disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds after the lights vanished we noticed two helicopters flying (circling?) around the area where we had seen the three mystery lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted about five or six minutes.<n>

This occurred near the Christian Academy but on the Valley Forge side of the road.  The object appeared 20 feet from the left side of the road and about 6 stories high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From a distance it appeared to be a large radio tower however there was no flashing red light and the object did not move.  When I drove closer it was evident that the object had 3 white lights (two in the middle on each side and one front and center) that were not overly bright.  The lights did not shine on the ground they just appeared to illuminate the immediate area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was made out of steal (with no apparent windows) and was shaped almost as a fighter jet.  The UFO had no outside markings and did not move.<n>

Stopped the car and observed the object for about 1 or 2 minutes.  It looked like a big ball of fire just hovering there.  There seemed to be some small erratic movement and no sound.  I quickly went back to the house and got my wife to come look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we looked back up the object appeared to be moving SW at a very high speed and disappeared.<n>

We were heading south on state highway 57 passing Luxemburg,WI at County Road S.  My girlfriend pointed up through the top of the windshield and asked &amp;quot;what the heck is that?&amp;quot;  At this point we observed a orange in color glowing object flying directly above us headed in the opposite direction.  My first thought was that this may be some sort of ultralight aircraft, however there are no known landing strips in the vicinity.  To my knowledge ultralight aircraft do not glow and pulsate.  This object was triangular in shape and did not act as a conventional aircraft.  I looked in my rear view mirror as i continued south on state highway 57 and observed this craft veer up and down and take an immediate left turn above the treeline viewed from my rear view mirror, a left turn as a car or truck would.  It was not something any aircraf! t i have ever seen could maneuver.  While i continued driving my girlfriend turned around and continued to observe this object as it appeared to have descended beneath the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been to several Expermental Aircraft Association fly-ins at Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh, Wisconsin and never have i observed an ultralight aircraft make the maneuvers that this object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background: (me) small business owner, property maintenance manager (my girlfriend) criminal justice major, customer service representative  Neither of us have ever witnessed a &amp;quot;ufo&amp;quot; or anything that we could not dismiss as being something &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot;.  This incident took us completely by surprise.  I have been looking all over the internet to see if anyone else noticed this object in the sky as there were approximately 15-20 other vehicles within a mile radius travelling north and south.<n>

I sensed a very sureal feeling and was totally shocked and amazed.  My mind was racing with questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With narrow sholders on the road and heavy traffic I did not stop but slowed down.  One light was larger (sphere) and the others seemed more like orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was cloudy and I could not discern if they were connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one quarter of a mile I turned off Hwy. 30 to enter Crown Point and looking back to my right I could still see one orange orb, lighting up the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked directly at it and it was a lighted triangular craft heading from west to east. It had a streak behind it about 15 times the length of the craft.  Both the craft and the streak behind it were illuminated a creme white color. I do no know its approximate altitude or distance from me, but it appeared to fly at the same distance and altitude as other planes that regularly fly at low altitude over the area.  It was moving much faster than the average planes that fly over this area at low altitude.  I watched the craft for about 4 seconds before it and the streak behind it seemed to vanish at the same time.  There were no clouds in the immediate area and I could see stars all along its patch and in the direction it was heading, so it couldn&#39;t have disappeared behind a cloud.  I heard no sound other than the cars driving by.<n>

I just happened to be looking for the Moon which I observed south (nearly 180 true) when I observed two objects approximately 3 degrees east of the Moon and the same south.  They were moving at about a course of (nearly 15 true).  The first seemed to be moving ahead a little faster and opening the distance between them that I adjudged to be several degrees at first. They appeared to have some color in the setting sun.  I watched them as they continued to separate a little and then slowly veer to the east to a heading between 15 true and maybe 45 true.  As they now moved away from me the appeared closer together, that is less separation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly another object appeared from the same location, so I went to get binoculars.  With the binoculars I could not resolve anything but a ball like object.  That is no wings.  The third object had bright red markings and some black. The fourth object appeared out of the same location and followed the same path except these seemed not to veer off to the east as much.  The forth object was a brilliant green, and could only be resolved to be round.  The fifth object seemed to be as the first three bright red with some markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I had only a 45 degree field of view, blocked by a tree, my estimates of speed and altitudes are just that, estimates.  Speed I adjudge to be greater that mach 1.  I first thought greater that 500 nm.  Altitude I adjudge to have been greater than 50,000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sonic boom.  There was no sound of propulsion system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife observed the first two, but says she thought them planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a message about this on Facebook, but no one else has reported seeing them.<n>

I saw what a appeared to be a glowing ball of light.  It was pretty dim, I described it as a fireball because it looks a lot like the fireball UFO pictures posted on this site.  The second I saw it, I said &#34;Holy S**t&#34; and pointed my finger in the direction for my friends to see.  While they are turning around, the light got a little brighter and it zoomed away. It dissapeared out of my site in less than a second.  And IT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO NOISE.  So they turn around, see nothing, and think I am playing around.  They tell me to swear to &#34;God&#34;, &#34;My Mother&#34; and several other things.  And then they said they beleived that I really thought I saw it, but that it was probably my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I know what I saw.  And it definitely was not my imagination.

The caymon ranch and the sterling apartments .<n> <n><n> <n><n> For 5 hours, I stayed up looking in out of my window hoping for it to be a helicopter or something else, but I notice it rose quite a bit from the last time I checked up on it .nothing else was in the sky for miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then hours later the light faded away.  Everything was silent their wasn&#39;t any distant bodies of a aircraft or anything remotely sounding like a aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star?  PD))<n>

Time of sighting was just after 10:00 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were up at my parents cabin on Black Dan lake for a fishing trip and my brother-in-law and I had gone outside to look at the stars.  My brother-in-law has never been up to the cabin and I wanted him to see how many stars you can see way up north.  As we were walking out to the road I mentioned to him that it is so dark up here you will have a hard time seeing the your hand in front of your face. When we stepped out into the complete darkness we looked straight up and he was amazed at the amount of stars in the clear night sky.  As we looked south we were both taken by surprise and seemed to be in a state of shock. What we were looking at was a bright reddish orange object moving slowly in our direction coming from the southwest moving to the northeast. The object looked like a rectangular cube and the intensity of the light was like a brit fire.  We were looking at this object at about a 30 degree angle in the beginning to about a 60 degree angle when it disappeared.  There w! as no wind and the temperature was around 60 -65 degrees and the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved slowly closer to our position my brother-in-law started saying go get your camera, over and over.  I don’t know why I didn’t run and get it at the first but I was in a state of aw.  The object continued move in out direction and I did run in side to get my camera.  As I was running in to get my camera it felt like I was running up hill and that I would never get it in time to capture the object. I franticly opened the door and started rumbling to get my camera bag open.  I had that strange felling that I was going to never make it, or it was just out of reach like in a dream.  I was able to get my camera and charged back out into the pitch black night.  As I ran out, I had turned on my camera and captured a short video of the object as it flew a way and then just disappeared in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother-in-law asked me if I got it and I explained that I could see the object as I recorded but it was distorted at times and looked like you were looking out a window with rain drops on it.  This object must have been a thousand feet in the air and was seen by us for about 5 minutes before it disappeared completely.  We did not see any outline around the light object but if you had a ping-pong ball held in your fingers at arms length this object would not be blocked out by the size of the ping-pong ball  (This is when the object was closest to us).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object was gone we both new we had seen something that would be hard to explain to the others in the cabin.  I don’t know why I didn’t yell out for everyone to come outside but I think we were just hypnotized by the moment.  I have always wondered what it would be like to see a Unidentified Flying Object and now I have even more wonderment than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video was taken as the object flew away from us to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30dLJMdLk6I<n>

Slightly to the right of that mountain is a smaller mountain with a single and smaller tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light I saw was right next to the tower, appeared to be very close to the ground and was a brilliant white light, unmistakable despite the fact it was night time and the city was filled with lights.  It was much brighter than any other light in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then within 25 seconds it receded behind the mountain and was no longer in sight.  The light could compare to the brightness of several spotlights, it lit up the clouds around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it wasn’t a spotlight, it did not shine upwards or in a cylindrical form, it was an oval shaped ball of light, far too bright to be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have altered the date above to August 4th, a more realistic date.

They started in a Y formation going from south to north-west.  We also saw an airplane flying above, not near or around the objects (seemed to be unrelated).  There was no sound and they were moving faster than a regular aircraft.  One by one they began to disappear.  After they all disappeared through the tree line we could make out other lights, but were unable to tell if they were the same lights or something unrelated they seemed to be both white and the orange/red color.   After waiting around for a few minutes they didn&#39;t reappear.<n>

They looked like rectangles and transformed into squares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had white lights that came from the bottom of the figure.  They were about 3.5 times the size of stars.  The background was a clear sky no clouds and few stars.<n>

My cousin and I were driving towards my house when we saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course we had to detour and get closer to the UFO.  As we drove closer, the lights multiplied until there were 10 visible lights.  They were hovering in an oval formation in a very methodical way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after about 6 or 7 minutes, they started splitting, taking off one by one.  As they split, one to the left then one to the right, they went from having one white light to having the one white light and 2 red lights on each side fairly far apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They eventually flew out of sight.  Their white lights were about twice the size of a star but about four times brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not beaming to the ground.<n>

I was driving down the road and I was facing east. I saw 4 strange lights in a weird pattern I decided that something was not right so I knew the road I was on went out into the desert so I went about 5 miles out of town and now there was 8 lights in the sky in different patterns from horizontal lines to rectangles to circles. As soon as I got to the desert there was another car already out there and one soon showed up and then a few minutes later there was 4-5 cars including mine.  Having a truck and it being the desert I went out as far as I could and I go to I would say about 2 miles away.  I was standing lights of and I knew they were not airplanes because they were just sitting there but being so close I also didn’t hear any helicopter noises  I took a bunch of pictures and the last one was when they were in a rectangle and then they started to circle the city it seemed! and then they all started going towards the ground and where most of them flew I knew there was departments so I decided to head out that way and I think I saw one on the ground but as soon as I parked my car a cop seemed to appear out of nowhere and he asked me if I had a problem I responded if I was trespassing and he said I wasn’t and so I started to tell him about the lights and showed him the pictures. He then proceeded to tell me that there are new aircraft that hover and don’t make noise but I haven’t heard of anything like that. I said I should go and he goes good Idea and as I was turning my car around he turned left to go where the lights had seemed to land.  The whole cop thing seemed rather suspicious and it just didn’t feel right I was out in the middle of nowhere and I didn’t even see him coming but take that for what it is worth.  I then went home and looked up the number to call and report I tried calling a couple of times and it was busy and then I started t! o see the lights again this time they were heading south and t! hey were in a horizontal formation I went had gotten gas and that’s when I tried take more pictures and only one came out and it seems really weird. When I was looking at the lights I was able to get through and the person told me to try and get as many people to look and report. I got in my car and started to head south but they just seemed to disappear rather quickly I saw them and then I didn’t see them I tried waiting around but then I had to be somewhere at midnight that is why I am writing the report so late. I will include pics in the email and try and describe them. The lights every time I saw them where just white and they did blink but only sometimes and I didn’t see any other color.<n>

8/4/11 12:00|San Jose|CA|Other|4 seconds|Highly reflective object moving over homes in a populated area|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83762.html|584|ndxe201108| Highly reflective object moving over homes in a populated area<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my car driving north down Santa Teresa Blvd when I noticed a chrome/nickel (highly reflective) craft flying between the hills and the road that I was on.  The craft was approximately 150 Ft. off of the ground.  It was approximately 60 feet long and nickel with a blue tint on the bottom. It was moving at approximately 100 MPH. It made no noise and had no visible means of propulsion. It was completely bare, just solid chrome/nickel with the blue tint on the bottom.  I know this is going to sound strange, but it looked like it was just floating there, except for the fact that it was moving fast through the air.  This was in a heavily populated area in the middle of the day right over homes. I pulled my car over to get a better look.  As I got out of my car, the craft was now about a half of a mile behind me.  By the time my eyes found the craft (it was so low that it didn&#39;t take long for it to leave my field of view) it just faded away into nothing.  It just ! disappeared.  This thing flew right over some friends of mine that were eating their lunch, and none of them noticed it or heard a thing.  It had to go right over their heads.<n>

The object was rounded, almost like a boomerang. There were 3 orange bright lights on the bottom of the craft. They were recessed into the craft and seemed to be made of a liquid or sphere of liquid as I was able to see the substance churning about within. The lights were odd in the fact that they did not seem to emit a glare. It appeared to be two or three pine trees tall off of the ground (150-250feet). The object made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Events: I stepped outside for a quick smoke before I went to lay down with my girlfriend. I had been up working on a programming project and she had gone to bed before me. As I sat outside enjoying a cigarette, I noticed this object moving toward my location. As it began to pass directly over me it seemed to stop instantaneously. I was quite startled  by this and made no attempt to take cover, I was paralyzed with intrigue, eyes locked to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall the object starting to move away, or leaving at all. I simply remember next sitting in my chair and it was gone. I looked down at my wristwatch as I  felt the need to make sure and note the time and to my surprise it was hours later than I thought it should be. I rushed inside and woke my girlfriend in a panic and demanded that she tell me the time. She told me it was 3:47 in the morning. My watch read that it was 6:23.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Physical Evidence: The watch was given to me not long ago by my aunt who works in a jewelry store. The watch has never had an issue telling the correct time. It is a Quartz ESQ E5460 that is rated at 3 ATM or 30 minutes under water. I find it quite odd that after observing this object at such a close distance, not being able to recall the object leaving, and that my watch was 1:36 hours ahead of when it should be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is now about a month after the original sighting. There is a rough circular shape of dead grass/clumps of dead grass that is tangent to the side of my house, and seems to fully encompass the area where I was sitting if the grass was extended through the area of my patio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusion: I know that I saw something, and I feel like this something did not want me to remember seeing it, however I can not state that as fact as I simply do not know what happened after the object stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes: I have selected the checkbox below that states the object landed. This is due to the possible interaction it had with the ground(i.e. dead grass). I did not see the object land, but there is indeed the possibility of physical interaction with the ground.<n>

8/3/11 23:00|Key Largo|FL|Chevron|10 Sec|Large Chevron UFO flying over Key Largo FL from the SW to NE -|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83096.html|591|ndxe201108| Large Chevron UFO flying over Key Largo FL from the SW to NE -<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport, I submitted my Sighting Description late last night and I am sorry, I made many grammatical errors. I went through my paper and have corrected them all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello My name is ((name deleted)) and I observed for approximately 10 seconds, in great clarity, in extremely close proximity, a  very, very large chevron shaped unidentified flying object that flew completely from one horizon towards my position, virtually  directly over my head, to the opposite horizon until I could no longer see it, on August 3rd, 2011 in Key Largo Florida at  approximately 11pm at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Background:  I was born in May of 1964 and raised in the Metro Detroit area.  I graduated from Western Michigan University in 1990.  I left the  Metro Detroit area and moved to Kansas City in September of 1996, and then finally re-located to Cape Coral, Florida in  September of 2000 where I reside today.  My occupation was in the restaurant/hospitality industry for most of my life and left that  behind when I became self-employed in March of 2004 as a Realtor in SW Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a young man growing up during the Apollo era, I have always had an interest in aviation, space flight, the planets, the moon  and the stars.  I became so interested in astronomy at a young age that my parents gave me a telescope for Christmas when I  was 9 years old.  I still have a 900mm telescope today, although it doesn&#39;t get used all that often anymore. At any rate, I have  observed the Moon and its mesmerizing  countless craters countless times.  I have visited Mars, Jupiter, Saturn with my telescope as well and their observable moons and gazed at the Horse Head Nebula, many stars and variety of other celestial objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, I enjoy starring out into space and contemplating all of the greatest questions that confound mankind.  I am  always amazed that I am not seeing a picture of the present stars, but rather looking at a picture of the past stars, and of course its endless beauty.  In addition, through the years I have read books on astronomy, aviation and expanded my knowledge through  college academic&#39;s in calculus, physics and astronomy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an aviation buff as previously mentioned, I have attended many aviation shows over the years and I can say that I am  probably more familiar with civilian and military aircraft than the average Joe on the street.  My son has been to 10 shows with me,  and he is now 12 years of age.  I have seen just about every type of current military aircraft that civilians are allowed to see, on the ground up close, as well as performing maneuvers for the crowd over the tarmac.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To finish the context of my background that is important for you to understand regarding how and why I was privileged enough to  witness this event, I must tell you a story of my past. One evening about 16 or 17 years ago I was laying in the grass at a rest  area with my then wife, outside the city of Detroit, to avoid the city lights. We were there, late night picnicking to observe a  meteor shower that we had discovered was happening, from a radio news broadcast we had heard a couple of days earlier. We  watched many shooting stars that evening, and noticed a bunch of small moving stars. We realized those slow moving stars were  not stars at all, they were satellites. Unexpectedly, I had found a new hobby that night, starring at the sky, in one direction for  long periods of time, then finding and watching satellites cross the sky. I thought that was so cool, to see something so small, so  far away, flying at 17, 500 miles per hour! It just brought me a little closer to outer space!  So, over the years while camping or at the beach, on the darkest of nights when the stars were at their brightest, my son and I  have laid on the ground and looked for satellites together many times. This night, last Wednesday, August the 3rd 2011 was not  our first time satellite gazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Event:  My son Julian and I went to Key Largo, Florida on Tuesday August 2nd, 2011 for a two and a half day get-a-way, to celebrate the  end of his summer vacation. 7th grade was starting that follow Monday, so we had planned on doing some snorkeling and fishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically just goofing around and relaxing really.  So, on Tuesday morning we left for the ((name deleted)) Inn located at 97xxx   Hwy, MM 97.8 Bayside, Key Largo, FL 33037  Phone: (305) ((deleted))FAX: (305) ((deleted)). We arrived in the early afternoon,  check into the hotel and met up with some old friends. Then we proceeded to have a fun evening talking, walking on the small  dock and beach at the hotel and eventually went out to dinner that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday, August 3rd, 2011, we got up in the morning and went to the beach again. I ended up doing most of the real  snorkeling and attempted to do some spear fishing. ((name deleted)) spent most of that morning and afternoon tooling around the real  shallow waters close to the beach with just his goggles on.  Later in the afternoon I met a lady, a guest of the hotel, who was  drinking a beer in the hotel beach waters relaxing.  She talked about this and that, and went on and on, but the two things I  remembered from our short conversation was that she was from northern Florida, and the night before, Tuesday (when we were  out to dinner) she and her husband had been shark fishing off of the little dock at the hotel, and they had done pretty well  catching a few nice sized sharks.  Well, I knew at that moment that Julian and I would be doing some shark fishing that night. It  sounded fun, it was convenient and - well - I wanted to catch a shark too!   That night at about 10:15pm, Julian and I headed to the dock with 2 fishing rods fitted with metal leaders, a fishing tackle box, 4  cans of dog food for shark chum and a box of thawed squid for bait. When we arrived at the Dock there were other people their.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady from northern part of Florida (she was already fishing) and her son, a new female guest of Latino origin, and another  child I believed to be her son. So in total, there were 3 adults and 3 children. It was a beautiful evening almost completely clear  with a sporadic cloud now and again, but virtually clear. The two ladies were chit chatting away about this and that, the 2 other  boys were playing behind me. I wasn&#39;t really paying close attention to any of them at this time, as ((name deleted)) and I were setting our  gear down and getting ready to fish. Julian and I prepared our fishing rods. I went ahead and opened the cans of dog food and  threw the food into the water to bring the sharks closer to the shore. I then baited both fishing rods, each with one full squid and I cast the baits out into the Gulf of Mexico.  At that point, I asked Julian if he wanted to look for satellites and he said sure. So, Julian  and I laid down on the dock to begin looking, starring into the heavans...  NOTE: The docks shape is square and approximately 40&#39;  X 40&#39; and its orientation is such that if you were sitting at the end of the dock, on the edge, with your feet in the water, looking  straight out, you would be facing just about dead NW.  This is where I had cast our fishing rods out into the water. So when we  laid down on our backs, our feet were facing dead NW, with our heads pointed just about due SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Starring up at the zenith of the sky only after a few minutes, we spotted a tiny red dot, a satellite emitting this faint light, like a  faint star, but crossing the night sky.  As we watched it cross the sky, suddenly one of our fishing rods exploded with the fishing  line running out of the real at a very fast rate! We both jumped up to our feet, I pulled the rod out of it&#39;s holder and handed it to  my son.  The 2 other boys came running up to us to watch, and the 2 ladies were there already chit chatting away, now standing  next to us watching the fishing battle. Julian was wrestling with a fiend from the deep and he was loving it.  I had to take the rod  from him a few times to ensure the fish wouldn&#39;t wrap himself around a buoy and dock a couple of times, but ((name)) did most of  the work and pulled up to the dock a 4.5 foot Lemon shark. We tried to land the shark as the lady from northern Florida said she  wanted to keep it, but while I was trying to take the hook out of it&#39;s mouth and not get bitten at the same time, the shark shook  it&#39;s head and jumped off the hook. It fell into the gulf waters and swam off. I asked my son to grab another squid from the box, and I re-baited the fishing rod and cast the bait back out into the Gulf of Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shark having swam off and the excitement over for the moment, ((name deleted)) began to hangout with the 2 other boys on the dock  behind me playing and talking. The were walking around the dock, then off the dock to the beach and back again to the dock  etc. The ladies still standing 5 feet away from me off to my right, went back into their conversation chit chatting away... I laid  down on the dock, back into my satellite hunting position.  My feet again pointing about due NW and my head about due SE.  The  lady from northern Florida still fishing as well. I starred straight up into the sky looking for movement in the stars, looking for  another satellite to show my son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the ladies were talking, the Latino lady mentioned something about God and the stars and heavan and then mentioned  something about the North Star, at that juncture I interjected in their conversation and I pointed out to them, how you could find  the North Star by looking at the two stars on the end of the cup of the Big Dipper.  I told them to find the Big Dipper, and then the  2 stars at the end of the cup and showed them how they pointed like an arrow to the North Star...  They didn&#39;t seem impressed,  So I laid back down on the dock looking straight up, looking and looking for another satellite to show Julian and his new friends...<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about 30 minutes with no luck spotting another satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then caught movement out of the corner of my left eyes&#39; peripheral vision.  Still lying flat on my back, I simply turned my head to  the left (looking just about due SW) and to my amazement I clearly saw a large, and I mean large, flat black object approaching  me, us, quickly.  If I had to judge the objects altitude at the moment I first saw it, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon (or  about a fist and a half at arms length).  The objects physical width was about a fists width across.  It was approaching fast, that&#39;s  why I noticed it. It blocked out the star light as it was moving.  Although I had been looking straight up all of this time, my eyes  were wide open and in-tune to the ambient light, so it was easy to see. I leaped to my feet (my entire body has goose bumps as I  am writing this - remembering) - I leaped to my feet, pointed directly at it and started yelling &#34;look, look, look, look, look, look,  look, at that!!! look, look, look, look, look, look, look, at that!!!&#34; I was yelling, keeping my finger pointed straight at the craft as it  approached, so that everybody who had not been looking up, could focus on it, could find what it was I was seeing approaching  us in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving quickly, straight, straight towards us, heading to be almost perfectly above us.... I wasn&#39;t paying attention to  anyone else so I really don&#39;t know what everybody elses locations were around me... all I could do was stare as it approached  very quickly, and I am yelling to everyone, I see it has lights underneath it. Not a lot of lights, maybe 5 or 6, white lights not too  big, kind of small actually, not flashing, but on - constant and white, they kind of look like the stars, running along the center line  of what I see, as it approaches - clear as if it were in day light - to be a chevron craft, huge, as it passes above me - it&#39;s size, its  wing span (for lack of a better definition) was... if you held your hands up to the sky and spread them apart 3 feet apart.  The  wings are perfectly symmetrical, the width from the leading edge to the lee ward edge was a fists width, the ends were square or  45 degree angles, they were not rounded like a boomerang.  It looks like a perfect chevron, with lights running across the center  line of the craft equidistant from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s was huge - it&#39;s the size of a cruise ship in Key West. The real creepy part - it doesn&#39;t make a sound - I can&#39;t even hear wind  running over the body of it. I&#39;m thinking &#34;it&#39;s not silent, it&#39;s more than silent - nothing - no sound - Just me yelling as it&#39;s passing  over head - almost as if it were suppressing the sound - as it passes above us I start say &#34;Do you see that?  What is it? Oh my God  what is that.....Do you see that!&#34;  It&#39;s moving away - never slowing, never buffeting, no lights blinking - no sound - it&#39;s past me  moving away - NO EXHAUST... It has no exhaust, no sound... I&#39;m yelling - &#34;look there&#34;, pointing at it, never taking my eyes off of  it, as I hear the boys come running up. It&#39;s approaching a cloud to the NE... I&#39;m yelling at the boys to look hard before it  disappears &#34;look, look...it&#39;s going above that cloud, look at the other side of the cloud maybe you will see it when it comes out the  other side....&#34; and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It never slowed - it never turned - it passed almost directly above us, just so it&#39;s right wing tip was at the sky&#39;s zenith above me  and it&#39;s left wing tip directly away from me to the NW. It was flying on a course following the island from the SW to the NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the experience, the Latino lady left quickly, I never saw her again a long with the boy that was with her. The other boy, the  northern Florida lady&#39;s son couldn&#39;t stop talking about it, what he saw, over and over again. I was dumb founded. I just shook my  head head and could not understand what I had just seen. The feeling reminds me of when I was told my older brother had died. I  didn&#39;t go into shock like frozen or start crying, I just was amazed, dazed. I ask everyone did you see that?... and everyone said  yes, but there answers washed over me - I went into shock by going about my business.... I checked the fishing lines, lit a  cigarette and laid down on the dock, looking at the sky. I ask Julian if he had seen it and he said he yes he had...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started thinking &#34;was it a B-2 bomber? Could a B-2 bomber be flying that low? Why would a B-2 bomber being flying that low?? I  know B-2&#39;s are REALLY quiet, but could one fly that low and be SILENT?? No, it wasn&#39;t a B-2, when it flew over head it was a  chevron shape, didn&#39;t have the &#34;bat&#34; look with the B-2&#39;s &#34;W&#34; shaped tail end. There were no red and green navigation lights, just  the white lights across the center line or the entire mid line of the chevron shape...my mind was spinning... I went to our hotel  room, made a rum and coke and went back out to the dock. 15 - 20 minutes had passed. I laid back down on the dock, looking at  the sky, by the fishing rods smoking a cigarette. I asked the northern Florida lady, &#34;did you see that thing?&#34; that&#39;s all I could say...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t even have an intelligent conversation about it, I had to have been in shock now that I look back. I didn&#39;t even have the  sense to ask for the northern Florida ladies phone number. Why? I&#39;m an intelligent person??  Around midnight Julian and I packed it up and went back to our hotel room and we went to sleep. The next morning we had to  drive back to Cape Coral. I had some work to do with a client on Friday, and I wanted to make sure Julian was all set for Monday  morning school. On the ride home I called and told one of my best friends and told him what happened and what I had seen. He  fully believed me, but after I hung up with him, I thought I best be careful who I talk to about this...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, I had to talk to someone and get some answers, so I called the Monroe Sheriffs department, and I told them the basic  story. I asked if anyone had reported seeing an unusual object in the sky around 11pm last Wednesday night flying up the  coastline of Key Largo. The lady officer I spoke with actually took the time to ask around and check if any reports had been filed (I  didn&#39;t expect to get that much consideration with the story I had just given her) and she said no, but perhaps I should call  Homestead Air Force Base and see if the were conducting some sort of operations. So I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Homestead Air Force Base and kind of gave the gentleman on the phone the short version like &#34;I think I saw something  like a B-2 bomber flying low over Key Largo last Wednesday night...&#34; He said quite plainly and politely that Homestead did not  have any B-2&#39;s stationed there. I asked him &#34;would a B-2 be flying that low over the Island in any event?&#34; He said that he really  didn&#39;t know. So, I called the Key West Naval Air Station to see if they had tracked anything on radar that night. I ended up getting  a message machine in their &#34;public relations&#34; department. I left a message asking for someone to contact me, and that I had few  important questions to ask, but no one returned my call... So I told 3 more people over the coarse of the last 5 days. My cousin,  and 2 people at work. I then decided I need to call somebody who knows more about this stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted MUFON, and their investigator is out of town. Ann Castle, emailed me and said she would try to be in touch with me  next Monday. That&#39;s when I got back on line and found THE NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER. I recognized Mr. Davenport&#39;s  name from previous TV shows and articles I have read and decided to leave a message explaining what happened last week. and  there it is...<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the things I keep thinking about over and over was how the object moved and looked as if it were a computer enhanced  image, almost like it was an image projected onto the sky because it was so perfect. It was like watching a space ship in a movie  theater, moving perfectly soundless, never fluttering, never buffeting, moving quickly - steadily, straight, soundless, moving  almost god like. OR, I guess you could say it looked like a ship in space, how once they are moving in a direction, they continue in  that direction unless acted on by another force. That&#39;s kind of the way it make me feel every time I reveiw the film in my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seemed like nothing was pushing or pulling it, it was just momentum. Maybe that&#39;s why there wasn&#39;t any sound? Airplanes and  jets tend to dip a wing, make the air move, make some sort of sound... Every time I think of it, I get the goose bumps because  although it was completely absorbing, fantasinating and I feel privileged to have been in the right place at the right time - it was  still really very eerie...<n> <n><n> <n><n> One conclusion I have come to: If I was not looking up, I would have never had known it was there. No sound what so ever. It  would have passed right over all of our heads as we looked out on the water and never had a clue. Amazing. I have watched  every aviation program, every UFO program, every Big Foot Program etc...that has ever been broadcast on TV since I was a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always wanted to see a UFO. I have looked at the skies looking for a UFO&#39;s for years and years. I never thought I would  really see one. I cetainly never thought to be caught purely by surprize and have one fly so close to me, over head, and to be so  immense. I truely am privileged. It was the most awesome sight I have ever seen next to seeing my son being born!  In conclusion, all I can think is that I hope it&#39;s one of ours, because if it is - we have some bad-ass flying machines up there! If it  isn&#39;t one of ours, one can only speculate to the possibilities and implications... Thanks for taking the time to read this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best  regards, ((name deleted))<n>

At first we thought they were radio towers.  But then more lights started appearing with them, and then they started move.  Each Object would fade out slowly and then quickly snap back into view, but when their lights would snap back on they were typically in a very different part of the sky.  After a while other similar objects seemed to show up and then later disappear. About two minutes after they were gone two military air-crafts flew into the area.  The military planes were very unique.  They only had one single orangish light on them that would breath in and out kinda like the light on a mac-book, but it wouldn&#39;t fade all the way out.  One of the plans seemed to go invisible right before it got over our heads and it stayed invisible until it was almost over the horizon.<n>

She called me after figuring out they were not air craft. I came out and also saw the two objects. One was just below the second.  Both were very bright amber colored.  Radiating out light and floating with no sound.  The lower one started dimming and started to drop and eventually dimmed out. The upper one started to go away from us and get higher and slowly dimmed out. I called my son who finally made it out and also witnessed.  The total time was about 3 minutes. I started this report and called back out,   It’  back!  Approximately 11:08 pm.  My son had grabbed binoculars and  both he and my wife saw that it was triangular in shape and sold color.  I caught about 15 seconds of video and it went back up and away from us.  My son thought he saw a light come out! of one object and shoot downwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seen to the north west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son is 20 years old.,  My wife a house wife and I have been a manager for 20 years. Seen a lot of things but nothing like this.  I kept thinking if some one was hoaxing with a flare but it was about 1500 yards from  us if not closer and no sputtering or strobe that you would see from a flare and no wobbling if something tied to a balloon and released. I got the first on my phone video and need to review yet.<n>

Shasta, CA in an area not accessible to humans or animals in symmetrical lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were driving back to our house in Mt. Shasta, CA 96067 from Weed, CA at about 9:00PM on 08/03/11 when we got to Truck Village Drive (our exit south bound on I5) and noticed bright lights on the mountain Black Butte (a pilot cone that is almost straight up and down).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car and got out to look and realized that the lights were not coming from anything we could explain, and it was nowhere near the trail that goes up the mountain.  It was about 300 yards up from the base of the mountain in a rock valley (lava rock) that is not accessible to humans, or animals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were in a symmetrical line and very bright, and white, and not moving or flickering.  We raced home (about a 5min drive from the Truck Village Drive exit) and grabbed our binoculars.  We returned to the same spot and the lights were still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When viewing through our binoculars we could see that there was a perfectly horizontal line of about 4 lights and directly in the middle going diagonal (the line falling from left to right) were three more lights very clear.  It kind of looked like a cross of some sort.  We stayed there for a long time looking at it through the binoculars and it did not move.  We got home at about 9:45PM and called the local police and sheriff’s department to see if maybe they heard anything about those lights, if there was a lost hiker by chance, etc. but they didn’t know anything about it and acted like we were wasting their time. My boyfriend and I have lived here for 12 years, have hiked that mountain before many times and have never seen anything like it before.  We can’t explain how it got there or what it was, except that it most likely is a UFO. The lights were exactly the same size, brightness and just too symmetrical to be done by anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the other witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  He has hiked the area in question, on many occasions, and he is certain that there could not have been any kind of vehicle in the area where the lights were, given that it is a very steep, scree-covered area.

As I was reviewing the photos on my Canon G2 Powershot Digital Camera, I noticed that I may have captured the first stars of the evening with the moon.  This turned out to be a big problem though, when I returned to the deck to look for the stars, there were no stars-which should have been brighter by that time.  Next, I went to the computer to do some analysis.  What I saw on the screen was amazing.  Two disc shapes, weird squares, large moon like objects, and also a triangle-missile shaped UFO. Alan Fergason mentioned on Coast to Coast that he didn&#39;t see very much until he went to the computer to look, as was my experience, I saw nothing through the viewfinder when I snapped the shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took 12 shots of the sunset that night, some have nothing odd, others some, but on IMG_054 the ufo&#39;s are are amazingly vivid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me some time to believe what I was looking at, until I it coupled with the strange camera battery situation I experienced while taking the images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While taking these photos, my battery read close to dead, even though I was sure it was fully charged.  After reviewing the photos I checked my camera again and it then again was fully charged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something really weird is going on, I&#39;m sure of it.  I&#39;d appreciate if you would help me analyze these photos further.  I&#39;ve included the original and some blowups.  I have a PowerPoint poster too, which makes it easier to track and identify the UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: Arcata, CA 95521 Date/Time: August 3, 2011 20:52 PDT<n>

I sat outside for about 10-15 minutes. I saw this bright light come into my vision. It was as if a street light fell out of the sky at a 45 degree angle. It appeared quickly, and disappeared about 2 seconds later. I immediately got goose bumps! I decided to stay outside for a bit longer, looking around to see if I could see anything suspicious in the sky. There is a radio tower on top of a hill about 3 or 4 miles away from my home, and it has a light on top of it. I saw this flashing light beside it.. Just hovering there along side it. It was flashing colors of red, blue and white. Mostly white though. When the object would flash a different color, the light on the radio tower seemed to dim in and out. It was very strange. I watched it flash and hover for a long time. It started to slowly creep above the tower and over it. I ran inside and got my brothers as witnesses. As we were outside, we all saw anoth! er flash of light where I saw the &#34;street light&#34; fall earlier, except this time the light was a little bit smaller. I then proceed to call the UFO Hotline and explain what I had witnessed myself. We all sat outside and watched the object by the radio tower for about 30 minutes and decided to go inside. I can look outside my window now and still see the object hovering. It is creeping up toward the sky very very slowly, flashing mostly white and red now.. It is fascinating. I saw it around 1:10 maybe 1:20 AM, and i can still see it now at 2:19 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading.<n>

They were seen from south-eastern Salt Lake.  They initially looked like airplanes, but they did not blink, were much brighter, bigger, and followed each other in close formation.  They were traveling north. After 30 seconds, the lead began to appear smaller and slowly dimmed, as though it was increasing distance from the earth&#39;s surface.  The second light followed exactly the same trajectory and pattern of dimming.  An attempt was made to use a cell phone video camera to record the event, but the two lights were gone before the camera was even running.  The whole sighting lasted about two minutes.  The lights seemed to follow the same path as planes approaching the airport from the south, but appeared to be higher than planes would be found and &#34;increased distance from earth&#34; well before getting near the airport.  There was also no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses were a young married couple (20s &amp; 30s) who had just returned home from a movie. The lights were bright white and were seen from the witnesses&#39; apartment parking lot.<n>

I have a 20 min commute I from the center of town to the north end of the outer-belt (I-270) where I stay at.  The night was fairly clear, but I can&#39;t see too many stars due to light pollution.  I am in the city (obviously) but my street has no lighting what so ever.  Its kinda isolated which is why we chose to live here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming East down my street (approx. a 1/4 mi of no lights / straight shot to a T intersection) and saw an orange glow in the sky.  I would guess that from the horizon it was up approx. 30-40 degrees in the air, and was an orange ball.  I think it was between 2-7 mi away in distance from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it traveling from at least north to south, if not NW to SE (which is my better guess but not 100% sure).  I THOUGHT I might have see 1 flashing light happen as if it were an airplane, but this thing was going at a pretty decent pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I can think of that would go at its speed from that low would be a helicopter, but there was no sound, and I don&#39;t get much air traffic over my house from Port Columbus Int&#39;l.  Too fast for a smaller aircraft, and definitely not an airliner.  I saw it travel, then I drove up by a tree and lost sight of it because of the tree, and then it was gone.  I looked outside for 10 min not find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange color was about the same tint as the orange in highway lights that make everything gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think it was jupiter (or any other planet) due to the movement and that I lost sight of it.  But I&#39;m not ruling out the thought.  Maybe someone knows where certain planets are at this time of year and specifically for that date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know of any aircraft that have that orange tint to their headlights.  I&#39;ve seen the normal white, and recently saw an airplane w/ LED (like the obnoxious head lights that pure white).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This object was decending as it moved along. There were no lights and it was a greyish color.  I was able to see it because the city lights illuminated it to a certain degree, from below. I lost sight of it when it was low to the ground and a few miles away. I was confused as to what that was. At first I thought it was a white owl flying late to nest, when I concluded it had no wings. Guessing it&#39;s altitude as it passed overhead, 1,500 feet.  Size, possibly 100 feet long and it seemed to be going at a few hundred mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:45pm another object went from west to the east at approximately the Lomita and Palos Verdes border, at approximately 3000 feet and 500 mph, silently. Lit from below from the city lights, I could see the shape was a flying wing. This object must have been about half a mile wide.  It looked top heavy because it was higher top to bottom than it was long, from front to back.  The shape of the back side was irregular.  There were shapes such as tubes and other shapes.  There were 5 dim lights on the underside, shining a yellowish white light.  I saw no windows or beings of any kind. The objects weren&#39;t doing anything except as I described, flying straight and/or descending.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didn&#39;t move much faster than a bird would fly id say.

The night was clear, no haze and normal air traffic was abundant.  I saw numerous &#34;regular&#34; satellites passing overhead as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2204 hours I noticed a light appear about 45 degrees above the horizon to the south.  At first, I thought it was an iridium satellite, as it grew in intensity and size to a brilliant yellowish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 to 2 seconds later, a second object appeared behind the first, following the exact path of the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were separated by a space which was approximately the width of my thumb at arms&#39; length.  The second object got increasingly brighter, surpassing the brilliance of the first by a small margin.  Unlike iridium satellites, these two objects remained at peak illumination for maybe 5 to 10 seconds before fading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression is that the objects were self-illuminated and not reflecting the Sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects seemed to veer slightly to the northwest as they passed overhead.  Both objects faded out one after the other and could not be seen anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were no iridium satellites or other man made objects in the vicinity at the time of my sighting.<n>

The object appeared to be aflame and seemed to move like a small aircraft except there was no sound it look like a rotating spherical object as well. It was an overcast night and the object either went under the clouds or faded out.  About two minutes later another glowing object appeared and did the exact same thing.  I stood out and watched for about a half an hour as these objects kept traveling in the same direction, some solo, some in pairs, some in groups of three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went up and had my wife and her sister and my nephew come out and see.  We stood and watched the objects for another half hour continue to pulsate and fly across the sky.

We were on the Lake Huron beach in Greenbush Michigan looking north.  The globes rose from the horizon either one at a time or in groups of two to three.  As they rose, they travelled to the east over the lake toward Canada.  Eventually they disappeared into the night sky.  It was certainly an orchestrated maneuver of some sort from an alien society - or the U.S. Air Force was secretely invading the hostile country of Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a very close planet, but I knew that I had never seen one in that position in the night sky.   We sat outside to watch it for approximately 10 minutes, until it faded and finally went out, still in the same place it had been the entire time.  It was as if a circle of orange light was beaming around the circular object, approximately 17,000 ft. in the sky.  It also had a small fire coming out of it at times, toward the end of the ten minutes.  I thought it could be a flare, which I&#39;ve heard of but never witnessed, but the craft was stationary in the sky the entire time, and quite large and unusual.  It is not like any military or civilian aircraft either of us had ever seen.  Slowly the light on the craft began to lessen as it went around, and then it extinguished entirely.  There was no sound that we detected.  It! was approximately 20 miles from our location.<n>

The light grew rapidly into a brilliantly bright white rectangle and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was happening I called my family outside while I described the sighting, but by the time they arrived outside it had completely vanished.  The entire event took no more than 5 to 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I extended my arm in a &#34;Babe Ruth calling the shot&#34; fashion, the object appeared as a pin prick and grew to about one inch long strip approximately 1/4 inch wide in comparison to end of my extended arm.

Funny part is it didn’t  show up on cell phone camera when ((name deleted)) tried to take a picture of it (I was driving)  Was triangle, with three white lights one on each corner that and a solid red light in center of bottom I will do my best to draw it up. After hovering it moved slowly toward Hickory Park in Owego, then took off very fast moving south toward Pennsylvania .  Both the wife and I saw it, she first noticed it as I was driving, when we first seen it the entire bottom was lit up in white light.It was high up, but when I got out of the car, I could see it was triangle shape on bottom, due to the light pattern that gave some dimension, the color appeared to be a charcoal brown, but as far as size. If I had to guess with distance and size in our view, I would guess it to be at-least 500 foot from one light to the other to the n! ext,  It was much closer than the 747&#39;s fly in the area, and I could see more detail on it than the planes that fly around here too, even with it being dark. At first it was just a bright line of light (viewed from Rte 434 in front of NYS Police barracks in Owego, then as we moved north (toward the light) the dimensions became more apparent.  Also made no sound.<n>

8/2/11 02:00|Memphis|TN|Cylinder|6-7 mins|VERY LOW OBJECT w/ LIGHTS, sounded like helicopter, but WAS NOT! ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  One of several.  PD))|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82886.html|621|ndxe201108| VERY LOW OBJECT w/ LIGHTS, sounded like helicopter, but WAS NOT! Circled several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening, about 2:00am CDT, I was sitting on the couch watching TV when I heard what sounded like a helicopter circling the building really low.  I figured it was a helicopter going to the local hospital and dismissed it as not a big deal.  Then, I was still sitting there and heard it come back around again.  I turned off the window unit air conditioner to see if I could hear it better.  It was close.  I got up, opened the balcony door and looked outside and there was a dark cylindar-outline object with 2 lights on the rear, a red and a green one.  The red one was blinking, I think.  One of them was blinking.  There was also a spotlight on the front of the object.  The object also looked to have dark circles on the cylinder part that were just part of the craft itself, they were not lit up and hardly visible.  I screamed bloody murder to my girlfriend to wake up and to see what I was seeing.  She started to brush it off and was sleeping.  About that time! , I heard the sound of it fading back in towards me again.  Here it came again!  She got up this time and witnessed what I described above.  It was NOT a helicopter.  I thought it was when I heard it and even thought it still could have been after seeing it the first time because everything was so dark that I wanted to be really sure, but no, it was not a helicopter.  It was flying just as low as one though and when I first saw it, the cylinder dark part of it was facing slighting downwards, like it was looking for someone or something.  My girlfriend went back to bed, upset that she had to get up in a few hours, otherwise, I know she would not have wanted to miss the rest of this.  I stood there for a few seconds after it flew over that time and here it came again.  This time I knew it would.  I was excited and also kind of scared.  I had no idea what it was really doing, but it was astonishing to be so close to something that I could tell was not man-made.  When it came a! round this time, it started heading directly West, right towar! ds me, r ight towards my balcony door.  That&#39;s when I saw it shift it&#39;s light and knew that it did, in fact, have control over it&#39;s headlight/spotlight.  It never pointed the light directly into my apartment, but it pointed it right over me and I know that whatever was inside of the object definitely, without a doubt, saw me.  I was freaked out at this point because I have heard stories and read things about abductions and I was just not ready at this time, if this is what was planned.  So, I freaked out a little bit.  The object was flying directly over the 3-story leasing house next door that is only about 15 feet away from my balcony.  There is only a small space in between my building and the leasing office (it&#39;s a 3-story brick house).  The house has a chimney about 10 feet tall with an old antenna coming off of it that&#39;s about another 3 feet.  The object flew RIGHT ABOVE the antenna.  I&#39;m telling you this object was no more than 15 feet above my head.  At this angle, it appeare! d &#34;wider&#34; or &#34;fatter&#34; more like a soda can, than it had from seeing it from the side.  I had grabbed a notebook and pen during all this and had began making sketches of it and I can see it in my mind, but was finding it hard to draw it on paper.  I have the sketches and am about to try to draw them in Paint or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been seeing objects for weeks and have been making reports here and have contacted MUFON on a local level here to investigate.  They are usually silver cigar/cylinder shaped and make no sound and appear to glide across the sky, seeming to appear out of nowhere.  We have witnessed them traveling slightly faster and higher than airplanes with a contrail of 2 lines that runs very close together and parallel and we have seen them fly slower than airplanes, at the same higher altitude with no contrails or sound whatsoever.  Recently, we have seen them appear, flying faster than airplanes with the &#34;double contrail&#34; then slow down, and have ZERO contrail and still no sound.  All of these are cigar-shaped and I have emailed you guys a picture I drew this last week or so of one of these objects and what I have seen on them that sometimes looks like a &#34;fin&#34; or a &#34;straw&#34; type of object stemming from the cylinder itself.  They are usually so high it&#39;s hard to make out what&#39;s on ! the object.  We have also noticed when it starts to get dark around 8:25pm, these same objects have a visible blinking red light on the top of them, sometimes in the middle of the cylinder and we have also seen them towards the tail end.  Tonight, we wanted to see if we could see them after dark, so we went out around 10pm and observed several of these objects in the sky at the same time... 2 or 3 sharing the sky at the same time within our field of view (which is limited from our balcony because of the house next door and trees across the street and we absolutely cannot see West or North at all).  These objects blinked erracticly like red/red/white/red/red/red/white/white/red/white/red/red/red, flashing brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also want to add after the close encounter highlight event of this evening/morning, I did actually see a REAL helicopter through the window, with the door closed, and was actually unable to hear it at all whatsoever.  To me, this is proof that this other object was even louder than a normal helicopter and certainly much lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last, but not least, this may be the weirdest part in all of this, but hopefully you guys know how often we see this things now.  Well, sometimes when we are out watching them, I kind of say to them (the objects) that I wish they would come closer or lower so that we can view them.  I know this is going to sound really, really crazy, but it almost like this object wanted us to see it.  I did not witness anyone outside during this commotion of this craft, nor did I hear or see anybody afterwards.  It is like a desert town outside.  It is eerily calm and quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also want to add, although I do not fully know its significance, that last week sometime (not sure of the day) around 1 AM, I was sitting up by myself watching TV while my girlfriend was asleep.  I heard a very loud and very close BANG! right outside my window.  I then saw a flash of light right after it happened.  It was so sudden, so unexpected, so immediately unexplainable as anything natural at all, that my heart sank to my stomach and it began pounding.  I was so scared, I was literally frozen and did not know what to do.  Once I calmed down, I looked outside and decided that maybe somebody had busted a lightbulb out or something like that, but that doesn&#39;t even make sense either.  It was much louder than that and certainly on my level (the 2nd floor) and close enough that my neighbor lady on my level would have heard it and the guy that lives below her.  It was still after that.  No sound, nothing.  I told my girlfriend about it the next day and there was nothing out! side at all to remotely explain the sound.  Nothing was broken.  There were no large holes in anything.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Until last night, around the same time I heard the noise before, around 1:20am, there was a loud BANG! boom, boom. then a rumble that lasted for a couple seconds.  This was NOT lightning.  It was not thunder.  It was not storming.  There were no rain clouds.  There was nobody outside.  Everything was still.  This scared the crap out of my girlfriend and it was almost like I didn&#39;t even flinch this time, even though it sounded like a shotgun went off outside my window and not even both of our windows, only one window.  That&#39;s how localized this sound was.  So, this evening before I heard the helicopter sound, I had looked at the clock at around 1:50am and decided that I guess we weren&#39;t going to hear that noise again tonight.  We had agreed to pay attention to the time in case it happens again (not that you wouldn&#39;t hear it), but she went to ! bed and I was still up and didn&#39;t hear anything.  It wasn&#39;t ev! en 10 mi nutes later when the helicopter noise began.  I hope you guys can make some sense of all of this.  I&#39;m just along for the ride here, apparently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  One of several from the same source.  PD))<n>

I was admiring the stars when one star got my attention.  It seemed to be moving. It was very high up – higher than any airplane that flies over my house. It was not in the normal flight path of the aircraft that fly over my house.  I was watching this “star” and then all of a sudden the light went out.  I could still see a non-blinking faint red light as the object transited the sky.  I was able to follow it until it disappeared behind a bank of clouds. It was very hard to see but the red light was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location in the sky: it was in the north just west of the dipper that is directly over my house this time of year.  It moved from north to southwest.  From my unaided sight perspective it was about 12 inches west of the handle of the dipper.  I could hear no sort of engine noise because it was so high up.<n>

It swooped down into the atmosphere than starting flying up to the right in such a weird way, it was bobbing up and down as it was flying away. I have never seen anything fly like that. It was so high up nd appeared to move so fast.  It traveled back up so high it disappeared into the atmosphere. It was as if the craft was hitching a ride on the meteor then separated from it right as it entered out Earth. The meteor appeared then not even a second later this craft came swooping right where the meteor had came down from.  The flight was so weird i cant describe it good enough. Thats really what gave me chills was how it flew.  How it was bobbing up and down as it flew away, up and down up and down as its flying so quickly.  I called the local police tha! t night and left a report on a few ufo websites. I never got any replies.  I wish i would have found this website sooner, i got a reply right away from you guys.

We tared at it for a minute and then it took off from south west and proceded toward the north west.  There were no flashing lights on it like an airplane has, it moved in a straight line thru the sky.  It stoppd abrupty for a few seconds, then went north, stopped again and then stopped again.  It then took off in the north east direction again.  This object went at least twenty five miles and two counties in less than three minutes, it then stopped again and stayed there for at least a half hour.  The sky was dark and it was an hour and a half before the sun was to rise.  There was no planes in the sky because our airports close from midnight until six am.  The five of us were speachless.

It was just hovering and moving in up and down, side to side motion.  We then noticed that there were planes that were coming around and then circling the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe 20 minutes a second and third one appeared, however they left just as quickly as they had came. There were also beams of light that kept flying overhead. Too many to be shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 2:00 am, there was a big beam of light that fell from the sky then became very large and turned bright green with a ring around it right above the tree line.  Then it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I said to each other we had both had times that we could say “might have been ufo’s” but this was most defiantly the clearest it has ever been to seeing such an event that we could not move from where we stood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the object that had been hovering disappeared behind the trees over a field  where there is a river that runs through our city.  And there was no more activity of any planes or anything after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Heads and eyes towards the skies, I noticed an orange light in the western direction. I mistook it as a planet because it was a solid light... and not blinking... at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour passes by, and that light has moved a little down towards the horizon... and now is blinking between white and red... like a star would... Except its rocking back and forth in a horizontal pattern... I got the attention of a friend and asked for a second opinion... he agreed that it was indeed rocking back and forth VERY subtle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another 30 minutes goes by... and that light has now traveled down towards the horizon RIGHT above the trees. It has moved FAR too fast to be a star or planet... and is still rocking back and forth... it got the attention of the rest of the people around us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decide to try and communicate... we flash the LED flash on the back of an iPhone in a strobe pattern... and the light starts to move back and forth faster... until it just goes out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was my first UFO sighting. Please tell me if this is a mistake...<n>

It was a fiery orange/yellow globe hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I had thought that perhaps it was a plane, because it had just suddenly appeared.  Then I thought it could not be a plane, because the object was stationary for a minute or so and it was huge.  Big enough that when I pointed it out to the boys they thought it was the moon!  We watched it and I noticed it did not change size or shape, as I would have seen or expected from other planes in the sky. Typically the lights grow smaller or larger as it comes closer or further away.  This was very different. It stayed hovering in the sky fixed in that one spot.  The boys were looking for an explanation as to what it could be, I had none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after a few moments of staring at the object it suddenly vanished, then reappeared further away in the same area.  It was smaller and still glowing in the distance.  Seconds later it vanished again and instantly reappeared moving to the right. I was stunned and the boys were frightened.  It then appeared as two lights in what seemed like a strange bar like object with curved edges still moving to the right.  It vanished from sight as it passed behind the trees in the distance.  I kept looking to the other side of the trees expecting to see it appear on the other side again trying to reason that it was a plane.  We watched for what seemed like forever.  It never returned.  I have yet to figure out what it could have been.  It was scary to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was so bright and so large I expected to see it in the news this morning.  I have yet to find anything on the matter.  I found it so strange I was compelled to report to some one and found this sight.  I hope perhaps this can provide me with an explanation as to what that object could have been.<n>
8/1/11 00:30|Clinton|WA|Unknown|1 Min|Object with three lights hovering just above trees.|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82916.html|640|ndxe201108| Object with three lights hovering just above trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work second shift as an Aerospace Engineer.  I had been commuting on my motorcycle, and as I pulled alongside the driveway at around 12:30 AM I noticed what appeared to be the navigation lighting of a helicopter in the low horizon (approx. Latitude 47.97, Longitude -122.37).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home in Clinton, WA on the remote south end of Whidbey Island is located in a cul-de-sac and there was no other vehicular traffic at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft did not seem to move, hovering as a helicopter would and not wavering. I shut my motorcycle off to listen for the sound of an engine from the craft but heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my estimation the craft was about 100-200 yards away from where I stood and 30 degrees in the sky, 50-80 feet above the trees surrounding the neighborhood which are around 120 feet tall.  It had two pure white lights which shone solidly and a third light to form a triangular pattern which was red, blinking on and off regularly about every second, and about one-and-a-half times the intensity of the two white lights.  By my calculation I gauged the total length to be 35-50 feet and the width about 25-30 feet, assuming the lights were positioned toward the extremities of the structure since it was too dark to make out any silhouette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft remained in the same position for approximately twenty seconds, then moved in a smooth South-to-West arc keeping a constant speed which I would guess to be about 40 miles per hour, maintaining a constant altitude and remaining completely level when making the turn.  It was at this time, when the craft was moving away from me that I noticed the sound of some type of engine.  It was a regular, single pitch drone and not very loud, somewhat like an ultralight engine but not fluctuating at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The air vehicle continued out of sight as it disappeared behind the trees and continued West.<n>

Then suddenly it shot straight up, maybe five hundred feet, faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  After that it was stationary for about thirty seconds then it flashed brightly and disappeared.  There was no sound but it was quite far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I&#39;ve seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it is but it was scary and I don&#39;t need to see it again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
