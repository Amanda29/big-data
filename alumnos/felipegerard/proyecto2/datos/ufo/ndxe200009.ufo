Get binoculars, ex husband looks and says, Damn these binoculars work good. There&#39;s blue and red flashing lights coming from it.&#34; I looked and saw it to be a round shaped white light with flashing Blue light on the left side of object and red on the other.  Amazing to see, but could only see the distinct light through binocs, otherwise looked like a slowly moving satellite or star.  I look back about 2 -3 mins later, but the flashing lights were gone, now there was only a single red light sitting on top of the object!  Shocking and exciting to see!  I looked again 2 mins later, no red or blue lights at all and the shape of the white light had changed entirely.  For one it was not horizontal anymore, it was more vertical and now it was shaped like a long hotdog and pointed on an incline towards the heavens!  Weird, it was moving more and more away into space slowly and our eyes were tired.  I think it is a satellite, My ex husb. says satellites don&#39;t have blue lights on them or change shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know for certain what the witnesses observed, but it is reminiscent of a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.  They always appear to change color, change shape, and to move slightly, as the witness has described.  No other reports from San Antonio for this date.  PD))<n>

An object appeared in the North sky that seemed to be traveling very quickly in an arc-like motion towards the South East. I had my binoculars (16/32)with me and quickly picked them up to view the object. I saw two colored spheres - one had a bluish tint and the other had a reddish tint - both with a sort of glowing haze about them. The were traveling in a zig-zag fashion in a way that I can only describe as &#34;playful&#34;. I followed them across the sky for about 20 seconds while calling my mother to come outside. When she arrived, I pointed out the direction and she was also able to capture them in a pair of binoculars (4/30). We followed them for about 15 more seconds until they seemed to disappear just as quickly as they appeared. There was absolutely no sound associated with the objects.<n>

After doing so I turned to walk back to my home, when I noticed something in the sky. I was facing north with the three spheres of light moving from east to north-west while maintaining an even formation. I found it quite disturbing as there was no noise what so ever. I waited for the delayed sonic boom, nothing. Also, the objects movement gave an impression of bobbing just slightly.

They replied what is that? I only said call it ufo&#39;s for now I don&#39;t think they&#39;re flares. The Van Nuys Airport is in the opposite direction. The most compelling thing was before they vanished, they moved and formed a star constellation the Big Dipper and winked out a few at a time. This happen in just 2 to 3 minutes. I left and later came back with my cam corder and there was a helicopter circling the area at a low altitude. I don&#39;t know if it was police or military, but I got it(helicopter) on video.

Without notice, they broke from formation and formed another formation and remained stationary in the sky for about thirty seconds.  One by one, the red lights disappeared, as if moving away at a high rate of speed, not across the sky, but outward, to space I presume.  The objects seemed to be bigger at the bottoms than the tops.  About twenty seconds later, a red object reemerged where the others had disappeared, along with a bright orange object, larger than the red ones, but of a similar shape.  The bright orange object illuminated the sky around it, with a visible vapor trail, and descended in altitude, in comparison with the other red object.  As the orange object descended, it got brighter, and for a brief moment, the sky around it grew very bright, similar to the glow of a distant wildfire. The orange object descended quickly until it went below the tree line, and the red object, like the other red objects before it, disappeared.

As it was fading we called our friend to come outside.  Before she came outside it had disappeared for approximately 1 minute and reappeared in the sky.  This time there was a white light, which started off small and grew bigger.  There was also a red light next to the white light on the right side.  The last 2 lights we saw in the sky were there for approimately 1 minute and disappeared.

They moved with a and stopped like nothing any of us had ever seen...very smooth and seemed to stop on a dime with no correction for gravity.  One of them then faded away, followed by another, and then the remaining three faded away together.

My son said Dad at least 3 quick times,(my son is 23) to draw my attention to the object that had lighted up south of our location. I turned around very quickley to see a very bright white/blue object of great size traveling at a speed that my son and I agreed would see the object fall to earth very soon ( in fact I kept looking to see a mushroom cloud rise above the hills to our west) there was no cloud nor any sound at all. The object appeared to me to be almost square in size, lile a cube, picture a square moving left to right, now cut into fourths, remove the lower left square and slide it to the left and down to leave a equal gap you&#39;ll see a 7, with a square following at the same speed. The object was bright enough to light the lake and the hills around us, it&#39;s colors were like a cutting tourch used for cutting steel (in fact the trailing sparks were brighter than steel being cut by a cutting tourch, the sparks trailed the object by about three times its size. The size of the object was hard to figure, but with the skyline of the city &amp; lights to guage, the object was huge, I would say more that a a mile or two across or cubed.  It was approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the south horizon, and was not traveling at the speed of a metorite, it was as a slower astroid would travel. the direction was east to west, in fact I was thinking to myself that california would now have another disaster to bare. there was no sound or vibrations, there was no blinking lights, there was only white, blue and some orange hues in the short tail, the object only went in a straight line, no turns, but almost a failing arc to the west (thus, our thinking that it would fall in west Arizona or eastern California. The exact time is hard for us to pin down, we were with out watches, We are thinking that with the sundown not too far behind and our best guessing it was around 8 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report for this time period.

Falling at a very fast speed at an angle that made us believe this was an asteroid or satellite falling through the atmosphere. We did not think this object to be anything but a natural occurance. The object was very large with a tail of flames, blue and white, with the blue color around the flames tail. The flame tail expired as it crossed lower into the Western sky. Again, this path convinced me it was a large object crashing throuth the atmosphere. I waited to hear a sound when I thought it would have landed, but there was none. I accessed your web site after I found no mention of this incident in the local newspaper or televised news reports. I wanted to confirm the identity of our sighting and was suprised to find there is no &#34;official&#34; word on it&#39;s identity. The size &amp; brightness of the object made me assume everyone out of doors that night had seen it.

It didn&#39;t display any FAA lighting. I could easily judge it&#39;s relative size. This object was displaying only a dim gray colored light and it moved quickly from northeast to the Southwest.  It covered the sky from where we first saw it to the horizon in less then 15 seconds. I observed several &#34;normal&#34; aircraft in the area at the time of my sighting, including a police helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Mr. Jim Hickman, noted UFO investigator from Oklahoma, for submitting this report.

It was the end of summer, beginning of fall, I remember, around the year 2000.  I was tempted to report the incident but was too baffled as to who to tell and who would believe me, as it occurred so fast, but the incident has always stuck in my mind.  I found this web site and realized other people did report the incident.  Anyway, my neighbor and I noticed 4 saucers in the sky to the west above the SFV, over Canoga Park, near the Pacific Ocean.  The clouds were streak like that evening and the red sunset was beautiful in the sky.  At around 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. (unfortunately not sure of the exact time) but right as the sun was setting that year, we noticed 4 aircraft with colored lights around each of them.  The aircraft were flying in uniform formation, all somewhat close to one another.  I think the lights were blue, orange, red and yellow (not sure how many colors I saw).  Anyway, the 4 aircraft hovered down ! for a short period of time (not sure how far down to earth or how large they were as they were miles above earth)and then as if by mental telepathy they knew we spotted them as we were commenting on them to one another.  Then, the 4 aircraft stopped, changed course and with a fast trajectory zipped into some sort of hyperspeed out of eyesight and were no where to be found.  We have never seen airplanes accomplish such speeds, trajectory or disappear so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When going west to east it was rotating in a clockwise direction and on returning west was rotating anticlockwise.  Above the lower cloud level it was distorted and out of the cloud it was sharp in deffinition as to the lights.  All lights were white but defused in the clouded area.  Slightly north of my location but on its easterly extent it appeared to be almost over the top of my house. This was observed by myself, my wife and one guest leaving and another arriving.  At first glance I passed it off as the arora borealis, but the rotation and rythmic arc was not consistent with this. I tried to make sence of it but the item appeared to be above cloud level and not below it. I tried to think maybe it was a laser light display, but the number of people that may have that equipment in this town I think would be (0) zero.  Also it apeared to be above the cloud not under the cloud cover. This was observed for 30 minutes continuosly at first, then intermitently there after. Altitude could not be established but it had to be large (over two miles)diameter. I remember from the bible a wheel inside of a wheel and that came to mind. This was on Rosh Hashana accoring to the local radio station but I am not religous.<n>
9/29/00 19:40|Chandler|AZ|Fireball|12 Sec|Small EmeraldGreen light moving at approximately 5-8 MPH in a straight line-Emitted two or three White flashes  to rear|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14344.html|20|ndxe200009| Small EmeraldGreen light moving at approximately 5-8 MPH in a straight line-Emitted two or three White flashes  to rear<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Small Fireball appeared from over the top of my neighbors home ( 2 Story )  The Object apppeared to be similar in size to a bottle rocket but the (flame ?) was green and it went in a straight line.   The line was paralel with the ground and moving about 5-8 miles per hour.   It emitted two or three white light flashes from the rear after the first 30 feet of the sighting and then continued on between two houses at the same rate of speed.  My wife ((name deleted)) age 58, my grandson ((name deleted)) 4 3/4 Yrs. old Myself (((name deleted)) age 58, and one of our new nieghbors approxmmately 34 yrs old saw it.  The neighbor immediately said it reminded her of one of the Ufo Show sightings that she had once seen.  FYI   Two years ago my wife and I saw an object similar in color and size move from above our SUV Front window down across the hood ( similar to a plane coming down for a quick landing )and then dissapeared at eye level.  (It was Also a Small green light)<n>

I was staring up at the sky (there were no clouds today) and noticed what I first thought was an airplane (because it was metallic and reflecting light) that was flying so high it looked like a little ball.  It was moving in a straight line, much like an airplane would.  Then, I noticed another one, same size, same description, but flying towards the first object.  I thought maybe they were planes flying at different altitudes, because it looked as though they were going to have a head-on collision.  I became anxious as I thought I was going to watch a plane wreck mid-air, but just as they were going to hit, they VERY QUICKLY (much faster than an airplane ever could) spun off in opposite circular directions.  They danced around each other in circles, occasionally disappearing then reappearing.  The most I saw at one time were 4.  Then, and actual airplane passed through my area of vision (flying much lower than the objects) and as it did, the objects disappeared totally.  After the plane had been gone for about a minute, one reappeared and continued to dance around, and another appeared.  Sometimes there were two, and sometimes one. During the course of this, I stood up to observe, and sat down, and laid back down, just to make sure I wasn&#39;t contorting my body in a way that was effecting my vision.  But, these objects were clearly in focus, not just light spots created by poor sight. Finally, I decided I had seen enough and wanted to leave.  I&#39;m not one to make up stories (as most people probably say), and though I believe there is something out there, I NEVER thought I&#39;d ever see anything like this.  There was no other explanation for what I saw today.  About two minutes after I left, I developed a very bad inner ear ache that lasted about a half hour...may be unrelated, but just thought I&#39;d mention it.<n>

The light, which was only slightly dimmer than one of the stars in the Belt of Orion, at first was traveling very fast in a straight line toward the north.  It then abruptly turned westerly, then northerly, then westerly again and continued these erratic manoeuvers.  After watching the light for a minute or two, I went inside and asked my wife to view the light.  Although the sky was clear, after about five minutes of watchint the light, it faded from view, then reappeared and, and finally disppeared altogether, not to be seen again. Having spent many years as a journalist, I have observed many different types of phenomena, both natural and man-made.  Because of the apparent altitude of this light, its movement, its speed and its lack of any characteristics common to an aircraft or weather balloon (there were no anti-collision lights, for example, and its speed was much to great), I find it hard to believe it can easily be explained.<n>

One was traveling from NW to SE, and the other, SE to NW. They were traveling very fast,which took only 5 min. to go from Zenith to horizon area of the sky. They appeared to be approx. 2 inches apart when they crossed paths with each other. I followed them with binoculars till out of my view.<n>

The object was between Queen of the Valley Hospital and Salvador Ave, just east of North Jefferson St.  At first I thought it was a planet.  I stopped at a stop sign and observed it hovering for about 3 minutes and the light simply faded out.  It was directly over a residential area.  It reappeared a little ways off from where I originally saw it.  Then it started to move and faded away as it moved north west.  There was no sound.<n>

Then they stayed in view for approx. 10 seconds and all together vanished at once. We saw the trail first it seems, before we ever saw the objects. There was another incident a couple of years ago that happened in Sargo, Kentucky that I would like to talk about if contacted.<n>

She saw a huge fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove home at the same time in seperate cars, something caught my eye so I looked up in the sky and saw 3 white/grey objects seem to be separting from a larger object with maybe smoke around them perhaps.  They appeared to be glowing or burning hot some, the smoke or water vapor around them was lit up some.  When I pulled in the driveway I saw her outside looking up and she ran up to my car and told me she saw a huge fireball (yellow/white) in the sky fly over head, the biggest one she has ever seen, but did not see what happened later due to someone tailgating while pulling in.  She said fireball object was maybe slightly smaller than her hand at arms length.  It was in the Belleville News Democrat 09/30/00, they got responses from Scott Air Force Base (said they know nothing and that a good number of people have called them about this), the tracking center in CO (said no known objects), etc. Must have been a big rock from space coming in over our heads...<n>

I was in Donner Hall. Outside the window was a parking lot and to the left of that was a grass and a bench under a tree. I went outside and layed down on the bench so my feets were towards the building. It was nice. I was staring up through the tree branches (no leaves). From my view an orange clowing like thing came from the left. I saw it and fallowed it through the tree branches wondering what it was. It came out into the clear and it looked like a saucer, just like I see in the movies sort of and it was glowing orange, but it was clear enough to make out and see little ovals that might&#39;ve been windows. It was a saucer bottom and a little hump in the middle (the way people say they usually look). There was only one and I was the only one that saw this I&#39;m pretty sure. Suddenly as t continued going it did a spiral manuver (flying in a spiral) and disappeared from my sight behind the building (I don&#39;t mean it landed). It took me a few minutes to finally realize what I saw. But I DID see it. I told my now ex-girlfriend and my........about it. My girlffriend believed me of course (they believe you all the time), but my......didn&#39;t quite believe me. I had some exams that week and I&#39;m attention starved and stuff like that. He tried to convince me that those were the reasons I saw what I saw. In the first place, I wasn&#39;t stressed at all. I had a lot on my mind and I did not do this for attention. No way. I can&#39;t be 100% sure of what I saw, but I god a damn good look and I saw and didn&#39;t imagine it. You don&#39;t imagine a glowing orange thing flying over you in the shape of a UFO. I didn&#39;t see any scifi movies or anything. It came out of the blue and wasn&#39;t even thinking of anythig realated. Sorry this is a late report, but better late than never. I feel kind of special that I saw a UFO.<n>
9/28/00 20:30|Morristown|TN|Triangle|8 minutes|Huge, triangular craft with six white rectangular lights on the bottom witnessed in  EastTennessee|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14588.html|29|ndxe200009| Huge, triangular craft with six white rectangular lights on the bottom witnessed in  EastTennessee<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:30, three friends and myself observed a large white light in the distance, that appeared to be rising upwards. After watching it we determined it was not rising upwards, but coming toward us. We then noticed a flashing red light approached the craft at the 1 o&#39;clock position, and remained beside it for a moment, before moving ahead of the craft at about the 7 o&#39;clock position. It steadily came toward us and we noticed that the small flashing red light in front of the craft appeared to be a jet, and the large craft was following it.  As it began to move above us, we no longer saw the one large white light we had seen before, but we saw six fairly large white lights on the bottom of the craft.  These lights were rectangular in shape, and looked very similar to flourescent lighting fixtures you would find in a garage or kitchen.  The larger craft stayed very close behind the jet (obviously following its&#39; flight pattern), but made no noise whatsoever.  The sound from the jet&#39;s engine was all that could be heard.  It was moving much too fast to be any type of balloon, or anything like that.  As it got directly over us, we could make out a somewhat triangular outline, and saw what appeared to be a semi-circular shaft coming down from between the six rectangular lights.  We wondered amongst ourselves if this could be some sort of secret military plane, and we noticed that the large craft had no flashing lights, only the six lights on the underside.  This craft was extremely large and absolutely dwarfed the jet it was following.  We watched the flight pattern as it seemed to be going back from where it came from.  The flight pattern was almost a complete circle!  We don&#39;t have any idea what we saw, but we wish someone has witnessed something similar, and will be able to provide a clue or two for us.<n>

The object was visible through the windshield of my car as I approached the crest of the hill from the north on Highway 89. When I drove under the viaduct I slowed my automobile to about 20 mph, and was directly underneath the apparently hovering object. This object appeared to have a similar size to a that of a small conventional aircraft. The object seemed to have an altitude of about 150-200 feet. As I looked at the hovering, strobe-lit object from out the window of my moving vehicle, it appeared to have a solid black body in the shape of an equilateral triangle. As I pulled to the side of the road and brought my automobile around to face the object, it began to move north. Its pace was slightly faster than that of the northbound traffic below it, on Highway 89. Soon it was out of range as it continued on a northern course.<n>

The white jet simply disappeared from my view in blue skies just to the north of the jet trail it had just passed through.I was video taping the activity of the jets leaving trails that day because I was so alarmed to see the numerous jet activity in our area and the trails being left by them flying in our area. I replayed the portion of video that the white jet was seen to disappear in blue skies during the taping. I could not determine that it was visible in the video, only a comment made by me on the portion of video it should have been visible. I made a comment about the fact that white jets seem to be involved in this activity that are oddly disappearing from sight in blue skies.I also have 35mm photos of the trails left that day.<n>

My bedroom faces the lake.   I woke up at 1:00 AM and looked out my window and saw a disc shaped craft traveling from west to east . As it was traveling east, it made a sharp turn to the north.  Two other craft were behind it , and followed the same path.  There was a slight cloud cover, but you  could see the  domes on top of the discs. The crafts had a light greenish hue to them.  Two years ago, my wife and I both saw a spacecraft come almost directly over our car.  It was the same disc shape, but had lights around the sides of the disc and 3 white lights underneath the craft. It was traveling from a northwest to a southeast direction,  I know you just wanted one occurance, but I felt  you should know this too.<n>

As I turned to look up, the double AA size mini mag flashlight I was using scanned across the corner of a dark triangular object floating directly above us  and our camp trailer.  The object was COMPLETELY SILENT, no noise at all!  I started yelling  HOLY S--T!, HOLY S--T!, HOLY S--T!, YOU GUYS HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS!  I was extremely upset and shaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was running (stumbling)  to the trailer my brother and another party member came running out the door.   I did not take my eyes off of this object.  As my light moved across the corner of the triangle, I could see rounded dark edges and the flat bottom.  The bottom had a texture that looked like suede leather and had a gold-grey color to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light shined on the object it &#34;throttled up&#34; with a very deep low sound of intense power, increasing in intensity slightly and began to float straight up and then move forward(?) up a steep narrow canyon that goes from 6700 ft to 9800 ft. The object moved up the canyon very slowly like a hockey puck sliding on ice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and the other party member had time to look up at the object just as it started to move forward then they both ran to the pickup and grabbed their 10 x 42 Ziess binoculars and continued to watch the object until it was out of sight.  As the object began to move forward the sound stopped and movement continued with complete silence.  This object was only about 200 feet straight  above us when first spotted, about 300 to 400 feet above us when it started to move  forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it &#34;throttled up,&#34; three lights, one on each corner of the triangle came on.  Each one of these was about ten feet in diameter and glowed like a dim dome light.  Another &#34;light&#34; in the center was about 20 feet in diameter and protuded below the bottom (!) about 8 feet and was deep red in color and pulsed about once a second.  The outline of the object had a slight light halo around it.  None of the lights illuminated anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was a perfect triangle with radius corners and radius edges. The size was enormous with every detail seemingly in perfect proportion. Each side of the triangle would be approximately 250 feet long.  The thickness of the body looked to be about 30 feet.  Other dark circles in a symetrical &#34;design&#34; were slightly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear, lots of stars, no wind.  There was no smell, no feeling of blowing, prop wash or thrust of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My bother and I are building contractors and like to think we are normal, educated, business people. The third witness is a successful stone mason contractor.  We all have excellent eyesight.  This was also a &#34;dry&#34; camp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this exceded the limits of our known comprehension we felt priviliged to have witnessed this most incredible piece of equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We talked at length with two of the witnesses, and we find them to be serious-minded individuals.  Our impression is that the report is genuine, a suspicion supported by the fact that the witnesses reported the event to several government offices.  We are quite impressed with the report.  We will attempt to investigate further.  PD))<n>

I was trying to prove to a friend that what he had witnessed the previous evening was a satellite and nothing more, so I watched the same area of sky he had (due north) and waited.  Sure enough, a dimly lit object came from the south and halfway across the sky gained in brightness, reached a peak of brightness, and slowly dimmed and moved on.  I attributed the change in illumination to reflection of sunlight off a solar panel of a man-made object, but my story does not end here. Crossing the path of the above object and just barely visible to the naked eye was a dimmer object which seemed to have a reddish-brown aura surrounding it.  I thought it was a shooting star at first, but the object did not throw sparks and was travelling too slowly for a meteorite, but faster than any object that I have seen in orbit.  It moved from west to southeast, and performed manuvers (no meteor could have done this) in a zig-zag fashion.  I watched the object for a full minute until it faded from sight.<n>

It&#39;s a ball in the western sky and was seem last night before dark. It is extremely bright that is last night. Before it was sperical, rotating with different colors some emitting from it. I got out my rifle with a 10 power scope and looked, really pretty pulsating, rotating. Dicided to get under it so we all got in the car and took off. It would not let  us get any closer to it than when we first saw it. We chased it for about 10 miles.I dicided to go back home and did but in my rear view mirror I could see it. Pulled into the house and went inside. It was no more than 3 minutes after when I saw an orange glow comming from our west window I looked out to see the woods right next to the house on fire not a small fire but a big one. Called the fire dept. and we got it out.All I can say is that there wasn&#39;t a spark of a fire when we came up the driveway, and it was totally dark outside when we came in. Don&#39;t know what it was that we saw in the sky but it looks like something came back last night. I still would like to get a real close look at it.<n>

When we got to the lake we started to fish. After about 10 to 15 minutes, I started to get bored and so I went to the top of a hill to put away my gear. To the left of my eye, I saw an orange bright light circling a spotlight (the ones that shine up in the sky to attract people that goes back and forth). Whenever the object circled around the light at a slower speed it got brighter. Whenever The object circled at a faster speed it got darker. I told my friend to come up to the top of the hill with his sisters. He saw the object and said it is probably a helicopter or something like that. I asked him if he wanted to go to his house to go get his video camera just in case it was a U.F.O. Since his house was about a block away, we had to walk pretty fast in order to catch the object on tape. As we started to walk to my friends house we noticed it started to follow us at a high rate of speed because the object was about a mile away when it was circling the light. My friend, his sisters and I stopped dead in our tracks when we saw it had caught up with us. The object was hovering to the left of us about 300 feet above the ground about 500 feet away from us. Then the object turned toward us. It was a triangle shape with a orange light on the top corner, a blue light on the bottom left corner and a red light on the bottom right corner. Then the object slowly drifter toward us with no sound at all. The object stopped about 300 feet away from us then it turned around 180 degrees and shot off like a bullet leaving no vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

It was still dark, some fog, and no wind.  As I was approaching an intersection of homes, across the very wide avenue running perpendicular to my approach are other homes and some trees.  From my vision&#39;s right side, a bright semi/incandescent blue/white round light floated in a straight line above the roof tops to the left and disappeared beyond and behind roofs and some small trees.  The altitude seemed to be about 200 feet off the ground.  The light, held out at arms length seemed to be about the size of a nickel.  The intensity was not blinding, and clearly the object was round. The travel-speed was not anything like a meteor, as this object was in no hurry.  There was absolutely no sound from this light.

My house is very high and so it is a natural thing to look at the stars as that is all you can see from the second level.  I immediately said to myself, wow, a shooting star.  How lucky to be up for five minutes and see on.  Upon further inspection, it never continued to fall.  It just kept going around and around and from my vantage poine, I could make out at least a red and white light going around the center.  I stayed there for some time trying to figure out just what I saw when I realized that I could make out three stationary objects forming a sort of triangle around the moving object.  I left the room, came back and refocused.  I even called my husband who saw the object but didn&#39;t have his glasses on to confirm my beliefs.  I compared this &#39;object&#39; with everything else in the sky and NOTHING else was moving except this.  After about 15 minutes, I went to bed.  I rewoke two hours later, and it was gone, however, ALL OF THE OTHER STARS WERE STILL OUT THERE.<n>

Some of the lights are brite white and others are yellowish in color. I noticed a light in the center of the road which looked like one of the yellowish lights. As I focused on it I could tell that it was much higher than the others. It was just there not moving at all then it just took off in the southerly direction and disappeared over the horizon. What ever it was it moved faster than anything I have ever seen.

About 5-7 miles north of Ankeny I casually looked over to the right side of the road at what appeared to be a farmhouse. As I was approaching the farmhouse I saw what looked like lights for the farmhouse but as I approached the farmhouse I saw something that looked nothing like a typical pole light. First no light was illuminating any kind of pole that would be holding it up. Second I saw that the three lights were unusually distant from each other(about 20-30ft?)and arranged in a perfect triangle. Also the lights were higher than nearby oak or elm trees leading me to think that it was about 40-50ft high above ground. but the most astonishing detail was that the lights didn&#39;t appear to be pointing strait down but rather out and down at an angle. This allowed some kind of surface around the light to be illuminated, showing the outline of the craft.<n>

I pointed it out to my girlfriend and commented it must be an aircraft flying high with a very bright light. The light looked more like a bright star than an actual aircraft light. The craft then suddenly appeared to be in space and the light was very faint and traveled in the same direction at a much slower rate, much like the way a satilite looks. The craft slowed down to a conplete stop for a few moments and then continued on slowly and then stopped again. The craft then held constant for several minutes and slowly disappeared.<n>

I looked up from the telescope when at about my 11:00 position I spotted a V-shaped formation of circular diffuse white lights on the underside of a &#39;solid&#39; V-shaped &#39;fuselage&#39; which was transparent (could see star field behind it) and shimmered like a mirage. From 4 to 6 closely spaced lights down each leg of V and 1 at point. Their diameter was nearly the width of each leg. They pulsed slowly (approx. 1 sec intervals) and simultaneously, and shimmered in sync with rest of craft. At first sight it was at least as big as both fists held at arms length. Estimate altitude at between 2000 and 5000ft. Traveled straight and level SSE at what must have been thousands of miles per hour and was completely silent. Fantastic, dizzying speed. Within view for approx. 5 sec. At last sight it was about the width of my pinky at arms length.<n>

As they approached the south horizon, the merged into one brighter light and went away over the horizon.<n>

This was in a wooded residential area on a little street that is only about 6 blocks long, end to end.  There were no other cars on the street except mine, which is not uncommon since the street just leads to another road that is a dead end.  The craft had very bright green lights in the front and very bright, bright white lights in the back, one on each corner.  The white lights were so bright they illuminated the back of the craft and you could see it was solid across the back.  The green lights in front (one at the point and one or two on each side very close to the front point)  were also bright and emitted a green glow downward as they passed over my vehicle.  It was similar to witnessing a traffic accident where the crash may have only taken 1 or 2 seconds, but everything seemed to move in slow motion.   Looking out my windshield, first I saw the green glow from above, then the green lights as the first aircraft passed over my car.  I thought it was a plane that was going to land in the street and I slammed on my brakes and the green and white lights from the 2nd craft passed over my car and I realized they were 2 jet like aircraft, except they were triangle shaped and I said out loud &#34;What is that?&#34;   They appeared to be flying in formation and reminded me of the way the Blue Angels fly, so close together.   The 1st one was in front of and a little to the left of the 2nd one. (The right 1/2 of it was in front of the 2nd one)  They flew very fast, very close together, had very, very, bright, bright lights, were just above the tree tops and were silent.  My car window as half to 3/4 of the way down and I did not hear a sound.  They continued to fly North.  I estimate the total time I observed them as 6 or 7 seconds.  I am a middle aged, professional, married woman and this is my first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite serious minded in her approach to the incident.  The party was quite convincing, and the person occupies a position of responsibility in the business community.  We have checked with the administrators of local sky cameras, and have found no record of the incident yet, but if the objects were at as low an altitude as the witness suggested to us, they would not have been recorded on the camera in Woodinville, WA; its effective horizon to the west is some 20 degrees above the horizontal plane.

We are located on the west side of the island of Molokai in the Hawaiian chain; as we stood there looking at the stars and the sky, at a southwest direction in the sky we saw what we assumed at first was a airplane then we noticed there were to many lights to be a airplane.  It looked like it was bobbing left to right then there was a solid roll of lights that started with only one light then followed by one on each side then a multitude of resddish lights began to flash on and off in a pattern.  The pattern was, it would start at the center light then flash out quickly and continue to flash in this manner.  The object seemed to be rolling ( like an airplane would).  But there was too many lights to be a airplane and as a frequent observer of airplanes I know it was not a airplane and it was not in a normal area or flight pattern in which airplanes would fly over this island.

At about twilight my husband noticed a bright light in the southern sky.  To my naked eye it looked like a large, bright star.  When observed through binoculars, I saw three lights arranged in an inverted triangle.  The bottom light appeared more red than the two at top, initially, which looked more yellowish in color.  It appeared stationary to me at this point.  We went outside (had been on our enclosed patio) and saw two neighbors, to whom we gave the binoculars to observe the lights.  One (occupation unknown) noted that the lights were moving.  I looked again, and noted that through the binoculars small darting movements could be observed, although the lights remained in the same relationship to each other and in the same general location.  As we watched, the lights became more reddish in color, and gradually became smaller and smaller, until they were no longer observable.  Neither my husband nor I have ever seen anything like this before and aren&#39;t sure what to make of it.  We saw a plane in the general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report is somewhat reminiscent of the red lights that have been reported over Arizona, Illinois, and several other states since February of this year.  Generally, when a stationary light at night is reported to us, we attempt first to eliminate the possibility that is is a &#34;twinkling&#34; star, planet, or other celestial body.  However, such an object should not simply disappear from sight on a clear night, we feel.  PD))<n>

The speed seemed to be faster than most high-altitude aircraft, about the speed of a LEO satelite.  The lights were fixed in a triangle formation.  No sound was heard.  No strobes or other navigational lights were seen.  They were barely visible with the naked eye.  When viewed through 7x35 binoculars the formation occupied about 1/3 of the field of view.<n>

It appeared to be oval with colored lights and either pulsing or rotating in position.  We ruled out helecopters and planes.  It definately wasn&#39;t a house or vehicle as there are no houses or roads in that area.  We turned off our lights to watch it for a couple of minutes.  After a couple of minutes, I turned on my parking lights in case someone happened to drive up on us and the object suddenly emitted a very bright white spot light and started moving in what looked like our direction - I turned the lights off very quickly and the object returned to it&#39;s original colors and stopped moving.  I asked my husband if we had the vidio camera with us and he said yes.  However, When hereached for it, the object disappeared in slow motion from the outside in.  Very strange.....<n>

It was light enough so no stars were visible.  I was looking to the north about 30 degrees above the horizon and a very white bright sharp light caught my eye.  It was moving from NW to NE and gaining altitude.  It was moving at a rate of speed that I estimate to be 7-10 times faster than any airplane that I know of.  It traveled for 2-3 seconds, split into 3 bright lights one above the other.  The center light was not as bright as the other two.  As soon as the it split, it appeared tocome to a complete stop.  The light split into three seperate lights and disappeared.  There was no contrails, smoke trails or debris of any sort during flight or when it disappeared.  There was no shape detected as it was only the bright light during travel and the three light just prior to disappearing.  The sky was clear at the time with no clouds or aircraft in the area. Both my wife and I saw it traveling through the sky, but she turned to look at me in disbelief for a second and didn&#39;t see it split into three lights and disappear.  When she looked back, it was gone.  Both my wife and I spend a total of 33 years in alw enforcment and she now owns her own business and I am a computer network manager.<n>

I had my head tilted back, watching a satellite that had just passed out of view.  Into my filed of sight entered an extremely bright light.  I told my friend, &#34;Look at that bright satellite!&#34;, which was ridiculous because it was way too bright to be a satellite.  It looked to be extremely high, and was moving at about the same speed of a satellite, faster than any jet could go.  It was lit up with an extremely bright white light.  Upon looking at it closely, it appeared to be a triangular shaped craft with the white light around it&#39;s borders.  It was going from the northwest to the southeast above Salt Lake county.  It started going behind a tree...I told my friend I was going to get up to check it out before it went behind the Wasatch Range (mountains), but before I could even get out of my seat, it took off at a rate of speed so fast that it basically vanished before my eyes, and I made sure I didn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.  It was one of the most intense colors of bright white I have ever seen, no strobe or any other colors.  My friend was going to report this, but never found the time, so I thought I&#39;d do it, that&#39;s why it&#39;s coming in late.<n>

The 2 white lights after these lights on the same level as these lights was the red light. The other white light was at the the VERY front of the plane. We saw no &#34;bubble&#34; where a person would sit. It made a VERY tight turn a turnisappered. We heard noise and the plane was at about 5,000 ft. TO LOW for this area. The FAA does not allow planes that low in this area. It had the shape of a stealh BUT WAS very different as we heard a lot of noise.<n>
9/23/00 20:18|Fort Nelson (80 miles NW of) (Canada)|YT|Unknown|5-10 minutes|Silent, hovering and moving lights close to the highway.|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41185.html|68|ndxe200009| Silent, hovering and moving lights close to the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north through Canada to go to Alaska. It was just after sunset and the after glow of the sunset was almost entirely gone. There were some kind of radio towers out in the hills and I was doing a little game with myself trying to spot the radio tower&#39;s support wires. It took a little concentration, but I could make them out still against the slight glow of the horizon. I kept moveing from one set of lights to the next to see how far out there I could see. The radio towers had 2 red lights on the tops of them. Off to the right of the radio towers there was another set of red lights, but this set had three lights and another set of lights right next to it that held the same shape, but different colors (One set was red,red,red and the other set was red,white,green). I thought that it was kind of weird and continued my little game on it. I noticed there was no tower under it and no wires. It wasn&#39;t close enough to anything to have been supported by something else. As I kept driving I noticed it was near the road and I would be driving near it, so i kept my eyes on it as much as I could. The trees along side of the road were about 50 feet tall and these lights were about that again over them. Once I got almost right under them I pulled over along side of the road and turned my car off. I got out of the car and stood there looking up at them. First thing I noticed was there was no sound of anykind of engine or exhaust. This really had my attention at this point, I knew this was something seriously new to me. The lights didn&#39;t give off any real radiance to speak of, more of a dim luminesense. The trees below the lights didn&#39;t show and color of the lights. The glow was almost like the glow emitted by the painted Christmas lights, a real subdued glow. The position and shape of the lights were like a wide V shape with the individual lights them selves being the shapes of large ovals or maybe circles looked at from the side. The angle of the V shape was about 30 degrees angle on each side angled up. Kind of like this with the angles being 30 degrees and the lines being ovals \_/ much like lights on the bottom side of a concave object. I tried really hard to get a look at what the lights were attached to, but the lights didn&#39;t illuminate the object in any way, which was really weird. I must have been within a 100 yards from these things with them across the two lane highway over the trees on the edge of the highway&#39;s cleared area. I heard no noise from the objects, noticed no movement for about 5 minutes.The red,red,red one started moveing away from me at a 45 degree angle to the highway to my left at probably 10-20 miles an hour.The speed was sudden and totally steady. Then once it got almost out of sight over the trees the red,white,green one matched the red one&#39;s speed and trajectory perfectly and in the same fasion. Throughout the whole encounter there was no noise made from these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Under the circumstances I tend to take notice of everything that moves in the sky.  Tonight I saw a very, very large light holding a stationary position just South East of the super mall in Auburn.  A plane was flying in a pattern near the object and another light was a great distance East.  I couldn&#39;t tell if that object was a plane or not.  I only had a short time to view the object, but I&#39;ve seen similar.  The light from the object was slightly golden in color, very bright.  I&#39;ve been told that hot-air balloons are known to be in the area, but I rule this out for this sighting.  The size of the light in comparison to the aircraft was quite large.<n>

As I was coming down the highway about 8 minuets from Simcoe there was this large light low in the sky. I could see the object from about 4 miles away in Scotland Ont. It was about 200 or 300 feet above the bush. As I aproached this light there was this beam of light circling like a spotlight around the center parallel to the ground. Off to the sides there were two pulsating lights on each side, blueish white in color, in a V form. I could distigush that there was a bottom to this disk, a light glow. It was rocking side to side slightly. I observed this object for 10 minuets. Called my wife on the cell phone to tell what I was witnessing. Then I decided to go around the corner and get closer, that is when it totally disapeared.<n>

We have corrected the date to 23SE00.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shooting star looking object that moved quickly and freely across the sky for several hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I witnessed what I thought was a shooting star. It looked like a shooting star in color and quickness. But then it shot right back up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed. I have never seen any airplane move that fast. My husband compared it to the speed of a laser pointer moving across the sky. The object did circles in the sky, it went up and came down, moved east and then west. I thought maybe I was seeing things, so I went and woke up my spouse so he could see it too. He too saw it and could not explain what it was. It did not have the usual airplane red and blue blinking lights, it was a solid color, not really a color, but it glowed evenly. I sat and watched it amazed for about 3 hours. At one point it looked very low in the sky, to the point where I thought I could hear its movements. It sounded much like a kite sounds when it is flapping through the air, and it had more of a shape to it at that point. It had a a triangular shape to it when it got down low, and it appeared to be white in color, or maybe it was just glowing. It came down in circular movements, but then it shot straight back up into the sky. I know it was not a kite, because kites don&#39;t have such a range on them. I thought maybe a secret military craft, but this thing moved super super fast. I had a hard time keeping my eye on it at times. I had never in my life seen anything like that before. My spouse and I were equally confused as to what it could have been. I even called 911 to see if anyone else had reported seeing an object in the northern skies, no one had according to the 911 operator (at least not to her knowledge). I eventually got tired and went to bed. I have not seen anything or heard anything about it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shooting star looking object that moved quickly and freely across the sky for several hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just wanted to make a correction, I realized that I witnessed this after midnight, so it would have been 9/23/00.. not 9/22/00 as I previously reported. I am not sure if I need to retell the story, but I will. I was sitting outside on my back porch smoking a cigarette, when I saw what I thought was a shooting star in the northern sky, but unlike a shooting star, the &#34;light&#34; shot back up in the sky at an incredible rate of speed. I watched this thing move around, up and down, east and west, circling at times for about a half an hour before I decided I should go wake up my husband so he too could see it. I knew if someone else did not see it, no one would believe me or think I was hallucinating. I ran upstair and got him out of bed to come and take a look. He came outside and after about 3 minutes, he too saw what I was seeing. He compared the speed at which this thing moved to the speed of a laser pointer moving across the sky. The sky was clear that night, and I do not remember seeing a moon (may have been south of me as I was looking north). Someone suggested that maybe there was a laser light show in the area that night, but it was after midnight, and I would think that the lights would have to have something to reflect off of, plus there were no beams coming from the ground up. This thing was up there looking like a moving star. It has also been suggested that maybe it was a satellite, because that it what it looked like in color and size. But I have seen satellites in the sky before, and none ever moved with such quickness, and so sporadically. This thing was all over the place, doing dives, circles, back and forth, up and down. I was just amazed at what I was witnessing. My husband was not as impressed as I was, however he could not find a logical explanation for me. He ended up going back to bed after about 15 minutes. I stayed out side watching this thing until about 3:30 am. It moved all over. When I first saw it, I would say it was at about a 60º angle, falling down like a shooting star to about 45º then back up to about an 80º angle. At one point it came down really low in the sky, however it was still quite small. But when it came down &#34;lower&#34; I thought I could hear it. The sound reminded me of a ! kite fla pping in the wind, and some of the moves it did (the spiralling downward) reminded me of a stunt kites&#39; movements. I also thought I could make out somewhat of a shape, and it&#39;s shape reminded me of the Stealth Bomber, triangular in shape, but white, or glowing in color. It did not blink lights, the light stayed solid. It did not have the red or blue blinking lights like airplanes have. It did not blink at all for that matter. I thought maybe a remote control airplane (like the UAV) but this thing moved so fast, I had a hard time keeping my eye on it. Sometimes it looked like it hovered, but I am not sure, it may have been going up higher and away from me. I even went as far as to call 911 to see if anyone else had called in to report seeing an object in the sky. The dispatcher told me that no one had to the best of her knowledge. She offered to have an officer come out to my house so I could point it out to him, but I declined (I felt foolish). I watched it for a long time, then it started heading east, and I was tired, so I went to bed. I am still perplexed as to what it was that I saw that night. And I might think it was a dream if my husband had not also witnessed it. It amazed me, I was so in awe and so excited about it. I still smoke, and I cannot smoke in my house, so I sit out there every night hoping to catch a glimpse of something like that again, but so far there has been nothing out of the ordinary. I will never forget this as long as I live. I just wish I knew for sure what it was..and if anyone else besides me and my husband witnessed it.<n>

I was coming back from the second shop to get a part.  I glanced up to see something I have never seen in my life that stopped me in my tracks and totally speechless.  It was tear drop shaped but the sides were straight not concave and rounded at the front.  It was an orange, red and yellow distinctive but blend of these colors.  Kind of looked like it was on fire or flaming but was not pulsing or flickering.  It seemed like a cut out picture that was suspended in the sky but I knew this was NOT the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood and watched it for a few minutes as it seemed to be heading straight for the ground maybe 1,000 feet or so up.  I caught myself watching in an almost trance-like state I kind of snapped myself out of and thought, &#34;I HAVE to get someone else to confirm what I am seeing is just that!&#34;.  I knew I wasn&#39;t having dillusions, was well rested, not hung over OR on ANY medication. (legal or otherwise)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I briskly headed for the main shop to get the shop foreman because we were the only ones there at the moment.  I went into the office and asked him with much firmness in my voice he needs to come here to see this.  He asked what it was but I just blurted out, &#34;Just come here. You have to see this!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He followed me with out question as I quick stepped it the spot I was standing earlier.  I stopped at the same spot and pointed backwards to the object and replied, &#34;WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!&#34;.  He turned in the southern direction I pointed and froze solid...speechless as well.  Blank stare on his face. After a couple minutes I asked him again. &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; He said,  &#34;Charlie, I really don&#39;t know&#34; in an awe stricken fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, we just stood there for a few minutes more then the object seemed to turn due south very gradually but it didn&#39;t bend, flex or change its looks when it did.  It was smaller looking after the turn south and seemed to slowly continue until it got too small to see any more.  It left no trail, residue and had no evidence of being a &#34;made&#34; or &#34;built&#34; thing.  No lights or anything that people typically report with ufos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place maybe 1 mile south of the Louisville, KY, international airport.  About 1/2 mile west of I-65 and about 1/2 mile south of I-265.  So close to the air port and never heard anything about it on the news or from others.  It seemed to be bigger than the good year blimp.  I can&#39;t even be sure it was a craft but it seemed to move with a definite purpose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

When we first seen them , all three were distinguishable as seperate ships. After a moment of observing them the first  two ships briefly merged into one , then seperated again. I pulled into my sons school and parked in the back lot until I could no longer see them. My son observed them until he had to get to class. In all I watched them for about four - five minutes as they headed southwest.<n>
9/22/00 00:30|Defiance|OH|Other|1.5 Minutes|The object, in about 1 -2 seconds, moved from my east to west without a noise.  It looked circular and glowed like the moon.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14245.html|84|ndxe200009| The object, in about 1 -2 seconds, moved from my east to west without a noise.  It looked circular and glowed like the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking from my car into my house, after getting home from work, and was observing the night sky as I do most every night.  I was walking north.  From my far east a disk or ball (somewhat obscured by the light clouds) appeared kind of as a soft white glow, like the moon light, and traveled to my far west in about 1.5 - 2 seconds.  It moved so quickly that it appeared to have a short tail coming from behind.  It disappeared to my view for about 5 seconds.  The object reappeared to my far west side and in approximately .5 second moved to a position just in front of me and slightly to my west and stopped.  While it was stationary the soft glow stopped and all I could see were four lights which were green, red, and white.  The object hovered at that position for about 15 seconds and then moved off to the north at a slower rate, but much faster than any airplane or jet.  While it traveled northward I could see the lights and it did not during any of this sighting make any noise.  At first I thought maybe it was a shooting star or an object entering the atmosphere.  However, it was unlike any falling star or other object I had ever seen before and, it was much to large, I thought to be such an object.  I also thought maybe it was a search light, however you can see the trail of a search light as it cuts the sky and this did not have any.  When I saw the lights I thought maybe it was an airplane, jet, or helicopter.  However, there was no noise, no airplane or jet I know of can hover, and a helicopter noise would have been very distiguishable at that range even if in a silent mode.  I followed the object as it traveled northward until I was in front of my house (on the other side from the drive) and then it was lost to view shortly afterward behind the trees.  I stood in awe and watched this thing.  I have heard of sightings and other reports of people seeing objects like this.  My wife said her and her mother seen one when she was just a child.  But, until it happened Friday night I was still skeptical! .  The t oughest problem for me right now is that I have a very analytical mind and I would like to explain this away.  However, it has bugged me all weekend because I cannot explain it.  Was there anything in this area or in science that can explain what I saw?  I am curious now.  I hope I have another encounter because this was such an awesome, frustratingly inexplicable, and wonderful thing to behold.  I hope you don&#39;t think I am nuts.  Thanks for your time.<n>

I&#39;ve seen the object on my right, it was flying in the direction of the near-by school, slowly. It was like as it was made of many very small lights, with a couple of big slowly flashing lights. It was flying above the tree tops, and was rather big (may be 50 metres in diametre). I started to slow down, but other cars (two) passed me by, as though they did not see anything. I took the first road on my right (to the school yard actually) because the object was moving perpendicullar to the road i was driving, to my right (in direction of COD main campus). I followed it untill the road ended, and somehow though the object was moving slowly, it was already far away. I was looking at it from there, and it was still in the air when I started to drive home (it was late and i had to go), and from the distance it was a small enlighted oval, i would not notice it anong the lights from the street light. The object was very beautiful when it was close to me when I&#39;ve seen it.<n>

In a flash it tapered down in a streak and disappeared very quickly. There were other people right there with me, but nobody else (to my knowledge) saw it. I suppose it could&#39;ve been a meteor, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before.<n>

I was scared because i felt that something was pulling me toward this object.  I got back into the car and kept looking at the object.  It disappeared into thin air. I NEVER took my eyes off the object.  Then the object disappeared before my very eyes.  I got back into the car and the clock said 8:30PM. The round shiny part had a bright neon purple &#34;tail&#34; that tapered down from it, but did not touch the ground.  I have drawn a picture of the object as I saw it.<n>

I first thought it was the &#34;V&#34; formation of a flock of birds.  I cupped my ear to listen, but it made absolutely no sound.  It glided smoothly but quickly from the North towards a South-southeasterly direction.  It spanned the portion of sky from Hercules to Capricornus (where I lost it behind the trees) in about 5 seconds.  It was shaped like a flattened out &#34;V&#34;. At arms length it was about 3&#34; across and about 1&#34; long.  It&#39;s shape was made up of many pinpoints of white lights, not brilliant, about as bright as the average star.  It was a perfectly clear night, the moon had not risen yet.  I was outside just gazing at how spectacular the milky way looked when I saw it. My background: 37 year old male, I own a hardware store, I have a college degree in marketing and management, I am an avid starwatcher, I own a telescope, I do not believe in extraterrestrial life but I am miffed by what I just saw.<n>
9/20/00 22:30|Naha (near) (Okinawa, Japan)||Triangle|40-60 seconds|a Object that flew extremely slow, triangular in shape, producing no light or sound only reflected light and half a football field big|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14236.html|95|ndxe200009| a Object that flew extremely slow, triangular in shape, producing no light or sound only reflected light and half a football field big<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was several hundred feet to a thousand feet in the sky.  It was triangular in shpae and it produced no light.  The only light that came from the objest was the light that was reflected off the bottom. The light source was the city of Naha which is 5 miles south of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.  The light that was reflected off the bottom was also oval in shape giving it the idea that the bottom was convex and had bulges(like that of a bird...air that goes around must speed up to catch up to the air that goes straight through). Plus the light was formed in a &#34;V&#34; formation like geese heading south for the winter which suggests the object was triangular. there were no flashng lights like a commercial airliner.  There were no headlights on it like a KC 130 aerial refueler(the sir station has KC-130&#39;s, CH-46&#39;s, and CH&#39;53s).  Th object did not make the sound of a KC-130 which has 4 propellars.  The object produced no sound at all!!!!!!  I also thought that it was a B-2 bomber but B-2&#39;s make a lot of noise even.  This unidentified Flying Object was gliding through the sky. Any Aircraft in the world would have fallen out of the sky if they flew as slow as this object did. ANy Aircraft that flies around the Air station either land or take off....not fly over head. It was not of this world.  My parents know about this and my uncle does too and him and his son saw a UFO several years back.<n>

The whole thing started again after about 5 minutes,after it finished the 2nd time we went inside because it was too cold.If the lights were all one object, we estimated that it must have been about half a mile wide.We were camping on a campsite at the time, on holiday.I was a self employed gardener at the time, and my partner was a lorry driver,we had been together for four years. We were both 26 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The first possibility that we feel would have to be ruled out would be some kind of laser-based advertising light.

Well tonight I saw something very very different.  5 or 6 lights flying about twice as slow as a shooting star, in formation and appearing to dip then rise and go out of sight.  All over in 2 seconds.  They covered about quarter of the sky in those 2 seconds.  I&#39;m used to military aircraft round hear but there was no noise, at all. So what do you think - is this the DT&#39;s or madness or have I just seen something weeired.  You know after I had seen it I kept saying &#39;oh my god, oh my god&#39;.  It bought tears to my eyes.  Wish I know what it was...  Sorry I just needed to share that with someone. (the formations was a V shape - white round lights)<n>

I noticed a very bright object high up in the sky above a very calm sea.  My partner also saw it.  It was still at first, maybe a small side wobble or two.  It then seemd to know it was being observed as it started rising, slowly at first then seemed to accelerate, there was nothing else in the sky.  As it rose higher it diminished in size, I am no scientist but I believe that objects moving away from you at light speed turn red &#39;red shift&#39;, this is what happened to this particular object as it moved away from us into space.  The object soon dissapeared.  We saw this again in a different location on a different date.

While stopped at a light I thought a photo of a powerline running through clouds would make for an interesting image to use on our company website. There were clearly no aircraft in the vicinity when this photo (sent via email) was taken. I cannot explain what the black image in the upper right corner is, nor can I reproduce it when stopping at the same location and taking a photo this morning. I used a Sony digital camera, model MVC-FD73 with no additional filters to take this photograph. Although it is somewhat pixelated due to the lighting environment, the photo has been altered in no way. I have kept the original file, which produces an image summary file to prove no alterations have been made. This object looks somewhat like an upside down aircraft in my opinion.<n>
9/20/00 16:00|Dahab (Sinai)||Changing|Approx five seconds|Morphing, definate object changing speeds and shape whilst going from one side of the sky to the other.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14694.html|104|ndxe200009| Morphing, definate object changing speeds and shape whilst going from one side of the sky to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us were lying on a roof in Dahab, the Sinai, Egypt.  We were all looking at the sky which had become black half an hour before. There were lots of stars, sattelites and shooting stars.  It was quite entertaining and we were talking.  Suddenly without speaking we all looked at an object which at the time I thought was a hovering bird of prey.  After aproximately two or three seconds the object travelled quickly in the sky directly across our orientation.  Suddenly I thought it was a teridactle(prehistoric bird) by the look of its bent around &#34;boomerang&#34; shape and it seemed to move very quickly and effortlessly as if it were gliding.  It glided directly above and across us.  Suddenly it seemed to change shape into a triangular, hard object which moved as if it were on one part of the sky but still in another.   It was a short distance that the triangular shape moved and then object disapeared. We didn&#39;t talk for about two minutes, we just laughed.   All three of us had realized there was no explanation on earth of what we had seen except that it were an alien spacecraft.  It varied speed dramatically, changed  shape and we didn&#39;t believe anything of earth had capabilities like that no matter how much technology had advanced.  I thought about Saudi Arabian technology and thought there was no way as it was almost as if I had seen photographs or pictures of such things a fairly long time ago. Myself and the two others were so definate about what we had seen that we went to the local bar straight afterwards and told everybody. When we talked about it we thought initialy it had looked like a cloud, then a hovering griffin or eagle, then a boomerang or terridactle, then a hard straight edged spacecraft sort of thing. All three of us had a long experience with smoking grass but we know you don&#39;t see things like that on grass and two of us have smoked for two years continously.  As usual we smoked a lot that night.  Two of us were working in Dahab as dive guides and the other person, the Gay Australian we had met as a dive customer.  We had lived at the house for about two months and often sat on the roof watching the sky.  Imeddiately after it happened I climbed down the ladder and asked the couple sitting downstairs, outside if the had seen it, they hadn&#39;t and were a bit reluctant to consider it a UFO. I can tell you I am quite liberated and will take drugs, discuss sex in the open and am twenty two years old. My flatmate who saw it is also liberated and we both have a history with electronic music, drugs and diving. The gay Australian was obviously liberated and very open minded. We were all very pleasant people, between twenty and thirty and I think were up with the times and were modern  young at heart. None of the characteristics below apply<n>

It could have been disc shaped and I might have been looking at it from the side but I&#39;m not quite sure. it had a glowing white color like the kind of white that clouds have when sun shines directly on it, but just a bit more &#39;glowy&#39;. It was going from north to south direction. at first I thought it was vapour from an aircraft, but at the tip of the vapour i could see no visible craft, and if it was vapour, the vapour was not getting any longer. I only noticed that it wasn&#39;t conventional aircraft when i saw the whole length of it move. it was huge. It moved behind a big cloud however and we lost sight of it. During that time, it was also beginning to rain. Right now we are experiencing some real crazy rain, so I&#39;m not quite sure what the object might have been. I&#39;ve seen alot of planes flying before, but just estimating and looking at it in the sky, it seemed pretty big, as a matter of fact around 5-8 times bigger then a 747. I&#39;m kind of surprised no one driving next to me saw it cos they were probably concentrating on driving.<n>

At around 4:30 am on 9/20/00 I saw a strange blurry circular light. As it came closer to the house the light grew very large and pretty bright. There was no sound at all. This object came right up to the windows, and seemed too low to be an aircraft (especially with no sound). As it passed by the house I saw a completely round object, like a baseball. It was white in color, and it had a singular strand or line of red lights all the way around the center. The red lights were not on, but 2 or 3 would blink on randomly . After it passed the house, I then heard a very loud noise. Like a rip in the air? Its hard to explain, like a hole being torn in the air. I ran to the front window , and there was nothing. It was gone in a split second? I cannot explain what this thing was, but I am very sure of exactly the description of it. This was something I have never seen. The following day, military helicopters circled the general for several hours.<n>

Very slowly moving from West to East, at a high altitude.  My husband and I watched it for 25 minutes and timed the flashes, which were exactly every 10 seconds. We guessed it to be about ten miles up.  The object hovered in the same area, moving back and forth as though it were inching across the sky.  We watched through our binoculars but could not see any particular shape.  The flashing light was round, large and extremely bright.  After 25 minutes the flashes stopped.<n>

I viewed for approximately 5 minutes with both 7x35 and 10x50 binoculars.  It never made it all the way thru The Great Square when it no longer flashed to be visible.  I watch the skys quite a bit and can judge high altitude aircraft speed thru the sky, but this was moving very slowly.<n>

9/19/00 20:30|Ravenna|OH|Formation|3 - 5 seconds|Formation of 4-5 huge boomerang shaped objects, fully lit, silent, shooting star speed, flying in perfect unison.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14326.html|114|ndxe200009| Formation of 4-5 huge boomerang shaped objects, fully lit, silent, shooting star speed, flying in perfect unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday, September 19, 2000, I walked out on my back porch and looked up at the sky.  I was standing facing south. It was a clear night and the stars were very visible in the heavens.  From out of my right  came a formation of four to five objects, grouped closely together in flight, but clearly individual objects, traveling west to east straight across my field of vision.  Within 2-3 seconds they were clearly visible in the sky straight ahead of me.  They then paused, banked slightly and shot upward  to the south disappearing in the sky at about a 100 degree angle from where I first spotted them.  The objects seem to glide rapidly as opposed to &#34;flying&#34;.  There appeared to be no &#34;drag&#34; to the motion as one would expect if watching a plane make its way slowly across the sky.  Instead they glided effortlessly, silently and quickly like a shooting star. They paused in mid-air for only a fraction of a second before changing course.  When they banked and changed direction, they moved all as one unit.  Not one of the objects appeared to lose the slightest distance in its position to the other objects when turning.  They turned synchronized in perfect unison as if one unit.   Each object in the formation was very large (about the size of our moon in the sky), triangular to boomerang in shape and completely illuminated in a brilliant, but unusual white light -- as opposed to having lights &#34;on them&#34;.   When they paused for the split second and my mind could fully view and assimilate the formation of objects which had just sped into view before me, I had an incredible sense of awareness and knowledge that I was viewing something awesome and extremely technologically advanced.  I say this because of the speed and agility with which they glided across the sky; the fact there was no associated engine sounds; the ability of the pilots to fly in a formation so perfectly at the speed they were achieving; and the size of each object as compared to the stars and other objects in the sky.  I refer to  &#34;other objects&#34; because at the same time they were crossing the sky, there was a jet plane to my left traveling eastward.  Had the formation of objects continued on a straight line eastward, they would have passed just south of the position of the plane at a very close proximity.  In fact, I was hoping the plane passengers would see them also.  Instead the formation paused, banked and headed southward well out of view of the plane. When the objects turned, I saw the underside of each object and realized that the illumination of each object was emanating  at different intensity levels.   Hence, it was not a reflection of one object appearing as several, but in fact several.  When the objects turned they increased speed dramatically and disappeared from view in about the time it would take a person to blink their eyes.<n>

It was at night and the road was deserted except for two other cars.  The sighting was before a new Space Challenger Center built in Radcliff and in the vicinity of Ft. Knox.  A huge bright light appeared in the sky and headed straight for us.  We thought it was a plane in touble and was going to land on the highway.  We were totally freaked out.  Then it broke apart into three huge lights, in a formation and dove into a wooded area.  We saw no craft or heard no sound.  It disappeared at the base of a small hill in a densely wooded area.  The whole thing happened so fast and was so strange and, with it&#39;s location so close to Ft. knox, that we decided that it had to be something connected with the military and dismissed it.  In fact, we have not mentioned it to anyone except one of our childen.  And even then it was not the night of the sighting but some time later that I reluctantly told him....in a kind of...this s wierd and probably has a logical explanation...kind of way. I recently decided that I should report this...we DID see something and it was an unidentifiable flying object....maybe you (?) can make some sense of this.<n>

As I walked through our sliding glass door, I noticed a funny looking light about three to five thousand feet above the center of the city of Pueblo.  This distance was about a mile from my house.  From plain eyesight, the color of the object was opaque.  It was like an opal in the sky.  Furthermore, it stood stationary in the sky with no movement for a duration of ten minutes.  I unpacked my binocular and took a second look. Wow, this was incredible, a triangle shaped craft with three bright dots inside, one in each corner.  I then unpacked my spotting scope and viewed the object. Double WOW, this was one of the most amazing objects I&#39;ve ever seen. Of course there were no stars out at this time, so it wasn&#39;t that. Furthermore, the object remained stationary for ten minutes, which eleminates an aircraft. About the time I zoomed in on the object for a second time it took off at a high rate of speed. I took my eye from the lense and followed it from about three thousand feet to about fifty to seventy thousand feet in a matter of two seconds, counting one one thousand two one thousand.  What ever it was, wasn&#39;t from this planet. It&#39;s one of those strange things that I&#39;ll always remember.<n>

Iam located in downtown Houston Texas. It moved in 4 or 5 directions and was very shiny. The sky was clear with good sun. At one point a Southwest Airlines jet looked like it was going to hit the sphere. The event lasted about 30 min. I took pictures and called the Houston Police Dept and was told it was a weather ballon. It moved from very fast, to slow, to still. It seemed to continue to move to the north until out of site. I also looked at it with 60x28Mc field glasses. It was round 3d and very shiny or spinning possibly. It moved very smoothly, not in a jerking fashion. There were quite a few jet contrails in the sky and thats what made me look up. Those contrails have been occuring alot lately. I am a professional with a college degree and generally clear headed. I have never seen a Ufo before. I am 38 yrs old. It was probably less than a 2 miles from me when this began.

She asked me &#34;is that a plane?&#34; I was driving so I couldn&#39;t look right away, but after a few seconds I looked up and saw an &#39;8&#39; shaped white light in the sky several miles ahead of us. It moved vertically, while swerving from side to side. The light went off once, then after a second or so, it came back on, quite far away from where it was when the light went off. Then after another second or so, it went off again and disappeared. It&#39;s a pretty clear night so I don&#39;t know where it could have gone. The strangest thing about it was the movement and the speed at which it seemed to have traveled. I would have dismissed it as a helicopter if it weren&#39;t for these two factors. My wife is convinced it&#39;s a UFO, but I&#39;m wondering if there is another explanation. I&#39;d appreciate an e-mail with any information regarding this &#39;sighting&#39;.

As the observers were eating dinner at their residence (elevation 650 ft. above sea level; at approximately 33 degree North latitude, 117 degrees West longitude) located at the mouth of a canyon,  observer #1 spotted a balloon-like object in the sky about one-half mile due east across a small valley and above a ridge at an elevation of approximately 750 feet above sea level. This is in an neighborhood of widely spaced large homes on large (1 acre+) lots in an uneven terrain. The object moved slowly toward the observers&#39;  home until about 1/4 mile away, when it  made a right angle turn to the north, at which time observer #2 saw it. The object, which was gray colored,  did not behave as a typical balloon. It  seemed to have a controlled flight path and a constant speed (perhaps 5 miles per hour), and it maintained a level elevation of about 750 feet.  It did not drift in  the breeze, nor change elevation, but moved slowly in a straight path. The observers moved outdoors onto the patio behind their residence, and observer #2 observed it thereafter through 7 x 35 binoculars.  After making a 90 degree turn to the north, it travelled slowly (estimated at 5 mph) due north across Lake Hodges and toward the City of Escondido, CA, in a straight line until it disappeared in the distance.  At one point, over Lake Hodges, the left (western) side of the object glinted in the setting sunlight. The oject had a shape somewhat between that of a balloon and a football.  It had no wings, or anything exterior to its basic shape,  and no antennae were observed.  It was about as large as a standard sized suitcase, about 3 feet long and 1.5 feet wide, and an elyptical shape, somewhat like a small derigible. No sound or light  was emitted from the object.<n>

We were in the hot tub, listening to dreamland and watching the stars.  It came zooming across somewhat in the northeast sky and heading east.  It had a faint orange light and was a crescent shape.  (My husband says he saw a light, but I don&#39;t remember that.)  I estimate the visual size as being about an inch across at arm&#39;s length.  (long arms)  The speed was much less than a shooting star, but much faster than any airplane.  There was no sound and no sonic boom of any kind.  This appeared sometime close to 8:15 or 8:20 Pacific Daylight Time.  So fast, my goodness.  Also, the object gave me the impression of flowing through water.  Like the stars seemed distorted by it.  Can&#39;t really describe very well.  That&#39;s about it.  Thanks.<n>

The stars were visible but the sky was not dark yet.I was sitting on a seat in the garden just looking at the sky.It was a quite a warm evening for September in the U.K.We are about 25 miles from our local airport which is (East Midlands)and I had noticed 2 or 3 commercial planes with vapour trails and their wing and tail lights flashing at high altitude. flying north and south.The garden faces in a south westerly direction. As I looked directly above me I noticed a vee or delta formation of lights.There were at least 10 to 15 lights on either side of the delta shaped. The delta shape was static with no engine noise at all. It kept this position for 4-5 seconds as if it were scanning the area or me.I didn&#39;t take my eyes of the shape, the lights appeared to be green/yellow in colour and they did not appear to round more oval in shape. The delta had no back or form as in a triangle just the delta wing as I could see the sky directly behind the lights. The delta shape then moved slowly across the sky for just a second or two then the movement was so rapid I could not track with the human eye. It did not disappear at the front of my eyes it was just as if it went faster than my eyes could react.The position of the delta was north to south. To me it looked like it was tracking or mapping the area and something made it stop so it could be monitored.I would say it would be traveling faster than light.<n>

I watched it for several minutes.  then instantly it shot off at a high rate of speed.  There was no sound.  At that point in time the electricity to the concert was momentary interupted.  Since we were several miles from airport, I was able to compare several differet shpes of planes seveal flying high.  All the planes I saw, I could make out the wings and the planes were leaving vaper trails.  The object I saw didn&#39;t have a vapor trail.  That&#39;s when I felt for sure it was a UFO.<n>

We were at San Quentin village on the little beach. I looked up into perfectly clear blue sky and happened to see 3, very small points of brilliant white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lower 2 seemed to be one over the other and the top light was equidistant from the other 2, but to the left, about 15 degrees. The 3 lights were &#34;joined&#34; by 2 very thin, black lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my brother if he saw anything up in the sky, without showing him and he described what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went over to my 21 y/o niece, and without describing to her what I saw, asked her. She described the same  lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 lights were due south of San Quentin Prison, and possibly directly high over San Francisco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t possible to estimate the distance - but they were, as best I could tell (I triangulated with a tree branch) motionless over the city (or at least in that direction).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an air show down in South Bay that day and 2 military jets did do a low pass over us before we saw the 3 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the 3 lights for 30 to 45 minutes and then as my brother and I were watching, they &#34;seemed&#34; to flit up and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They left no vapor trails Their light was almost lazer-like, dazzling and just a pinpoint with some slight &#34;flaring&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also a pilot and can state that it wasn&#39;t a satellite, a plane, a balloon or blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a year later, I ran into my sister-in-law&#39;s brother - and - he recounted that he, from the South Bay, was working on his house on the weekend and also had seen a series of, what he proceeded to describe, as the same type of lights and about the same time of the year. He described them as &#34;over San Francisco&#34;. So, if they were the same lights, We both, from different locations, saw them over San Francisco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He is a pilot, also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped about halfway and I looked up and spotted faint lites traveling from north to south. Spotted them as they  approached the Colorado River from the Bullhead side.  There were about 8 or 9 of them in a chevron formation. Then from the Chevron formation they formed 2 separate circles and still moved at the same steady - fast speed. The individual craft (I&#39;m assuming) rotated around into circles for about 10 seconds then quickly reverted back to the chevron formation.  I told my mother to look at it and she saw it at the moment that they were moving back into the Chevron formation.   I would say that they were flying at a higher altitude than jets and it took them only about 40 to 60 seconds to leave our line of sight.  The reflection of the almost-full moon made them easy to spot, but faint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I, together with Dr. Roger Leir, Peter Gersten, Mr. Terry Burris, and many others,  were personal witness to a similar event over Laughlin, NV, on Saturday, February 27, 1999.  In addition, however, there are many migratory birds over the same area, which is the cause of many sightings from this area.  We do not know what the witnesses observed on that night, but the fact that the objects apparently formed a circle seems to us to militate against migratory birds.  PD))<n>

You could here a very faint humming sound. And there seemed to be a little mist or haze like around it. We didn&#39;t know what to think it could be. After a while in one corner there was 2 lights that shone, one bright white and the other was bright red. They flashed as the object slowly started to move away, then in a bright flash of light it was gone. And there was a small trail of light left behind but then it soon faded.<n>

They said it wasnt cold out so why were they showing up?  I told them the higher you go the colder it gets.  That is ho you can tell if a jet is real high or if it is low.  We then saw a smaller crat (UFO) that appeared to be higher than the jet.  The jet was flying west and the smaller craft was heading north and it crossed behind the jet.  I thought it was kind of weird for a small plane to be that high and continued to watch it.  I was steering the boat we were on and turned to make sure we werent going to hit anything and turned around and looked to continue to watch it and didnt see it anywhere.  The craft wasn&#39;t flying mach 1 or anything like that so it couldn&#39;t have flown out of sight.  The jet was still visible but yet the other object had seemed to just disappear.  The object was dark gray in color, cigar shaped, and it looked like it had two big circles on the side.  There was no contrail behind it.<n>

Object was seen for up to 30 mintues high up over south downtown SF.Bright shiny object<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are  entertainers  for kids and  was playing at a brithday party.My name is  ((initials deleted)) .and my wife name is ((name deleted)).When we  finished the party and started to pack up my partner and wife in the act asked me what was that in the sky. My self and another guy said we did not know.At first the 3 of us  thought it was a ballon,but we agreed that ballons don&#39;t hovverThen we went through the usual supects,a plane, helicopter. At that point others begin to become interested in the object .We were in San Franciso close to downtown.We were in a backyard of a rec center,facing the bay. To the left of us if we&#39;re facing the bay was  the south part of downtown SF. This is where we saw this object sitting still in the sky.It was really high up in the sky so i decided to go and get my binoculars.I zoomed in as close as i could.It looked  like a shining egg just sitting there by this time some 5 mintues had past.Other witnesses started to use the binoculars,they describe a similar sighting. Older kids maybe ages 12 -15 took a look.I knew their eyes was better than mine .They reported seeing a red fireball.I was stunned.We all Begin to take looks, by this time the damn thing begin to move slowly toward the direction of the Bay Bridge. It was still pretty high because i remember first thinking it was a star in the daytime.Anyway I was looking but i did not really see it move, it was like you know it move but when?Next thing we know it had change locations.This is about 15 minutes into this sighting.Once it took another location i took another look and i swear it had lights on the outside of the object flashing.I must confess that i am a Peter Davenport and Art Bell fan but i did&#39;nt expect to see this.At arms length i could not cover this object up.By this time most everyone knew  something special was going on.Then all of a sudden there were 2 objects.It was like it had split into. All concerned were amazed. This was about 20 mintues into the ordeal.Of course out of all the years we&#39;ve been doing family events this is maybe th! e first time no one had a video camera at the party.At this the second object started to curise right above our heads.One little girl started to say this is scareing me.If it was it 1oclock over the Bay Bridge it headed  toward 4or 5oclock over our heads.When it was right over our heads i took a look in the binoculars and i saw a red plusating craft.I felt really strange. It really hit me that we could be witnessing other dimensions.Most people had that feeling.Anyway the 2nd object headed our way pasted over and went about what seem to be another 2 miles away hovvering over some trees.While the 1st object is still over the direction of the Bay Bridge.The 2nd object over the trees is just there and then it seems the 2nd object spilt into 3rd object but only briefly,maybe once or twice. After about  5mintues or so the 2nd just vanished.Now with our breath taken away, we focused our attention on the first object.It was still there but one weird thing was . We could see the object with our naked eyes as before but now when we tried to see the object in the binoculars we could not find it.It seemed transparent,strange. Then we looked away for a few seconds and looked back and it was gone.We were lost for words.30 mintues is a long time to witness a sighting.We just wonder did anyone else see it. All the people at this party were just regular folks,bringing their kids to a party.WHAT A PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<n>

Another unidentified flying object appeared at first to the rear and below the two commercial aircraft.  The commercial aircrafts emitted a clearly visible vapor trail.  The UFO did not.  The UFO seemed to be flying faster than the commercial aircraft due to the fact that it appeared to &#34;pass&#34; the commercial aircraft.  After watching all aircrafts for about a minute we took our eyes off of it to check the time.  When we looked up again the UFO had disappeared but the two commercial aircrafts were still visible.<n>

It seemed like it was changing color from red to bluish white and possibly green.  We got out our binoculars to get a closer look. Through the binoculars it appeared as though there was a smaller light (bluish in color) moving up and down underneath the original light.  Both of the lights were twinkling and changing color. The original light hasn&#39;t moved but our son also saw another little bluish light at the 7o&#39;clock position.  My boyfriend said that while I was filling out this form it appeared as though a very dim &#34;shooting star&#34; came out of the original light.  The shooting star moved down and to the right of the original light and looked kind of like a firework fizzled out.  There were a few aircraft in the sky but not near the light we saw. It is a very clear night tonight and we can see lots of stuff in the sky, stars etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Addition to Vancouver lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> After filling out my initial form I went to your homepage and the picture of the lights seen in Gilbert in July that look alot like what we saw.

9/15/00 22:45|Idaho Falls|ID|Chevron|2 to 3 minutes|Fast, low flying, Boomerang, no sound!|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33033.html|155|ndxe200009| Fast, low flying, Boomerang, no sound!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live 1/4 mile East of the South end of the local airport, there was a 22:25 evening arrival every night.  I was standing on my driveway looking South when I saw what looked like the landing lites of the evening flight of a Boeing 737.  As the object continued in from the South it was not decending as it normally would so I watched to see what was going on (at this time I looked at my watch to see if it was the regular flight at 22:25 P.M.) After checking the time (now 22:45) I was courious as to what was flying so low but not continuing to decend as usual.  As the craft approached I began to see its shape, it was a Boomerang or Delta wing shape.  I looked to be no more than 500 or 600 feet off the ground, the wing span was about 200 feet and each wing tip was fitted with a winglette which extended 90 degrees virtically maybe 10 or 15 feet. Each winglette was fitted with what looked like little windows or lites simular in size to a 1 ft by 4 ft floresent lite.  The leading edge of the underside of the wings on each side had 3 rowes of simular windows or lites the first row had 4 end to end the second row had 3 end to end, row 3 had 2 end to end.  The craft was flying about 10 degrees West of due North and eventually disappeared from view.  The craft had no markings, no blinking lites on the wing tips or the under side of the craft only two forward facing lites that appeared to be landing lites.  I watched it fly from South to Notrht for 2 to 3 minutes.  This craft made no sound and flew very fast!  I would venture it was Military.  Since I hang out with the Delta ground crew I ask them if they had seen it, they said they were busy with the evening flight and didn&#39;t notice it.  I tryed to contact the FAA tower people but they did not return my calls.  It was very interesting to see, I wonder if anyone else has seen something simular?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The light was steady and I thought as usual it was a plane from Balt-Wash Int. Airport.  So as I was going inside the house I looked again and the light had not moved in 15 seconds.  As I watched in amazement, the light suddenly became smaller and smaller, and suddenly as if a light switch was pulled, went out completely.  What kind of scares me is that someone else sent in a sighting to you 1 year and 1 day ago, and the address is right down the street from here on Crumpton South in Laurel, Md.  I kept looking and looking but nothing ever happened after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This sighting seems reminiscent to us of a sighting of a bright satellite.  As a satellite enters the Earth&#39;s shadow, it slowly fades from sight in a few seconds, just as this witness describes.  Just a guess, since we did not see the object.  PD))<n>

What we saw was a point of light coming over the mountain, moving at a fair rate of speed. As it came over the mountain, the object emitted a multi colored flash of light. It then proceeded to drop and rise in elevation, change course at angles greater than 90 degrees, coming to a dead stop and starting again. It traveled from west to east and appeared to originate from the White Sands area, which is just west of Sierra Blanca. After about 2 minutes of viewing its travel, we observed it turning to the northwest and the light became too dim to see. About 10 minutes later, we observed another point of light crossing over the mountain, coming from the same area as the first object. This object performed much of what the first one did, but in a more subdued manner. About halfway across the sky, this object also pointed north and became very dim and eventually dissappeared from view.<n>

It&#39;s fire tail disapated and the object continued to glow that orange-yellow color. We have seen many such objects but this one appeared to be in distress.  It just didn&#39;t look right.  Fearing that it would crash we headed East on the nearest side road.  The object was on the North side of this road, but its path took it across the road as it was headed in an East/SouthEast direction.  We estimated where this object would &#34;fall&#34; or intended to land, and raced East down Hwy. 60, to the city of Mulberry, about 12 miles away.  We saw nothing else that night, but what we saw the next day will make me wonder just what we saw for the rest of my life.  Just outside the city of Mulberry, we saw police and military personnel manning the perimiters of an abandoned phosphate mine and trainyard(across from IMC Rainbow Phosphate Co.)   There were over 20 marked police vehicles(state and local), atleast the same number of unmarked police/federal vehicles, and four canvas covered military cargo trucks.  There were over 60 soldiers in fatigues holding M-16&#39;s securing the area.  I know a woman who lives in that area, and on her way home that day she was turned away and asked to take another route home due to an enraged man with a gun that was threating to take his own life, and the life of his daughter.  None of these activities were reported on any of the local news channels.  I am convinced that what we witnessed was a UFO crash recovery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/15/00 19:45|Wister|OK|Triangle|30 seconds|Observed a dark colored, unlighted triangular object apparently following a turboprop commuter airplane.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14222.html|167|ndxe200009| Observed a dark colored, unlighted triangular object apparently following a turboprop commuter airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out on my patio relaxing and watching aircraft pass over my home.  There is a busy air corridor that passes over my home, probably mostly Chicago - Dallas traffic. I enjoy watching the aircraft pass by.  About 7:45pm I noticed an airplane I believe to have been a twin turboprop commuter plane (maybe a Brasilia) traveling the usual flight pattern from northeast to southwest.  I am not a good judge of elevation, but I would guess the plane was at 9,000 to 12,000ft.  The sun was down and it was dusk so I could see the usual red, green and white strobe lights on the airplane.  I could hear the plane faintly.  The plane passed behind a tree in my yard and I watched to see it come from behind the tree.  The airplane came into sight again and after a moment, I noticed a dark, triangular object that appeared to be following the airplane. The object did not display any lights and was behind the airplane at an apparent distance of about the width of my hand at arms length.  It appeared to be at the same elevation as the airplane and of similar size.  My first thought was that I might be seeing a large bird that just happened to be gliding along a similar course as the airplane, but after a few seconds I could see that it was not a bird.  It then occurred to me that I might be seeing a shadow cast by the airplane on the thin clouds.  There was also a contrail that was thinning out and creating some cirrus-type clouds.  The clouds were thin and broken and a lot of brighter stars were becoming visible.  I observed that there was no direct sunlight striking the airplane and that the angle was wrong to be some kind of shadow.  I concluded that the object was some kind of triangular craft and that it was indeed following the airplane.  There was a denser contrail running north-northwest to south-southeast and the airplane crossed this contrail as it continued southwest. When the triangular object crossed the contrail it disappeared.  It was suddenly just not there anymore.  I carefully watched behind the airplane until it was out of sight but I did not see the object again.  Since the airplane was approaching the lighter part of the western sky, the object should have been more readily visible the further west they traveled, but the object was just not there anymore and I did not see it again.  The airplane maintained a straight course southwest until out of sight.  As for the triangular object, it was dark and I could not see any details, other than it was triangular in shape, it was similar in size to the airplane, it did not display any lights, and I did not hear any sound that I associated with it.  It did not appear black, but rather a dark charcoal color around the perimeter and a lighter gray in the center.  This difference in color was not sharply delineated.  About fifteen to twenty minutes after I saw the object, a large jet aircraft came from the northwest and virtually bisected the point where the object disappeared. The jet then curved from a southeast course to a south-southeast course and moved rapidly out of sight.  It may just have been a coincidence, but if the jet had been sent to the area to look for the object, its most likely point of origin would have been Tinker AFB near Oklahoma City.  Curiously, the jet left a contrail across the night sky that seemed to glow softly and the contrail persisted for almost an hour.  That is all that I recall about the incident.  I hesitated to report it, but maybe someone else saw it and will report it as well.  I do not believe the triangular object was an F-117 or a B-2.  I have seen both of these aircraft in flight more than once and really don&#39;t think it could have been either one.  I would not be surprised to know that it was some kind of secret aircraft, but I can&#39;t imagine why it would be following an airplane in a relatively busy air lane.  I also can&#39;t imagine how it could have vanished like it did.<n>

They were dark.  I had just crossed Cherry Hill where there is an open view because of fields.  The sky ahead was cloudless and blue with large, puffy, dark clouds to the west and lighter ones to the east, but these &#34;objects&#34; were against clear blue sky.  They caught my eye because they were moving so fast from east to west (crossing Sheldon Rd. and seemingly traveling parallel to Ford Rd. which is a very heavily travelled road) and so low that I could see two of them, one flying in front of the other.  I live approximately 10 miles from Detroit Metropolitan Airport and see planes flying all the time, and less than 6 miles from Willow Run Airport whose flight path is directly over my house and these objects were not planes.  Planes never fly that low, east to west, around here.  These objects were too high, too big and too fast to be birds.  As I continued to travel north, and they to the west, it looked as if there were really three distinct objects with space between them with the first one hiding the one in the middle until I was farther north to see it.  Then they went behind the trees and out of my sight.  When I got to Ford Rd. I looked to the west but couldn&#39;t see a thing.  Then I turned west and parked in a large strip mall lot to search the skies, but I could not see a thing.  I looked at my van&#39;s clock and the time was 7:06 p.m. Eastern Standard time.  The next day, I drove the same route to measure the distance from where I first saw the objects and the distance to Ford Rd.  It was seven tenths of a mile.<n>

It was around seven o&#39;clock in the evening and the sun was going down. The sky was a grey blue. Exactly straight above my head, I noticed a dot of light in the sky. At first we thought is was a satelite catching the sun from the west (which would have been weird to see at that time with it being so bright outside.) At first it was moving from northwest to southeast. We couldn&#39;t figure for the life of us what it was and could only think it maybe was a satelite until it dead stopped and changed direction - to go south. Considering  how far away it was, it had to be moving REALLY fast, and there was no trail.  Then it stopped dead again for about a minute.  The it changed direction completely and started moving northwest. Because it was so high up and moving into the light of the setting sun, we lost sight of it about a minute and a half later. We tried to videotape it, but the object was too small and close in color to the sky to pick it up on video.<n>

It appeared like a normal bright evening star until it started to waver!  I stopped my car to look at it.  It then divided into 3 or 4 lights ( I can&#39;t remember) They flew uniform distance apart.  I kept looking for blinking lights, as an aircraft would have, but saw none.  The three or four lights were not as bright as the original one star I first saw.  They were more of an even glow, no real color that I recollect.   I heard no sound. They appeared to be flying closer and closer towards the earth until they turned and flew to the north and then they just disappeared.  They seemed to be flying extremely fast.  Distance is so hard to judge with light, so I have no idea how far away they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 2000 is approximate.  PD))<n>

The center lights were brighter than the lights on either end. We first thought it may a plane but the lights were too bright. They were as bright as the lights in a sports stadium and it wasnt completely dark outside. We drove east to get a better look and ended up below the object. It was triangular and had approx 8-10 very bright lights shinig down. The object hovered in one place for about 30 seconds without moving. There was no noise form the object. It then rotated and left very quickly in a northeasterly direction. The rear of the object had only two  red lights, one on each side, which were flashing. The object vanished within seconds.<n>

I was unloading my car when I turned to go back to the cabin and looked up in the sky to the South and saw the unusual lights. I 1st thought what I was seeing was a flight of hellicopters because planes would not be moving so slowly but then I realized their was no sound. I shouted for my brother in law &#34;Crawford, look&#34; and pointed him to the lights. What we saw was a series of ~5-6 lights lined up in an edge straight row at ~3,500 feet above ground. the lights moved in unison, silent and moving slowly from West to East. I am certain of the altitude because from out vantage point their are a series of ridges, one being mallardy (sic) ridge that show elevations on topographic maps as 3,200 - 3,500 feet above sea level. I have taken a daylight picture of the spot from where I 1st saw the lights pointed at the ridges and can provide that upon request. MY brother inlaw found lated that several others had locally reported seeing a large craft with the lights we saw moving accross Whidby island to the West of our location then over puget sound to the West of Whidby Island then over Marysville/Everett area and on to the East of Granite Falls past out location. I can better pinpoint the date &amp; time once I have an opportunity to look at our Cabin sign in log book from that night and then can pretty well pinpoint the date &amp; Time. The best discription I have found that closely matches what I and others saw that night is to view the video from the Phoenix lights. We did not see a Triangular shape. Rather we just say perhaps one side of such a craft edge on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to finally report this unusual sighting after watching the Peter Jenings UFO report last night on ABC KOMO TV<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was a cool autumn day, with clear blue skies and no clouds, and lots of sunshine.  There was a bit of wind, as I recall.  I looked up and saw a white puff of cloud appear, like a firework...but there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, a white hemispherical shape came out of the smoke, with a white/metallic cone underneath it, pointing down, and seemingly separate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself, &#34;This looks like a model rocket nose-cone with a parachute, I remember making those.&#34;  However, I saw no indication that a model rocket had been launched (they leave smoke trails.)   I slowly realized that this object was actually much larger and further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My estimates are that the bowl shape was 100ft across, at a height of 750ft to 1000ft above ground.  I puzzled over why it was hovering in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, to my surprize, the cone began to rotate around underneath the bowl shape, clockwise if you were looking up at it from the ground.  It acted as if it were connected to the rim and remained pointing down.  There was a hazy dark cloudy spot between the cone and the bowl shape, like a field of some kind.  The cone spun around at a rate of 3 to 4 times per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the whole unit turned on its side at right angles to the ground, and proceeded due south at an estimated acceleration of 1000km/s (100 Gs!!!).  The cone continued to rotate around the rim as if attached to the bottom of the bowl the whole time it did this.  It was on the horizon and out of sight in less than 4 seconds.  Then, mysteriously, there was a second puff of smoke where the first had been, as if something closed behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in broad daylight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I am a drummer and had just packed up my gear and was heading home.  We had played at a place called ‘Rosie’s’ in Harrington.  I lived in Wilbur Washington. I have not drank nor done drugs since May 28th, 1998.  I have a full time day job, music is my hobby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 2:30am and I was traveling toward Hiway 20 ((sic.  Route 2)) on a back road from Harrington that comes out by the power transformer station (I guess that’s what it is) onto Hiway 20 west of the Davenport Refuse Transfer Station.  I think the back road is called Rocklyn Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my Ford van which had a big windshield.  I glanced out the driver side window and noticed a huge jet black triangle shaped object outlined against the clear night sky.  It had one small red light in the very center.  This red light did not blink.  This object was moving very slow towards Spokane, Washington.  I pulled over to get a better look.  Even though it was dark out, I could distinctly see this object.  It was huge.  About 300 feet long, maybe 200 feet across the back.  The sides went straight up about 40 feet.  I rolled down my window (I did not get out of the van because I was pretty freaked out by now) and it made absolutely no sound.  I sat and watched as it slowly passed in front of my van.  It was about 200-300 feet off the ground.  It took about 15 minutes to pass in front of me if that tells you how slow it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed my van I saw 5 very big square lights across the back of it.  They spanned the full width across the back as well as went almost from the top to bottom of the object.  I am absolutely sure there were five lights because there was a dark line between each of them.  These lights were intensely bright.  Even though they were bright, they didn’t seem to give off light outside the object itself.  They didn’t seem to light anything up.  I thought to myself, &#34;Llights that bright should throw some light onto the ground,&#34;  but they didn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as it silently disappeared from my view.  My heart was pounding and I was scared to death.  The next day I told some friends.  They immediately told me I was seeing things.  I know what I saw.  I have no reason to make up story like this.  I don’t care if anybody believes me or not.  I know what I saw.  I will never forget it.  I was going to send this report in several years ago, but could never get myself to push the send button.  Seeing  that you are now located at Davenport, I thought if nothing else you should know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to pinpoint where I actually was that night because of the darkness.  I was probably 5-6 miles out of Harrington heading toward hiway 20.  ((sic.  Route 2))   I know I had passed where there is a Y in the road.   For the life of me I can&#39;t remember how long it was untill I came upon one of the old farm houses after I watched it.  Like I said I was very freaked out by then.  We usually played every other weekend at Rosies.  We always played the first and third weekend of the month.  My best guess would be August 19, 2000.  Rosies has closed since then but I could talk to to the other band members and see if they remember the exact date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept running it through my mind the rest of the way home and do not remember much of the surroundings after that.  I kept asking myself things like &#34;could it have been a helecopter?&#34;  Then I would remind myself just how big this thing was and how it made no noise.  So then I thought maybe a balloon.  Again, it was so big and so quiet with absolutely no blinking warning lights, just the small red light on the bottom in the center.  I ruled out balloon.  Maybe a big plane from fairchild?  It would have fallen out of the sky it was moving so slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always had this missconception that UFO&#39;s were round, saucer shaped objects.  That UFO&#39;s darted about then hovered, then darted about some more.  This did not fit that category at all. In my wildest dreams I would never have thought of them as being triangle shaped.  I always thought of them as being lit up with multicolored lights.  Again, only the small red light and the 5 sqaure lights across the back.  This object was totally black.  No lights on the sides.  I thought they would make humming or whirring sounds.  There was complete silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept questioning myself about the 5 lights across the back.  They did not fit the norm for lights that bright.  If you were to look at 2 bright headlights that are 2-3 feet apart, you would see two distinct bright points of light.  The light from those two headlights would join at a distance and you would probably not be able to see a distinct gap between them unless you were standing right next to them. From a distance they would blend together.  The gaps between the 5 bright lights on this object were very distinct.  Even at a distance.  The light formed definite edges that were perfectly straight.  I mentioned in my letter to you that they were square.  Actually they were more rectangular.  Taller than they were wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 51 years old and have never in my life seen anything that even remotely resembled what I saw that night.  It defied all logic.  The only thing that could move that slow and stay in the air would be a balloon.  This was not a balloon.  I can not tell you exactly how big it was because I had no reference points.  In the darkness I could not see buildings or trees, just the outline of the hills.  I can tell you that my Ford Van was a 1989 E250 Custom van.  It had a big front windshield and that at one point this object completely filled it.  This object was probably 400-600 feet directly in front of me and 200-300 feet off the ground at that moment.  It was very, very big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This expierience has changed the way I think. I don&#39;t take things for granted anymore.  I don&#39;t believe that just because the Theory of Relativity states we can not travel  faster than the speed of light, we can&#39;t travel faster the speed of light.  I am full of &#34;What If&#39;s and Why&#39;s&#34;  What if we simply do not have a calculation that would prove that theory wrong?  What if a life form millions of years older than ourselves had the capability to travel through space at speeds we can&#39;t begin to imagine?  Only 500 years ago people would have said you were crazy to think it possible to talk to someone  5000 miles away instantly in real time.  Why do scientist&#39;s and engineers continue to develop ways to travel faster if it&#39;s not possible to travel faster than the speed of light?  Even at the speed of light things are simply so far away it would do us no good.  I believe they are hoping the Theory of Reletivity is also wrong. The universe is huge. Just because we can&#39;t do it, does not mean another  much older inteligent life form can&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As humans I believe now that we are self centered and very, very small in the grand scheme of things. I believe that we have conditioned ourselves to think if we can&#39;t do it, it can&#39;t be done.  I believe if we can imagine it, eventually it will be done.  I also believe something, a life form or entity, whatever, just beat us to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stated, I don&#39;t care if anybody believes me.  I know what I saw and nobady will ever convince me otherwise.  I know in my heart that the object I saw that night, was NOT from this planet.  As for my credibility... take a drive to Wilbur, go into Sandy&#39;s family foods.  I worked there 10 years as a shift supervisor, ask them.  Everybody in Wilbur knows me.  I am not a publicity seeker and have nothing to gain by making up a story such as this.  I have palyed music proffesionally for over 30 years and have had all the publicity a person would ever want.  My wife and I are very private people, almost to point of being hermits.  I just wanted you to know what I had seen in your area.  I will draw you a picture of what I saw if you would like and attach it to an email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and he has appeared on the Jeff Rense Radio Program, to tell his story.  The witness seems to us to be a quite sober-minded individual, and we find his description of the event to be quite convincing.  PD))<n>

He had the classic grey big head, but has short and stocky and about 3&#39; but probabley weighed 80lbs.  He had no clothes and he was waddling across the road right in front of us.  When he make it to the other side, as soon as it was stepping on the curb, he was gone.  It happened so quick and it was so unbelievably freaky we made an agreement not to talk to anyone about this.

I was contemplating life before I went to bed. I heard a noise that sounded like a plain at cruising altitude high in the sky. I turned my head up to the right and saw a light then I looked back down as my first impression was plain in the sky no big deal. After a second or two once my mind re-analyzed the image my head spun around and looked back with my mind already racing. Low and behold there was a saucer shaped craft that was about 30 to 50 feet in diameter and maybe 20 feet high hovering along at about 10 to 15 miles per hour. The altitude was very low maybe 50 to 100 feet. I remember looking at the tree in the yard and thinking it was about double the hight of the tree. The tree was a little higher than the building was a typical two storry aprtment building with a low slopping roof. I think it was about 30 feet hight or so. I just started at it very closely trying to make out the details on the body of it. I remember creases in the exterior where doors could have been. It had lights on top which I think where blue and/or red and it had three white lights on the bottom which formed a triangle. The lights on the bottom where pretty big but I don&#39;t remember them being very bright but I could be wrong about this. I was trying to concentrate on the details of the exterior which I could see because I was so close. It entered to the right of my balcony and flew across the back yard of the building and crossed over the top to my left. The building is in an L shape at about 45 degrees. So it passed over the back of the building which is the acute angle side of the building. As soon as it passed from view I ran inside and grabbed my video camera which was sitting on the cough (very cool) I ran outside and downstair out the front of the building and into the parking lot. By this time it was about 200 feet away heading away from me at the same speed, 10 to 15 mph I would estimate maybe slower. I was scrambling to get the video camera on the right setting and powered on and zoomed into the object and at the same time trying to see the object with my other eye so I didn&#39;t miss anything. Well by the time I got the video camera working it was to far away. It looked like a street light from a few hundred feet away. I had a really good zoom so I was zooming in way to far. Well you get the idea I didn&#39;t manager to get it on tape. The object made a low rumbling noise which was pretty quiet. Like I said it sounded like a jet at very high altitude at first. I did not see any exterial signs of propulsion. There was no smoke or trail of any kind and I did not smell anything either. I definitely had some type of vertical thrust acting on it because it was going so slow and it was saucer shaped. Right after the incident I went inside and spent the next 4 hours researching on the internet. I found pictures of UFO&#39;s on the internet that looked very similar to what I saw. I reported this incident that night to http://www.aliens111.com. I got an email back from them a few day later asking to put my report on their web site. I told them that was fine just leave my name off. I just emailed them again to see if they could dig up my report because it could contain details that I have forgotten or maybe identify some inconsitancies with this report I am filing now, which is my current memory of events. Thanks for listening and keep up the great work. I became aware of your web site from Jeff Rense. I was listening to his radio and heard you call for more reports so I figured I would take the time to send you mine...:-)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed a blimp, but that is only a guess.

9/14/00 21:00|Portland|OR|Triangle|2-3 minutes|Triangular shaped object viewed through a telescope after initial sighting by 4 adults.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14124.html|184|ndxe200009| Triangular shaped object viewed through a telescope after initial sighting by 4 adults.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting outside on a deck at an approximate elevation of 400-500 feet above the Wilamette river looking to the East, 4 adults including myself witnessed an object crossing over head slightly South of our position. It moved at rapid speed from west to East toward the river. We discussed it&#39;s speed and at first thought it to be a satellite however as we watched it pass without sound we agreed it was too close to be a satellite. At this point the object slowed considerably to what looked looked like a stop and apeared to have some color qualities. At this point approximately 45 seconds after our first sighting, I became more puzzled as to what the object might be. It was too fast for conventional aircraft, made no noise and now had stopped. The sky was overcast but the object was visible the entire time. It had stopped approximately over Mt Scott at which time I asked my brother in law if he had binoculars, he said ther was a telescope inside. It was just inside and on a tripod. I quickly brought it outside to the edge of the deck. The object was still stationary and as i began to look it apeared to turn brightlights directly our direction. I was able to get approximately a 4 to 7 second clear look at the object. I was actually  shocked to see see the object through the telescope so clearly. It was not an airplane. It had a bright red light at the top of a triangular shape with many smaller lights running at angles down the sides creating the shape of a triangle. It actually looked more like a cone with small strings of lights running from the top point of the triangle down to the base. It was not moving very much toward the north so my brief vision was amazingly clear. When a actually realized what I was looking at was not an aircraft, I simply said to the group just that, &#34;that&#39;s not a plane&#34;, it then moved to a point where it was obstructed by the house in front of us. I ran with the telescope 1 short block to a view spot at the end of the street where there was a 180 degree view looking East, bu! t was un able to find the object again. I could see however all the incoming aircraft to Portland international. There is actually a good deal of aircraft activity visible from both the deck and from the end of the block. It was easy to compare what I had seen to the other aircraft and I became even more clear the differences between what I saw and the aircraft in the area, both looking through the telescope and to the naked eye. A strange feeling indeed.<n>

So, if this does get published, I want to say that there is &#34;NO DOUBT&#34; in my mind asd to what I saw! I&#39;ll get to it, then say my thoughts on the matter on a whole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving twards birmingham al, on a slight up-hill twards a ridge(small to med height), a silver glowing object (substantially large) came over the crest at my &#34;2-oclock&#34; and landed approx. where a mall area is. another went into the air and assended with &#34;great speed&#34;. To be more specific, it didnt go too far into the air(200-300 ft) before it really shot away!. what was comming twards me(the driver of the car didnt see it) was moving &#34;as if it had leaped the mountain top&#34; and came down very knowingly and controlled. I even saw the silver color hit the ground at the ridge. Therefor, I say it was 2 that i saw, though not at the same time. seemed like one came and the other left. I was very scared! i thought that a missle was comming or something. I don&#39;t know when the fear left and the realization began, but I sure didnt stop the car or tell the driver till we were well away. he was a bit mad about it, but I know better than to mess with what I dont know about. well, that&#39;s it. no weird dreams or sudden realizations of an &#34;antimatter energy&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were camping on the Steens Mountains for sight seeing and picture taking.  We drove to the top of the fault block mountain at approximately 9500&#39; and sat on rocks to take a video and picture of the rising full moon. We were sitting on rocks on the edge of a virtual cliff with the Alvord Desert and remote roadless desert 3000&#39; below looking east. Video and pictures of the large rising moon were taken.  My wife noticed lights on or near the ground while I was doing this. They were approxiamately 10 miles east of us and a little north of the moon rise.  At first glance they looked like headlights from a cars on a highway.  We had been at this vantage point several times before in years past and there were never any lights.  Also, the area in that direction is only accessable by 4 wheel drive and very rugged with isolated cliffs, valley&#39;s and sagebrush. We began to focus the camera, video camera and binoculars on these lights.  My wife watched mostly through the binoculars while I took about a 10 minute video.  Also, a 10 minute exposure by camera with a 200mm telephoto lense. The observations lasted about 2 hours until we became cold and went back to camp a few miles away. The cluster of lights to the right had a red strobe light in the center.  They were the size of peas held at arms length and amber. My wife referred to them as a &#34;string of lights&#34; as there were about 10+ lights on either side of the red light, moving slowly from left to right. Somtimes they appeared to not move at all. The lights, except the red one, would disappear at once, then reappear seconds to minutes later. As they moved very slowly left to right more would suddenly appear just to the left of the red light and the process repeated. Just a little north of this activity (several hundred yards? a mile?) were more lights, 1-8 at a time moving around doing various manovers. They were on or slightly above ground, never going obove the horizon. Sometimes they created triangles with just 3 lights other times triangles with 2 lights in each corner. One time, with about 10 lights visible, all went dark for about a minute, then suddenly three brighter lights were seen one on top of the other with a definate space in between each light.  This lasted several minutes before they disappeared and other lights reappeared. Wish I had more video but ran out of film after 10 minutes.  Amber, red and green lights show on the photo.  We never saw green lights when we were there. The lights are in streaks because of the 10 minute photo duration. There was just so much activity in &#34;a middle of no where&#34; place.<n>

I grabed for my glasses to look closer as I was driving and it was not a balloon, plane or anything else I had ever seen. It appeared to be hovering about 10 miles away and I would say maybe 10,000 feet high.  This item did not move.  I watched it as I continued to go over the bridge thinking I would pull , I glanced down at the traffic, looked back up and it had completely disappeared.

I took some still photographs of the object but ran out of film. Plus I was shaking so bad I know those photos probably won&#39;t be that good. So I hauled butt upstairs and got the video camera. I got to film this object for at least three minutes before it passed over the roof of the townhome. The battery to the camera was dead so I had to use the ac adapter and film it out of the window. After it passed overhead I went downstairs and watched it for another five minutes. It floated and move very high in the sky and appeared to stop, but it continued to rotate. I could clearly see it rotate and change color from white to like a brownish color. I could have contiued to watch, but it was very sunny and my neck was hurting from looking up so long, so I went back inside. Later I was having a smoke out of the window when I noticed another plane leaving a trail in the sky I noticed high up to the west another of these strange objects, so I ran downstairs and tried to image that object as well. But it was too small and the camera would not focus on the blue sky. But I can verify it was the same thing, It was rotating and changing color like the other object, it might have been the same one. I saw it rotate to my left and it dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not understand how witnesses are able to distinguish the alleged &#34;chemtrails&#34; from genuine contrails.  However, this fact may not have any bearing on the other aspects of the report.  PD))<n>

As I went to stop and position my car to get a better look at the object, it took off to the south-east rotation as it, seems as I stopped, It new someone was watching it! The sky behind this object was somewhat fogged, this may it hard to determined the distance away the object was, just guessing about 300 - 450 yards away! Windows were down in my car and no sound or any thing was heard as the object left the air port and the area!<n>

There was a bank of intense lights in the front of the triangular, black craft.  What was most spectacular was the absence of any noise.  The second sighting was the same craft landing on an airfield at Wright Patterson AFB.  At 4am two such craft were seen going away from Wright Patterson AFB, again flying very low, soundless and huge, each the size of a football field.  There was a bank of lights on the front of the craft.  These crafts are completely soundless, traveling at a velocity too slow to keep such a vehicle of that size airborn.  This suggests that the military is flying a craft using a new form of propulsion not using fossil fuels.<n>

I&#39;ve watched the skies for a week now and last night (9/13/00) they were back. My husband and I saw the first object last night at 9 p.m. in the clear SSE sky. Tiny and un-moving like a star, but visibly blinking red, green and white lights. We searched the sky for any other objects and found 2 identical objects at the NE and WNW sky. We watched these objects fixed in this triangle formation for 3 hrs. until they were obscured by overcast clouds. Except for their position, these objects were identical to the objects seen 7 days ago and like last week&#39;s sighting, there were an unusally high number of other aircraft flying about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably &#34;twinkling&#34; stars, or other celestial bodies, we feel.

I told her to bring her little binoculars out so we could look at the moon, planes or any UFOs. I brought my bigger binoculars out as well. I was talking on the telephone and looking at a plane that caught my eye. Well, I pointed it out to my daughter and as I turned around I happened to look above me. Well lo and behold there was a silent, cigar shaped object gliding along from west to east. It had no wings, was solid as I could see it blotting out the stars that should have been thru it. It had one steady white light (with a slight yellowish cast to it) on either end of it. When I looked thru the binoculars I could also see a dimmer solid red light towards the back about 3/4 of the way. While not viewed with the binoculars, it seemed to have a slight haze arpound it, like perhaps anothe rbrighter light on top that I could not make out from the bottom. It was apparently at a fairly high altitude. When I saw it right over me, it was equal to about 3 to 3 and a hlaf thumb nails wide ( at arms length)   there was no noise that could be heard, although at its percieved altitude, the sound if it had any probably could not have been heard. The plane was headed generally southeast and looked like it was at a lower altitude (note I didnt notice any noise associated with it either.) The plane seemed to not take any notice of the other object whatsoever. My daughter (shes 6 so not the best observer however) and I both saw it as did my sister (40) because I opened the door and shouted to come out quick quick quick! She saw it as two white lights traveling along (the red light was only noticeable with the binocs) My binoculars are Bushnell Ensign Wide Angle. They are 7 x 35 (500 feet at 1000 yards)<n>

FROM OUR DECK WE CAN WATCH (WITH BINOCULARS) THE PIKES PEAK HILL CLIMB,THE FIREWORKS SET ON JAN 1 AND JULY 4, TOURISTS AND RANGERS DRIVING UP AND DOWN THE PEAK HIGHWAY. WE WENT OUT TO WATCH THE RISING OF THE FULL MOON OVER THE PEAK (WHICH IS QUITE AWESOME)- AS WE WERE WAITING FOR THE MOONRISE, WE NOTICED WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE TWO ERRATIC FLASHING WHITE LIGHTS (IDENTICAL TO AIRLINE STROBE LIGHTS FLASHING ABOUT ONCE PER SECOND); HOWEVER, THESE WERE MUCH DIFFERENT- THEY FLASHED IN ONE LOCATION (ALL WITHIN THE AREA OF A FINGERNAIL HELD AT ARMS LENGTH) THEN WOULD JUMP TO ANOTHER LOCATION AND THEN TO ANOTHER FOR THE NEXT FLASH AND SO ON--WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE A FORMATION OF MILITARY PLANES BUT RULED THAT OUT WHEN THERE WAS NO DIRECTIONAL HEADING AND INDEED EXCEEDINGLY ERRATIC-FOR THE LIGHT GROUPING.  WE LIVE DIRECTLY UNDER A TRANSCONTINENTAL FLIGHT PATH, SO WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE AIRCRAFT LIGHTS ABOUT 20-30 THOUSAND FEET ABOVE US. (WE ARE AT 9250 FEET.) THE LIGHT PATTERNS DRIFTED OFF TO THE SOUTH OF THE PEAK (TOWARD PUEBLO) AND THEN SHOT BACK TO THE NORTH OF THE PEAK TOWARD THE AIR FORCE ACADAMY. AT THIS POINT WE CONTACTED SOME FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN EAST COLORADO SPRINGS-POSSIBLY 40 MILES AS THE CROW FLIES- AND ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT THE PEAK- BECAUSE THE HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW- AND THEY CONFIRMED WHAT WE SAW.

I made reference to my wife about it and said this is the same thing I had seen before about a month or 2 earlier but she had missed it that time , well she finally saw it , after about 5 seconds it picked up speed and turned direction and was heading upwards now and heading due west in less than 5 seconds it was at the mountain range at the cut through for sidling hill at which time I noticed a second one coming from the south from west virginia. it went to the other one and then there were 4 at the mountain flying up and down at tremendous speeds as darkness began to fall all 4 went straight up turned a glowing orange and disappeared like a bright flame out.<n>

There was no noise. They were in a perfect equalatteral triangle for about five minutes and then the light top light moved down and to the left and they formed an isosceles triangle for about five minutes. They remained stationary directly overhead the entire time. They were below a cirrus cloud layer. It was seen by two male sales associates who had never seen anything similiar before.<n>

When I first saw the object I thought it was a blimp completely illuminated in the distance.  As I drove towards the end of my street, the object became much more clear and the shape became much more defined.  I believe that the object was moving towards my development as I was driving towards the object. The object was a perfect rectangle tilted approximately 20-30 degrees (long axis horizontal).  The object was completely illuminated to the point where all I could see was a white light in the shape of a rectangle.  If I had to guess at a distance I&#39;d say the object was between 1000&#39; and 2500&#39; away from me.  It lit up the sky like a full moon does on a dark night (it was still pitch black outside). I turned onto another street and continued driving while looking out the window at the object.  It was moving parallel to the street I was on and about the same speed (45 mph).  For a split second my line of sight was blocked by some trees.  When I could see again, the object was much farther away (several miles) and all I could see was a very small illuminated rectangle.  I am 30 years old with a wife and two children.  I have a civil engineering degree from VA Tech and have been employed as a transportation engineer for almost 7 years.  I live about 10 miles northwest of Dulles Airport but this object was like no airplane I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

The &#34;chunk&#34; had a heat glow - bright, clear light blue at the edges deepening to a darker blue towards the body of the object and trailed a hazy, glowing, misty tail of faint blue and cream which was twice the length of the object and shaped almost like a candle flame on it&#39;s side.  The body looked metallic and somewhat &#34;crinkled&#34; or angular.  I did not percieve any portion of it as smooth.  The size was approx 1/5 to 1/7 the size of a full Moon.  It cleared the mountain range South-East of my city which is about 7 miles away from my home.  Also, the tail included what I percieved to be sparks.<n>

As I do on any clear night, I started to look at the stars.  From the East, an object which looked like a pen appeared and was moving toward the Detroit River (north from my location).  It began to turn northward just past Casino Windsor which has 5 circulating lights which shine upwards (similar to the lights at an airport).  It appeared as though the object momentarily observed the source of the light from the Casino, and then flew northwards (towards Michigan) between the Casino and the Ambassador Bridge.  Instead of flying in a straight line, the object began to fly in a snake-like pattern until it disappeared from my view.  I wasn&#39;t able to determine the height of this craft because there was absolutely no sound.  There was also a definite glow to the object.  At first I thought this was a reflection of light from either a boat in the Detroit River or from the Casino lights, but the sky was incredibly clear.  My heart began to pound, I began to sweat, and I got the chills  when I finally realized what I saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A similar report was submitted from Houston, TX, for a sighting there on the morning of 08SE00.  It, too, was reported as a long, cylindrical-shaped object that could maneuver.  PD))<n>

I was driving to work (Emergency Call) and I saw a round and extremely bright light suddenly switch on kind of like if you were in a dark room and someone 10 feet away turned on a flashlight and moved it.  It looked to be at least a few miles away from me - my viewing angle must have been ~45 degrees.  It didn&#39;t show a beam in any direction (not from the ground, and no beam emitted from the light in any direction).  It was just a round ball of light.  It made a quick move in the shape of a &#34;J.&#34;  Then it switched off.  It turned back on again a few seconds later and did a &#34;Z&#34; and then turned off.  Seconds later it switched back on, did another upward &#34;Z&#34; and I never saw it again. It never left any sort of trail or tail indicating a meteor. I had even rolled my window down to see if I could hear anything but I was either too far a way to hear or it just didn&#39;t make a sound.  It was just wierd.  Nothing around me or in the car could have done this.  It certainly didn&#39;t look like a spotlight.  There were no clouds around to bounce a light off of anyway. I&#39;m not a crack headed country yocal either.  I am an educated professional.  I have all of my own teeth too!  I just saw a very odd light in the sky that oddly did not have any beam to or from it.  I will speak with anyone about it - ((e-address deleted))<n>

The sky was partly cloudy with the sunseting and thunderstorms moving in from the north-norteast. At first glance this object looked like a long narrow cloud hovering with the setting sun eluminating the object very brightly. As I stood there and stared at this object, it was then that I realized this object was moving. At this time I tried to determine speed and altitude of the object. My best guess would have to be at least at an airliner cruising altitude of 30-40 thousand feet but traveling much slower then any comet or any space debris entering the earth atmosphere I have ever expirence in my liftime. The object made no noise, not that any could or would be heard at that estamated altitude. Left no trailing smoke or any other evedience of any kind of trail, and made no directional changes (up, down or side to side, turning). I dont know if this &#34;sighting&#34; qualifies as a &#34;UFO&#34; sighting (Alein craft) but it sure was an unusual sight in the skies that evening. The TV stations made no reports that evening. I just like to know what this thing was. We lost sight of the object as it moved closer to the horizon and are view was blocked by trees and houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  Our only guess is that the witnesses might have been looking at a high-altitude aircraft, but it would be unusual for one to be visible for 15-20 minutes.  We have no idea what they were looking at.

It did not appear to be moving, but as I continued driving east it dissapeared below the horizon and out of my view as I got closer to it. I then called my neighbor who I thought may have a better unobstructed view from his home, but he was unable to see it. I then drove to his home a mere 2 minutes after the sighting and aquired a pair of binoculers and he and I went back out on the highway to the location at which I first observed it, but it was no longer visible. This was the most unusual and unexplained thing I have ever seen.<n>

At first it looked as if it was not moving at all. Over a period of 3-4 minutes, the object had clearly moved in an upward and easterly direction (approx. at a 45 degree angle from the horizon). This object was very far away. After a couple minutes of wondering what this was, I thought that it could possibly be the space shuttle taking off. Given the vast distance from Florida to Ontario, I did not really think that it would be possible to see. But that is how I would describe it. The fireball was stationary but shaky (much like a twinkling star but with a much greater intensity). The fireball was orange for about three minutes then it flickered to orange/white for about a minute and a half. It faded out to black over about 30 seconds.<n>

The first (04/28/98) was on Rt. 270 South near the Boyds exit. The object was traveling West to East at a very steep angle. At first I thought it was a plane going down and I waited for the impact, but there was none. I disappeared behind the tree tops. The light was the brightest I had ever seen! It was super white! It was no plane, star or meteor as I have seen them all. The second sighting was at Patuxent River Naval Air Station. Exact same object. This time there was a streak behind. I was lying in bed and saw the object out my window. Planes fly over all the time. I am positive it was no plane. It made no noise and it lit up the inside of my room. Again, this disappeared behind some tree tops. This sighting hapened in June. I was in bed again and guess what, there it was again. This sighting was in August.

We were driving south on hwy 53 just north of hermantown minnesota..When we noticed a rather low flying aircraft with a whole aray of lights coming from it.....Not like a normal jet with lights flashing and headlights blaring forwards. The lights on this craft were emanating from it....they  were very bright and there where many of them....At first we could just see a side profile and it was very difficult to make out a shape...as it got closer it came along side of the freeway with us and you could make out a shape that being a trianglular and very large with 9 lights on the bottom..six yellow,three green, and one red at the very rear....The aircraft was about 100 feet above our heads and made no noise what so ever.......<n>

As I approached the light  it seemed strange because it did not move. As I came under it I saw a black triangle shaped object hovering about 120 feet above the street I stopped my car and stepped out to look at the craft. The craft had three red lights on the outside points of the triangle and one brith white light directly in the center of it( the lights did not blink).  It remained hovering above me for about 30 seconds and the slowly glided away to the north until I could not see it anymore.<n>

I was outside with my dogs when I saw what looked like a shooting star. I noticed it start on the East horizone line and make it way to the West horizone line. I thought to myself how amazing it was that it didn&#39;t fade away and thats when I noticed the head of the light was shaped in a perfect triangle. Just before the light was covered by my nieghbors tree it faintly flashed and completely disappeared, Light and light tail.<n>

The object appeared to be hovering unsteadily in the sky as it was moving sideways. The speed of the object appeared to be approximatly 400-600mph. The object also made no sound and was moving in a strange manner that is its edges seemed to be waving up and down. There were no lights emmitted from the object and the color of the object was black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested more information from the witness.

The object did this about 4 times , then the fifth time it apeared there were about eleven of them , only alot smaller and were in kind of formation then they just dissapeard, this whole event lasted about fifteen seconds. It was hard to tell how close it was, but to me it looked like it was a mile to a mile and a half away from me, which was south east of me just after the sun had gone down, you could just start seeing a few stars. The main object was round , i had my binoculars on it for the last single bright object and when it turned into 11 objects. The object really didnt look any different except brighter. I talked to a few other people that said they saw it also.<n>
9/10/00 14:45|Great Sand Dunes National Monument|CO|Circle|2 minutes|A dull grey CIRCLE flying from the E/NE toward the W/SW.|10/15/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25412.html|230|ndxe200009| A friend and I were hiking at the Great Sand Dunes near Alamosa, Colorado.  There had been quite a bit of air traffic, but one jet flew over that was quite low.  In fact, it was much lower than I thought it should have been, and it looked huge as flew directly overhead.  As I watched it fly over, shielding my eyes from the sun, farther up in the sky was a dull grey CIRCLE flying from the E/NE toward the W/SW.  Although it&#39;s impossible to judge altitude with certainty, it appeared to be about 40,000 feet up, a bit larger than a jet, and crossing the sky at about the same apparent speed as a jet at cruising altitude.  I found the object through my binoculars at it passed through the zenith, and it was perfectly round -- i.e., no fuselage, no wings.  Obviously I couldn&#39;t tell if it was a flat disk or a ball shape because of the altitude.  Both the friend and I witnessed this unconventional craft flying over, but I&#39;m sure we would have missed it had it not been for the low-flying jet that passed overhead and made us look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.

We spent a couple hours there and on the way out of town I stuck my camcorder out the window towards the sky and jokingly remarked that I would have to view these tapes when we got home to look for &#34;ufo&#39;s&#34;.  Since I was driving I could not see what I was taping but when I got home the picture in the clouds was remarkable.  It was not a  space ship of any kind but it was a very intersting and quite clear image of what appeared to be the face of an &#34;ebe&#34;. If you would like me to forward you a copy I would b e happy to.  I am not looking to sell anything here and would be happy to pass it along .  I am a skeptic when it comes to ufos but this image is rather remarkable considering where we where when I got the picture.  ((name and e-address deleted))<n>
9/9/00 22:30|Dahlonega|GA|Changing|at least 1 hour|A stationary bowl shaped object with colored lights.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14085.html|232|ndxe200009| A stationary bowl shaped object with colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:30 PM a flashing object was noticed in the southeastern sky. The object appeared to be just below the moon and yet was clearly visible. With binoculars we could see red, green, purple, and white lights. At times these colors seemed to spin around the object as it took the shape of a bowl. At other times the object appeared to have no shape; just flashes of color. There was very little movement. We watched for about 1 hour before retiring. It was an extremely strange thing to see and I will never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Description seems not inconsistent with a celestial body, but we did not see it.  PD))<n>
9/9/00 22:15|Johannesburg|MI|Fireball|10 minutes|two stationary orange fireballs|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14108.html|233|ndxe200009| two stationary orange fireballs<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving eastbound on M-32 and saw two orange fireballs suspended in the sky to the south.  Cannot tell how far away they were, but they were only about 10-20 degrees above the horizon.  They stood still for about 10 minutes while we watched. Then they gradually (over about 5 seconds) &#34;extinguished&#34; themselves.  Prior to extinguishing, we noticed a smaller fire ball (about half the size) descend downward below one of the two, as if suspended by a wire.  It descended to the ground in about a minute. Two possible explanations:  there are some natural gas wells in the vicinity, however I am not aware of any flare stacks.  We have driven this road numerous times and have never seen any flares. Another possible explanation:  there is a air national guard air-base approximately 40 miles to the south, which might have been involved with nightime aerial military maneuvers<n>
9/9/00 21:30|Hermitage|PA|Triangle|10-15seconds|On 09/09/2000 I saw an object that had three rectangular goldish-amber lights in a triangular pattern and the object was totally silent|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14079.html|234|ndxe200009| On 09/09/2000 I saw an object that had three rectangular goldish-amber lights in a triangular pattern and the object was totally silent<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two friends and I were hanging out in the one friends backyard, which is actually located on the main business strip of our town. They were sitting at a picnic table and I was standing.  I was talking when I looked up, and in the opening between two trees(40 feet), I saw something fly overhead. I said &#34;what the **** is that?&#34; I quickly turned and took a few steps to my left and watched the object disappear into the night sky.  While I was watching my friends had got up from the table.  The one was standing behind me and said &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  &#34;What the hell was it?&#34; The other friend didn&#39;t see anything but could tell that we definately did.  We discussed what we saw and each drew pictures of what we saw.  We saw the same thing.  First of all the object was completely silent. It did not appear to be flying at an altitude greater than a couple hundred feet.  It was again absolutly silent. It was moving but not at a tremendous amount of speed.  Traveling west to east and moved laterally to our right before disappearing. It did not bank(like a plane would)it swiftly moved to the right.  I cannot make a fair call on how large it was and whether or not I was seeing the back of it or the bottom of it.  But what I saw consisted of three rectangular lights, goldish-amber in color, not terribly bright, but distinct--no halos or blurriness to them(it was a little hazy that night too) The rectangles were in a triangular pattern, one on top, two on the bottom, as if there was one for each point on a triangle. Whatever it was DID NOT make a sound.<n>

We noticed large cloud formations to the north of us. As we were observing the clouds we all noticed a gray metallic object floating next to the clouds. We pulled over on the side of the road and took pictures. The floating object was visible for approximately 5 minutes then disapeared behind the clouds. The film was developed on 10/6/00. Two pictures show the object very clearly. It is similar to the picture on the homepage of this website. I also have to conclude that we did not hear any noise from the aircraft. Pictures will be submitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report was submitted by person who occupies a position of considerable responsibility.

In a field a few miles above North Gate-Yellowstone Park. In the middle of the night about 3:30am, the whole valley lights up like Yankee Stadium, and with not a peep. It stayed lit without movement of any kind for at least 40 seconds. It came back a second time moments later for about 20 seconds, and went away again. I came out of my Mini-Van the first, and the second time looking for a truck, but my eyes looked to the sky both times like I was having some sort of an invitation or something. It felt like I was hiding behind a tree, and I was witnessing a serious crime,  thus knowing the silence  was very strange. Blew it off, went to sleep and woke early just to find an open field with a bumpy dirt road, and no main road near enough to provive any lights. The sound of the yahoo&#39;s pick-up aproaching convinced me-------UFO.......  If you want the story, let me know.......…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness who submitted this report, and he asserted that the incident occurred as described above.

At this time an extremely bright white light filled my entire sight, bright enough so I could see shadows from the trees around me. The flash lasted 3 secs .I then looked up and saw a white-gold-yellowish looking ball, follewed by a blue tail.It also had what looked like smoke folowing the tail.The head was the size of a golfball.I saw this object for about a minute.It was moving south to north directly above my car.On the local news the following night, there were reports of a similar object over Delaware and Pennsylvania.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports were received by the Franklin Institute/Observatory in Philadelphia and by news agenicies in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.  Some witnesses in the Philadelphia area reported that the object had &#34;corners,&#34; and that it stopped and was motionless in the sky for several seconds.  We cannot confirm those reports yet.

9/9/00 03:30|Philadelphia|PA|Changing|3-5 seconds|A bright flash seen in the sky facing west, 60 degrees above the horizon, heading downward from right to left, leaving a trail.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14053.html|240|ndxe200009| A bright flash seen in the sky facing west, 60 degrees above the horizon, heading downward from right to left, leaving a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside on the porch of the home where I work as a night shift private duty nurse. I was facing approximately north when the entire surrounding area lit up brightly for several seconds. I began looking toward the garage to my left on the property to see if a spotlight had been turned on. While turning, I noticed a bright light coming from high up shining through a tree in the yard. I stepped to my left to see the light without the tree being in the way. I was facing approximately west. At about sixty degrees above the horizon, I could see a bright trail angled down from right to left terminating in a bright mass. When I held my hand at arm&#39;s length, the length of the mass and tail together was roughly that of my index finger. Within a few seconds, the light from the object had faded. I did not notice any smoke remaining after the flash faded. My first thought was that perhaps it was an exceptionally large meteorite. I have seen numerous meteorites in my lifetime, but have never seen anything light up my surroundings like this did. I then wondered if it might have been an Iridium satellite deorbiting. The thought that there was a space shuttle mission recently launched to the international space station made me wonder if there could have been an accident associated with that, although the notion clearly seemed like a stretch of the imagination. I decided to report the object to the National UFO Reporting Center in hopes of perhaps finding a means of identifying what I had seen.<n>

The exact time was around 2:30 or 3:30am. There was a brilliant blue-green flash that lasted about 5 seconds. I thought a power transformer blew up - but there was no sound. On the National Police frequency I heard different departments talking about the flash also. Some departments I heard talk about the flash were from nearby counties. The flash was so bright it lit up the whole area like daytime. I&#39;ve seen meteors/fireballs before, but none lit up the area like whatever caused this flash. I work as shift leader at a local factory. I&#39;m an Amateur radio operator and radio communications is my hobby.

I was watching the jets do there thing when I noticed overhead, a silver object that appeared to be cigar shape bright silver color. I used my eyes to get a idea about how high it was, I guess around 7 to 10 thousand feet. I watched the object for a few minutes and showed it to the people who were sitting next to us along with my wife. We did not notice at anytime that the object had fixed wings to make it appear to be a plane and we were very positve about the shape.  It appeard also to be blunt on the ends not pointed like a high flying plane.  The object stayed in one spot for about five minutes and then dissapeard.<n>

It was September 8th, 2000 and we first saw a police helicopter circling around and we concluded that the helicopter was there because of the UN 2000 conference/meeting of world leaders. Then, I saw a reddish/amber object which seems stationary at first but then seems to move very slowly, I then asked my workmate &#34;what&#39;s that red thing there in the skies?&#34; he replied, &#34;oh, its one of those baloons.&#34; But, for some reason I kept on looking and the object now was showing a bright white color also, so I pointed that out to him and we decided to focus on the object and the helicopter. It was&#39;nt long before we noticed that this thing was acutally moving in a circular fashion, that is, it was traveling and spinning, this was evident because we would see the bright white color and the reddish/amber, sometimes it appears that this was a two-colored object sometimes one. We became more curious when we realised that this thing was really moving upwards and getting smaller and that we now would only recognise the bright white color. By this time we knew it was not a baloon, nor a helicopter, nor any other object that we can recognise. In the midst of the whole scene we would look at each other and ask &#34;what da hell is that thing?&#34;  Then one of us suggested it might be one of those flying saucers, we both laughed as if to say &#34;yeah right.&#34; The object mounted so high that had it not been for the bright white light we would not be able to recognise it with our natural eyes. It disappeared when it mounted beyond some clouds so to us the clouds covered or blocked our view but it had gone so high already. I must say that it seems to pick up in speed as it climbed higher. Although maths is my favorite subject I am not good at estimating distances and sizes so I will not attempt to estimate either at any point in this experience. All i can say is that when I first saw this thing it was probably a little above the distance the helicopter was and at that point it was quite visable; by the time it disappeared it became as the size of a miniature baseball. What is interesting is that there were other people(about 12-15) in the same cafeteria at the same time but we really never thought that we should bring it to anyone&#39;s attention because we were&#39;nt sure what this thing was. There was a plane which was traveling ( in the opposite direction) high above the helicopter but this object was high above the plane. I am not going to conclude precisely that this was indeed an UFO for I still do not know what the heck this thing was but I know for certain that this was something like I aint never seen before. And the movement and awe startled me. If there&#39;s anyone who had a similar experience I would sure like to know what this was, maybe some expert can contact me or even someone who is a doubter. I know we were&#39;nt dreaming, we had no strong drink, I dont smoke and i dont think my workmate does. Let me say one other thing, the direction in which the object move is as if it made a sideways V.<n>

As I closed in on the object heading south along the tollway, I noticed the object appeared to be an airplane heading into Androw Airport.  As I got closer to the object, I noticed it was larger than the normal size of aircraft for that airport, and it was stationary.  As I approached the object, instead of making a left turn into the airport, it remained stationary and became larger.  The object appeared as a cylinder with conical ends ending in very sharp points, and large red lights before the apex of the point on each end.  The object appeared to be tilted downward 10 degrees to the west.  As I faced the object, above the red light on the right side was a dimly lit dome.  On the left side above the other red light appeared to be a bright blue-white light similar to a spot light. The object looked  to be dark in color.  As I approched the object, my view was obscured as I passed under the vehicle. The size of the ufo was 150 feet in length and 15 to 20 feet in height.  It was one and one half times the size of a full moon.  It was approximately 1000-2000 feet above the tree line over a suburban area with no cellular towers  or other man made structures which could confuse the observer.  I am a geologist and have a working knowledge of areodynamics and physics. This object did not exhibit any properties which could be explained by natural or man made phenomena.<n>

The topography is relatively flat at  that location and continuing north into Wyoming. I noted some landmarks, so the accuracy of these data could be improved if necessary, especiially if triangulation is used. I cannot estimate my distance from the object.

As I got closer to it over the course of the next few minutes I saw it was a very large triangular object, moving very slowly East Northeast....the front light was white and very bright the rear two points of the triangle were not as bright and were blinking on and off in unison, very slowly. The lights formed a perfect triangle and were about 1,000 feet over the ground. I then saw another object, exactly the same as the first traveling the same direction about a mile or two behind the first. I did everything I could to tell myself it was just a couple of aircraft in formation but after watching these objects for SO long (5 mins or more) I was sure it was not aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke on the telephone with this witness and found him to be seemingly quite credible in his report.

A triangular object in the sky (at about a 75 degree angle, and about the size of my thumbnail at arm&#39;s lengh) cought my attention.  I was surprised by the shape, but especially because it was not moving!  There were three yellow or white lights, one on each end.  I was glad that the light was turning red because I would be able to take a better look at it.  My aunt was in the car with me and I asked her if it looked like the object was moving-she said no.  I rolled down my window and turned off the radio to see if it was making any sound. It wasn&#39;t.  Then, before the light turned green, the object started moving slowly and smoothly towards the west.<n>

At about 10:55 pm pacific time, I was standing on my front porch smoking a cigarette, when I noticed a bright yellow light in the sky to the north west.  It stayed there for about 65-70 seconds.  It then started to move to the east in a very strange pattern. First, it moved perfectly vertical, then perfectly horizontal, and then vertical, and so on, until it moved a great deal across the sky.  While this light was flying in this strange pattern, another bright yellow light appeared in the same spot that the original one had.  This started moving in the same pattern as the first one, but it did not travel as far neither vertically nor horizontally.  After a few seconds, it completly dissapeared.  After about a minute, another bright yellow light appeared in the same place.  Immediatly, it started move in the same direction as the other two, in a similar pattern, but this time more erratically.  It moved rapidly, and moved in the direction of other, stationary, flashing white lights.  It seemed to be flying in the direction of one light, then would change direction towards another light.  After about another minute, an airplane appeared over the horizon in the north west, and began to turn in order to alter it&#39;s course to follow the light.  After several minutes of the plane flying after the light, more airplanes began coming over the horizon from the north east in fairly regular intervals.  I saw about 10 or 12 planes fly in the direction of the light.  While these planes were flying, there were many more flashing white lights in the sky, which flickered for a couple minutes, then stopped. All of the planes had flown away, and then nothing more happened.<n>

We stopped and also saw an identical object in the east, also stationary with consantly blinking lights. They were sized like a pea at arms length. After arriving home, we watched them with binoculars in the clear starlit sky for 3 and 1/2 hours, one on each side of our property. After 2 hours we saw a third identical object, though a bit dimmer or at a greater distance from us, that was located a short distance (about 1/2 inch) NW of the eastern-most object. Though I think we may have observed unusual objects or events a couple times before, this is our first report. We are college-educated, rational but curious about these events. We also had observed many PARALLEL and CROSSED CHEM-TRAILS over our area that same afternoon and early evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The report of multi-colored objects, stationary in the night sky, seems reminiscent of &#34;twinkling&#34; stars.

Our son brought to our attention what he called a &#34;falling star&#34;. My wife, older son and my self looked up into the sky, to see what appeared to be an object (fireball) in the South Western sky. It appeared, to be traveling in a south westerly direction, on a re-enrty path. It was obviously generating quite a bit of heat as it was producing, an orange glow and contrails. It turned rather sharpley to the west as it was decesending, and contiued in a westerly direction. It seemed that the contrails split apart 2-3 minutes after it turned. The turn that it made was very quickly executed as though it almost turned at a right angle. This didn&#39;t appear to be a normal aircarft turn as it was done at high rate speed. We continued to watch it until it dissapeared behind a cloud bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time here to 1915 hrs., which was the correct time of the sighting.  PD))<n>

I first looked at the water, then I looked up to the sky (which was clear except for a few light clouds), and out of a cloud came this circular shaped object. It flew straight in my direction and it flew very fast. I could see that it was grayish white in color with no discernable apparatus on the craft itself as it was very smooth, almost luminous. I heard no sound coming from the object. It flew east to west direction, coming from the direction of the water to the direction of the land. It flew either so fast I could not follow it&#39;s full trajectory and/or I also had a sense that it may have simply appeared (from where?), flew over me, then disappered (to where?). I know that what I saw was not a plane (no visable tail, wings or nose present on object), nor did I see a bird (it was close enough to me that i could discern that). Since it was a daylight sighting, I can state that it did move so, it was not a planet or a star. I thought maybe a satellite but talking with a friend, we decided probably not. I&#39;m open to possibilities. Also, I saw the same object the next day also, so I had two sightings on two different days of same object. Thank-you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates Hampden Beach.  We wonder whether the location of the sighting was Hampton Beach, on the coast of New Hampshire.

I left his house at about 2:40AM. When I pulled onto the street I observed two bright lights low in the northwest sky outside of town, one above the other. At first I thought they were aircraft with their landing lights on flying toward me but they did not change position. I stopped at a curve in the street and watched them for several minutes. I saw no strobe lights or wingtip lights and heard no engines or rotors. I drove out of town to the west to try and get a closer look at them. Both objects moved to the west as I approached. I tried to catch up with them for about 8 miles then one of them headed northwest toward Defiance, steadily speeded up and vanished from sight. The other object was now directly north of me and moving towards the north. I turned onto highway 108 and pegged the 85 MPH speedometer in my vehicle trying to catch up with it. The object continued to move away to the north. I had to slow down to go through the town of Holgate and lost sight of it. I looked at the clock, it was 2:58 AM. I drove east of town on highway 18, stopped about a mile out of town and got out of my vehicle to search the sky but the object was nowhere in sight. I then observed a small plane flying from west to east directly over head, I clearly saw the wingtip lights and belly strobe and heard the engine. I returned to Leipsic at about 3:30AM. When I stepped out of my vehicle I heard rotor blades to the north and watched a jet copter fly from north to south. I am a 41 year old male. I have done some flying and amateur astronomy. I live 5 miles from an air force base and have seen lots of different types of aircraft in flight both day and night including the B2, F117 and SR71. The objects that I saw were brighter than anything in the sky and the brightness did not change when they moved away from me. At no time did I see any kind of structure, just steady bright white lights. They were not planets since they were too far north to be near the ecliptic and they changed position in the sky.<n>

At first I thought they must&#39;ve been airplanes flying to LAX or wherever that were reflecting light from the sun. If you were to place your middle finger &amp; index finger in a &#34;peace sign&#34; formation and held them against the sky, that is the distance that these two bright &#34;stars&#34; seemed to be apart from each other. If you drew a line between these two objects, you would have a perfect horizontal line. At first, the left &#34;star&#34; which was bright started to dim a little bit, like an airplane flying away from you. Then it regained its original brightness. Then I saw the right &#34;star&#34;, which originally wasn&#39;t as bright as the left &#34;star&#34; start to become brighter also. So I knew then that these were not airplanes. Immediately I saw the left &#34;star&#34; dim slightly. When this happened, it appeared to reveal it&#39;s shape which was like a slim disc. It all of a sudden started to zig zag downward very rapidly. After that, it zig zagged upward back to its original position. Immediately after that, the right &#34;star&#34; also revealed its disc-like shape and did a zig zag motion downward as well but diagonally to the right. This right object revealed its shape in better detail. It sort of resembled , if you&#39;re familiar with the movie &#34;Star Wars&#34;, the rear end of the Millenium Falcon ship as it would launch of any given surface. What I mean is it resembled the orange glow given off by the rear rockets and the exact detail of the rear end of the Millenium Falcon. Anyway, when this was apparent, it appeared to dive slightly to the left going downward. It looked exactly like the Millenium Falcon when it would change direction and dive left. It did this motion at the speed that an airplane would. Then it quickly jumped back to its original position. Then, the left &#34;star&#34;, which now appeared as a disc, also somewhat resembling the millenium falcon, zig zagged rapidly downward diagonally left, staye! d there for a moment, the zig zagged back to its original position. These two objects now appeared to be bright stars again. All of a sudden, their brightness dimmed, then disappeared suddenly. As far as my personal background goes, I&#39;m a 24yr old graphic design/web design student here in West Covina.  I was not under the influence of any alcohol or substances at the time of the sighting. I come from a family of four who all carry on w/ typical work/school lifestyles and who don&#39;t suffer from any history of mental disorders. I do stargaze and look at the sky from time to time but this is my first time seeing unidentified flying objects and am really excited now.<n>

One saw the actual object. About 30 ft. wide by 5 ft. deep. Deep sounding noise eminating around the area were heard by another. The last was sounds of chattering(talking)from outside the tent by two of the occupants.<n>

It didn&#39;t move like a normal aircraft would be able to.  It would dart from one point to another, extremely quickly.  He and I watched it for about 10 min. and decided that we should go in and get my mother and sister and the bonoculars.  What we saw through them, was incredible.  I could see a circle of multicolored lights, beautiful lights.  It never made any noise what so ever, but every time the light show would begin the neighbor&#39;s dogs would really carry on (barking).  It would rise and lower but it never did land.  We notified the local sherriffs department and a deputy came out to make sure for one that we were not crazy, it had drifted off by the time he arrived but as we was looking through our bonoculars, it popped back out from behind a distant tree.  We had photographed it prior to the deputy&#39;s arrival in hopes to be able to see it better.  We have a very clear picture of the saucer shaped craft, with the surrounding lights.  I also notified a man in the military who deals with this sort of thing and sent him the pic. and he stated that he thought it was authentic, and most definitely somthing not from this world.   I know this all sounds crazy but I suppose that sense you do have a web site for this it is all too common to you. Let me know if I can be of any assistance to you.

There were perhaps 3,000 other people present. Surprisingly, no else commented on what I saw, even though I tried to point it out to my wife and my sudden and excited words to her were no doubt heard by people sitting immediately around us--&#34;Look! Wow! Don&#39;t you see that?! You didn&#39;t see that?!&#34; Most of the seating was on the grass. At the time, I happened to be reclined and looking up at the sky (the time was about 2130-2200). Earlier, I had seen a few &#34;shooting stars.&#34;  The object--which looked like five lights forming a point--appeared suddenly, as if it were just there, many miles above me. (I am almost certain that the five lights formed a singular object. The position of the lights was too symmetrical and the object moved in perfect unison so as not to appear as multiple objects.) The individual lights emitted what I might describe as &#34;luminous radiation,&#34; and the points of light seemed to be &#34;connected&#34; by the same type of luminous radiation. It moved in the direction of the point (west); within 2 or 3 seconds it was gone, moving faster than anything man-made could move. If you are interested, I can provide you with an accurate drawing.<n>

Anyway, I was using  binoculars and I noticed in the sky to the north was a lone star, until colored lights started swirling around it and it started moving back and forth, (right to left, right to left) then a few minutes later across the water was a huge fireball essence that showed itself and then suddenly dissapeared, my boyfriend saw it too and was amazed.

It resembeled a bright star, at about the same altitude a star would be (or so it seemed), which moved at various speeds and directions for 20-30 minutes.  The light would start in one place, then would zip across the sky to another place.  It continued to do this in different directions, at different speeds, and in different formations.  It zipped back and forth, and would stop sometimes, only to start its erratic movement again.  Sometimes it would even seem to disappear, only for a moment, before reappearing somewhere else in the sky.  It was still light outside, although it took place years ago, so the time of day listed is only an estimate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only talked to people of this, and have never reported it, as I only today found out about this organization.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidentally, my sister (who I had spoken to about the incident years ago), while attending a similar festival in Manchester, Tennessee a year or so ago, witnessed a strikingly similar unidentified flying object in the sky.  It had the same flying patterns as I mentioned above.  My sister was amazed, since she had been skeptical of my sighting years earlier, and since it was so similar, but in a different state and years later in a similar situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was unlike any aircraft I&#39;ve ever witnessed in terms of altitude, speed, and the way it could so abruptly stop and change directions.  Also, it remained in the same general area for a long period, which I have never witnessed in a plane before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since many people attended both of these events, I can&#39;t help but think others witnessed these events, or if any explanations can or have been offered, and I am very curious to know.

When I looked out my bathromm window (facing North) I saw a cigar shaped object with several blueish white lights on the side (roughly 1/3 to 1/2 way between the front and back). The object was flying fairly low in the sky in a singular, easterly direction and from it&#39;s size, it appeared to be fairly near.  I viewed the object for approximately 2-3 seconds before it flew out of the view of my window. The sound was still audible for a few seconds after I lost visability.  Slightly stunned, I returned to bed but was unable to sleep.  I got up again 1 or 2 minutes later but did not sight the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally convincing in her description of her alleged sighting.

9/2/00 01:00|Indiana|IN||1-2hours?|Followed by three craft on return trip to Columbus from Chicago.|3/6/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16721.html|280|ndxe200009| Followed by three craft on return trip to Columbus from Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and a friend ((name deleted)) were returning from a trip to Chicago where we went for guidance at the SGI-USA Chicago Culture Center, a Buddhist organization which we are both members of.  I was the primary driver as Debbie has MS and can&#39;t drive all that well.  We had stopped at a truckstop inside the Indiana line to allow me to get a few hours sleep.  At one point ((deleted)) started the car and drove to the next stop as I slept.  When I awoke it was almost midnight and I took over the driving from then on.  I am concious of being an abductee and am part of ((deleted)) study group.  I have only been able to have memories of the very beginning and or the very end of eppisodes.  I have felt someone standing on my bed or seen bodies next to me as I lie in bed, but I haven&#39;t been able to remember anything in between.  As this trip was coming up I essentially invited anyone who wanted to to &#34;come and play&#34; as I put it.  As I drove on toward Indianapolis after a while ((deleted)) asked if stars moved.  I said well they shimmer due to the atmosphere is that what you mean? She said no I&#39;m seeing one oh no there are two no wait there are three lights moving with us as we are driving.  I couldn&#39;t see anything as I was paying attention to the road.  At one point during this period I openly called to the craft and ((deleted)) screamed &#34;Oh my god!&#34; when I asked her what happened she said that as I was talking to the craft what she at first thought was a very bright light in the fields next to the highway flew almost instantly toward the car and was next to the passenger side window for about 5 seconds as we were going 65 mph..  When that was happening I had the feeling like something was happening in my mind, I can only discribe it as a fuzzy vibration that was supperimposed and lasted till the ball of light sped away.  After she saw the light speed off she reportedthat the craft were having a light show of blinking on and off as if the ships were communicating with each other.  I was by this time anxious to see this all for my se! lf and a t the next turnoff went to one of the corn fields to stop and get out of the car.  I saw two of the three craft going away toward Illinois and one coming toward us.  ((name deleted)) freaked out at this point, she said it was because this was klan country and a white guy and Black woman were in danger here.  So I got back on the Highway and was told the craft was still following us.  In my mind I was saying &#34;if you want to have me talk to you you&#39;re going to have to get ((name deleted)) to sleep, she won&#39;t let me stop.&#34;  After a while she did fall asleep.  I waited till I was sure that she wouldn&#39;t wake up and took the first exit I could find. When I stopped the car in the corn field this time I got out of the car and saw a lowhanging cloud in front of me with the craft hidden just at the bottom edge of the clouds.  There were two sets of lights on the craft a set of blue lights on the top and a set of red on the bottom.  There were 4 or 5 lights visable above and below and they were going in sequence in opposite directions I never saw the body of the craft itself only the running lights.  I said that I was going inside the car now and if you want to come and get me you can.  I have no memory of what happened. But I was informed by friends of mine that they came to do a &#34;memory retrieval&#34; from me.  The entire evening there were no clouds in the sky except when I stopped to let them visit me.<n>

We were talking and heard a very low (for an aircraft) sounding noise. Neither of us knew what it was so my friend (who is very much into aeronautics) couldn&#39;t resist looking at it. He saw it and grabbed me right away. We looked at it for about 15 seconds too scared to do anything until we came to our senses and ran inside yelling. My dad did not believe us. The U.F.O had rounded sides and looked like a skull/heart shape. Also my friend discribes it as an octagon with rounded edges that thins as it goes farther towards the end of the craft. It had three lights in a triangular form and the tip at of the triangle at the front of the ship was the brightest.<n>

They have been seen during daylight hours as well as nighttime. Many people from this area say that helicopters fly over this time of year due to the Marijuanna harvest.  However, they all agree that they have never seen so much activity.  They further state, the black helicopters have never been seen during harvest time before. The sightings of black helicopters continue.  I will keep you informed as more come in. Sincerely, ((personal data deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received a number of reports of &#34;black helicopters&#34; over the years, but we are unconvinced that if they in fact exist, they have anything to do with UFO&#39;s.

We conclusively saw six over the course of 30 minutes; no idea how long they had been going on before we saw them, or whether other flashes occured while we were turned away and discussing the phenomenon.

My best friend and I had just finished clearing trails in his woods and we were making our way back to his house, crossing a grassy field to get there. Headed towards us we saw what we thought was an airplane at first, especially considering that there is an airport somewhat nearby. This craft had three solid white lights on it, arranged in a wide triangle shape. The lights were not blinking and the craft was completely silent. It seemed to be flying very low, enough so that we certainly would have heard this thing if it was just another passenger airplane. Besides the fact that this craft was completely silent, a couple of things really grabbed our attention. First, we realized that this thing was either jet black or totally transparent between the lights. Realizing that detail was very unsettling. The second thing that really grabbed ! our attention, and the thing that caused us to run towards his house (this whole time we were just standing there watching this thing), was when it changed direction. Up to this point the craft was moving very slowly, as far as we could tell, in a straight line directly toward and over us. This thing seemed to suddenly and completely stop, do a 180 degree turn, and head back in the direction that it came from. There was never a shift in speed, from what I could tell. After that 180 degree turn we were both startled enough to run to the house and pretty much pretend that none of that happened. All of this happened about 9-12 years ago and I&#39;ve told very few people about the event, probably because I&#39;m afraid of what they&#39;d think of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m no expert on aircraft but I was in the U.S. Army and I saw my fair share of passenger, fighter, transport/cargo, and unmanned aircraft during my service and never once did I see anything like that. I heard about you last night on Coast to Coast (I work midnights and have nothing to do on my break so, typically, I listen to Coast to Coast) and so I figured I&#39;d file the report.

The sky had patches of fog.The first object was just a white starlike light that I viewed flying fairly high into the fog. I continued to watch for a number of minutes to wait for it to reappear on the other side of the fog. It never reappeared. The second object I viewed just about 3 minutes later was cylinder shaped and was flying much lower. It had flashing lights so I assumed it was a plane but it traveled in the clear (not foggy) part of the sky and I expected to watch it pass by until it was out of view yet it turned around smoothly and flew just a little bit more then it completely disappeared and never reappeared. I did not take my eyes off it for one second while I was watching this. A few minutes later a normal plane came by and traveled normally across the sky in the same path as the cylinder with the lights. It possibly was following it. I was completely sober and have never seen anything like that before in my life.<n>

I appeared to be staying in the same place or moving very slowly. I watched it stay in the apparently same location for about five or more minutes. At this point thought it was two large and very close stars. I then went into the house and told my mother to come see it. We wasn&#39;t looking at it very long and then it started to approach us. I could tell it was getting closer because the two large lights was spreading further apart and getting larger. The lights blinked off and on twice and what I thought was going to be a thrid time but instead the two lights just very went dim. Soon it was directly overhead and this is when I looked through my binoculars for a better look. My mom who was talking on the phone heard lots of static on the cordless phone. I could tell that it was triangular except the point of the triangle was the tail instead of what I believe should be the nose. The tail had a very small red light compared to the large front lights. These lights looked as tough they was pointed down at a forty five degree angle. It was flying very low and I could hear the engine. The engine sounded as though it had zero throttle. It did&#39;t sound like the planes to day but those in old war movies. As soon as it crossed over my house I went to the front porch and watched it circle over high way about 3000 yards away. Then Sept. 9, 2000 I seen two transport helicopters then about five minutes later I seen a Apache or simiular helicopter going in the direction of where the object came from. Then I remembered seeing three helichopters come off the ground and fly over me about ten minutes before the strange object on the the night of Sept. 1, 2000. The are no airports near my area which is in the country. The lights was was bigger than the moon that night. And I believe the moon was almost full that night. I am certain that is was very large and flying very low. I also posted it on my website with drawings of what it looked like at: http://www.geocitie! s.com/Al iensWebsite/ and clicking on personal sightings.<n>
9/1/00 21:00|Post|TX|Light|15 min|I was followed closely by a flashing blue light, for about 15 miles.|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19647.html|289|ndxe200009| I was followed closely by a flashing blue light, for about 15 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving between Jayton and Post on Highway 380 on a very hazy, humid night.  I had never travelled this highway before, but was told later that it was remote, unpopulated ranch land.  As I approached a rise, I could see the reflection of a flashing blue light in the haze on the other side of the rise, but could not see the light itself.  I assumed it was the flashing light of a communication tower.  When I topped the rise, to my left was a flashing blue light about tree top height over the fence line, right next to the highway.  To my astonishment, the light, which appeared to have been hovering, immediately went from stationary to 65 miles per hour, traveling still over the fence line next to the highway, as though looking at me through the drivers side window of my van.  The light was bright blue, about the size of a basketball, flashed about every second, and I heard no sound from it. For several minutes the light stayed right beside my van.  I thought maybe I was beside a train or something, but later found out there were no tracks beside the highway.  The light drifted behind me, and I slowed down to do a u-turn to try and figure out what I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I slowed to about 10 miles an hour and was about to turn around, the light appeared outside my drivers side window, again as though staring at me through the window.  Now I am scared, and I jammed on the gas, only to see the light accelarate at the same speed I was going.  For the next 15 or so miles the light travelled right beside, behind, or over my van.  At times I could see it over the highway in my rear view mirror.  At other times I could not see the light itself, but could see the flash reflected in the haze, realizing that it was right over my van.  It would also move over the ditch on the other side of the highway(Blowing my theory that I was beside a train running on tracks beside the highway).  As I approached the city of Post, the light finally disappeared from view.  I reported the incident to a deputy sherriff I saw coming out of a cafe, assurring him I was not some crazy person or high on something.  He said I looked and sounded credible to him, and said he would drive out later to take a look.  He told me that there were no train tracks beside the highway, and that I had driven through ranch land that was largely unpopulated. He had no clue about what I had just seen.  I am a conservative, professional person, late forties in age, and don&#39;t do drugs or drink.  If this had not happened to me personally, in the past I would never have believed this story to be real if I had read it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Addendum by same source:<n> <n><n> <n><n> A flashing blue light flew beside and behing my vehicle at tree top level for 15 miles.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to contact this witness at the e-address he indicates, but the address is not valid.

I was walking the dog and there it was ... went to get my wife to look out the window but by then it was gone. Only was there for maybe 30 seconds. it kind of looked like a crescent moon (or is it waning?) anyway, points of light curving top and bottom to the left with a bright shining round ball in the middle of the shape. No planes in the sky and the sky was partly cloudy at the time.  in any event it remains an unidentified flying object.<n>
9/1/00 18:00|Union|MO|Other|2-3 minutes|Franklin County, Union, Missouri at Hwy 50 and Prairie Dell Rd, WalMart|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68794.html|291|ndxe200009| Franklin County, Union, Missouri at Hwy 50 and Prairie Dell Rd, WalMart<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dates are not exact, I apologize for that, but I can narrow it down to a 3 year window when my oldest daughter was 12-15 years old, she will be 23 this year. This sighting occured between approximately 6-7 pm, in broad daylight, as I was stopped at the stoplight on Hwy 50 (in front of Wal Mart and across the Hwy from East Central College), several cars in front of me, several behind me. I was Eastbound headed toward I-44, and while stopped at the light, I noticed the cars stopped Westbound, looking at something to my left. I looked to my left, I remember having to turn my head quite far - practically over my left shoulder, and hovering approximately 20 ft over the trees was a massive object. The exact location at the time had a large barn and silo on it, but is now a strip mall of shops - directly west (to the left if you are facing the front of it) of wal mart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be 20+ feet high, 50 to 60 feet wide, and it was matte mettalic looking, grey/silver in color. Solid in appearance, with no distinguishable lights or windows. The object appeared to be motionless, and made no audible sound that we could hear. The best way to give a visual is this: Take a stainless steel dogs food/water bowl, and turn it upside down. This hovering object was wider at the top, slightly narrower at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I recall, it took several seconds for my brain to process what I was seeing, as it wasn&#39;t necessarily scary looking, it was more of a &#34;what the ****?&#34; reaction, more alarmed than frightened. I turned to look at my daughter in the front passenger seat - she was leaning forward and towards me, looking out my driver side window at the object, with her mouth hanging open. I remember saying &#34;you see it too?&#34;, to which she replied with a nod of her head indicating &#34;Yes&#34;. I had the presence of mind to glance around at the other vehicles, the traffic light had turned green and no one moved, we were all looking at the object. I looked back at the object and stared at it for what seemed like maybe 1 minute more, and I promise as God is my witness, it &#34;disappeared&#34;.  My daughter&#39;s interpretation of it is the same. One second it was there, and the next, gone. No dramatic flight at high speed was witnessed, just the analogy that it seemed to vanish in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craziest thing of all, looking back on it now, is that there had to be at least 6 cars that I noticed, whose occupants were looking at the same thing we were, and none of us acknowledged to each other what we had just seen. I checked the local newspapers for months after the incident, hoping for some validation, but could find none. My husband said that if I wouldn&#39;t report it out of fear of being labeled a psycho-nutcase, what made me think anyone else would report it? He had a point. Anyway, I plan on checking back here from time to time, to see if anyone else comes forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to point out that I see that there IS another report on here that sounds like a family saw the same type of object in almost the exact location, except their experience occured in 2004. I held my breath when I saw &#34;Union&#34; and &#34;Wal Mart&#34;! I hope more people &#34;google&#34; their experience, as I just did, and find this site. After all of these years, reading about the other Union Wal Mart sighting report gives me the validation that I have been searching for, for many years. THANK YOU!!

We were sitting there when all of a sudden a bright light from the distance of the hills started getting closer and closer.  When we started yelling &#34;holy ((deleted))!!&#34; the object slowly moved backwards a tad, but as soon as we settled down it started moving for my house again.  The object had a green lime light underneath it, it looked like nothing I have ever seen before.  When it hovered over my house I looked up and it was a grey color like misty sorta.  It had that bright light right on the front of it.  We tried to take pictures but every picture on the roll showed up but the ones of the UFO. Ever since that night, I have looked out my window every night and about two nights ago I saw the same bright light hovering over the house across the street.  When I looked at it, it slowly moved away for the hills. Definantly a UFO (i think)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  It would be unusual for a UFO for hang around for 3 hours.  Were such to happen, I suspect that we would have been inundated by reports, which I believe was not the case.  PD))<n>
9/1/00 02:00|Channing/Littlefield (385 between)|TX|Changing|5 minutes|I saw moving lights in a field and then a close up view of a UFO from my car on September 1, 2000.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14012.html|297|ndxe200009| I saw moving lights in a field and then a close up view of a UFO from my car on September 1, 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting took place: September 1, 2000, Approx 1 am MNT/2 am Central On August 31, 2000 I started my trip from Denver, CO to Andrews, TX. I met a potential client in Colorado Springs, CO and then left there around 6:30-7 pm. I arrived in Raton and stopped at the McDonalds and called my family in Andrews at around 9 pm mnt/10 pm central. From Raton, I headed Southeast on 64/87 and went through Clayton and Dalhart. Once 87 turned into 385, at around Channing or Vega, I started seeing what I thought were peculiar lights moving down the fields I was driving past. The lights I saw would go one at a time at approx the same height along the stationary &#34;normal&#34; lights at that were in place in the field. I watched this as I was driving for about half an hour or so. At approx 1 am mnt/2 am central on September 1, 2000, I stopped my car on the RH side of the road to watch a light I’d seen out of the rear mirror of my car that appeared to be moving inwards in the field. I turned off my engine &amp; watched the light move across towards the road and then &#34;hover&#34; out in the field for a few seconds. It was the same color as all the others I’d seen - a white light (same as starts you see in the sky or headlights from most cars). All of a sudden, this light &#34;whipped&#34; around to stop approx 15-30 feet behind my car a little to the left above the road. I could very easily see it out of my window. Immediately upon stopping it &#34;opened up&#34; or changed form (there were no &#34;doors&#34;) and I was able to see much more than a &#34;blob&#34; of light. This inside was defined by shades of light - golden hues. I could see 2 distinct cylindrical shapes coming from this part of the object. They were more horizontal than my drawing shows (they were not pointing down at the earth, but outwards towards me). There were &#34;bands&#34; that were coming from the cylindrical shapes towards the center. I saw nothing resembling anything I’d ever seen on earth or even on TV. Nothing appeared shiny or metallic. This object made no noise at all. I looked at this object for seconds at the most and then turned in my seat and started my car and began driving away as quickly as I could. I said the words out loud &#34;no I don’t want to go.&#34; The object did not follow me and I don’t know where it went. I did not see it in my rear view mirror when I looked back. I did, however, as I continued driving see the lights out in the fields that were traveling down the stationary lights in the field. I stopped again to watch one that was at it’s &#34;end&#34; of its &#34;route&#34; and tried to communicate with it as it &#34;hovered&#34; out in the field. I felt no response to my questions. When it started moving inwards again like the other light, I drove away. The next night, at a hotel where I was staying with my sister in Andrews, TX, I awoke in the middle of the night to my body jerking (much like when you fall asleep) and the bed shaking from side to side underneath me. This has never happened to me before. My sister was not disturbed, nor was my dog in her cage near my bed. I felt an &#34;energy&#34; moving over my body and saw a tiny light &#34;dancing&#34; over the room that I could not explain. I felt parts of my body tingle throughout this process and at one time felt a &#34;pressure&#34; on the left side of my brain. I was able to move, however, I chose to stay still for several minutes since I was not uncomfortable during this experience. Then I got up and went outside and saw nothing out of the ordinary. I went back to sleep and then woke up and felt my bed shaking underneath my body at least 2 more times that night. I was extremely tired and so I immediately went back to sleep each time. I have no unusual marks on my body from this experience. I have noticed a different mental &#34;awareness&#34; since the incident and I am remembering all of my dreams so far each night since the event, which is not usual and has not happened to me since childhood. I have felt anxious since the event, however, this I feel is due to my own imagination and choosing to listen to stories my friends have told me they heard or read about abductions. I am choosing not to do the hypnosis, since having listened to some friends who are familiar with the hynotic process, I feel there is a tendency for suggestions to the mind that did not actually occur. I have absolutely no reason to think I was abducted (I have accounted for all time that night) and that whatever beings might have been in that object meant me any harm. I know what I saw was nothing I can describe based upon my experience or TV. I believe whatever technology could create such an object would be able to do whatever they wished to us and so logically to me this means they must be here in peace and even possibly to help us. I am 32 years old and have been a professional in the advertising industry for 10 years. I have traveled quite a bit to several countries and lived overseas in Switzerland during high school. I have never seen anything resembling a UFO before. I have never had hallucinations before. I have not been interested in UFOs prior to this event. In fact, although I believed that there were very likely more evolved beings in the universe, I did not actually think they were showing up here in the numbers people were claiming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length over the telephone and found her report to be quite sincere and convincing.  She is quite successful in her employment, and seened quite confused by what seemingly had taken place that morning.  A follow-up investigation has been initiated.  We have altered the indicated time here; it was at approximately 0200 hrs. on Friday, 01SE00.  PD))<n>
