8/15/55 00:01|Eagle Pass|TX|Cigar|10 minutes|Mr. Martin in 1955 has encounter with cigar shaped object in 1955|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14811.html|2|ndxe195508| Mr. Martin in 1955 has encounter with cigar shaped object in 1955<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have recently come across a magizine published by Dan Martin by DAP O&#39;Day press 9 the magazine has no publishing date on it). The booklet is about Mr. Martin&#39;s sighting of a ufo in the late summer (August) of 1955 and his encounter wiht beignd within this object. Mr. Martin asserts that he was driving north from Eagle pass Texas and had just passed the Nueses River It was about midnight . At this point suddenly Mr. Martin&#39;s legs and arms began to feel numb, Mr Martin quickly pulled off the side of the road fearing he was having a heart attack. As soon as his car was stopped a noise from behind his car caought his attention.An object came form behind Mr. Martin&#39;s car and stoped across the road form him. Mr. Martin describes a Cigar shaped craft that appeared to be hovering about 8 ft. above the ground. He could not see landing gears of any kind. At this point Mr. Martin felt compelled to get out of his car and walk across the road as he came around the back end of the object he say a medium sized humanoid woman step out of the craft. He says at this pont he had a conversation with this beign. After this breif conversation Mr. Martin got back into the car and cannot remember starting it. He watched the object take off at a very sharp angle, clearing very easily the nearby treetops. Mr. Martain never heard any noise from the object and within a matter of seconds from it taking off it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I got the sensation that i was floating when I released the steering wheel. The next thing that i remember is being 50 miles away at Fort Campbell Ky after releasin the steering wheel.  We had changed positions in the car.  I was no longer driving and he was in the drivers seat.  What was odd was that he didnt know how to drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

8/8/55 01:00|Independence|MO|Fireball|several hrs.|Flaming ball of light making right angle turns seen from front porch on a hot summer's night.|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50478.html|4|ndxe195508| Flaming ball of light making right angle turns seen from front porch on a hot summer&#39;s night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very hot summer evening and seeing as how we did not have air conditioning my older sister, younger brother and I were permitted to sleep on our front porch, since it was cooler than our bedrooms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this occurred so many years ago, the actual year could have been 1954 or might have even been 1956.  In any case, I was 8 or 9 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1:00 A.M. in the morning, I had to get up and use the bathroom.  I know it was around 1:00 A.M. because our clock struck the hour before I went back out onto the front porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was settling back down to go to sleep, I heard what could be likened to the sound of an 18 wheeler when it shifts down to a lower gear, and there was also a hissing sound like steam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat up and since I thought it was a truck coming down our little side road, I wanted to see that unusual sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Imagine my shock when instead of a truck, there in the sky was a fireball.  It was skimming along just above the trees lining a creek on the other side of the road.  It made a sharp right angle turn, and after it moved off perhaps 75 feet or so, it looked like it was dripping something flammable from beneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it stopped.  And just as I thought to myself....&#34;uh oh, they see me&#34;....<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is sitting on the front porch, and somehow the craft had already moved off some distance.  I tried to wake up my sister, but by the time I got her to wake up, it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing about this whole ordeal, was that it was already beginning to get light outside when I watched this craft move off.  I went from 1:00 A.M. to daylight without any memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mom about what happened, and she only suggested that I not tell anyone about what had occurred...and I haven&#39;t until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now married, retired, and no longer live in Missouri, and I don&#39;t see where this information is going to hurt anyone; and perhaps someone will find it useful or interesting.  If not, that is okay too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was around 7:00 PM.  The sun was down but it was still light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look at the moon because it was full and beautiful.  As I was looking at it, something looked like it came out from behind the bottom on the moon, traveled up the side and disappeared behind the top of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hollered at my dad and brother to look at the moon and they looked up in time to see it disappear behind the top of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have a clue what it was but it must have been traveling at a tremendous rate of speed to go up the whole side of the moon in about 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always wondered what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
