They moved swiftly and Rapidly through the sky. It had a strange Mist or fog around it a gas it seemed to make the T shape &#34;Frizzle&#34; in and out of reality it could not of been meteors or anything of the sort the T&#39;s changed direction every 10 seconds or so the T&#39;s travelled North Whereas I faced south the T&#39;s sped toward me it was so fast they went over the top of me at a height of about 50ft other people around me seemed to notice this happening but said nothing the objects  carried on traveling North I turned to view it but they had gone the amazmening things that happend on the 31st of October could not of been ordianary. After the incident a tail of what can only be described as floating water was left like a Slugs trail<n>

I&#39;m a natural skeptic thatI would actually see something like this, so I tried to think of what it could have possibly been other than a UFO. I wanted to think it was a meteor or something....except that it was going the wrong direction! I thought that was something other people could witness, but not me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I had gone to an AA meeting and were on the way home.  I&#39;m not sure of the exact time....somewhere between 11:00 pm and 12:00 pm.  We were driving north and came to a stop light.  Over to my left (in the west) and a good distance away, I saw a very large &#34;fireball&#34; shoot up from the ground (or from behind some trees...hard to tell)and straight up into the air, heading slightly to the north.  It was green....as you would imagine green light would look in front of a black back drop, somewhat varied in brightness.  When I first saw it at its largest state (just after leaving the ground)  the color was very intense and bright.....then the further it went, it became dimmer and less saturated. It appeared and disappeared within the span of 3-5 seconds.  I turned to my friend and asked him if he had seen it too.  He said he had.  I think that was a relief to both of us...to know we weren&#39;t hallucinating!<n>

I wasn&#39;t even looking in the sky, but the brightness of it caught my attention in the Northern sky and while it was in my sight, only lasted about 3 seconds.  It rocketed across the sky traveling from East to West for a short distance then simply disappeared.  In describing it&#39;s size, if I held up my hands a foot apart looking toward the sky, that&#39;s how long it was.  Using the same method for width, my hands would be about 4 inches apart.  There was no noticeable sound.  The night was partly cloudy, however, the object appeared in front of the clouds and the point at which it disappeared would have been where the sky cleared, but it disappeared as well.  I called to my husband, who was in the barn, but he did not get out in time to see it.  We live in the country, about 3 miles outside of town so there would not have been any city lights interfering. It made the hair on my neck stand up because, with the recent attacks on our country, I thought it was a missile and it truly scared me.  We observed the sky a few minutes longer, but saw nothing else.  My husband and I are local business owners.<n>

I was driving through the park in my town and a glowing blue sphere-like object quickly punched in and out of some low-lying clouds almost directly over me.  It appeared to be going forward at a very high speed.  The whole event lasted no more than a second.  The blue glow was a very soft light, and appeared to be &#34;humming&#34;.  I had my stereo up to high to hear anything, but the perfectly linear path looked as if it moved effortlessly and quietly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that it was a crashing airplane, but that was just the angle I was at, and also it was moving way to fast.<n>

All  I saw through the view finder was the clouds and the moon. I never saw what turned up in the photo. What ever it was, it had to be extremely fast to appear as lines on the photo and not to be noticed by myself.  I see them as 3 objects, a white large leader and 2 chasers, one smaller than the other and of a different color, almost blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s it , what’s it look like to you ? I’ve been wanting to show this to someone, I tried to contact some people at nasa.gov/apod/astropix, all I ever got was a dead end, unless you knew some one there, they didn’t want to look at any picture from some guy from Roswell, good grie !

At appoximately 171st and Oak Park Ave. in Tinley Park IL three red lights were just sitting moitionless in the sky in a straight uniform evenly spaced line. The objects made no noise at all  After about five minutes one of the lights moved and the three lights formed a Triangular shape.  After which the lights started heading east in a very slow manner.  They were very high in the air and were just a solid red light no indicator lights like on a plane or helicopter.  It was something amazing to witness and the local paper reports that they are unsure of what it was.  After about 10 more mintues the 2 of the lights disappeared into the cloud cover and the night. Shortly after the third and final red light was gone as well.  The paper reports one of the lights been spotted again briefly at about 9:30 PM<n>

We continued to watch it for a period of 10 to 20 minutes, we began to try and rationalize the object away as a star or earth gas but its in michigan sothere is no fault line and there was no moon  and overcast so it could not have been a planet,star,artificial satelite,etc. we could not figure out what this was it was obviouslt not a moderen air craft it didnt even look like any plane i have ever seen  and there is no way it was some sort of test craft as there is not a single air base on this side of michigan. This unidentifiable flying object vexed us and as We are just three of your average teenage boys  out trick or treating this never even crossed are mind that could have been happening so i have decided to post this now a year later after the fact to find some answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that if the sighting occurred on Halloween, the date must have been October 31.  We have amended the date here.  PD))<n>

A. area,|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20442.html|14|ndxe200110| A large flying saucer with white lights all around it, in the greater L. A. area,<n> <n><n> <n><n> On holloween night, October 31, 2001 I was going south on Rosemead Blvd. in the Arcadia/Temple City area, around 8 or 8:30 pm. I had an errand to run, and comming back home from the store there was a traffic accident on the intersection of Rosemead Blvd. and Longden Avenue. A police officer was involved, so all traffic going north was to detour on resdental streets.  I was heading North, and saw a flying saucer right in front of me,above the San Bernadino Mountains. I could not belive my eyes! I was alone in my car, expressing my disbelief in what I was looking at! It was very large, and there were lights all around the saucer. I pulled over to the curb to view it, but the street was lined with traffic, and I was causing even more traffic to build up.  That night we had a full moon, and the saucer was even bigger than what the moon appeared to be. It was hard to keep a full view of the craft since the street was tree lined.  As I was tring to keep the craft in view, I thought maybe it was a blimp.  It took me around two minutes, if that, to get back onto Rosemead Blvd.,  heading north bound. I was able to see it without anything blocking my view.  It&#39;s location seemed to me to be over the Glendale Mountain area, about 20 miles west of my area of Arcadia.  I know that if it were a blimp, it would have still been hovering over my area.  This has caused me concern as to why I had not heard of anyone else seeing it.  A friend of mine said she heard on a radio staion the next day,November 1st,01  that if anyone else had seen this flying saucer, to phone in and report their sighting, but said she did not know what radio staion it was, since she was not in her car at the time this request. If you, or anyone else knows of this sighting on October 31 st, 2001, please let me know.  If someone did this just because it was Holloween, I still have a problem tying to understand how, why someone would spend millions of dollars on such a prank.<n>

This cloud bank was massive. A Sony Hi-8mm 72x zoom camcorder was being used to capture the moment when the camera caught a ping from the infrared right in the mid section of the cloud bank. Clouds typically make the camera fuzz out because nothing is there to rebound the focus. The focus was almost immediate. It became evident, real fast, that something was either hiding or being masked in the clouds. It may even have been generating the cloud cover. We guess the initial distance to be about 10km+ from our location. The film captured something of encredible size, perhaps 1500&#39;+ in length and no guess on the height. It appeared to have stuff hanging all over it. The IR was scanned above and below this region and found only the fuzz indication of emptyness, nothing to ping back. I know it sounds crazy, but everyone that sees the clip walks away with their eyes wide open and their mouths dropped open and with a stare. Their are appearances of reptilian shapes and symbols on this leathery textured object. It&#39;s very strange, but it was there.  Viewers in awe after watching the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance from viewer:  10km - 20km Number of objects:  1 Motion of objects:  Extremely still for about 2 minutes, then gone from view and believed to be recaptured  about 12 minutes later on film at a much further distance up to about 20km further out away from camerman. Watched the shape at a distance move two different directions and then upward back into the cloud bank and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Direction of movement:  West-NW, eventually moved more NW direction until out of view. About 45 minutes later a helicopter came and spot-lighted the vacinity for almost 45 minutes, spotting into the clouds and all around.  Yes, spotting the clouds.  About ten minutes later a fighter flew over, up like a rocket and loop to loop out to the same direction of that being filmed.  Shortly after that, another fighter repeated the path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration of sighting:  From about 7:11pm - 7:34 pm  Sound:  Very quiet. As a matter of fact, the birds were not as active.  Several neighbors did complain of headaches, some associated with a high to low pitch frequencies, twice in the preceding week.  Also, brief headaches were noted during the same period, but without the freq noise. Everyone thinks the INS building a few hundred yards away was probably tweaking some security gizmo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Number of witnesses:  Not sure on event.  Many have seen the film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comments:    At least I now know for sure about ET and this part of the mystery has been validated for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background of witness(es):  Professional, President of privately held consulting firm.<n>

I live in Syracuse NY and back on October 30th 2001 while my son was driving me home around 5:00pm/5:30pm we both saw something very strange. There was a full moon (or it looked full to us) and starting at the 4 or 5 on a clock going diagonally across the moon was a thin black line. It grew as it went across the very bright moon but stopped growing once it reached halfway then started to shrink back to nothing exiting at the 10:00/11:00 on a clock. There wasn&#39;t any air vapors before or after the moon and I tried to catch the news hoping there would be mention of it. We were on the road at the time (690 going east). It was the strangest thing I have seen in a long time. My son believe other drivers must have seen it too because the traffic wasn&#39;t moving at the 60pmh it normally moves at.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky is perfectly bright and blue with no clouds at all.  At first I thought nothing of it and then thought that this is kinda weird.  They looked like stars but it&#39;s too late in the day and they were too bright and too big to be stars.  I went to another room to grab my binoculars and went outside.  When I got outside I was unable to find the objects.  I returned to my office and looked out the window again and there they were.  I thought maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me.  The whole thing was driving me crazy.  I was sure they were really there.  Sure enough I found them in the binoculars and watched them.  One was positioned at 12 o&#39;clock and the other below it and to the left at 8 o&#39;clock.  As I watched, the lower one moved to the right.  Both of them appeared to be followed by a light cloud of smoke, not a stream.  As the lower one approached the 6 o&#39;clock position both of them just disappeared as if they ducked behind a cloud, yet there are no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I write this description of the event, one hour later, a third or one of the original two has appeared in the same place.  This time I took a picture but it surely won&#39;t show much as the object is too small and the camera too weak.  As I watched, it has drifted out of sight away from me and upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never thought that I had seen a UFO before, although I have always believed in them.  I don&#39;t know what a weather balloon looks like but this was definately a unique experience and I&#39;m positive that what I saw was not conventional aircraft.<n>

Like I said...glow balls without a pattern. They came up fast. some of them danced around each other....they were so high in the sky that we couldn&#39;t tell if they were running above  and around each other or what....we just couldn&#39;t do anything but watch. WE watched until they got so high bove us in an unbelievable amount of time...then...whoosh....they were gone like they had never been there.   We didn&#39;t know who to tell abpout it but us. We knew noone would ever believe us. WE knew that no agency would ever admit it. When we talk about it, it&#39;s just that we KNOW what we saw. It overwhemed us. WE weren&#39;t looking for it. WE hadn&#39;t been talking about ufo&#39;s and gotten our imaginations up.....it just happened....out of the blue.I&#39;ll never know how to describe what I saw.

Made no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Happened a while ago. We were coming from a nearby Halloween campfire and started to drive through a neighboorhood, looked up and seen a huge floating disk. It was pitch black out so I couldn&#39;t make out the shape too well. However, it had a blue light on the bottom and 2 (or more) red lights around the side making it appear to be a disk. 4 witnesses. The strangest thing about this was that it made absolutely no noise. It was approximatley 150 feet from the tops of houses and added to the fear because I thought it was going to crash onto one of the roofs. We stopped the car and it hovered over the houses for about  10 seconds and then jetted off unbelievably fast....so fast that it was out of sight in seconds. We attempted to follow it to a cornfield but when we looked up, all we could see where two lights and it appeared to have split in half. Amazed that no one else has came forward with this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a huge light and at first I thought maybe another plane was going to crash due to September 11th was only 5 weeks earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the doors and watched the light which was above the tree lines, and noticed that there was a much smaller amber circle following just behind and below the larger light. Then the all of a sudden the small light shot right up and out of sight it a split second. I knew then this was not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to my bedroom and woke my husband froma sound sleep. We ran out the french door and onto our deck with no lights on and it was a perfectly clear quiet fall night with a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was in the Navy on a aircraft carrier and he could not say that it looked like any known craft that he had ever saw.  It was pulsing with a shifting orange red light.  It made no noise what so ever, and moved very gracefully and slow, at the exact level in the sky, and what really was the clincher was that it seemed every dog in the neighborhood from all around us what barking. I mean we heard echo&#39;s of dog&#39;s barking near and far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took place in at least a 5 min period.  I mean I had enough time to wake my husband after first seeing it and run back out onto the deck and we both watched it for at least another min. and a half until it went out of sight.<n>

I observed the object flying on a straight path, then it begain to zig-zag. The side to side motions were approximately 8-10 times the width of the object. It zig-zaged 4 times then flew straight for about the same distance and repeated the zig-zag motion. I turned away from the object for a moment then looked back in the direction but couldn&#39;t find it anymore.<n>

His house sets on a little hill overlooking a small town 5 miles north. We stood on his concrete basketball court and fratenized in the cool missouri air. I looked to my east, northeast,above the horizon was a pink, wispy, cloud superimposed on the blue night. It was like a light but not, it was like a paintbrush stroke but not.  It was large, i estimate it to be around the size of 30 full moons, speaking of the moon it was directly opposite the pink anomali. As any young 21 year old of average intelligence might gather, &#34;this must be the northern lights&#34;. It was beautiful  whatever it was and it held our full attetion for its duration. But here&#39;s the clincher about 3 minutes into the sighting a red pulsing light caught our attetion, due north, toward the town. The light seemed to be between us and the town, but closer to the town of some 14,000. It was red, stoplight red,and its lights never toataly went out, but dimmed and brightened in a methodial pattern, bright 1000 dim 1000.i estimate its size at 1/10 the moons. As the round light, as i could make out no shape of a craft, moved east toward the wispy pink anomali they both seemed to slowly disappear. That was it and they where gone. Sound u ask. Yes we heard a sound even befor the sighting, we thought it was a jet overhead, but it seemed to linger, who knows if they&#39;re  connected.  I have no idea if the red pulsing light was connceted to the pink discoloration. I&#39;ve had a couple more sightings, none this intresting. My friend can backup all this 100%. What an intresting world we live in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the pink glow in the north may have been an example of the &#34;Northern Lights,&#34; also called the Aurora boreallis.  The red pulsing light may have been a strobe or Grimes Light on an aircraft.  PD))<n>

She is a very serious person in the way that she is&#39;nt fooled. At about 23:00 we went from Paramus to Hackensack to pick up my brother from the bowling alley. We say 4 lights that move around in oval orbits.They moved around as a group never changing their movements. We looked for a source of the lights but couldn&#39;t find any. You could tell they were moving as a group because you could see that when they crossed pathes it was over a different spot then before.had a bright narrow end and extened to a faded wide end. We watched each one move around and as they met in the middle the bright part of the light seemed to miss each other. When we got home I took out my Telescope and aimed it at a fixed spot where the lights would move through my point of view. After about 5 minutes of consistantly looking through the telescope I saw a little bright dot move just in front of the light. When I called my mom to see she saw that one of the lights stopped and became brighter. I quickly turned the telescope tword it but just as I almost had it in my finderscope it faded away.<n>

It seemed too bright to be a star and appeared to be slowly moving west.  As it moved closer, we were able to see about 3 flashing lights that made us think it might be a small plane.  However, the craft seemed to just stop in the sky.  Then my son said it &#34;took off&#34; at a high rate of speed and disappeared.  Then, once we were closer to home about 10 minutes later (as I was telling my son it was an airplane) I saw about 4 more (the flashing lights made me think they were planes, but then their flight pattern and hovering would say they weren&#39;t).  My son then tells me he sees a large one behind a true.  As I&#39;m driving west toward my home, I see an object with three bright round lights (in a row) at about only 25 feet above my house.  As I got closer, it was gone (the darkness made it difficult to see a shape...though you could see there was something definately behind the lights.<n>

We looked at the craft with binoculars, and both  agreed that we could not tell what it was. It was a relatively low altitude, 10,000 feet or under. Several airplanes were flying overhead, and all had contrails, but the craft we were seeing had no contrail. If you would like to contact me, please do so by e-mail.<n>

While in my backyard, I saw a commercial aircraft going overhead apparently only moments after take off from the local airport. I glanced up at the plane and noticed, in the blue sky at a much higher altitude, a star like object. Had the plane not passed over, I probably would never have noticed the object. It looked like a star of average brightness, but this was 1 in the afternoon, and the only object of its kind visible. The object moved very slowly from east to west, perhaps slightly southwest. At one point, the object abruptly changed its course and moved south for about one minute. Then it once again resumed its westerly course. As I said, the object moved at what appeared to be a very low speed and was at high altitude. While watching, I observed two high flying commercial jets flying over Memphis, apparently bypassing the city enroute to other destinations. These planes were leaving contrails, but appeared to be at a lower altitude than the object. They were also moving at a considerably higher speed than the object. At one point the object came to a dead stop in the sky. It appeared to hover over what appeared to be the center of the city for at least ten minutes. It was absolutely stationary. It then resumed its westerly course. There were no erratic manuevers or sudden changes in speed other other than the 10 minute period of hovering and the brief change of direction to the south I mentioned. The object moved in straight lines. I ruled out a balloon figuring winds at such an altitude would have driven the object across the sky at a much faster rate, and balloons tend not to hover and remain stationary for ten minutes at a time. The entire sighting lasted aproximately 30 minutes and the object could not have covered more than 45-50 degrees of arc in the sky during this time. It did not appear to emit light of its own. It reflected sunlight and the intensity of the reflection varied as it moved across the sky. I am not a trained observer, but if this object was indeed as high as I thought, flying higher than airliners bypassing Memphis, it must have been  a rather large craft based on the intensity of the reflection. I followed its course with the naked eye until I lost sight of it as it moved into the path of the sun.<n>

Stars shining brightly.  No evidence of dawn yet.  We observed a singular, dark cloud about 8 miles to the east in the dark sky.  There was a beam of red light about 100 feet across shining straight down to the ground from the base of the cloud.  The red shaft of light was visible for about one minute.  Vehicles were stopped, lights and engines off, to watch the event.  A retired naval flight crew member said that in twenty years of flying he had never seen anything like it.  When the red light went out, it became dark once again.  Sunrise occurred about 45 minutes later.<n>

They observed from door windows an orange (fire-colored) sphere, appearing about 3 feet in diameter, floating noiselessly about 4 feet above the ground, approximately 150 feet from their observing location.  The sphere was floating near a water well located behind a building in their property and in front of a wooded area; no light sources are installed at that location, and lights from the state highway at the front of the property do not penetrate that area.  The denseness of the woods and the slope of a hill behind the sighting location precludes the possibility of neighbor&#39;s lighting sources being the source of this light.  The observers watched the sphere for approximately one hour, as it shifted position within about a 10-foot area, including changes in elevation of about the same range, continuing to make no sound.  After about an hour, the sphere slowly faded into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers are both keen observers of weather and surroundings, coming from farm backgrounds and being avid watchers of wildlife in their backyard and adjoining woods.  They both describe the sphere as looking like a full autumn moon, except their was no full moon at the observation time and the sphere clearly illuminated only the surrounding buildings and trees.  Neither observer felt that the light was a flashlight, and found no indications of trespassers after daylight.  Submission of this report by son of observers.<n>

We exitted the ramp from highway 64 onto Airport Road (AND NO IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE) and began to on the first right towards my aparmtent. I casually glanced up (he was driving and I was in passenger seat) and hovering below the powerlines maybe only 10-15 feet above my car was a gray/silver UFO. It was twice the size of my car, round, discus shape I suppose, with white lights around the middle and a red light on the bottom. I want to say there was a green or blue light but it is fuzzy. It also had silver like &#39;windows&#39; all around it. The light on the car and inside flickered several times but he engine did not stop. I have not wanted to talk about it...and don&#39;t know why I am now. I screamed for him to stop and rolled down my window. There was no sound, acutally everything was erily silent. No cars, noise, people...nothing. I noticed around the craft was a gas-like ring. Similar to the phenomenon in the summer on hot asphault when heat is rising (it&#39;s the best I can do to describe it). It began to lower itself slowly behind the powerlines and some trees. Unfortunately my fiance revved up the car and took off. I was screaming for him to turn around.  He finally did...but we saw no sign of it and he wouldn&#39;t let me go into the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, althought the witness does not indicate that fact.

My wife pointed out to me a &#34;moving star&#34;. I noticed it and told her it was a satellite and resumed my star-gazing. In a very short time, 1 or 2 minutes, she said it &#34;changed directions very quickly&#34;. I then started watching the object. The object seemed extremely high in the atmosphere. It would move in one steady direction, then, as if it were tired of doing that, it would take a quick 90 degree turn in another direction. Then one of my friends noticed another object, then another. There were now a total of 3 moving &#34;stars&#34;. They roamed around a bit going one direction then another. They would also be moving east, then immediately go 180 degrees towards the west. They then seemed to group in a very large triangle after about 10 minutes of our observance. When they finally were in the triangle formation, they would move back and forth very rapidly from east to west in the 180 degree fashion. I am not gullable, nor do I jump to conclusions. This was the FIRST ufo sighting I have ever witnessed. It was very odd and I now have chills reporting this. The only theory I have come up with in the past 3 weeks since the incident is that they were some sort of military craft like a star-wars anti-missile(ICBM) craft.     Food for thought:Sattellites do not move like that because they would need fuel to propel themselves, right?<n>

We were driving from Petaluma to Sebastopol and the car was running so bad we didn&#39;t think it would make it home.  It was running rough and kept stalling out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving west on Hiway 116, and we noticed a bright, bright light above the car.  The light was pointing straight down at the car blinding us.  We thought it was a helicopter at first.  When we turned left onto my street, it turned with us.  We slowed down to a stop, jumped out to look up, and it was so bright we couldn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car and drove to my house, and it stayed above the car all the way home. When we pulled into my driveway, it was right above us.  Then it was hovering above my house, and it was as big as my four-bedroom house.  It gave off a friendly aura.  I wasn&#39;t even scared.  I had a warm feeling inside.  It didn&#39;t seem like a threat in any way, but like it wanted to make friends.  It had little bright, bright lights all over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing tilted and the lights started blinking alternately. They were giving us a light show.  The lights would go fast, then slow, as if he was showing off.  He tilted on his side, made all the lights blink really fast, then the lights all stopped and it was gone in a blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it appeared again instantly, no sound, and sat above the house again.  It tilted one way, then the other, and it was gone again.  I felt honored that it chose me to show itself to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reading this over when I finished writing it, I realize it sounds crazy.  But it really happened.  If someone else told me this story, I never would have believed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never believed in UFO&#39;s until this day.  Now I&#39;m a believer.

But I did see the back end of the pattern four times before I went inside my house.  There were several minutes between sightings.  I could also hear a low rumbling, almost like a jet engine, but it was constant, never really fading too much as the object went away, and didn&#39;t really get louder as it came close.

I decided to go out side before going to bed.    I was looking up at the sky, as usual, and I saw what I believe was a UFO. It didn&#39;t have any lights on it (that I could see) but I was still able to see it (very clearly) traveling across the sky, low to the horizon. It was kind of a dark gray in color. It was traveling from east to west. It was oval in shape, and appeared to be traveling at about the same speed a plane would, flying at a low altitude. Yet it appeared to be high in the sky. To get an idea of how big it was from my point of view, go out side, stretch your arm out and hold a &#34;quarter&#34; up to the sky, flat side facing you. That&#39;s approximately how big the UFO was against the night sky.<n>

And it was moving side-ways, and then it dissapeared... suddenly. There was only one ball. And it was silver, shiny and it looked like it was not reflecting off of the sun very much, but naturally it was that color. And about 4 seconds later I saw a plane, and I couldn&#39;t find the sphere like object.<n>

I looked closer, and noticed a triangular object that appeared to be transparent, and outlined in lights.  The lights were 1/2-1/4 the light of the nearest stars. The body of the craft moved from the 90 degree angle that it first appeared to me, to approx. 45 degrees on the Southern horizon before disappearing (it became too hard to see-IT DID NOT SPEED OFF). The body of the craft fluctuated, acting as if it were floating atop the waves in the ocean. The lights all appeared to be fixed to the craft, and moved in unison with body. The craft appeared to be bigger than a full moon in size. The craft appeared to be moving steadily, and my view of it lasted approximately 7 seconds. What was interesting, is that it seemed like you could look through the body of the craft, and see the sky behind it.<n>

I pointed it out to my friend and he thought it looked odd too.  We knew it was a UFO when we studied its movement.  It would speed up and then slow down as if it had brakes.  Not like a regular airplane.  Then right before we lost track of it.  It deployed another smaller red light and it fell downward.  It was amazing.  I had never seen anything like it before.

Once they passed I noticed a Boeing 747 higher in the sky traveling east to west.  What was strange was the two smaller planes following the large 747. At first I thought the smaller planes were escorts (like maybe it was the President&#39;s plane with two fighter escorts)  But the smaller planes were both on the left side of the 747. They were dark in color but surrounded by a translucent cirle. by  Then the 747 started to turn south and the two smaller planes did an ariel loop-de-loop and ended up behind the 747. Then the two smaller planes sped off so fast I couldn&#39;t tell in what direction they traveled. I kept asking my friend if he could see the two small planes.  We both concluded that the two smaller planes had vanished. We could still see the 747.<n>

Yet it was only as long as the width of my finger when I held my finger up to the sky.  It was moving very quickly.  And then as we were driving the tree line obscured it and I could no longer see where it was going.  At first I was afraid it was a bomb or missle yet it did that 90 degree turn.

Let me make somthing perfectly clear this jet is Big at least 2 football fields long wide etc. The Ball that passed in front of it was half is big as the jet so it can&#39;t be to small acording to distance because both objects are in clear focus.

There were several (5-6) lights at least one red and the others white as if on a plane. The lights were blinking very rapidly and the object was moving up down, side to side and back and forth. I thought it&#39;s strange movement must be caused by going in and out of clouds, but I realized there were stars all around so there were no dense clouds. The object moved in this manner along the south sky from east to west, then I watched it go over the house from the west north. It moved along straight like a &#34;normal&#34; aircraft as it went from the west, northward at which point I lost sight of it. Although I could not say the shape of this object, the lights flashed in a &#34;sequence&#34; or &#34;formation&#34; that gave the appearance of a diamond shape.<n>

It was about 8:45pm, I was waiting to close the shop at 9:00pm. Watching the sky which was hazy but clear enough to see stars. There was a light layer of clouds coming from the west out of California. I suddenly caught a glimps of somthing flying over my head. I looked up to see a group of three reddish/orange, some what bright yet fuzzy looking lights flying at what seemed to be couple of hundred feet above my head but completely silent. It travel at a very fast speed from east to west in the direction of Luke Air Force Base. It travel from above my head all the way across the sky to disappear over single story house across the 30 foot wide alley behind my shop. This took a total of about 6 to 8 seconds, just long enough for me to jump out of the chair i was leaning back in and shouted what the hell is that. My receptionist looked out the door and said &#34;what, what?!&#34; Just as it was passing over the top of the roof of the house. Then another person I work with ran out the back door and was asking what I saw. I was describing it to her and all of a sudden a boomerang shaped cloud traveling the same direction east to west, was moving across the sky at an extremely fast speed too. The other clouds that were in the sky never changed,they were in the same place as they were when the event started.<n>

I was driving around the corner before Devil&#39;s Backbone, when I saw it.  At first I thought it was an airplane, the airports only a few miles away, but something about it wasn&#39;t quite right.  I pulled off of the road at an observation spot for the backbone, which looks out over a valley.  I could see the craft hovering down there, then it would fly up higher.  I would estimate that it never got higher than a few thousand feet, as I could still make out individual lights.  It almost seemed to be flying a search pattern, it just went back and forth, high and then low.  It seemed to be moving slowly, ground speed wise.  I am pretty familiar with the area where it was, and I know about how much ground it covered.  It took about two minutes to make one pass over the valley, which is only about half a mile across or so.  It flew by seven or eight times, then just took off like a rocket!  It disappeared from my sight in about ten seconds, but there wasn&#39;t much noise, I don&#39;t know if what I heard was the wind or the craft.  I do know that right before it left, I heard a train approaching the Tunnelton Tunnel, which is very near by.  I could hear the whistle, probably a mile or two from me.<n>

He said the mystery object had a reflective glare like the metallic exterior of a passenger jet, but it did not move like one. It maneuvered more like a helicopter, although he saw no rotor blades and it suddenly, abruptly went straight up and out of view. This gentleman had no idea what to do with the footage and contacted the local newspaper. He&#39;d seen it 5 years ago and again before this, but this was the first time he had a video camera. I found this website while researching for the story. We reported on numerous UFO sightings in Fyffe, Alabama and strange cattle mutilations that suddenly ended.

We happened to be looking up for a moment and saw a turquiose luminous cigar shaped object streak across the sky.  It was as if a neon light    has turned on for a moment and streaked across half the sky above us,then turn off then back on again.  This object was cloud high and confounded the two of us.

The first object appeared to be fairly close and had a beam of light barely visible coming from the front of the object.  The second UFO appeared shortly after I spotted the first one.  They were very intensely bright, a silver color, so there was no way to distinguish a shape.  To the eye they appeared like a round cluster of with tenacles of light protruding from all sides that hung down at the ends as if they were heavy, like a tree limb full of rain or snow.  The only thing I could relate it to is a decoration that one uses at a party to hang from the ceiling that has many short pieces that hang at downward angles when unfolded and hung.  I lost sight of them at one point, but as I turned the corner and looked to see if i could spot them I could see one UFO had risen and was barely visible as an eerie glow in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke to this witness, and we found her to be quite credible and convincing.

The wind shifted and I looked up to make sure no sparks were going to hit my roof, when I noticed a twin prop commercial plane heading south, appearing behind it, closing at a high rate of speed was a small silver object. Estimated speed of object 2000 miles per hour plus. I walked from the garden to my 800 foot front lawn, still watching both objects. The silver object seemed to come to a stop behind the small plane but stayed with the plane for about 20 seconds. All at once the object moved back towards me, made a loop, came to a dead stop and accelerated out of sight at a 45 degree angle. At that time I considered calling my wife outside, but hesitated. As I went back to the garden to check the fire, a commercial jet heading south about the same altitude, flew over. I proceeded to observe this one also. From the northeast sky another silver ball closed in on the jet, staying behind the jet about one half mile. This one was weaving from side to side. It stayed behind the jet for about one minute. It then sped off in the same direction as the other object. This one seemed to travel a little faster then the first object. At this time I called my wife outside. As my wife came down onto the front lawn, two more objects appeared, not accompanied by any commercial aircraft. They both raced off to the east. My wife did not see these objects at this time as they moved too quickly for her to catch sight of them. I went into the house to get my binoculars. I do not own a video camera, which I really regret. At this time my wife and I started noticing a dark area, we are not sure if it was a cloud, fog or mist forming directly overhead, it appeared to be 25000-35000 feet high, estimated. It looked like it stretched in symetrical shape, about two miles. As this &#34;cloud&#34; seemed to get darker activity increased, at this time only with small objects appeared. Now my wife started to see them also. Let me state at this time the sky! to the north, south, east and west of this &#34;cloud&#34; was extremely clear and blue, except for the &#34;cloud&#34; directly overhead. My wife stated at this time&#34;they do not seem to be coming from the outskirts of the horizon, but from the &#34;perimeter&#34; of the &#34;cloud&#34; area&#34;. For about a fifteen second burst, way off to the south, two smaller objects trailing behind one larger object, the larger object being three times larger then the small objects ,they seemed to be swaying back and forth behind the larger one, similar to a kite tail. They came and went so quickly my wife didn&#39;t see them. Remember, I had been looking through binoculars. These objects seemed to just disappear from my sight. For the next 4-5 minutes the cloud, mist, fog got a darker grey in color. My wife sighted two large silver objects traveling side by side from the northeast heading southwest, from the perimeter to the center of the cloud formation, when they got to the center of the cloud area they disappeared from her sight, she did not see them come out of the cloud area. At the same time I myself observed other objects, two large ball shapes exiting the southeast corner of the cloud, they were moving half the speed of the smaller objects observed earlier. This lasted for about forty seconds.Immediately after these seperate sightings, the cloud increased to its darkest color and we sighted a silver boomarang, vee shaped object heading east-southeast.,it was moving much slower than the rest,it seemed to have sqared off wings at the ends,the size was about 1/and 1/2 times bigger than a 747 airplane,again all objects had no sounds,for the next couple off minutes nothing appeared ,where it came from i am not sure, but heading in the same direction as the v object ,an older  military plane which had those pontoon type ends on the wings ,the wings were straight.,seemed to be following the v, let me also state it was an extremly wide v, dusk was now stating to set in,and it seemed now the so called cloud was almost gone, these were not off this earth. as my ! wife sta ted to me this was some type off portal, or cloking devise , on this planet no one has this tech. yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at considerable length, and we found him to be quite credible.

Driving southbound on Harrison Street at 9th Avenue--- STRANGLY ENOUGH where about a year ago I had a dream of seeing a UFO- I spotted a shiny object in my front field of vision. I slowed down, stuck my head out the window, and it just vanished. I thought it might just be a common sun reflection off of a plane. However, it now occurs to me that the sun reflection would have to be on the OTHER side of the plane, as I was north of the object.&lt;P&gt; I kept looking up in the sky casually, though slightly alerted. I then got in the turn lane of Colorado Blvd, waiting for traffic to clear to make a left turn eastbound. I then spotted either another object or the same object high in the eastern part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a VERY bright dot- just hanging in one spot, and rock solid, not moving at all.&lt;P&gt; I made my turn, and immediately parked the car on 6th Ave.&lt;P&gt; I got out of the car, and looked up to see a bright object, again totally immovable in the sky, about 60 degrees up from the horizon. Imagine how bright this object must have been to catch my attention from inside my car, waiting to make a turn, in broad daylight. I had one small Fuji Finepix 2.1 (4 MP extension) megapixel digital camera in the car which I used to take about 10 pictures, the best of which are below. This camera has only a 3X zoom lens-- IT FIGURES! This day I did not have my high power digital zoom video camera with me (never again!!)&lt;P&gt; Never the less, you can clearly see the object between the light and the curve of the lower tree branch.&lt;P&gt; Upon enlarging, the object appears to be a metallic sphere, with light reflecting off of the upper right hand side- facing the position of the sun. &lt;P&gt; I watched the completely stationary object for about 15 minutes, up and down the street, even driving around the block , and confirmed its presence by talking with about six other people waiting for the bus (they had not seen it until I pointed it out, then confirmed it was there).<n> <n><n> <n><n> &lt;P&gt; I then decided to quickly drive home and get my telescope and more powerful cameras with stronger lenses. From my home a mile away, the object was not visible. When I returned to the exact same spot about 10-15 minutes later the object could no longer be seen. &lt;P&gt; I returned home and checked my computer sky chart program to see if there were any planets or bright stars in that part of the sky- and there was nothing at all. The brightest star above the horizon was Vega, and at 3 PM, it was completely invisible, as well as not being in the same part of the sky where I had seen this object. &lt;P&gt; I considered that it could be a mylar birthday or maybe another balloon reflecting sunlight, but given the amount of time that I watched it, its&#39; apparent size at a distance and brightness (I could judge it was very high up from my perspective as I moved down the street, and that it did not budge any perceptible amount whatsoever during this time, this seemed pretty much impossible. A balloon in the atmosphere would move up or to the side- and this object was absolutely rigid in one location, as a star would be (and I ruled out any possibility of celestial object with my investigation).<n> <n><n> <n><n> &lt;P&gt; I thought that maybe it could be a stationary satellite reflecting the sun, and so I would return on the next day and see if it was again visible. I returned again to the exact same spot at the exact same time the following day with the same weather and carefully scanned the same part of the sky, but absolutely nothing could be seen, ruling out a stationary satellite. See the photo below, taken at exactly the same position and time as the previous day, and compare with the photo above from the same spot that clearly shows the object:&lt;P&gt; Images at:  http://www.http://www.neilslade.com/UFOs.html   second half of page<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.

I can&#39;t believe I noticed it, because it is as if it is camouflaged in the night sky. I just so happen to look up and notice three stars movng and thought that is odd, so I drove closer, and got out of my car and really took a good look at it. It was relatively low, very quiet, and seem to be very large. At this time, I became nervous, because I knew that what I was watching was not of the norm. Then I got back in my car and followed it for a minute, but then it seem to vanish from my view. It really could be very hard to realize it was there unless you were looking at there at the right time, but once I realized that this was definetly a moving object, it really kind of scared me, because of the size and the whole thing.<n>

I had to stop her twice to calm her down as I could not understand what she was saying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night before, Jill and Jack went to bed at 9:30PM. At midnight, Jill was awakened to the dogs in the house &#34;going nuts&#34; and to a noise directly above the bedroom outside that was loud enough to vibrate the walls slightly with each pulse. The noise was described by Jill as being the sound you hear when someone takes a large but thin piece of sheet metal and bows it in and out, making that sort of &#34;whirring&#34; or &#34;whipping&#34; noise that comes from the vibration...only this was higher in pitch, perfectly rythem&#39;d, and many times louder, emanating from directly above the bedroom roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She described her reaction as nothing less than total uncontrolled fear and panic. The dogs in the house were loud and frantic in their reaction to the noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the two minutes that this took place, she was unable to wake Jack as he simply laid asleep, not responding to the deafening noise from above, the panic of the cats and dogs and the screams of Jill to wake up, accompanied by hits to the arm and slaps to the face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the noise disappeared, the cats and dogs were quiet, and within 5 seconds, Jack opened his eyes to see Jill staring at him, holding the cat, with eyes swelled shut and red from crying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;What?&#34; Jack said. Jill reports that she was angry beyond words that Jack would not wake up during this but cannot understand why he didn&#39;t. Jack got out of bed, turned on the light and opened the bedroom window and listened but all was quiet. He then turned off the TV which had been left on earlier. He turned off the light and went back to bed. Shortly after returning to bed, the chimes on the clock rang on the hour but the tones rang with an intermittent rhythm and backwards from what is normal. Jack and Jill looked at one another, and again Jill began crying. Jill was unable to go to sleep for the rest of the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening, I talked with them on the phone and had them go across the street to ask the neighbors if they had seen or heard anything but they were not home. Jack and Jill live in a very rural part of the country with very few neighbors and a lot of forest around their home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday morning, I called to check on Jill before she went to work as Jack had already left. I asked if they had bothered to look closely outside for any signs of broken trees around the house. They had not. On the phone I had her go to the glass door that leads from the kitchen to the outside and look out and back toward the back of the house and above to see if she noticed anything. As she opened the door she looked out and yelled &#34;Oh my God, Eric!&#34; and began crying again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the house, just on the other side of the bedroom wall is a deck. Over the rail of the deck by the trees, in view of Jill as she looked down the side of the house, were all five chairs from the deck and the table with all 4 legs broken off, scattered next to the trees. She was unable to get hold of Jack due to where he works.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The table and chairs where they lay as found after the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jack called me when he got home that afternoon, before he had talked to Jill, and I guided him on the phone over to the door and had him look out. His reply was, &#34;oh shit!&#34; Jack reports seeing the furniture on the patio on early Monday evening as he went out to the deck to return a ladder which is kept under the deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jill has many interests, but talking about or following UFO information is not really one of them. She flatly states that she just knows this was a UFO over the house and has no doubt even though she was too terrified to look out the window during the event. Even during the time she was trying to wake up Jack, she was screaming at him that it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, October 20th, I went out to Jill and Jack&#39;s home where I took pictures of the back deck area and took samples of soil and vegetation in the areas where the chairs and table lay on the other side of the deck rail. Some of the pieces of the table legs were scattered around the area, one as far as 11 feet away from the table. Other items were noticeably untouched on the deck including the hot tub cover, a small tarp over that cover, several bottles of tub chemicals, two BBQs, a plant pot with only dirt in it, and a garbage can 1/4 full of garbage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should also be noted that a yellow ash tray which had a permanent home on the deck was missing. Jack and I spent nearly an hour searching the radius of the area...a very thorough search...and the ash tray was no where to be found. Bothered by this disappearance, Jack continued the search after I left and as of this writing, Sunday afternoon the 21st, it still has not been found and Jack feels it&#39;s no longer on the property outside the home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The soil and vegetation samples will be sent to BLT Research for analysis to find out if the area where the chairs lay was exposed to any of the energies described in the research by Levengood, Burke and Talbot. Further findings of this investigation will be found here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE: On Monday the 22nd, I got mail from our Chief of Investigations Mike Downey of Portland. Mike had gotten a call on his message machine from Tom Henderson of the Polk County Observer Newspaper. Tom was unaware of the Jill and Jack case and was calling to ask if Mike knew anything of a report that he (Tom) had got at the paper over a sighting report that took place on Wednesday the 10th, five days before Jill&#39;s encounter. This new report to the paper involved a guy and his wife who saw a reflection of light coming through the window of their mobile home. When they went to investigate, they saw a yellowish, red light shoot away, up into the clouds at a high rate of speed. The couple did not leave their names and was hoping that something might have been mentioned in the paper about it. I contacted Tom at the observer and confirmed the story and that he could not help in locating this couple for questioning. There may be some mention of it in the paper in hopes of bringing these witnesses to OUFOR for a statement. Tom also noted on the phone to me that the paper had in fact gotten &#34;quite a few&#34; phone calls over the last couple of years concerning UFO sightings in Polk County. Those sightings were passed on to MUFON. Tom has agreed to pass on further sightings to OUFOR as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eric Byler - Assistant State Director, Oregon UFO Research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor - Oregon UFO Review.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.oregonuforeview.com<n>

The nith sky was very clear. All of a sudden I noticed a luminous light was shing on me from behind me.  What struck me to notice this light was that I could see my body ool but nothing else in my back yard had a shadow.  I have a large backyard,neither the trees or fences or anything else had a shadow but me.  I finally turned around and looked up in the sky and saw what appeared to be a search light beyond my front yard.  There were no helicopters in the area or planes.  But the fact that there was no shadow to my trees or fences but there was one on me.  The next night I was co-hosting a radio talk show on KENS Radio 1160. I was interviewing a friend of mine and the last question s were of any ufos that he had experiences with.  I related my story on the air and my cohost had been driving that same night aproxx. 2 miles from my house and she along with  her driving buddy had seen a large rectangular  light in the direction of my house.  This was the same time I had seen this  light.  The lighting was again a very luminous rose colored light that seemed to illuminate the whole backyard,and that s the truth.  Thanks.

The terrain is fairly rugged and hilly, and being around 9:00pm, it was quite dark.  We might not have noticed the object otherwise.  All I can say is we both witnessed a &#34;fireball&#34; shaped object.  The encounter could be described the exact way one might witness a shooting star.  It streaked briefly over a hilltop to our left and dissapeared.  Now I would love to assume it was just that, a shooting star.  The two reasons I cannot are the color and the size of the object.  The color of the streaking object was bright green, like some sort of flare.  I would like to assume it was a flare, but again I cannot.  Flares do not streak low across the sky with such speed.  (I have considered the possibility of a firework, though we heard no sound whatsoever, no pop or similar explosive sound)  Secondly, it was large, low to the ground, and I could almost be sure that the green light was reflecting off of the hill it passed over.  I immediately turned to my wife to ask he if she had seen it, and she confirmed she had.  Neither of us can explain it, and I just happened to come upon your website and remebered the odd experience.  We haven&#39;t spoken of it since.  I just wanted to share, I do not wish to be contacted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw what looked like a flaming mass, about the size of a quarter at arms length, emitting blue and yellow/green flames as it traveled from east to west. It appeared out the drivers side window, (just to the south of my location) and traveled west at a very high rate of speed, (approximately 15 miles in 3 seconds). As it came into view through the front window, it appeared to &#34;go out or off&#34; just for an instant. The colors were very bright making it appear to be only about 2000 feet above my location. I heard no sounds. It had a downward heading of approximately 10 to 15 degrees leading me to think it was going to hit the ground in the Maple valley/Kent areas. It disappeared from my view when it fell behind the hills in the North Bend area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many witnesses to this event.

It fell slowly enough for the two of us in the front seat to say &#34;what the heck is that?&#34;, wake up the passenger in back, have her sit up and watch it drop as well.  It didn&#39;t look like it dropped far from where we were - maybe a mile?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness is alluding to the dramatic fireball seen over Puget Sound on Monday, 15OC01, at approximately 2023 hrs.

When the light caught my attention I thought that it was a shooting star but as soon as I saw it realized that it was much larger than any shooting star I&#39;ve ever seen.  It was round, slightly larger than a quarter (1 1/2 inch diameter) and was blue in the center surrounded by a white halo that extended approx. 3 inches around the circle.

It was more like a bomb falling from the sky. We are not sure how big it really was because we are not sure how far away it really was. From our viewpoint it was about a foot in length and 6&#39; wide. Neither of us has seen anything like this before in our lives. We live right next to a major airport, Boeing Field, and air force bases. We see strange planes and such all the time. We are sure this was not a plane or anything.

At first I thought it was a Plane of some sort but then I noticed it didn&#39;t omit any sound. The object passed by so quickly that I estimate that it was maybe 3500 to 4000 feet high. It may have been a lot higher but I&#39;m not really sure about that. The Object was circular, solid in appearance but without any distinct markings. It almost resembled the color of a cloud.( offwhite) The object I feel was going supersonic speed because it was out of sight in no time at all, headed in a Northeast direction. When I first noticed the object, it was about the size of maybe a nickle or a quarter from my perspective. as it traveled to the Northeast, it rapidly decreased in size rapidly until I lost it over the Horizon. There were no clouds in the shy,just a beautiful evening. This is the first time that I ever noticed anything like this and I tell you that I was really taken back in awe about the event. Could it have been a Satilite, I don&#39;t know since the sighting was in daylight.<n>

I quickly parked the car &amp; ran inside and said to my mom, &#34;get out here now&#34;.  By the time we both were outside, the object was hovering right over the driveway - maybe 20 feet above the telephone pole, which is beside the driveway.  The object was triangular in shape, was larger than a car and was metallic.  It made no noise, and glided through the air unlike any other aircraft I am familiar with.  The object had about 4 or 5 lights on it - multicolored.  After we watched it for about a minute, it continued to glide across the sky until it disappeared in the distance.

This particular afternoon there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky. I noticed forst one, then a second object fly into view from behind the roof of a house. I could not tell exact shapes as these were a fair distance away. What drew my attention to these was the way they kept pace with each other - I would extimate maybe a few hundred yards apart. They were not not moving particularly fast. I watched them for maybe 15-20 seconds, then put my head in through the kitchen door and called for my wife to come and see them. When I looked out again (no more than 5 seconds later) neither object could be seen. I looked all round the sky, but with no joy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally, when a plane flies over, it is visible for anything up to 3 minutes, depending on altitude and direction.

We pulled out of the Holland Tunnel in downtown NYC not far from Canal street, on our way to Brooklyn. It was a beautiful day as the sun was shining and visibility was straight up (10,000ft ceiling maybe), and no cloud cover. We were sitting in traffic for oh, maybe 2 minutes when something just above a building across from us caught my eye. The distance, ground, was maybe 100 yards to the building, and vertically maybe 12 stories high. The sun wasn&#39;t shining in our eyes nor was there any glare to obscure our clear path of vision. This thing behaved like a living creature, it sat in the air just above this building and slowly rose and began to move horizontally over canal street. Immediately i asked my girlfriend to look and comment on what she thought it was (still sitting in traffic we had ample time to peep it). Her initial comment was that it was a string of black balloons floating carelessly in the air and rising upward, made sense to me judging it&#39;s appearance BUT balloons wouldn&#39;t behave like this thing did! This idea of it being balloons was dashed against the rocks due to it&#39;s size and nature....was maybe 45 feet in length and altered its shape Allow me to explain in bulleted points: 1. The object was hovering in place and changed direction a few times smoothly, against the breeze which was blowing. Did not react to wind direction or speed, as the wind would gust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. Object was close enough to the street (like 100 feet) that it would be affected by same wind we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. Was jet black and appeared to be almost like a giant oarfish moving in the air in a twisting fashion. This thing had what seemed specific motions which were repeated over and over such as a sidewinder snake moves...deliberate and repetitive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. Would stop, hover, twist, move, stop, hover, twist, move, etc. all the while changing shape from long and snakelike to rectangular and spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. After floating and shape shifting above and around building (it wasnt tethered as the wind would whip it a certain way)it moved &#34;fast&#34; (maybe within 2 secinds time) the length of 3 blocks NE then stopped to begin its dance again. Then moved an opposite direction just as quickly and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved on it began to head due NE towards the east side and east river then ultimately dissappeared behind a large building maybe 6 blocks from my car, at this time it reached an altitude of maybe 350 feet then just vanished. By now i had cars honking behind me followed by a barrage of profanity, so i had to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangest thing i&#39;ve ever seen...it truely looked like a snake or oarfish/eel floating in air anyone else see this thing?!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

During this event, the object changed color at least 3-4 times, between reddish black, to a very dark red. It sounded like a whistle at first, but became silent and came on again. (Kinda like morse code) I saw at least a dozen lights on it that where various colors. I was talking on my cell at the time to my wife, telling her about this, and it was coming in kinda fuzzy, then I heard a noise coming from my cell phone, (Maybe a transmission) and then it went dead a couple of seconds later. The noises I heard from the phone could have been a launguage, but I could not understand a word of it. After my phone went dead It left a few seconds later.<n>

This was a very bright, clear, deep blue, cloudless day in October a month after the WTC disaster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all standing on a street corner right next to the downtown Atlanta post office and I looked up into the beautiful sky to take in all its glory and as I panned across the top of the Westin Peachtree Plaza hotel something caught my eye.  I saw what appeared to be a &#34;fleet&#34; of UFO&#39;s noiselessly drifting across the sky in a Northwest to Southeasterly direction.  It was an incredible sight to see at least forty or more objects floating at the same speed, silvery white in appearance contrasted against this crisp, beautiful deep blue fall day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the most amazing views of what appeared to be inexplicable objects that I never would imagine I would see, ever.  There is one detail I have left out till now.   I would estimate that from these forty plus objects at least one third of them  there was a similar, silvery white “tether” or “cord” that connected between two of the spheres.  This was a very unusual sight.  From the distance I stood from these craft, estimated at approximately 5,000 feet, the “tether” appeared at arm’s length to be the size in diameter of thread used in sewing.  The objects themselves appeared to be the size of a very heavy “period” one would produce with a pencil on paper, held at arm’s length.  When I called attention of this remarkable sight to a local street vendor I was surprised at his reaction.  There was relatively none.  He could care less.  I thought this to be very odd behavior.  He looked up and as quickly as he looked up he went back to his business of selling handbags and sunglasses without uttering a single word.   Our friends from Denmark saw this and remarked that it looked like someone holding “parachute exercises”.  The parachutes of forty plus sky divers over Atlanta at 5,000 feet up, without a single hint of descendi! ng?   Highly unlikely!   This was a curiosity that has stayed wi! th me to -date and I just wanted to report it here and now.  I listen to you on the Jeff Rense show every single time you are on.  I didn’t want to be one of those 99% you talk about that does not report their sightings.  I always wanted to see the typical saucer shape craft with a dome on top.   Little did I think I would see an entire “fleet” of UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll keep my eyes peeled over-head in hopes that I will someday catch a glimpse of my ideal saucer.  Until then, thank you for letting me share my experience of some 8 years ago.<n>

The chair was facing a large picture window exposing the northern sky; towards the Santa Cruz mountains. My eyes happen to catch a small reflection of light bouncing off an object very high in the sky. I staired at the object for about 5 minutes. After realizing it was not a plane I got a pair of binoculars. Once focusing in on the object I quickly realized I was looking at a silver, metalic saucer spinning in place high in the sky. The disc also had a pair of lights spinning around the outer edge of the disc at a very rapid rate. After watching it non-stop for about 10 minutes I got the impression that it was at least 30 to 50 thousand feet in the air and the saucer must have been as big as a football field. The most shocking thing about it was that it was in the middle of the day without a cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was facing east. The moon was at half-moon stage and at about 45 degrees from the horizon. There were no noticeable clouds in the sky. At exactly 22.00 hrs [local time] I suddenly saw 3 lights travel from south to north in the sky. They were bluish in colour and seemed luminiscient. The light was not flashing but rather glowing. The lights were in a triangular formation with a large one at the front and two smaller ones at the back. They did not move individually but seemed to be in perfect formation. They passed just below the level of the moon. There was no sound at all. They seemed to just glide at a very high speed. The sightinglasted about 12 seconds and I just managed to show it to my wife too. I did not discuss this with anyone except a friend who  believes likewise. This incident was then reported in a local newspaper. It also stated that there were reports from people from a town about 270 km away of having same sighting at exactly same time. The airport of my town has the airstrip aligned in east-westerly direction. So most aircrafts coming in to land come in low from a south-westerly approach. Also the restaurant is about six kilometers away from the airport so the incoming aircraft is low enough to see the sign on its tail. I have never seen a aircraft go from south to north before. Also there are no flights at the specific time. And since I am a fairly regular customer of that restaurant and prefer the same seat I am aware of flights passing in and and out over my head.

10/15/01 03:00|Chugwater|WY|Light|30 seconds|F.E. Warren AFB Wyoming sightings|9/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31278.html|158|ndxe200110| Brightly lit, digital-moving flying fish-shaped object with a crest of white-yellow fire emitting from its tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were coming back from a coffee shop (late night midterm study session) and decided to walk along Lake Michigan to get back to our dorms, which were also on the lake.  We were commenting on the low cloud cover and how strange it seemed, and were joking about it being Friday the 13th (though technically the 14th as it was after midnight).  We heard a weird whirring digital sound, followed by the sight of an aircraft free-falling directly towards the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend immediately perceived it to be a crashing airplane and instinctually climbing the rocks to dive down into the water (certified lifeguards do these sorts of things without thinking--I, on the other hand, just stood there like a dum-dum).<n> <n><n> <n><n> JUST AS IT WAS LITERALLY A FOOT AWAY FROM SPLASHING DOWN into the water, it recovered itself and swooped RIGHT over us....it was NOT a plane.  It was most certainly a UFO.  Its swooping motion was SO smooth, that it looked as though it were not at all recovering from a near-crash, but rather, it was as graceful and digital as possible.  The sound could be be described as a digital piano chord, very pleasing, soothing and attractive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its shape can best be likened to a fish (picture a generic fish, like a goldfish) with its upper fin and back fin comprised of a yellowish-white glowing fire, which seemed to be propelling it much in the same manner that a fish&#39;s fins would.  The body of the craft was totally visible to me, mostly because the craft was SO SO SO well lit, that it&#39;s lights drowned out the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did, however, get a really good look at the underbelly of the craft, which was an amorphous huge contact-lense shape, and violet in color.  It was quasi-transparent, and if I had logic under my belt at that point, i would have made an effort to peer into the bottom, when it flew RIGHT over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead, I just started crying, both because I knew that what I was seeing was something to totally behold, and because I was instinctually scared, though it didn&#39;t have an ominous vibe at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After recovering from its seeming near-crash by swooping over us, it proceeded to head South--towards downtown, precisely following the scape of the lakefront.  For instance, if there was a part of the beach which jutted out, its flight-path would follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my awesome college campus, we could see the Eastern-edge of the downtown skyline, and we sight-followed it almost all the way there, and then lost track.  My friend ran to his dorm to grab the phone, and we began calling 911, 411, 0--&#34;all circuits busy.&#34;  When we finally got through, the lady scoffed at us and hung up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to stand out where we originally saw it crash through the clouds, thinking that was it, and then, at the same time, we both saw it--AGAIN!!  It was coming back down North, again following the beachscape.  I thought it was coming towards us, so we began running away, as silly as that may sound.   While I was running, I was still looking back at it, and saw it come to the point where it had crashed through and then move VERTICALLY, very quickly and disappear above the very low cloudline almost exactly where it came through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to the fishlike shape with the fire-crest propulsion system (at least that is how I perceived it), here is more detail: The front of the craft had an upside-down &#34;U&#34; shaped lime-green, sequentially flashing (like chaser Christmas lights) nose, and the body had a number of sporadically placed lights that were hot pink, red, deeper purple...it was like a flying night-club, and obviously not meant to be inconspicuous, which really threw me off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sounds like a description of someone on acid, I know, but I need to ITERATE that my friend and I had just come back from a coffee shop, where we were studying.  No alcohol or otherwise was at all involved.<n>
10/14/01 22:00|Savanna|IL|Light|5 minutes|We were outside. saw a light. joined by another light|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19860.html|159|ndxe200110| Moving lights in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a member of a bigfoot research group.  We were researching/camping in Gray, TX.  It had been raining on and off all evening.  It was cold and miserable.  At approx. 0100 the rain stopped and the clouds cleared off.  At approx. 0130 one of our members who was facing the opposite direction from me muttered something like, &#34;Look at that star up there, it&#39;s moving.&#34;  Like a chorus from a choir, the profanity from that end of the camp sang out like Bocelli.  I jumped out of my chair to tell them to be quiet but to also see what the hell they were looking at.  I looked up and sure enough, there was a &#34;star&#34; that was moving around in the sky.  It moved up, moved down, moved side to side, got bright, dimmed completely and went back to bright again.  It also pulsated.  (This light was in the east) Shortly thereafter, another light of the same nature was spotted just several degrees to the right of the original moving light.  Shortly after that another light of the same nature was spotted several degrees to the right of the last.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights didn&#39;t seem to move great distances from their &#34;original position.&#34;  I think the first light may have been an exception to this.  At first it moved around in a small area but later moved around covering greater distances than the other two but then went back to just moving around in a small area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights seemed to be using the backdrop of the stars as camouflage in that they A) typically only moved around in &#34;small&#34; areas and  B) moved with the stars as if to follow the earth&#39;s rotation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This got redundant after awhile.  I believe I saw a 4th moving light later in the morning but didn&#39;t say anything to anyone.  This went on for the rest of the night/morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was seen by all in the camp except for one person who is near sighted and doesn&#39;t wear glasses (go figure).  I&#39;m very near sighted and have astigmatism but do wear glasses.  What&#39;s my point?  The first two lights were somewhat close to eachother.  Others seemed to be able to see more pulsating than me.  With my glasses off, these two very bright objects in the sky became very bright &#34;globs&#34; of light.  For once with my glasses off I could see something better than with them on.  The two lights were definately strobing/pulsating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent a lot of time out in the woods at night but have never seen anything like this before.  For the first hour, we all stood around with our jaws hanging to our knees. After that we just got used to it and watched the ongoing show without saying much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure I left out some detail and would like to be contacted before this gets posted on your site.  I can best be reached in the evenings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded sincere and eloquent in his description of the event.  He will encourage the other witnesses (7x) to submit their reports, as well.  PD))<n>

The object appeared like a star but was zig-zagging in the night sky. When I looked through my binoculers, I noticed that it appeared much like a jellyfish with two limbs and a light source inside. I contacted a friend who lives about 10 miles further west from me and he confirmed the object in the same westerly direction. The object also would dissapear behind clouds making the object higher in the sky then it really appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family witnessed the object along side of me and discribed the object as &#34;a  jellyfish-like object with two legs and a light inside&#34;. I thought it looked more like a frog with two legs and with a light inside. We all agreed that it looked and moved much like a kite would and not a weather balloon. Weather balloons are usually oval or tear-drop shaped. Additionally, how could a kite fly well above the clouds? If anyone else witnessed the same thing feel free to contact me so we can exchange experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!! ((name deleted))<n>

I did not see anything with my own eyes.  I downloaded the pictures a week or so later.  And there is something in the sky.  All I can tell you it was a clean night and I heard no sound, but there is something weird in the pictures.  I would love to email them to you just so you could look at them and let me know what you think.  It is so big that I should have seen something with my own eyes, but saw and heard nothing.  You can call me or email me and I will email you the pictures.  Just want to know what you tink it could be.  I took more pictures after I saw that thing in the sky and have other pictures of weird things in the sky.<n>

My wife, myself and two friends where driving back from a haunted hay ride in poughkeepsie,NY. We where driving south on the NY state thruway back to NJ. It was a nice night and very clear. I opened the sun roof and was looking at the stars. As I was looking at the stars and saying how nice they where tonight, the others started looking at them too. Then I think it was my wife sitting in the backseat with her friend sayed look at that really bright star, she asked me if it was the north. I said no because we where looking east and low on the horizon. As I really looked at it, it appeared to move . I asked my friend to pull over. We stoped and really took a good look at this thing. Thier is no dout in my mind what we where looking at was no a star! It was moving in odd formations. So we thought it was a pland moving across the sky. But after a minute or two it was still in the same spot,but moving up then to the left , right ,down, it would even dim then become very bright again. Then move in ciculare motions, then dim out completely . Then BAM brighten up again.The shape of this THING was a triangel and very bright, I don&#39;t know what it was but.. It was something and I hope I have the oppertunity to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the sighting occurred &#34;Saturday n<n>

I remember my parents weren&#39;t home that night. we would just hang out point lasers a cars.  But this night something caught out eyes in the sky. our apartment had 5 floors plus the roof. so we had a pretty good view of the shape of the object. I&#39;d say it was t least a mile or two from eye distance.  It was disc shaped. we noticed it stayed in place for about 5-10 minutes then it started rotating in its spot very slowly. With all 3 different colors flashing around it. bright green, blue and red..  Oh and no sound! whatsoever it was as silent as can be! no way it could have been an airplane or helicopter. we were in awe and were saying &#34;wow this is a ufo!&#34;  I remember my friend saying he thought he was going to cry! we used to live very close to Miami international airport.  and this craft was hovering above some big trees in the area . It was kind of like a mini forest, which those trees have been cut down ever since. Well after the 10-15 minutes of it rotating on its spot it finally moved to the right and went in back of one of the tress and we never saw it again. I truly believe it was UFO not from this planet!   Also I&#39;m sure other people driving around that area probably got a better glimpse of this object than we did.<n>

As I stopped briefly to turn on the porch lights my friend walked out to the driveway. As I walked out the front door he was standing next to his car staring up into the night sky with his mouth wide open. As I glanced up, I saw what I could only describe as a stealthy black disk almost directly above us. By stealth, I mean that it was silent and as it passed between us and the light cast by the moon over a thin layer of clouds (like fog) it&#39;s sillouette became visible. It was perfectly round and blacked-out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk appeared to hover for approximately 5-10 seconds then shifted from left to right in a zig-zag pattern. Suddenly it began moving to the south at a slow rate of speed. Then in a flash, it sped off at an unbelievable rate of velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I agreed that what we witnessed was exceptional. So much so, that we still talk about it to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I firmly believe that because the atmospheric conditions were just right that evening is the only reason we could see the disk. Without the clouds illuminated by the moon I don&#39;t think we would have noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always catch myself looking up at night now, wondering if on those dark moonless nights how many disks might be up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The lights contiued to flash until the power went out in the whole house. It was time for person 1 to leave so we all went outside to send him on his way. He had a brand new car and for some odd reason, the car&#39;s power would not turn on. The three of us sat out on the driveway looking at the stars when person 2 thought that he saw an oddly shaped craft, in the shape of a teardrop, in the sky. It had slowly flashing lights and the lights changed color every five flashes. There were three of them. They moved at a very slow pace, as if they were looking at something. After about 4 to 5 minutes, the 3 crafts took off at a very rapid pace. All power was restored to the neighborhood and my house and person 1 was able to start his car and go on his way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

The sky was clear and many stars were evident. I first saw what appeared to be a military aircraft flying from south to north - a white light with a red light and a blue light on it, and was flying rather fast. Not an odd occurrence given that there are several military bases in the front range area here in Colorado. However, I knew it was not a military craft when it stopped in mid-air and the red and blue lights disappeared. The single white light, which was now a little brighter (like a very bright star), started to bob up and down and around in the air, almost like a flying insect or a moth. I knew that since I was seeing this against the fixed backdrop of the stars that this one object was indeed moving, and it wasn&#39;t just my eyes. It became stationary, and while I was watching for additional movements I fell asleep. The total time I watched this event was about 15 minutes. I heard the rumble of two other military jets crossing the airspace during this time but did not see them.<n>

It would move only a few degrees, both verticaly and lateraly.  It wasn&#39;t a specific color, but changed colors.  It would bob and move in small circles.  It also seemed to have a two prominent spikes; one going off to the left, and one off the top.  The object looked as though it were no closer than a satellite.  (However, my brother and I speculated that this could not be a satellite because it didn&#39;t move enough, it changed colors, and it was in roughly the same spot over a period of about two hours.  Both of us are sure it wasn&#39;t a star--it was too big and moved; however, if forced to guess what this object was, I would have to say a large star whose light was bent by oscillations in the earths atmosphire..is that possible?  I did take several pictures with a manual camera--they are being developed.  I wonder if there is an agency (NASA maybe?) who can scan the pictures, identify the stars, and then tell me what the object is?  Can anyone help me?  Anyone else see this?

I was looking to the west up at the stars.  An object moving from the southwest to the northeast cought my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night.  As the craft got closer I could see for light one in front, one in the center, two in the back the light were a dim orangie yellow.

10/11/01 23:49|Lima|OH|Teardrop|5 Minutes|We saw three teardroped shaped crafts with slowy flashing lights moving very slow then taking off very rapidly.|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19822.html|185|ndxe200110| Objects were sighted driving north on Highway 5 in California&#39;s central valley after night fall, not far past &#34;Kettleman/Fresno&#34; exit sign. The area is farmland for the most part, therefore very dark beside the highway with city lights visable in the distance to the east. Two large blinking lights appeared in the blackness between the road and the city lights. The lights were blindingly brilliant with a bluish cast. We first thought they might be crop-dusting planes, as crop-dusters were still prominent in the news following the Sept. 11 attack. We then decided that they must be something else, given their brilliance and the speed at which the first light suddenly moved toward the south. The second light moved northward, turned toward us but hovered near the roadside as we passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly, a 3rd light appeared ahead and to the left the highway (same color and brilliance). It then seemed to &#34;jump&#34; to the right side, instantly. The third light rose to a higher altitude, separated into FOUR distinctly separate lights of equal brilliance and proceeded to move toward the south. Unlike the first light which also moved at what we took for &#34;impossible&#34; velocity, the third seemed to pulsate twice: i.e., it &#34;disappeared&#34; only to re-appear INSTANTANEOUSLY further south against the stars, in both cases radically changing shape. It swelled to enormous size prior to vanishing, then re-appeared in smaller mode. After doing so twice, it sped upward and southward at such tremendous speed I could not track its motion with my eye. (I was in the passenger seat, so was free to safely turn my head as it sped away). A combination of features convinced us we had seen no crop-duster, military plane or other easily explained phenomenon: that the light divided into four distinctly separate luminaries, melded into one again and &#34;jumped&#34; as it moved... then, that it altered size and shape still pulsating through the sky and finally, that it left with unnatural and amazing speed. All told, we observed the third and strangest light for an estimated period of thirty seconds (we did not calculate the length of time).<n>
10/11/01 20:35|Grass Valley|CA|Triangle|1 minute|Three bright white lights in a row, in the sky.|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19827.html|186|ndxe200110| We saw a square object at night,  which had 2 blue &amp; 2 red lights at corners, hovering in sky above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 9:15 p.m. and we were heading east just north of the city, when we saw in the sky what appeared to be something hovering.  It was square shaped with two blue lights on the two corners to the left as you look at it and two red lights on the two corners on the right. There was a white or yellow light in the center, but it didn&#39;t attract your attention as much as the blue and red lights did and the fact that it was square.  The sky was pitch black so you only saw the lights on the formation of the square.  By the time I slowed the car down to a stop the object was in the sky above the tree line, but far enough away you couldn&#39;t see details, just the shape and the lights.  It didn&#39;t appear to be moving and we couldn&#39;t take our eyes off of it.  When my passenger rolled the window down to see even better, it took off heading west, but only for a split second and then was completely gone from the sky.  It wasn&#39;t a helicopter; there wasn&#39;t any noise and it was square, and of course we know what a helicopter looks like.  It wasn&#39;t a plane obviously, because in wasn&#39;t moving, simply above us in the sky and again it was square and planes don&#39;t hover in one spot above the trees.  I&#39;m thankful there were two of us that saw this object.  There was another car on the same road as us and they slowed down also.  We would love to know what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness seemed exceptionally credible to us.

But I was wrong.  I quickly turned her attention to a rapidly descending white object apparently coming down out of the sky.  Since falling stars tend to disappear rapidly, I was very surprised that as the object fell, it did not disappear.  In fact, it slowed down! then appeared to stall, not moving at all.  I could not tell you how large it was, or how close it was, but I DID think it was a shooting star (at first), if that gives you some idea of apparent size and brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the object appeared to not move, i referenced other planes&#39; movements to compare.

As I approached the Rockfield Elementary School area I noticed a glowing yellow-white oval shape ahead of me. I judged it to be close to the Natcher Parkway overpass (approx.6 miles ahead) and about the size of my thumb with my arm stretched out in front of me. The oval shape was bright, but hazy and was slowly moving south toward Hwy 31-W. I watched it continuously as I drove toward town amazed at the size it must be and noting that I couldn&#39;t see any discernible object or craft in the oval light. The attack of 9-11 was still fresh and I was surprised to be seeing anything in the air. If it were a military helicopter searching for something, I thought I should be seeing a beam of light streaming to the ground or moving around, but there was none. As I neared Memphis Junction Rd. just a little before the Natcher overpass, I judged the object to be over Hwy 31-W (which at this point runs almost parallel to 68-80, aprox. 3 miles apart). Suddenly, the oval light changed into 5 separate white lights! They were in the formation of a triangle. It was very odd in that it wasn&#39;t a flat triangle. There were three lights forming the bottom base, a light at the top point, and the fifth was on the right side of the triangle closer to the base. It moved upright. (If you form a triangle with your thumbs and index fingers a few inches in front of your face and then extend your arms out still holding the triangle, that is how the lights moved.) I was watching this triangle of lights travel slowly beyond 31-W when they just disappeared!  I didn&#39;t report it thinking the original oval light was so big that others probably had already called. I checked the local news sources for the next few days hoping for some mention with an explanation, but never heard anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

She was concerned about terrorist activity, and wanted me to see it. I rushed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was it instantly. It appeared to be the size and intensity of a very bright star but perhaps brighter than the brightest star. It had blueinsh cast.  Over the ten minute period that I observed it, it moved very rapidly, yet erratically, over a broad area of the ski. Its movement seemed to be quite erratic, reminding me more of the movement of a bat (but not the appearance of one)in flight. It might move in a straight line for no more than a second, then switch directions for another second, and then continue this erratic movement. It was dark and just beginning to rain and I could not see if there were clouds. It did not appear to disappear behind clouds. It did not flicker, and remained totally visible unless I would lose sight of it behind a tree. When this happened, within a second or so, it would reappear from behind the object. In spite of the erratic and random nature of its movement, it did seem to be confined to a reasonably small area of the ski. I would estimate the horizontal boudaries of its excursion to be perhaps 30 or 40 degrees, and the vertical, perhaps a little less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so of watching it, I ran into the house to grab a video camera and ran out to try to catch it on video. I was never able to get it into the view finder, a failure that I found rather disturbing, sine I am very adept at video movies. For what it is worth, not once did I get a glimps of it in the view finder. I speculated that the intensity was not sufficient or that it was moving too fast for me to catch it, though the latter does not seem to be a reasonable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, it disappeared by moving behind a tree, down toward the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be an exceptionally good witness.

While sitting there talking I had noticed 3 very bright lights,shaped as a triangle, hoovering over the neighbors house. The lights were entirely too bright and close to be stars. I immediately asked my friends what it was. We knew that the lights were too low to be any air plane, especially everything that had happened in the past month. As we watched the lights, they began to slowly fade away leaving no trace of existence. We had decided to call my two friends mom and she told us to come over there. We haven&#39;t seen anything since then, but it&#39;s only been a couple of hours. But from the stories we heard tonight, this isn&#39;t the first sighting that people have seen around this area and it more than likely won&#39;t be the last.<n>

We drive to a more remote location to scrutinize it better. To our astonishment, this &#34;red star&#34; starts moving slowly, from all sides. A few minutes later, it starts doing fast turns and circles in the sky. It eventually fades to the point where it was easy to lose sight of. Then, in another area of the sky, the light reappears and shifts from left to right slowly before disappearing. Seconds later, the light, possibly the same craft- but with a different appearance and white color, reappears in a closer mountain range. It is moving towards us now and the light becomes brighter from whatever this thing is! Out of extreme fear, we get in the car and drive as fast as we can down the mountain, risking a serious car accident. As I look back at this object, while driving erratically, I could see that this object was close enough for me to see three white lights. We must&#39;ve escaped quick enough because by the time we got on the main road, that&#39;s leads down the mountain, the object was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened about an hour ago and I&#39;m still in shock.<n>

We both then continued to watch the craft, it was flying low, about where small airplanes go at their highest. It had no wings, was reflecting sunlight, and seemed to have a verticle fin or rudder on the back. it flew very steady SE until it became a speck and then went out of site. It had no jetstream of any kind. We do not know if it made a noise, but we noticed that no one walking into the entrance of the store looked up or noticed it in any way. We have looked up every sort of american aircraft and even unmanned spy planes, and none of them looked like it. The closest thing to what it looked like is a missle, like the tomahawk missles. My husband is in research and development field, and i am a professional. we are wondering if the government was testing some new sort of craft, as it was the day of the first air strikes against Afghanistan.<n>

No sooner than I stopped the car to observe it, I heard the dj on the radio announcing that several people were calling in reporting the same object.  That staion is in Owensboro, Ky.  Some people were calling from Evansville, IN as well.  It was presumed a meteor, but I&#39;ve never seen a meteor alter coarse like that.  Nor move with such speed.

The object went up above the mountain and hovered in place.  I had two co workers look to see if they could see it.  We decided it was a balloon.  The only problem was it was not moving.  Then it veered off the the right and then went back to it&#39;s original position.  I continued to watch.  The object disappeared then reappeared in the same spot.  Eventually it decended on the back side of the mountain and we couldn&#39;t see it any more.  This is the second time we have seen a similar type object.  A few months ago a white object came down a canyon then cased the mountain in a v pattern.  It went up the next canyon then back down.  It stared floating in a straight line and disappeared on the front side of the mountain.  Again, both of the occurances were in the afternoon.<n>

I noticed a small red, contrail from an airliner. I at first glance traveling 60mph, om I-40, thought how beautiful the contrail was. Then I noticed it was &#34;staionary&#34; and not moveing, after 15 minutes. I then, thought perhaps, it was a comet. Since I have not followed, any reports on comets like Hale/Bopp. This contrail, was, then &#34; degradeing&#34; yet, a new contrail was being formed. I could see clearly, a &#34;jet&#34; large airliner being, in slow motion, or stopped in the sky. Below that a small round, grayish &#34;U.F.O.&#34; wa dancing, and going back and fourth, under the airliner. The airliner was stationary, burning fuel, and creating a contrail, as this UFO hovered about 7 thousand feet &#34;under&#34; the large liner. I noticed many people watching this in the Bartow, Daggaet(Solar Power area)and this, was 50 miles from Edwards airforce base. I clearly saw a round UFO,and this jet, with small contrail, and it was redish, with the sun, setting, and was below the hortizon, or mountains. It was &#34;beautiful&#34; and &#34;spectacular&#34;, and was the most bizzar, thing I ever see. I felt it was showing off for all the cars traveling along I-40, that evening. I called the Highway Patrol in Barstow, they said they got hundreds of phone calls on this. They said it was a helicopter. I say it was a UFO, round, gray, and makeing a motion, for attention. Then after I was under it, the UFO , went away, and the &#34;airliner&#34; was free, to travel, to its destination.<n>

I peered up into the sky and noticed 3 stars next to each other, then i looked again and realized there were about 7-9 of these stars? encircling the power plant.I stopped the car to get a better look, and in the center of this was a plane at highspeed which seemed tobe escorting or being escorted by 2 other craft (not sure if they were planes or not). Around these encircled stars? there were small aircraft encircling them flying at what appeared to be leisurely pace. About 5. Everything was at a very high altitude. I tried my best to observe as I drove on, but then they were out of sight. Less than 30 minutes went by before I was returning on that same route , the airplanes were still flying steady around the power plant and the stars? had disappeared. I drove on another 2-3 miles and was just peaking at the roads ridge, as if out of  a space movie there were 7-9 stars? in a jagged V formation stretced out in                                                                                  mate to be about 5 mles. Now I was just a little creepd out at that point, and in the blink of an eye they vanished. I did a few inqires  and naturally no one saw a thing. This was my second sighting in 3 days, in my life, I was not scared in anyway and infact almost found it comforting, as I am located 60 miles south of Manhatten and about 80 miles east of Three Mile Island. I am hoping since this was right after the attack on America that our government or Allies were out there watching these vulnerable sights. I do know of 2 people who have witnessed some activity  very near the same area. Also days later I was telling this encounter to an associate and they asked if there was any interferrance with my radio during this sighting, yes there were actual total segments of song interrupted by what seemed like aCB but I did not make out any language. This person lives i! n this v icinity and was experiencing radio interferrance in that time table. The other people will be writing in to verify their sightings.<n>

Our flight left at around 9:30 am London time. The plane was in a steady climb. Our altitude was only around 10-15 thousand feet. We had just passed above the puffy sparse clouds that were in the area. I had two windows available next to my seat. I was looking out the forward window, looking as close to straight down as I could, I saw some sort of movement between the ground and the puffy clouds right below us. As I looked closer I could see that the ground was being distorted as this object passed above it. It caused a wavy appearance to the ground. Looking closer I could see a definite line where the distortion ended, it looked like a huge contact lens, or a clear plastic disk. I watched this thing pass under three or four clouds and always continue on the other side. I could only track it so far because of the small windows on a 777. I then leaned back and could still see it in the window that was in line with my shoulder. It was traveling in the opposite direction as the airplane, and going maybe three times faster than the clouds passing below us. I watched it until I could see it no more due to the small windows. Right after it was gone I noticed directly below us a nuclear power plant. This object was traveling away from the power plant. I believe this was not a reflection as it was observed from two different windows.  It took me a few seconds to realize that what I had seen was really there. It was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently having my son who lives in London for a short time longer, find out where the nuclear power plant is located so as to figure out our position and what direction we were flying.<n>

I stopped the car and got out, and noticed that it was getting close and still wasn&#39;t making any noise of any kind. I got back in the car and started the engine. There were some trees in the way so I couldn&#39;t see the &#34;craft&#34; now, so I turned around and headed east. I looked to my right and the triange had changed direction almost like it knew i was trying to follow it and was scared away and was now headed east as well, and as it started to really pick up some speed I now could no longer follow it. But I could still see it, and the white lights started to turn red and blue, they didn&#39;t change like a light going on, more like a transition. Then as it was starting to get far away i could tell that the speed was changing; slow then fast then slow then fast, sort of like a pulse then i couldn&#39;t see it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The case is under investigation by the Missouri Investigator Group, c/o Barbara Becker, (&lt;uforn@junocom&gt;), Columbia, MO.

I thought it was a firework and expected to see little pieces break off, and it would disappear. I believe the planet Mars is in the northern sky, and has been recently...(if not, there is a very reddish star there that crosses the sky). This object was about 4 times the size of it. Maybe a 4th- 5th the size of tonights moon. Anyhow, the object faded away quickly, travelling northwestward. It appeared to be very high in the sky when I lost sight of it. It seemed, maybe within 10000 feet when I first saw it. The object made no noise. I am a veteran skywatcher and I have seen satellites travel through the night sky, reflecting the sun.They usually, I believe, have a yellowish hue, and are never close to being this vivid. It did travel in a straight line away from me as a satellite would.( I&#39;m not sure about the distance 10000&#39;, it&#39;s a guess, I live on approach to Logan Airport..based on aircraft sightings) Thanks<n>

I left the porch light off to observe the night sky.  After a few moments I observed an object travelling at a high speed, by far faster than any aircraft I have ever seen (Military or Civilian) towards the SE.  This object had no running lights, left no contrail and was completely silent.  It looked for all the world like the detached wings of a glider aircraft.  It was silhouetted clearly in the night sky because the sky was clear and there was an almost full moon in the Eastern sky, low in the horizon.  I observed this for approx. 2 seconds as it passed through at about 20-25 degrees overhead, disapearing behind a line of trees.  I have observed many unusual sights in the night sky but this is the first that has left me completely stumped.  The object size exceeded, by far, the diameter of the moon by about 1 and 1/2 times.  There was one other aircraft visible in the night sky, identifiable by it&#39;s running lights, travelling in a similar direction but apparantly oblivious to the object.  I came inside and phoned in the report and will be mailing a drawing to the reporting center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found him to be an unusually good witness.

This is the &#34;four-corners&#34; area in Maple Valley. My friend was driving in front of me. What I saw may be similar to that of a shooting star but struck me as being unusual as compared to such. It seemed fairly lower to the ground against the horizon than a shooting star would be and also seemed closer against the night sky background. My point being that it did not seem to be an object entering the atmosphere. From my viewpoint it came downward diagnally straight to the right. The Object resembled that of a medium sized star and the color shared a likeness of a star as well. The objects brightness remained constant so it did not get brighter or fade out. The object disappeared then reappeared briefly before disappearing again for the final time. I would compare it to a light turning off then on again. This off and on effect occured towerd the bottom of the objects decent or line of travel. It had no tail or streak whatsoever. The velocity was not as fast as that of a shooting star. It had a certain amount of velocity but it just seemed slower. My friend had seen it as well as he was driving in front of me. The sighting struck him as being out of the ordinary as well. We would have just said &#34;hey, did you see that shooting star?&#34; or something like that if it had appeared ordinary.<n>

Its diameter was about the size of a pea held at arm&#39;s length.  It was much larger and brighter than what is seen during a meteor shower (i.e.,  falling stars).

It descended below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might hit maybe 10 miles east of where I was, which would be northeast of the area around Hartland, MI, near the intersection of M-59 and US-23.

This object made no sound what so ever. Next it moved exceptionally slow(almost a glide) about 150 feet away and stopped. We gave it the logical reasoning that there is a private airport a quarter mile away and it was right after september 11 and the crop dusting warnings and we thought it was govermental craft we were unaware of monituring the area as we are only 60 miles from  NY city.

Then, as they traveled a lil further, he saw it again, pointing and tellign her to pull over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She did.  She describes the object as this:   Blimp-Like object....smooth...no ribbling or lines like a blimp.  RED..Bright Red...glowing red...(it was an overcast cloudy day, no sun), she said it had black square things on the bottom...several.   There were two doors that were open, like barn doors....that had a V-shaped item come out, and that had 6 circles on each side of the V.....Said it didn&#39;t move. No noise...nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They watched it for like 5 min.  Said it intrigued her, yet sorta scared her.   She said she went to drive a lil further down the road, and took her eyes off it, and so didn&#39;t my nephew, and when they looked back...it was gone.  That fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being how a blimp cannot travel that fast....she was really skeptical about mentioning it.   However, since my nephew as well, saw it, she said, it was hard not to tell someone. So, she told my mother and I, and I told her to report it.  She hesitated, and then finally decided she wouldn&#39;t, but said I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soo, I am reporting it.  Personally, i have a feeling its Military related....with all thats going on.  She is totally shocked.   She did however draw a picture of it....and as well as my nephew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n>
10/3/01 11:00|Bonifay|FL|Rectangle|5 seconds|Silent, at tremendously high speed object seen flying north to south toward Panama City, FL|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20954.html|239|ndxe200110| Bright flash witnessed near Albany, New York<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving West on Interstate 90 W, between 7 and 10 miles outside of Albany, I witnessed an extremely bright, blueish white flash across the sky.  The flash was reminiscent of a comet image.  It moved in a direction from south to north (left to right) at an incredibly rapid rate.  The sky was cloudless, and the weather warm.  I was driving about 70 mph in the middle lane, with a tractor trailer truck driving 5+ car lengths ahead of me.  The flash surprised me, and I hit my brakes as did the truck in front of me.  I began searching the sky for any indication of the object, or flash, but found none.  I simply witnessed this flash of brilliant light.  It appeared to me to be too &#34;thick&#34; to be lightening.  It also moved more horizontally than anything else, but again was headed north and angled slightly towards the sky.  After the flash, I saw nothing else. Having seen both man made, weather and astonomical natural phenomena before, I can safely say that this did not appear to be like anything I have ever seen.  If I were to wager a guess, I would say that the streak was perhaps 100-500 feet off the ground, and perhaps 1 - 10 miles away.  It moved at a rate that no man-made object that I am aware of could possibly reach.  I am assuming that the reaction of the truck in front of me, hitting the brakes when I did, and slowing down, was due to the same occurance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness may be describing the bright streak of light that occurred over the east coast on October 02, 2001.  We will invite him to try to establish the precise date of the event, using fuel receipts, credit card entries, etc..  PD))<n>

We still don&#39;t know what caused us to look up into the sky because the craft was silent and almost completely transparent and it was dark and cloudy. The craft was in a pulled triangular shape in which we were only able to see the edges. It was moving exceptionally slow and was hovering low. It pass through the sky with complete silence. After it made its way out of our site, we noticed military jets starting to circle the area. The jets flew through the area numerous times then left to go back to surveillancing NYC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, with a report of this type, we would first attempt to rule out an advertising blimp.  However, we presume that even blimps were grounded after 9/11/01.  PD))<n>

Some where,about 2 or so hours both north of vasilia and after dark, I saw some out of place lights above the highway.At distance and just glacing they almost seemed to line up with the highway lights and may be easily missed.But then the object opened to face us and there were 3 lights slightly different in color.I got very excited and asked my girlfriend to confirm what I was seeing.She saw it.My two friends in the back were in a heated debate and never looked.We got very close,100 yards?  I began to see beyond the lights the shadowy outline of a triangle.The seemingly as if it knew we were watching and getting close it smoothly and silently accelerated across the horizon maintaining its 30ft. elevation.The way it moved was truly stunning.  Began so slowly one wasn&#39;t sure it was moving next thing you knew it was miles away. I believe Edwards AFB was near by. Amazing experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object was huge, silent and low, about 200-300 feet up and at least 70 feet accross. There was a white light at each corner of the object. I could see the shape of the object against the night sky, which was most stunning, it was a triangle. It was moving north east. I was so intently watching the object, that I did not notice that I was driving off the right side of the road. As I violently swerved back onto the exit ramp, I nearly hit a Michigan State Police suburban that was parked on the side of the road. I fully expected to be pulled over, and hoped the trooper had seen the abject also. I pulled alongside the trooper, expecting a strange look, when I noticed his dome light was on, with a brief case open on his lap, frantically searching through the papers in the case. I waited for a couple moments at the stop sign waiting to be pulled over. After I was not arrested, I excitedly got back on the highway in the opposite, in persuit of the triangular craft. I followed for about a half mile north, as the craft moved northeast and I lost sight as I went Due north. The direction the craft was heading was towards a military base in Grayling, Michigan. I am close to a local private pilot, I am quite sure the craft was headed toward restricted airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The light was moving forward (west) and slowly down, with the jet and behind it.  It appeared as though the light (object?) was dropped from the plane, and shortly thereafter the plane gently veered slightly to the north.   My first impression was that it was a star or planet.  My secon impression was that it was a military test of some kind.  2 more lights were observed a few minutes later, more toward the north, but in the same apparent altitude.  We also thought that they might have been smaller, lower flying business type jets.  Because these objects were definately moving, they couldn&#39;t have been stars or planets.  The 2nd or 3rd light spotted, at one point, moved very rapidly straight up.  The airplane contrail was at least several miles long, but none of the 3 lights gave off any sort of contrail of any kind.  We observed them for a total of about 15 minutes and they eventually disappeared because of the darkening sky and their apparent westward movement, in the general direction of the plane.<n>
