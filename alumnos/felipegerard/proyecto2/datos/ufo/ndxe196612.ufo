The year was 1966 or 1967. It was dark outside, evening hours, I looked out the front window and noticed a triangular craft, approx 6-feet in diameter with blue, red, and white flashing lights desending downward, stopped and hovered in the air approx 50 feet. I ran and got my father to witness. When my father arrived we saw the object start to slowly gain altitude, and the fly away east on a sharp angle, gaining speed until it was out of sight. Dad and I to this day can not imagine what this object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The time and year are approximate but probably rather accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember falling asleep wondering what presents I might get. I would have been 6 years old or younger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime very late in the night I was awoken by a sound. It may have been a whistling sound. Before I opened my eyes I wondered if it might be Rudolph the Reindeer. We had watched that show earlier Christmas Eve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I opened my eyes I have the distinct memory that I knew that I would not be able to move or to speak and that to try would be useless. How did I have that impression when just waking up? I have always had the impression that something had happened previous to this that I have never remembered and that this is what caused me to just know this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I opened my eyes I was amazed to see that our bedroom (me and my two brothers, each 1 and 2 years younger than me) was absolutely filled with hundreds or maybe even thousands of deep red, completely distinct, oval lights. They were each moving rapidly around the room in all directions. As I watched one group of lights I noticed that I could follow them along the floor, up on the wall and then over the ceiling. Whether they were projected from inside the room or projected in from the outside I could not tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked across the room and my 5 year old brother was looking at me stunned and seeing the same things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very frightened by all of this and tried to move. When I did I was suprised that I could. So I then tried to scream out for my parents and again was suprised that I could make a sound. I immediately then jumped out of bed and ran towards the door screaming for help. Our parents room was across the hallway at that time and they met us in the hallway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also always had the distinct impression that someone, not my parents, told me thta night that I should always remember what had happened because they would return in the future and that it would be important to me and to everyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could add more details later if necessary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also reported the october 31, 1974 Illinois sighting at this website and the One in Genesee Depot, Wisconsin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It started a fire, not a huge one, but bright greenish blue. Anyhow, my father went over and came back and talked with my mother and then took off into town to I guess get help. While we waited the fire had gone out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father came back with the local constable and they walked around the site. We didn&#39;t go over there as my father had said no. A little later on another guy came up and it was then my father came back over. We all asked questions but he didn&#39;t seem to know anything. I do know he stayed up late talking to my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess he had gone back over there while we were sleeping because the next morning he had a cylinder, kind of like the ones you draw blood with, filled with this green/blue/silver metal looking liquid. He showed us how when you shook it up the liquid vanished. After about 30 secs it reappeared. Pretty neat huh? He said it was all over the ground and hadn&#39;t seeped into the ground at all. Later on that day more people showed up. They seemed like workers from the nearby aluminium plant and they had some heavy equipment. They, or other workers stayed for a couple of days at least. The next day a helicopter showed up and some guys in white shirts and ties got out. I kinda lost interest as I was opening Christmas presents and stuff, plus we couldn&#39;t go over there or see it from the road anyway. So I&#39;m not sure how many people actaully were over there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 4 days everything over there was over. Me and a friend from down the road went over and the entire area, get this: Had been planted over. You could tell because the grass was a different color! There were still tracks and stuff from vehicles but if you didn&#39;t know there was a crash and fire there you would never know it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wondering what happened to the container of liquid? It only seemed to last about two weeks. It still dissapeared when shook but the more you did it the less would reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Twenty years later a student told me she had her first UFO sighting on the SAME DAY, at approximately the same time.  She described a &#34;saucer like&#34; object, about the size of a Buick, giving off a &#34;strange orange glow&#34;. In June,2002, I told the story to a class of middle schoolers.  One of them raised his hand, telling me his aunt had become nauseous and her dog died when a &#34;strange, orange,glow&#34; passed over her car.  This occured &#34;during the holidays&#34;, in the early a.m., in 1966!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

No sound! Ball stopped and suddenly went from basketball size to tennis ball. It wobbled slowly to the east from its southern descent and went over the tree line and was gone. It did pulsate rather weakly when in its tennis ball configuration. Have one other unusual sighting but too lengthy to describe now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/15/66 17:30|Webster City|IA|Sphere|2 minutes|Two silent and slowly moving red spheres suddenly accelerate and vanish.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48068.html|7|ndxe196612| Two silent and slowly moving red spheres suddenly accelerate and vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about twelve years old and collecting for my paper route.  I had been out about a half hour and was walking next to a school yard.  It was a crisp, cold, winter evening.  The sky was clear.  As I walked through a large open area between the school and my next customer&#39;s house, I looked up to marvel at the number of stars I could see.  I then noticed two red lights directly above me.  At first I thought I was looking at an airplane, but quickly realized that wasn&#39;t what it was.  There was absolutely no noise, and the red lights were perfectly round.  The light was solid and didn&#39;t blink.  It wasn&#39;t defuse and didn&#39;t radiate which gave me the impression I was looking at bright colored spheres or discs, possibly illuminated from within, and not actual lights. The two discs moved together across the sky, one after the other, slightly staggared, not side-by-side.  They moved very slowly.  I remember thinking they were about the size of dimes.  I could not tell how high up they were, but they were higher than the tree tops.  I do not remember seeing anything solid between the lights.  I saw them as two separate objects and not lights at either end of something else.  They were fairly close together, about twice their individual diameters apart.  What made this memorable for me is I immediately recognized them as something unusual and strange.  It was like nothing I had ever seen or heard about.  I remember the sensation of heaviness, and a strong feeling of anxiety.  I was unable to move, and I believe this was due to fear.   I stood frozen and watched two perfectly round, slowly moving, silent, red spheres move across the sky for about two minutes when they suddenly accelerated away very quickly to pin points and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
