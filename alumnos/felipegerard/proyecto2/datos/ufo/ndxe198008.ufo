8/30/80 16:00|Rush City|MN|Unknown|30 minutes|Space suit looking things and object in the woods|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24470.html|3|ndxe198008| Space suit looking things and object in the woods<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 15 at the time and I was outside by myself throwing bouncing a basketball while the rest of my family was inside the house.  I had a weird feeling I was being watched.  So I looked around and saw (the only way I can really describe it) is like a silver space suit type thing on the side of the house.  But it was only there for one second.  From where I was standing I could see both sides of the house.  One second later it was on the other corner.  Then back again.  I don&#39;t know if there was several or if that one just moved faster than light.  I wasn&#39;t afraid of them.  I was scared because it was unknown to me.  I started shaking and went into the house and never said a word to anyone in my family.  When I walked in the front door I locked it and deadbolted it.  I walked upstairs and saw my family all watching a T.V. show.  I didn&#39;t say anything, because I thought they would think I was crazy.  I went to the big patio door and locked that to.  Then I went to take a shower.  As I was in the shower, the house started to shake and I heard this loud noise.  I hurried up and got out and threw my clothes on and ran into the living room.  My dad was the only one there.  I said &#34;where is everyone&#34;, and he said outside watching a spaceship or something.  I went running outside and my mother and brothers and sisters were watching this thing that they said had come out of our woods and shot to the sky so fast and was making this loud noise.  All I could see was the dot way up in the sky.  They said it shot out of the woods so fast you couldn&#39;t see what it was.  At that time I told my mom my little story.  I don&#39;t think she would have believed me, but she said she did because when they went to run outside they couldn&#39;t get the door open because I had locked all the locks.  About a week later, my mom and dad were home alone and that same noise came back and the house started to shake and they lost electricity.  Only some beams were shining down from an object in the sky which they couldn&#39;t see onto our patio. ! Our hou se was on a cliff off a creek off the river.  They said it hovered there for awhile with the lights than just went away.  I was a paralegal for 10 years and now run a flooring business and business center with my husband.  Its weird because it seems like after that happened, no one in my family, including myself, after talked about it.  Its almost like you forget until years later.  I have just recently in the last few years, told only a few people.  And of course they just laugh at me.  I do believe there are a lot of hoaxes out there, but I have to believe there is something, because I saw like silver suited, what I think were beings, and they couldn&#39;t have been from this planet, because they moved to fast in second intervals.  So thats my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We (the work crew) was camped out about seven or eight miles in from the road, up in the mountains.  After eating, and after sitting around the fire and talking, I stayed up while the others crawled in their tents and went to bed.  I went out to the edge of the meadow, to where my tent was pitched, to watch the stars for a while before crashing myself...  After a while standing there, I saw a very bright/white saucer-shaped object come flying slowly over the tree line at the East side of the clearing, moving from North to South.  I was facing East, and the Moon was to my rear...  I couldn&#39;t really tell how big it was, because there wasn&#39;t really anything to judge it by...I couldn&#39;t tell how far off it was, only that I saw it over the tree line.  It was bigger than the moon in my field of vision though...  When I first saw it, I started yelling for the other guys on the crew to get out of their sleeping bags and get outside...I didn&#39;t want to be the only one to see it.  They just started yelling back &#34;what...what&#34;...and I just kept yelling &#34;get out here now&#34;...by the time they got out...it had already flown South down below the tree line...so I had them stay out for a while to see if it would take off again...but we didn&#39;t see that happen.  It was totally silent...no engine noise or anything...  The object was white...white like a florescent light...with clear/sharp edges.  Curved on top and curved on the bottom, lines meeting at each end to form sharp points.  The next day, I asked the trail crew chief if I should file a report and he said &#34;no&#34;...so I didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was up late one night and saw three objects above the meadow of the farm acrossed the the road from my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family hunted a lot so there was a spare rifle scope in the gun cabinet.  I took it with me crossed two roads to the back meadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was funny it was like the object could sence me getting closer because at first they where right over the meadow and seem to back off as I walk closer.  With the 3X9 scope I could see they looked like a clam shell shape and with several different color that seem to strobe and they seem to be hovering not flying.  That is what struck me as weird and there was no engine noise. They seem also to be in a slight V formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was only 15 or 16 and heard some strange noise in the tree near me so turn and run back to the house.  When I got back to the house about 400-500 yard.  I turn and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told to many people because I was by myself and most people do not believe in UFO&#39;s.  I thought it might be the ARMY testing something because FORT DRUM is about forty mile from my old home stead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was fishing with three friends at a lake. The sun was going down casting an orange glow in the sky. We were gong to the car when one of the guys said he had left the keys somewhere &#34;back there&#34;. So we split up and started to look.I was walking by myself,the area is flat with trees around but to the north is the lake and you can see a lot of sky. All of a sudden I see a cigar shaped object to the north going east to west, not real fast and I could not say it was white because the sun was making it seem slightly yellow-orange. Then coming up fast behind it is what looks like a military fighter, chasing it and getting closer all the time. You have to know that at my location I could see a lot of sky in that direction. I am yelling for my friends to look up but they can&#39;t hear me. The jet is still not close enough to me to hear the sound so there was none. Then I could not believe what I saw, a box, at least that&#39;s what it looked liked, appeared in the sky directly in front of the cigar, it also was the same color, a square door in the center opened up, it looked like a freight elevator door opening up, and the cigar went into what looked like a very,very black opening, the door closed and the box just vanished. The jet, you could here it now, circled around twice then turned east and left the scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was too far away from the aircraft to even tell what kind it was but it sounded like a single engine. I just stood there for a few minutes staring, then my friends showed up, I asked then if they heard me yelling, nobody did, so I told them what I saw and they said I was nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/16/80 23:30|Pine Springs|TX|Light|2 to 3 minutes|A Falling Star That Changed its Mind because it went back UP!|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37463.html|8|ndxe198008| A Falling Star That Changed its Mind because it went back UP!<n> <n><n> <n><n> A weekend in late August 1980 is one, which three of us in the group will never forget. It was our second and final night camping in the Guadalupe National Park near Pine Springs, Texas with part of our Boy Scout Troop from Midland, Texas. I was an Assistant Scout Master at the time and I worked as a News Reporter/Anchor at a radio station in Midland. There were 4 adults and approximately 15 scouts camping out under the open sky on cots and open pick-up truck beds. Two Scouts, about to become Eagle rank, and myself had settled in the back of a pick-up truck bed staring at the clear Eastern sky full of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best as I recall it was on August 16th close to 23:30 hours. I suddenly saw what appeared to be a &#34;Falling Star&#34; drop down in the Northeast. It came in at a fairly moderate speed and I thought how great it was to see such a bright falling meteorite approximately two to three miles away and guessed its circumference at 100 feet. This size of the ball of light seemed too large for a meteorite.  I was a little alarmed that there was not a trailing light tail and its brightness was not decreasing which would indicate burn out. I was even more alarmed when it dead stopped approximately a thousand feet above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then begin to move South, stopping then moving North a little then moving South as well as changing some in elevation. This jerking motion occurred over 5 times until it dead stopped for a few seconds approximately 4 to 5 miles South of where its point of entry had been. The light remained the same size whiteness and intensity the entire time. There was no sound heard. It began its same jerking motion back toward the North where it dead stopped a few seconds at the point it had stopped after entry. Suddenly it went straight up at a speed that only recently I can barely compare to the Stealth airplane going straight up at an air show. But this ball of light did this from a dead stop! The white ball of light accelerated straight up at seemingly impossible speed and disappeared out of sight in approximately 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this observation I heard myself say,” What the heck,,, is,,, that?&#34; One Boy Scout said, &#34;I dunno?!!&#34; and the other Boy Scout said, I dunno either but lets not tell anyone cause no one will ever believe us!&#34;  The next morning I ask if anyone had seen anything unusual in the sky and not one of the others said they had. When they ask why I ask, I just said, &#34;Oh, just wondering.&#34;  I considered our observation a personal experience and never reported it on the air as news and never told a soul until the past couple of years, this now being 2004. I never saw a UFO before that night and I have not seen any since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

Weather was partly cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being summer, my father was sitting on the porch. He walked in and said, &#34;Hey, do you want to see a UFO?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought, what a silly joke but got up anyway and went out on the porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went on the porch I looked up and saw an enormous disc hovering in the sky above the trees to the east. It looked to be in the area of 300 feet long and had a row of illuminated portholes along the side.  It was silent and floating in the same manner as a boat would in water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, grandmother, aunt and uncle also came out to look. We watched it a good 10 minutes before the tops of the trees obscured it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we watched it for just a few seconds, a brilliant blue beam shot down to the ground from the white light lasting about 5 seconds then blue light shot back into the light from the ground upward.  It the slowly moved toward us approx. 1000 ft up at 10 to 20 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer I knew it was not of this earth and took off running with brother and friend close behind.  It made no noise whatsoever.  Got back to car it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.   Date is approximate.

Second object appeared to be very high and yet its lights streched from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was only thirteen and my family where very protective.  I had never seen drugs nor known anyone who had. My family and I had just gone out and where returning from an evening of diner at a favorite pizza place. When we got out of the car I looked South and saw what at first appeared to be the moon.  I was about to comment on its shape and how shiny it was.  I couldn&#39;t make out any craters.  It was just white. Then I noticed that I had to many shadows. One shadow from the street lamp, one shadow from what I thought was the moon, and another. When I traced this third shadow back to its source I saw the moon almost directly overhead. I was about to yell at this discovery when I noticed the bright object begin to move.  I had to watch. I was nervous, but not frightend. My family by this time where in the mobile home we lived in at the time. I flattend my body against the trailor and watched by peeking around the corner as the object moved in a northern direction. The object moved till it seemed directly above me, then it stopped.  It seemed extremely large and high in altitude. I wondered if it where even in atmosphere. Then, wish it flew up and away into the out-there and was gone. I looked around the corner to where I had first seen it.  I saw something else.  I became filled with terror and dread. There, from one end of the horizon to the other were lights.  Red,Orange,Green.  Each one spaced evenly like many objects all in formation, or one huge object. It followed the same course as the other object and stopped over me just as the other object had. In the glare of the lights, and the blockage of the stars, it becaame aparent that these lights where all connected to one object.  The outline of the lights was striking.  It reminded me of that of a bird of prey symbol. It stopped momentarily and then it also moved up or out into the distance and vanished in seconds.<n>

I saw a round, bright light in the sky.  All of a sudden, the object shot upward, but not in a straight line. It shot at a 45% angle to the right.  My husband was asleep, but I woke him up.  He saw it too.  The object started to get dimmer and dimmer, then a cloud came over it and we could no longer see it.  We don&#39;t know if it faded out completely, or if the cloud was just not allowing us to see it anymore.  It really shook me up.  My husband, also commented that what we saw was very strange, not like what an airplane would look like in the sky at night.  I remember stopping to get a cup of coffee, in Bend, before continuing on our journey to the Oregon Crater, located to the east of Bend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

8/12/80 22:00|Bandon|OR|Disk|4-8 seconds|Father & son saw big glowing white disk approach thru clouds from S, depart thru clear sky to SW.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17512.html|16|ndxe198008| Father &amp; son saw big glowing white disk approach thru clouds from S, depart thru clear sky to SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and I saw a glowing disk in the sky about 20 years ago. I was probably about 11 years old at the time. We were in Bandon, OR, visiting my grandparents, probably during summer vacation. It was probably not before 1978 and not after 1984. At the time there was an empty field behind (SW of) the house where my father and I were laying on a blanket watching a meteor shower, probably the Perseids, so it probably occurred on the night of August 11 or 12. It was perhaps an hour or two after sunset, around 10:00PM PDT. I think there was no moon, so I&#39;m guessing that the year was 1980 based on star charts. It was breezy, and there were some low clouds to the S and SE, but most of the rest of the sky was clear. No precipitation. We saw what appeared to be a searchlight turn on, illuminating the clouds to the S, between 15 and 30 degrees above the horizon. No beam was visible. The illumination was moving N toward us, following a smooth arc toward the W. By the time the light reached the edge of the clouds it had slowed down slightly and was travelling approximately W. This was about 3 or 4 seconds after I had first noticed it. It was somewhere between 50 and 70 degrees above the horizon. At this point I was surprised (and very frightened!) to see a featureless glowing white disk emerge from the clouds. Apparently the clouds had been illuminated by this disk flying through or slightly above them, rather than by a ground-based searchlight. Not sure how high it was. The light had appeared slightly fuzzy as it moved through the clouds, but against the clear sky it was a definite disk with sharply defined edges. Not quite as bright as the full moon, and slightly smaller than two moons side by side. It looked solid (opaque). It continued on its smooth arc and flew off toward the SW, gaining speed and diminishing in brightness. The elapsed time from when it emerged from the clouds until it was no longer visible was about 2 or 3 seconds. We jumped up, hurried indoors and told our other family members about it. I was too scared to go outside again. There was no sound, no blinking. I don&#39;t recall any other air traffic in the area. There was nothing in the local paper the next day. I considered reporting it to MUFON at the time, but didn&#39;t, since we had no photos. Now I wish I had at least written it down because it&#39;s hard to remember details that long ago. Now my father only remembers &#34;seeing something strange&#34; that we were both &#34;pretty excited about.&#34; I remember more detail than he does, maybe because I was so scared and because I considered reporting it and thought about how I would describe it. I&#39;m finally reporting it to you now because I recently saw something else strange (reported to you 3/11/01), and was pleased to see 3 other reports of the same thing on your site.

I looked down toward the busy highway and saw this bus like thing above the highway. I squinted and looked again. It was still there. In this valley, there are many dogs but they were not making a peep for hours. A few seconds later the valley erupted with many dogs going crazy all at once. I told my girlfriend Ester to come out and look. I said &#34;do you see that thing down there?&#34; She said yes, what is that? I said I don&#39;t know. It looked like a big bus with lights moving slowly out of our view above the highway. Was I drunk or what? I know all about planes, etc. but was I seeing things or what? I still think about it every once and a while, but I quit drinking years ago--Aloha!<n>

We were about 30 to 40 miles from Tillamook in a mountainess area of hiway, at about 1:00 AM   when over to my right, and in front of us we saw a large rectangle shaped craft flying just above the top of the mountains, comming right at us. At first i thought it might have been a big jet liner, maybe in trouble becase it was so low, just clearing the mountan top. But after looking at it for a few moments, i realized it wasn&#39;t a jet, it was a dark craft with large windows on the front &amp; sides, shaped rectangle like a pack of cigarrets, as big as a football feild or a little bigger. It was flying very low &amp; slow about 250- 400 feet above the ground and it was comming right at us. The closer it came the more confused and puzzeled i became. what was it, i thought, as i watched it. I had no answers to my question just more questions. The windows were brightly lighted and i could see movement inside the craft as it flew over us. It had bright beems of light focused downward to the ground and the under side of it was&#39;nt smooth like i thought it should be, but it looked like pipes &amp; gurters like the underside of a steal bridge, and it had a lot of lights under it. The speed of the craft was maybe 60-80 mph &amp; it made no noise that we could hear in the car. It passed over us and went behind &amp; to the left of us as it just cleared the mountains on the other side of the hiway and was gone. I stopped the car and asked my friends if they saw what i saw, they said yes! with out hesitation looking at each other, we all said what the hell was that. i said i dont know but im not staying here to find out.I put the car in geare and punched it&amp; ran over 80 mph to Eugene&amp; home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/5/80 23:15|Glennallen|AK|Rectangle|25 minutes|Unidentified Bright Light Sitting On Road|10/15/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25361.html|22|ndxe198008| Unidentified Bright Light Sitting On Road<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving from Glennallen to Anchorage in a remote wilderness area, we observed a very bright light apparently on the road from a high ridge about 2.5 miles and several hundred vertical feet above the light.  As we drove down the hill we lost any view of the light.  The road at the bottom of the hill turned approximately 90 degrees to the right, and then went up perhaps 30 feet vertically and about a quarter-mile horizontally before we could see the light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was painfully brilliant to our dark-adapted eyes and we slowed the vehicle more and more as we drew closer because we could not see the road in front of us well enough to drive -- finally drawing to a complete stop approximately 200&#39; from the object.  Multiple flashings of the high beams to attempt to get the light reduced did not help, and we slowly creeped forward in small spurts until we were approximately 150&#39; from the light source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited perhaps 5 minutes for the light to change in some manner or another and began to get rather alarmed at the strangeness of it.  I made some comments about the fact that the light was super brilliant on the trees for as far as a line of sight carried it, but that it didn&#39;t reflect off of the metal of the car very intensely, so that I surmised it had some sort of polarization to it.  At that point our irritation turned quite sharply to fear when the unusual and unexplained nature of the event forcibly hit us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We backed up slowly for about 50&#39;, approached the again light slowly, freaked out, turned the car around, and raced back around the curving road through the 90 degree left turn and up the long, tall, straight hill.  It&#39;s embarrassing, but in our adrenaline-flushed brains, we had felt the car was &#34;bumped&#34; or &#34;jostled&#34; as we were approaching the light the second time, and we hit a top speed in excess of 90 mph in our subsequent flight.  The car was floored all of the way up the hill and well beyond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We travelled approximately 5 miles away from the light (and away from our intended destination) at high speed before we felt safe enough to pull over and discuss contacting the Alaska State Troopers.  We shortly decided that we had been rather cowardly, and did not want to be grist for the media grill, or the subject of jokes and ribbings.  Accordingly, we elected to return to the top of the large hill to observe the light from afar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our second trip to the top of the hill confimed that the light was still there.  And we watched it for what seemed like a long time -- though it may have only been a few minutes.  There was no other traffic in either direction, and the light was unwavering.  We were too spooked to investigate with another close approach to the light, and we attempted to restore our self-respect by making a quasi-scientific observation:  The light was of the apparent brightness of a large stadium light pack.  It had a color temperature of 8000 or higher, i.e., an actinic blue-white that destroyed our night-vision if we stared at it too long.  It seemed to be a uniform rectangular source approximately 30&#39; by 20&#39; in size when we approached it closely, but appeared to be oval in shape when viewed from above and at a couple miles distance on top of the big hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally decided to return to Glennallen and report our sighting to the Troopers...  or at least just go back and keep the whole thing to ourselves.  We had only driven back towards Glennallen for about 2 minutes when a light source appeared to be coming from the Glennallen direction.  This time however, it was a large tractor-trailer rig, a huge truck with a huge trailer that was literally barrelling down the road at 65 mph (we clocked it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped and followed the rig.  We began to look forward to seeing what would happen to the scarey USO (Unidentified Sitting Object) as the comfortingly huge and purposeful symbol of human industry plowed toward it.  At the top of the large hill, and cruising in the wake of the big rig, we saw the light still sitting there, less than three minutes away as the truck briefly hit seventy on the downhill stretch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came to the bottom of the hill, turned the 90 degree corner to our right, and coasted along in the wake of the giant truck, an irresistable force!  As we came to where the light had been seen before, there was nothing!  We hurriedly scanned everywhere, but stayed close to the truck.  No lights, nothing!  Within the next five minutes, we passed several cars going the other direction, but never saw anything that even remotely looked like the strange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a return trip later in the week we stopped at the place where we had had such a fright a few nights before.  I personally walked the pavement in the area, but could see nothing out of the ordinary.  We never knew what to make of the strange event, but have rarely driven a remote road at night without remembering it.  It has been more than twenty years as I write this report, so I apologize for any inaccuracies or forgotten details.  I have not observed any other unexplained phenominon in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> You may post my account as you wish.  I was quite impressed with the ufocenter site, and am sorry that I did not get a chance to record my father-in-law&#39;s experiences on that same stretch of road before he passed away.  His story was much more interesting, but never recorded accurately.  I am now sorry that I never interviewed him carefully on the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I plan to return to the ufo center site in the future and peruse the information there in more detail when I<n> <n><n> have time to do so.

I still remember it so clearly and have never reported it before because I didn&#39;t want people to think I was nuts.  I KNOW what I saw was real and in all my reading, research, etc., can&#39;t justify it away with any other answer! At the time, the area we lived in was very rural.  We live about 30 miles south of Phoenix, and in an area with very few homes (3).  We live 15 miles SW of the town of Maricopa.  I was in my house watching TV when my brother in law came screaming up to the door.  When I answered, he just said, &#34;Look!&#34; and pointed to the Eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw at first was what I said looked like planes flying in a V-formation.  He kept arguing.  As we watched, the craft moved in our direction VERY SLOWLY.  Eventually, it came directly over our house.  This thing was HUGE!!!!!!! It was solid black.  It was probably no more than 100 feet above our house.  We live on 3 1/3 acres and the wing span easily reached side to side.  It was moving incredibly slow.  I have been around planes a lot in my life.  This was not a plane.  You could see NO landing gear doors, no rivits on the bottom of the craft, no call numbers, no lights on the wings.  It was very much a boomerang shape with a small tail added to that shape.  I have drawn the shape a 1,000 times since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached us, there was a single center light inside, more like the irridescent glow of a light...greenish.  I saw no movement inside, just light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued to move east to west at the same slow rate...we were able to walk at a very normal pace to stay under it.  I walked to our fence line, about 180 feet away, under it and stood there and watched it.  It continued across the desert about a mile past my inlaws acerage, then stopped and turned very, very slowly to the south where it just seemed to sit for a few seconds.  Then it flipped upward, sort of tilted onto its back and was GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can&#39;t even come close to the speed it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely NO SOUND coming from this craft.  I think I have never been outside at night since, that I have not watched the sky, looking for its return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week later, there was a report in a small mountain town to the northeast of us, Morenci, that the same shaped HUGE object was observed during a football game.  I tried to write the paper in Morenci, but never received a response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  I had 2 cameras hanging just inside the door, but was afraid to open the door and go in for fear I would miss something.  I was just AMAZED.  I have kicked myself OFTEN for that choice.  Man, would I love to have a photo of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any questions, feel free to email me.  That was not a choice below, but for sure the best way to reach me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Front of object had several dim lights, craft very large, moving slowly over pasture<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the late summer of 1980, a friend and I were sitting on the trunk of my car  at approx. 11:30 p.m.  My home was located in Brenham, Tx,-right off of the highway, ( sorry, can&#39;t remember which highway) and was surrounded by cow pasture.  We were just looking at the stars..and suddenly we saw a strange craft moving slowly through the night sky, directly above us.  We thought at first that the object was a blimp-soon it was quite obvious that this was no blimp, plane,etc..The object was very, very long..at the very least one football field in length.  The front of the object was chevron/triangle shaped, with dim lights all along the rim of the front.  Object was very slow and seemed to be flying at low altitude.  The oddest thing was the complete absence of sound-any object that low, that large would have to make sound of some sort, but this thing was totally silent-almost like a vaccum- everything was incredibly silent.  We watched this for approx. 15-20 min, in total shock, not really believing what we were seeing.  We never reported it, never mentioned it to anyone-as we were young, ( 20) and knew that we would never be believed.  To this day, I believe we saw an alian craft--I am now in my 40&#39;s and have never again seen anything that large be able to fly..and especially be totally soundless<n>

I looked up to see a formation of multicolored lights in a triangular shape – like a rack of pool balls, but each line of lights were of the same color. I couldn’t make out the physical shape. It seemed to be black in color against a clear black sky. It was probably 800 ft in the air. No sound. I looked at it for approximately 2 seconds and pointed to the object. It then moved across half the horizon in about 2 seconds. I know it was watching us. I know it departed because I noticed them/it. It had unbelievable speed and no ramp during acceleration. It was either stopped and hovering or moving at 1,000s of miles per hour…with no trail or noise. I’m left with the knowledge that these flying objects are out there and not only do they have unbelievable flying abilities (it’s not fair to call it flying) they have incredible observation abilities. From about 800 or so feet they c! ould tell that I was looking at them and in 1-2 seconds they noticed me looking at them and they moved their craft across the horizon. I didn’t speak of this for over 10 years. I’ve told this to a number of people in the past 10 or so years and have been met with mixed feedback. I’ve been fortunate to meet others who have legitimate sightings and now I feel like there’s a legitimate population of “have seen” and “haven’t seen”. I’m not sure it’s any better, but at least I can say that I’m a “have seen”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am by no means saying that what I saw came from &#34;outer space:&#34;  just that I have never seen anything like it before or since and that it was very strange and un-earthly.  And while I believe that there is a good chance that there is intelligent life out there in the universe, I do not particularly believe that it is coming here.  Furthermore, I am the type of person who needs to see proof of something that is so unimaginable before being convinced that it exists.  Not a skeptic - but not a believer either.  My mind is open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing to you because I would like to know if what I saw matches the description of anything that anyone else has seen, or if there is an explanation for it.  Although there was another witness, I have not seen him for many years and we never really spoke about it afterwards, probably because I was facing the scene and got a much better look.  However, he definitely did see some of what I saw, so it was not just me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, this is what I saw.  It was around dusk.  We were sitting at an outside swimming pool area in South Miami-Dade County in Florida, which is about thirty five miles south of Miami and near the Florida Keys (and the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico).  I was facing south/southwest.  I was absentmindedly looking at the sky, since we were just sitting there and relaxing and not doing much else.  All of the sudden I saw a fairly large, cigar shaped object that was silver-grey in color.  It was very strange because it&#39;s not like it came from anywhere, it was just -there-.  The sky was relatively clear, and I should have been able to see it come from somewhere before it appeared in my view.  For example, if you are watching an airplane fly, you can see it coming from somewhere and then it is in front of you and then you can watch it go away from you.  But this object did not behave like that - one moment there was nothing there, and the next moment there was.  And it is not like I even saw it appear - it was just &#34;there&#34; if that makes any sense to whoever is reading this.  It did not appear like &#34;poof!&#34; and it&#39;s there, it just WAS there, where it WAS NOT before.  I cannot explain it any more clearly than that.  So it is in the sky and I am watching it.  It makes no noise at all.  Another strange thing was that it was hard to tell how high in the air it was.  It&#39;s as if it was both close and far away at the same time.  Overall, it did not seem to be very high - it seemed to be lower than a typical stratus cloud.  My best estimate of the altitude is around 1,000 ft.  Not being able to tell the altitude also makes it hard to estimate the size of the the thing, but I am guessing anywhere from 100 feet long to 300 feet long.  It did not seem to be larger than any airplane or blimp that we have on Earth.  It was also going slow, but not other-worldly slow (ie. too slow to remain in the air). However, speed  is also hard to estimate without knowing how far it was from me.  It did not make any strange or sudden moves, and moved in a south to southwest direction, as if heading towards the Gulf of Mexico.  It did not seem to have any lights on it per se, but it did sort of glow - consider that it was near end of dusk when I saw it and the sky was fairly dark.  It had no lights, yet I could see it.  So it must have been illuminated in some way but it was sort of &#34;hazy.&#34;  Now - I would probably have forgotten about this a long time ago and figured that it was something that was somehow explainable.  However - what happened next is what convinced me that I was seeing something -very- strange.  Just as the object appeared, so did many others.  First one, two, and by the time they were done there were around fifteen to twenty of them.  They -seemed- to be emanating from the first one and then flying in a slow formation.  They also seemed to be smaller, but of uniform shape and size.  The strangest part of this whole thing was that I could never actually -see- the new ones appear.  It was like the first one - it WAS NOT there, and then it WAS there.  It&#39;s not like I could see it come from the first one, or see it &#34;blink on.&#34;  I really cannot explain - even to myself - how exactly they came into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of the new ones appeared, I pointed it out to my friend, who had his back to it at the time.  He saw about half of what I saw, I suppose.  So we watched them for a couple of minutes more, then just as strangely as they appeared - they were gone and I never saw them, or anything like them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected to see or hear something about this the next day, but there was nothing.  Other people HAD to see it.  The only thing that could help to explain what I saw is that it occurred in the general area of Homestead Air Force Base - but these things were nothing like anything else that I ever saw come from the base (or anywhere else) and I lived there for almost twenty years. They were not searchlights, nor did they look like anything else that man has ever made.  And the way that they &#34;appeared;&#34;  I have never seen anything even remotely like that, anywhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s my one UFO sighting.  I say UFO because as far as I am concerned, that is exactly what they were - unidentified flying objects.  I am not saying that they came from another galaxy.  I do not know.  It was definitely strange enough for me to write to you about it, around twenty-five years later (please note that the date of viewing that I entered here is very much approximate.  It happened sometime between 1980 and 1983, and probably closer to 1980.  The day and the month are a total guess - it was a warm evening, but we are talking about the Miami area and it&#39;s always warm in the evening).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d be interested to hear from anyone who has seen something similar, or who can explain this.  Please - only write to me if you saw either exactly what I saw or something very close - or if you think that you can explain what I saw, or if you are an investigator who wishes to hear more.  But I am not a UFO &#34;buff.&#34;  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The craft flew very slowly just above the trees. As the craft moved across the treeline, it but did not create any air turbulence - neither the trees nor leaves moved. It made no sound and moved very very slowly over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I ran out onto the side gallery and looked up at the object which proceeded over our heads in an easterly direction. Again, it made no sound and I felt no air turbulence. As the nose of the craft moved over the front of the house, we had time to run to the rear side gallery and watch the last 1/3 of the craft pass overhead  (our house is approximately 45 feet wide).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The width of the craft, I would roughly estimate to be about 200 to 250 feet wide, maybe more. The wing span ran from our road to our barn, which is approximately 2 telephone poles wide(100&#39; between poles). I would estimate it took approximately 7-8 seconds for the last 1/3 of the plane to fly completely by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was a huge triangle. The color was a dark greenish black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It look liked it was made of plastic. I don&#39;t remember any lights or windows, but I distinctly recall that the underside of the craft was comprised of  very large tubing (same color as the craft but the pipes looked like large plastic sewer pipes (running back and forth..(south/north) across it&#39;s underside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must tell you however, the Plattsburgh Airforce Base was in operation at the time and someone in Howick ( a neighbouring town) also reported an incident and my daughter does not recall the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was dark and I had parked along way from my apartment.  As I was walking towards the apartment I looked up and saw this round saucer just above the roof across from my apartment.  As I was looking I saw white lights around the craft and blue flashing lights with red in the middle.  I was scared because I couldn&#39;t believe was I was seeing.  I must have stood there about two minutes trying to decide what to do.  I ran upstair to open my door and get a camera just inside and when I came back it was gone.  I did a sketch of what I saw and lost it, but I still remember it and the more I thought about it the more I believe what I saw was very real.  I checked around the next day to see if anyone else reported it but it seems I was the only one who saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
