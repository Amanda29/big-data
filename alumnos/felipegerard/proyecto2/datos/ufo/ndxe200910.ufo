Unfortunately I don&#39;t have any video footage of the event and I am afraid the sighting will not be taken seriousl because of it being Halloween night: which is the reason we were outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/31/09 22:00|Corpus Christi|TX|Oval|2 minutes|Three circular outlines made of red lights; two drifted away in different directions, one lingered and then left.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74264.html|2|ndxe200910| Three circular outlines made of red lights; two drifted away in different directions, one lingered and then left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background: There were seven of us at my house meeting up before we went to a Halloween party. We took pictures inside, gathered our belongings, and stepped outside to enter our cars. The second we stepped out onto the porch we saw lights hovering. I tried asking a news station if anyone else had seen what we did, yet I never got a response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw: There were three distinct oval shapes made of circular red lights in the sky in front of us; they were already there when we walked out. Two of them drifted away, in opposite directions, out of sight within thirty seconds. The last one lingered for what seemed like forty five extra seconds, and then SLOWLY drifted away out of sight. We were amazed and in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background of observers: We&#39;re all students here in Corpus aged 20-22. I said there were seven of us present but I can&#39;t remember any reaction from one of our friends, which is why I stated only six of us saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No photos: The thought came up but I had mentioned that my camera wouldn&#39;t get lights from that far away (Since it wouldnt have) and instead we just wacthed until they left.<n>
10/31/09 21:30|Santa Monica|CA|Triangle|5 minutes?|V shaped formation with orange lights hovers over area and then seemingly vanishes|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73127.html|3|ndxe200910| V shaped formation with orange lights hovers over area and then seemingly vanishes<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point between 9:30 and 10PM, the only known witness had taken a moment to go out back into the alley and light up a cigarette.  Not paying too much attention to what was going on, the witness suddenly realized a larger “V” shaped object in the sky to the immediate west.  The object was otherwise undefined except for the formation of orange lights that surrounded two sides of the object as if it were an illuminated flock of geese.  Besides being illuminated, this formation seemed to be hovering above and not in particular motion in the night sky (mostly clear skies at the time).  After watching the object for a few minutes, the witness ran to his front door and called for his wife to quickly come outside.  When the two returned to the area of visibility, the object was no longer visible.  A few planes entered the area shortly afterwards.  Given the perspective of these known aircraft, it appeared that the unknown object must have been considerably lar! ger and much higher in altitude than the ascending local air traffic.  With nothing more seemingly to see, the witness returned to his home.  The witness is just under 40 years old and would be considered a credible source.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That&#39;s when she said &#34; what is that moving fast,&#34;  I looked up and saw the UFO.  My wife and I have been a witnesses of a UFo incident in 1997 in northern Texas.  It was very bright star, like moving in directions and speed that nothing could do on earth.  I have seen almost the same siteings on the history channel etc.  But what we saw tonight was camoflauge cloud like UFOS.  Both the same size moving much faster than the long stratas clouds in the area.With the moon glow shinning on the small cloud like looking thing.  No way was it a cloud, both were on same flight path and travaling at a much faster speed than the rest of the sky.  The more I think about what I saw the more it makes since.  What a better way to be discrete than taking the shape and looking like a small cloud.  No lights.  Just camoflage<n>

We watched it for about 3 minutes as it moved around and than it disappeared.  About 30 minutes later it reappeared and moved acrossed the sky and than disappeared again.  Later that night probably an hour or so later we saw it again however this time there were 3 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it might be a firework as it was Halloween and there were a lot of fireworks that evening.  The shape of the light source changed to make it appear like a fireball and it also changed direction and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other people, unknown to me and the person I witnessed the event with, had also witnessed the event and we watched it together.  It lasted for about 1-2 minutes.  We all agreed that that what we had witnessed was strange.  I saw a similar event last year (2008) over Dublin, Ireland, however, no-one else witnessed this event.<n>

It had one orange or yellowish light which looked like it was burning.  The object was moving pretty slowly. My two sisters and my mom also saw it.  I do not know what it was.  I do not know if it was a rocket or plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My son and I, along with another adult male saw a bright orange colored circled shape object flying south in the sky.  We watched the object for about ten minutes and then it finally disappeared into the clouds.<n>
10/31/09 19:00|Indianapolis|IN|Fireball|1 minute|Orange "flaming" light rising, then abruptly changing directions and slowly disappearing in the horizon.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73096.html|10|ndxe200910| orange &#34;flaming&#34; light rising, then abruptly changing directions and slowly disappearing in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside my front door when an orange light, flickering as if it were a ball of fire, seemingly rose out of the north. My initial reaction, since it&#39;s Halloween night, was that it was a roman candle, It stopped rising then appeared stationary, it slowly moved south then turned abruptly to the east and went at a slow but steady pace, and also started to rise.  It continued in the same direction and same rate of rising until it eventually disappeared in the horizon.  It had just gotten dark but the moon was shining brightly.  There were very few clouds.  The next door neighbor was sitting on her porch and I asked her if she could see it, she looked up and said &#39;yes&#39;. We didn&#39;t discuss it further. Right after it rose and stopped, I opened the door and asked my wife to come and see it, she watched for the duration.  Oddly enough, we had seen (and reported) the exact same thing in the summer of 2008, which as it turned out, had been seen and reported by p! eople throughout Indiana and Michigan.<n>

It was around 6 to 7 at night.  It was still light out. I saw a orange ball above the tree line.  I have lived in town for over twenty years. The orange ball was large and looked like a perfect circle.  It looked like the light was above 80/94 highway.  The light was stationary then started moving below the tree line.  It wasn&#39;t the sun or any advertising signs.  I have never seen anything like it before.  It saw it for less than a minute.  This is twice in one year I have seen lights I can&#39;t explain.  I placed a report in August of this year.  I wanted to let you know I looked every night for a week after sighting and it was not there again.  So I know it wasn&#39;t a star or planet.  This object I observed with my binoculars changed in sequence to four different colors in a pattern. This was the August sighting.  I didn&#39;t want to report the orange ball because I was afraid no one woul! d believe me since I had posted a different sighting in August.  Then I saw that someone in Indy and Chicago saw a simular thing. Many people had to have seen this orange ball. It was right over a very major highway in and out of Chicago.  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The orange light was stationary and the blue light would movie 180 degrees back and forth on the left of the orange light. The two lights would dim in and out and the blue light would sometimes disappear. I live at a base of a small hill and the lights seemed to be right above the ground over the hill, I ran inside to get some binoculars thinking maybe I could get somewhat of a glimpse of what it could be and I focus the binoculars and point them toward the hill and the two lights zoomed from the stationary position to I guess you could say, light speed, faster than any machine or human can run.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What got my attention is that the light was larger than the normal flight traffic you get here between LAX and John Wayne airports. It was a deep orange color, no wing tip lights or other normal blinking marker lights. I watched for more than 5 minutes as it approached my location growing bigger, before I called to my son. My 19yo son commented that this was very definitely not our normal passenger air traffic, and that is very unsettling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later the light made a turn to our left and headed do west out over the Pacific Ocean and gained altitude. Just at this moment it seemed to break apart or drip debris. Looked very much like burning embers falling from the object and fading as the fell. Both my son and I felt that this must have been a burning aircraft up until it turned and gained altitude as it headed out to sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We see a tremendous amount of air traffic (civilian and military) here as well as occasional launches from Vandenberg AFB. This was very definitely not either! Too big to be aircraft and missile launches generally produce a very white light. Waited to report until today as we assumed we would hear about it in the news today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night was an almost full moon and exceedingly clear cloudless night. The altitudes and speeds  seemed consistent with general aviation, although the size and orange color were inconsistent as well as the turn towards the pacific and the debris falling. Total viewing time 10-12 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband asked if that was a star in the sky and I said no it is too bright to be a star.  The object wasn&#39;t moving so as we got closer to it, it started moving slightly toward our car. When it directly over our car we pulled over to get a better look.  The object just hovered mostly but as we looked at it longer it started to move away from under our car.  It was very quiet.  Never heard a noice from it.  We watched it fly away slowly and so we proceeded on our way.  As we were driving down FM1008 I noticed another one in the sky.  It could have possibly been the same one but I don&#39;t think so.  This is the second sighting I&#39;ve had in this area in past 2 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was travelling at a slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might have been a helicopter, but when I went outside there was no noise at all. We do get helicopters flying overhead from time to time and they can be heard and felt quite clearly within 1 mile. This was completely silent and moved in a haphazard kind of way. Whilst travelling northwards it appeared to be travelling in a slightly erratic way and not steadily as a helicopter or plane would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared out of sight as it headed towards the village of Irby.<n>

One light after another appeared in what seemed like 2-3 second intervals. There was about 5-8 lights, I was trying to watch the road, they came on in intervals, but disappeared all at the same time.  My eyes hurt afterwards and had a migraine, I had to leave work early on the 30th because my head hurt still.  I drove past the next day and there was nothing there.  This is an empty field, nothing else could explain what I saw. I have always been skeptical of UFO&#39;s, but when I saw this craft, I knew.  I can&#39;t explain what I saw, but it impacted me profoundly enough to write you and try to figure out what this was!<n>

After a second I looked in the sky and saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, a red light popped up, out of nowhere, then another, until there was four red lights, in a horizontal line; which kind of looked like a bar. Then in the same order, the lights went out and it disappeared. That is what I saw. The whole thing lasted about 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I started talking and she said that she saw the same thing, but white lights. I don’t know what that means. The entire ride home, we were looking for it, to see if maybe it was an airplane or something like that. It was definitely nowhere to be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a little scared, excited and in disbelief. That isn’t the first time I have seen a UFO, but the last time I did, I was about 9years old.

I slammed on my breaks and just stared at them trying to figure out exactly what it was that I was looking at.  I had never seen anything like it before in my entire life.  It was hard to tell if the lights were one or eight different objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were white with a yellow tint to them and were in a perfect line with one another.  There were no distortions or imperfections to the spheres at all, only a small halo of light surrounding each one.  They were spaced out evenly and had the appearance of having a curvature formation to them like a saucer or the such.  They also were approximately 17 to 20 times greater in size than the largest star that was near the lights (in the night sky).  The lights were approximately 45 degrees to the horizon in the southeast direction from my position where I was stopped in the road.  I would say that the lights were about half a mile away from where I was.  The lights were near my family&#39;s property and were a ways up in the sky too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, just as suddenly as I had seen them, the lights started to go out one by one.  There was a bit of rotation to them as they went out.  I tried to see where they had gone, but there was nothing in the sky.  The only visible objects were a couple of far-off airplanes, the moon, the stars, and clouds.  There were no smoke trails as from a bottle-rocket or other firework product. There was absolutely nothing left after the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove around on the back roads for about ten minutes looking for firework trails or an aircraft or anything to explain the situation.  I also kept looking in the same spot where I had seen the lights, but nothing appeared there again.  I finally went home and stood outside for around twenty minutes looking for anything that may be an answer to this phenomenon.  I never saw the lights or anything that even resembled them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 2 - 11 years old  I saw a curve of 8 white lights in the south-eastern sky.  Then they went out one by one evenly.  Then, we drove down [our road].  We saw nothing that could have caused them.  We drove down another road and didn&#39;t see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 3 - 9 years old  I saw 8 white balls of light in the sky.  They went out one by one.  It was about 8:45 at night.  First there were 8, then 7, then 6, then etc., then there weren&#39;t any left.<n>

We thought it was an airplane, possibly one of the C5s from Wright Patterson AFB.  But then we noticed it was too low and too massive to be a plane.  I slowed down the car and we rolled down the windows.  We heard nothing.  It was silent and moved at a slow speed east to west and then turned north and east disappearing behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got a glimpse of an object in the sky.  I jokingly said to my wife, &#34;Look there is a &#39;UFO&#39;,&#34;  but then we realized.  It was below the cloud level which would have been less than 2 miles on a cloudy evening.  No sound, no vapor or smoke emitted, no apparent lights, traveling approx 300 to 400 mph in a straight line in a west / south west direction.  We clearly saw the outline of the object which would be more of a polygon shape.  Appeared to reflect the cloud cover or type of translucent reflection.  Did not appear to be a whether balloon or etc as was too low and moving in a straight line and too fast.  We waited approx 1 hr before contacting anyone.  We see commercial aircraft everyday and also military aircraft but on specific coerces.  I would approximate the size of the vehicle at the given altitude to be approx length and wing span of a 737 but definitely! a polygon shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the Characteristics listed on your website were applicable<n>

My friends were surf fishing on the beach.  They told me to look out over the water and I would see what looked like a star with a flashing light circling it and I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend then told me that he saw the craft “bounce” around the local fishing pier and then shoot up into the sky where it has been stationary for over an hour now.  None of us have a telescope but with my binoculars it looks like a “star” with a blinking white light and blue light circling it.  Also, for the first 20 minutes the main light seemed to pulse becoming intensely brighter and then dimmer. Now it seems to stay more consistently at the dimmer light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will post another report in the morning if it is still in the same spot as it does not seem to be moving with the rest of the stars.<n>

But after looking at the plane I notice that out in front of the plane by about 500ft was another craft with no blinking lights just a faint light in each corver, Red, Blue, Green.  I immedietly called my wife who was able to see the craft as well.  It seamed that the plane was following the craft so I dont know if this may be a man made ufo or if they were observing it.<n>

I got out my binoculars, but they werent very strong ones, so it just seemed as a very bright light.  since it was getting late, I put my kids to be, then I took a bath.  at about midnight, I went back up on the deck, and that light moved about 3 feet froom where I sat, so I think that must have been a great distance up there to move.  and it did the same thing, move about 5 inches, then stay and rotate a little.  I got out a flashlight and flashed it a few times, then it would move closer again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time of sighting may be flawed.  PD))<n>

The object hovered for approxiamtely 5 minutes while we stood there staring at it. I snapped 2 shots from my camera phone and the object then took off at a 90 degree angle straight up the sky towards space. We stood there watching it as it left with extreme speed not capable of any airplane or jet. The object never emitted any sound or vibration.

I glanced up into a very clear sky and was immediately stopped in my tracks by the sight of 2 &#34;stars&#34; approx. 3 finger widths apart, just below Cassiopiea. Being an avid sky watcher, I KNEW that those 2 stars did not belong there. I turned and walked about 5 steps back to my car, so as to brace myself against a stationary object to try and see if they moved. In the 2-3 seconds it took to walk that far, when I turned back to look at them, they had dimmed considerably, and were slowly moving, this time the 2 had become 3 points of light and were slowly moving together. They appeared to be extremely high up. No sound. I am positive they were not balloons, chinese lanterns, airplanes, satellites. No idea what they were. It was just amazing, seeing this show in the sky and knowing it was something unusual and out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The lights were very bright and illuminating. I could see swirling fog or mist to the right and left of them but not between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that a vehicle was traveling down the hillside. But, the lights were much too large and they were quite high above the horizon, and I believe my mind was trying to be “logical” about what my eyes were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched these two lights moving at the same distance apart and slowly down until they were below the ridge and out of my eyesight.

10/28/09 19:30|Santa Clarita County (126 freeway)|CA|Unknown|20 minutes|I witness the teleportation of an alien spacecraft, as well as the soarce of this technology in action.|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75630.html|34|ndxe200910| I witness the teleportation of an alien spacecraft, as well as the soarce of this technology in action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling East on the 126 freeway with no other cars around  me.  There was no moon in the sky  and the area is a farming valley so except for my headlights there was no other sources of light in the area.  I happened to look to the Eastern horizon and slightly north when I noticed four red lights in the sky in a diamond shaped pattern hanging what  appeared to be approximately 200-300 feet above the Northern mountain range.   Although these lights were in the distance I wasn’t sure at the time what they truly were.  These lights were stationary and were constant at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to drive East I was beginning to notice that I was becoming aware that I was getting closer to these lights in the sky.  Growing up around an airport most of my life I knew an airplane or helicopter when I seen one, such as a strobe light on such craft.  These lights always kept the same distance telling me that they were on a craft and were apparently on one side of this craft, but because of the extreme darkness in the area I couldn’t tell you what this craft look like.  For the next 20 minutes I continues to see this light pattern in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached an area of this freeway, where the freeway would now turn to go around portions of the Northern mountain side that came towards the valley floor I could not see the lights due to my view being block. As I came around the curve in the road, out of thin area four large orbs of light appeared over a little mountain right in front my view.  These lights were large, as large as a house, and were of white light with speckles of grey within the orb.  Each orb had a halo surrounding it in what was the same color as lighting yellow and lit up the top of this mountain, which had a power line tower on top of it,.  These orbs were also in a diamond shape configuration.  Although I had my radio on in the car I could hear an electrical discharge as they appeared.  Within a second or two from appearing they quickly disappeared back into thin air. I’ll tell you that I was keeping my eyes on the road and trying to make sense of way I had just appeared and disappeared in front of m! e. As I cleared this part of the road and was traveling due East again and looked to the Eastern horizon and slightly North again.  Now I was approaching two sets of four red lights in the sky in a diamond shaped pattern side by side.  I opened my window and notice no sound from the air as I drove past these lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t talk to anyone about this incident for two days because I was trying to process what I had witnessed that night.  I finally came to the conclusion that I had witness teleportation of an alien spacecraft.  I had witness alien technology in action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while I began to tell people who I have known for at least several years about this event, including an older woman who was a widow.  As I told her this story, she told me her husband was a fighter pilot in WWII in the pacific theater.  He had spoke to her several times that while flying in daylight he saw a black disc object in the air with him which had four red lights on the back end of this craft in a diamond shaped pattern.  When he tried to fly towards this craft, the ship would race away from his plane.<n>

They were diagionally in the sky (one to the bottom right of the top on). They were not far apart from one another. They floated there in the sky like fireballs. The two objects seemed to not go anywhere. but then the top one went out like it was being covered in dirt and then same with the second. About two minutes later they came back in the same spot and stayed there for about another two minutes and went out again. The shapes were of fireballs. They looked like they were on fire. They were both orange-yellow in color. As for the credit of my friend and I, we both are smart intelligent guys. Both graduated high school with 3.2.or higher gpa and the driver went to community college for a year. We&#39;re both respected amongst our friends and employers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to sleep at 7am in the morning.  I had a dream that my parents bought a new house and then a friend and I where checking out a room in the house. The room had a back sliding door (glass).  We went outside for some reason and down from the sky past a tree with no leaves a bunch of these tiny balls floated down. well they didnt float they descended down under their own power it seemed but slowly.they started out as barely visible dots in the sky.  These balls looked to be about 10 inches in diameter maybe a little bigger.  The balls I saw were see through navy- light blue that looked plastic with a solid orange core about 3-4 inches in diameter.  They floated around us and we ran inside. One of the balls managed to get in and i picked it out of the air with both my hands cuped around the bottom of the ball.  I dont remember it feeling like plastic or not like plastic, i just remember it feeling like a smooth surface thats how plastic probably feels im sure.  It was very light pretty much weightless.  Anyways it came in and I picked it out of the air and put it outside quickly because i was freaking out on some calm level. when i tryed to shove it outside I closed the door while i was putting it out there so it couldnt get back in kind of what someone would do if they we putting a bug outside. when i put it out it seemed like it tried to get back in as it was ascending but couldnt fit through the 3 inch crack of the door. It ended up going straight up and over the house and the gutter. After that in my dream i was trying to call the police but i couldnt for some reason. Then this is the seemingly fake part that makes me think it really was just a dream. It was a dream but ever since i woke up it just felt so real i have never had such a realistic dream in my life ok heres the fake part. After the ball went over the house i went to the front of the house and there was this small auditorium facing a bunch of glass doors not sliding ! doors like in the back of the house but like office building d! oors. th e seats were facing the front doors. On one of the seats of the auditorium was this sprinkler head looking thing spewing out some kind of dark smoke on two side as it was spinning. it was deployed from one of the balls im pretty sure, so then i grabbed it off the back of the seat and threw it outside onto the ground. Then for some reason the auditorium was full of young to middle age people after i turned back from throwing the sprinkler looking thing out the front door. I remember this all vividly and perfectly but the end part is a little hazy. I remember telling anyone around me to call the police and the military. The police never showed up but i do remember a military guy wearing a decked out military navy blue uniform with lots of metals like you would see on a navy officers coat. Most of the metal were on his left breast like in real life. The military guy was the only one in uniform and he was in the front row of the full auditorium standing up looking at me along wi! th a few others in the front row standing up. He was the only one that stuck out in my mind. This all was probably just a dream. All my logical tells me it was just a dream but my emotions and feelings and body tell me it was real. It was so vivid, it seemed so real and it still does, even while typing this up 3 hours after I had this dream. I have never seen or heard about these types of blue balls with the orange centers so i dont know where i would get the idea about them. very strange. After i woke up i looked outside to see if they were out there and thinking that they would be; there was nothing. This was not at all dissappointing i hope to god it was not real it really freaked me out. I was scared when the balls came down the only reason i grabed the one and put it outside is because no one else was going to so i had to and i feared for my life. same with the sprinkler thing i thought it was trying to harm me in some way. It was probably just a dream but if not i don! t want to see it again and for that matter i hope i never drea! m about it again. disturbing.  I appologize for wasting anyones time for reading this if it was just a dream. I just felt like i really really had to tell someone about this and see if anyone has had a similar dream or experience. i looked on the internet to see if these ball things were common but i couldnt find any thing similar. thank you for your time.<n>

Definately not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 1 AM and my girlfriend and I were sitting in my backyard in the Oakland hills looking at the view towards downtown Oakland.  Out of nowhere a gigantic, extremely bright circular blue light appeared over the Piedmont cemetary.  It was so bright and sudden that we both at the same time said &#34;Whoah what is that!&#34;  It was easy to see the light there because the cemetary is one of the only areas in the cityscape that is completely black at night.  At first i thought it could be cops in the cemetary shining lights or a helicopter, but after about 1 second it was obvious that it was neither. The light was huge, bright blue, circular, and had defined edges. It even lit up some of the trees directly around it. Then for a split second it looked like there could be two circles.  This only lasted for about 3 seconds and just as fast as the huge light had appeared it disappeared.  Then the weirdest part happened.  About 1-2 seconds after the circle(s) disapp! eared, another blue circle (or possibly the same one) appeared at least one mile away to the south.  This time it was merely a flash for about one second after which it disappeared for good.  I cant stress how huge and bright blue this circle of light was, and how defined its shape was.  Looking at the view it was about the size of one of the houses around it.  I couldnt see any sort of craft, just the bright solid light light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a clear night because it had rained the entire day before.  Not a cloud in the sky.  We were both looking towards the sky when I turned to look towards the south.  She immediately calls my name and says &#34;Look!!!&#34;.  Right above our heads the formation flew.  It couldn&#39;t have been any more than 10,000 feet above our heads.  It looked like 5 white circles in a line and another one immediately to the side.  You could see a faint outline around them as if they were art of a larger craft.  Not very big, however.  It was late at night.  No noise and a clear night sky.  No lights on to dim the view so it was clear as day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And the smaller lights then came out again and circled the bright light.  This shooting across and stopping happend atleast four times.  And every stop was followed with the circling lights.

I was driving on 10th street heading south right at the camp roberts boarder.  I saw a redish orange firey ball standing in the sky about 40 degrees westwardly off the road (SSW), and an elevation about 25d.  It seemed to hover there for the duration of the time, not moving closer or backward and not adjusting in intensity.  It was twice as bright as Venus and a little larger.  I could trace a straight line between venus and the brightest star in the sky pointing to it with equa-distant intervles (probably no help).  I took a few quick snap shots with my camera, brief video, and test a friend in the town south of me to try and get a tringulation of the thing; while I smoked my ciggorette.  My friend didn&#39;t get out to see it fast enough.  After I jumped back in my car it was gone.  I have watched a bunch of rocket launches from Vandenburg AFB (this was brighter, and didn&#39;t move).   And I am in the sate! llite communications field (not a satellite).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an airplane and UFO fanatic sense I was a kid, and Have actually begun to get my piolets license with pigs can fly.  One of my hobbys is stargasing (so was my dads) so I&#39;m farmiliar with some of the random sights that people claim to be UFOs.  I could not explain what I saw and would like to get the info e-mail to me if anyone else saw it.  Thank you<n>
10/27/09 20:00|San Pedro|CA|Sphere|all night|Hundreds of them in the night sky over one city alone.!!!|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73052.html|41|ndxe200910| Hundreds of them in the night sky over one city alone.!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> First time I seen this thing was about two years ago in 2007. The shape of this thing looked like two crome balls about the size of a giant beach ball, (from the distance that we were from this object, which seemed to be about a football field away), These two balls had what looked like electricity circling around each one, I say electricity because we could here like a buzzing sound from it, and these two balls would fly together one above the other and at some instances join together and form one ball and then back to two, and when they would split we could here like an electrical popping sound. also it seemed to be scanning the area beneath it cause we could see very faint beams of light shooting out from it,(looked like 10 beams in all). This thing would be right in front of us and in about 2 seconds it would look it was as far as the stars. I&#39;ve seen this thing a couple of times since but not as close as the first time. Now as in right now I can walk ou! tside my house and look up at the sky and see about hundred of those things and who knows how many more are out there but something is going on cause every night I see more and more of them. You can spot them out pretty easy. Whenever you see a star and it looks like two side by side its one of those things and they&#39;re not that far up, some are but every day more of them get lower and there is one main one that sits the lowest and is the shiniest one out of all. If you have a bright laser, (I use a green laser) you can point it at them and watch them move out of the way of it. See for your self, but I think something is about to happen and these things do not look man made and I think that mans technology is not this advanced. Oh also these things blink red, yellow, blue, and white lights. GOD BLESS us all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/27/09 18:30|McAllen|TX|Other|Four minutes|They looked like planes without wings, emitting a high concentration of light and moving extremely slowly.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73051.html|42|ndxe200910| They looked like planes without wings, emitting a high concentration of light and moving extremely slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 6:30 PM or so on Tuesday, October 27, 2009, a friend and I were working outside on a project for school. We were underneath a décor tarp, which blocks sunlight. I happened to look up and see an object shining brightly in the sky. My first guess was that it was the moon, but after stepping out of the tarp, it was actually some sort of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two of them, flying apart at a distance and moving extremely slow. There was no roar of an engine in the air, and I could not see any wings. In a blue and clear sky, it looked like the aircraft had a type of mini cloud around it, or it was flying surrounded by clouds, but the sky was clear. It was also emitting an extremely bright light, enough to project enough shine like the moon. They eventually moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was 3/4 the size of a full moon estimated at 20 thousand miles up. The object was extremely bright and glowed with a light blue hue at the center and surrounded by bright yellow which left a trail of bright white. The object seemed big and very low to the surface of the earth. It seemed to travel slow for something that appeared to be pretty low. This was very similar to Halley&#39;s Comet. Which I remember viewing it for 3 to 5 minutes across the sky. This was very similar but only lasted 3 to 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

No “aircraft running lights” (green, red, or white). Partly cloudy, but light was between clouds and us. Was moving fairly fast, left no “trail”. No aircraft type noise. Traveled from north to south for less than (2) minutes, then simply disappeared. Did not fade, or grow dimmer. It was there, and then it was gone. We do live close to a local airport, and can easily identify aircraft (planes, helicopters) in night sky. This was not any type of aircraft lights that we have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They came from 440 area heading toward 540, moving up and vanishing into the clouds. The movement reminded one of candles or glow sticks attached to balloons, though the size seemed larger. A friend of mine and I were outside talking, and we saw them. Another person came into the condo complex who also saw the lights when we pointed them out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was almost like a loud “lawnmower” type sound not the sound of an aircraft.  Definitely loud.  I looked up in the sky and was in awe.  It was silver/aluminum looking in color,  one large white light on the underside and was definitely triangular in shape.  It was low and was in full view over our yard.  I ran to the front door and yelled for my husband and then ran back to view it.  It flew almost straight at me, but up where a small engine plane would fly.  It had two short “flaps” that went up vertical on the two back corners “like if you made a paper airplane and put little flaps on the corners. It had no wings.  By the time my husband got outside it was going higher and circling around.  It flew fast, very fast and went behind the trees across the street and looked like it was circling back by us when all of a sudden it curved the opposite di! rection and disappeared up into the clouds out of sight.  We live directly on the Ohio Turnpike(backyard edges it) very near exit 13 and also have State Route 43 and State Route 14 very nearby.  The sky was extremely clear and visibility was perfect.  There were two or three jets up above leaving jet streams, but this object left nothing behind and it was broad daylight.  I saw it very clearly.   I am a very reliable person to tell about this as I taught school for 28 years, have lived in the same home for 20 years, work at a church and do not smoke, drink or do drugs.  I did have my glasses on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be honest, I kept thinking “this thing has to be a remote control”.  But then I came to my senses that it was large, fast, flying high, and was not , could not be remote controlled once I saw it fly away up into the clouds and disappear a mile or so away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it on October 26th, 2009 at approximately 6:15 p.m.   My husband did not see it up close like I did, but he did watch it glide or fly across the sky and circle around and then disappear into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just looked like something that should not be able to fly and I cannot fathom where a pilot would be.  It did not have windows or such and was strange to look at.I was facing west and it disappeared northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Glancing upwards to get a closer look and maybe see another shooting star, to my surprise instead I saw a black triangle gliding southbound about 50 to 75 ft in the sky.  There were 3 circular lights on the bottom of the triangle which was equilateral in shape.  The 3 circles were glowing very dimly and were not radiating much light.  The Triangle was very dark in color and I would have totally missed it if it wasn’t for the shooting star.  I believe that the shooting star may have actually come out of the triangle shaped object, but I can’t be sure since it happened so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few other strange facts about what I witnessed:  The shooting star appeared to shoot sideways and even a little upward which I have never seen before with a shooting star.  Also the same night about 15-20 minutes later I saw two bright &#34;stars&#34; to the bottom left of the constellation Orion.  These stars seemed out of place and were pretty close to one another.  I tried keeping my eyes on the two stars but trees blocked my view since I was driving through a forested area.  Once I broke past the forested area the two stars were gone.  This all happened within a 30 second period from first noticing the stars and to them disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to think that someone else must have seen this too since I was not the only vehicle on the highway at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When looking up, there were two objects blinking in the sky.  After watching them for some time, we noticed different colored lights and at first glance appeared to be stationary.  After going inside for a camera the objects had moved out of sight but then reappeared.  The two objects were not close together, as if one ship, but some distance away from one another. The next morning a room mate stated he woke up with bright lights in his bedroom and the sound of someone scratching on the exterior wall of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pictures were taken and they revealed movement, including what looks to be a flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The flashes were seen for about 15 minutes (seen at very high altitude) and then disappeared. I took a look at the &#34;object&#34; with a 12x50 binoculars but I didn&#39;t saw a structure just a flash/strobe of light every 10 seconds. The night sky was clear, most of the stars were visible, no clouds nor aircraft close to it.<n>

I noticed what I thought was a big bird in the sky traveling from south to north. I thought to myself that was a really large bird. I stood up and noticed that there were two of them. Then I realized that each object had six lights, 3 on each side and the objects were triangular in shape and had rounded tips. They were very slow moving and made absolutely no sound at all. One of the objects was positioned slightly in front of the other. Then I notice that these objects where completely blocking my view of the stars in that particular area. The sky and stars in that area were distorted and then they suddenly disappeared. The whole event lasted about a minute long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have always been in love with the moon and the stars since I was a little girl but only recently has my mind been opened up to the idea that “we are not alone”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few times I have seen a “star” next to the moon. This “star” will be still for a few moments, and at first glance seems normal but I watched this star and compared it directly next to a rooftop. It will shoot straight up, then right, then down, pause, do a few “C” shaped turns and continue this, in no pattern that I have found. Different times I have witnessed other “stars” doing the same, some closer to Earth than others letting me see a red, blue and white flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I am aware, satellites orbit planets and do not move that quickly through space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another time, I was sitting on a bench across a river from a heavily wooded park.  Without warning the area was lit up by a bright blue-white light for only a few seconds.  It was too blinding to see where it came from but the direction of the lights was from the park, within the trees.  My friend who was sitting with me at the time also witnessed this but we never spoke of it again.  I did not feel that that experience might be relevant to other “sightings” until I read stories from other people describing the same events.<n>

I walked around to my living room window because I could see the TV through it and Dextor was on.  I looked up and noticed that the stars were very clear.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something moving, when I focused my eyes on the object I noticed a rectangular shaped craft moving silently with the long side being the leading edge.  It appeared to be two squares connected together with a faint dark green glow outlining the two squares. The light of the half-moon helped me make it out.  It didn&#39;t seem to have any bright running lights, it was very stealth like. It appeared to be very large, at least the size of a tennis court, but it&#39;s hard to judge size when it&#39;s in the sky, especially at night.  Being very surprised at what I was observing, I tried to track it, but after the object was obstructed from my view by the tree in my front yard, it was gone. I made several trips back out to my yard and looked up, but didn! &#39;t see anything else.<n>

It looked like an oval moving pretty slowly and low in the sky. It caught my attention pretty easily. It almost looked like it was headed towards the Airport which is pretty close to where I saw it. It has the ability to hover, not sure for how long but it did it a few times for about 10 seconds each time. It had many bright flashing lights, and they seemed to rotate around the craft. The colors varied from yellow, blue, green, red and purple. It was pretty far away but I could still see it clearly for the most part. It was a clear blue sky and it was all open area. The area has some woods but is mainly fields and clear land. I was inside my house and I saw it through the window, it must be a very silent moving craft because my dad had not seen it when I called him. He was taking a walk and he had no idea it was there until I told him about it. It was too far away to look like anything more than a tiny ! circle of light on the camera on my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After about 20 seconds or so watching, it came to a stop and headed the opposite direction slightly faster than it was traveling before.  This lasted about another 25 seconds or so when the object seemed to move in a zig zag making a small W pattern twice.  After that, the object made a U back in the opposite direction for a brief time before it disappeared for a couple seconds, returning in the same place half as bright, then disappearing for good.  The sky was cloudless and very clear.  The area is near an airport but i know that it was not a plane because of the way it moved.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were heading home from a weekend visit with relatives.  The kids were sleeping – the radio was on very low, and I was driving.  My wife was seated on front passenger seat of our van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we traveled on the highway through Bath, NY, at exactly 7:07 a.m., my wife and I observed an extremely bright light / object in the top right corner of the front window of our van – it immediately caught our attention due to the brightness of the light / object – the object was traveling southwest at a 45 degree angle towards the ground – approximately 3 to 5 thousand feet off the ground – the object was moving fast…we were unable to make out the shape of the object – the object emitted a tail of light behind it, due to! how fast it moved. At first we thought it was a shooting star, but it was moving too slow for that - but too fast for a plane. We thought the light/object was going to impact the ground - we were a little scared at that point.  The light/object then changed its course and traveled parallel to the ground – the light/object turned up the speed dramatically, began traveling in a 45 degree angle upward as it disappeared over a mountain range.  The sighting lasted approximately 8 seconds. We didn’t see the object again.<n>

10/24/09 23:20|Santa Rosa|CA|Light|20+ minutes|10 UFOs over Santa Rosa, California (six in a big dipper formation, four in a half circle)|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73022.html|69|ndxe200910| 10 UFOs over Santa Rosa, California (six in a big dipper formation, four in a half circle)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had trouble falling asleep on Saturday, October 24, 2009, and so around 11:30 pm, I just started looking up at the stars outside my bedroom window like I do occasionally whenever I can’t sleep. This night was different however, because I immediately noticed bright lights in the sky in an arrangement similar to the big dipper. My window faces east, so I was looking that direction. This link video footage of exactly what I saw, with a few minor differences:<n> <n><n> http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/7790/UFO_RUSSIA__SUMMER_2008_NEWS_BIG_DIPPER_FORMATION/<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like the formation in the video, the formation I saw had only two objects forming the handle, except the formation I saw had the handle tilted diagonally upward. Also, the formation I saw was staying pretty much stationary, with the exception of one of the objects (the lower object in the dipper handle which was sort of swaying back and forth, not in a dramatic way but ever so slightly, and it was this that caught my eye) and the only other difference is that the formation in the video seems to be more tightly packed in, and the formation I saw was a bit more spread out. All the objects I saw were dimming in and out, and the object that was swaying would occasionally flash a dark red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lot of things I witnessed are similar to the video like the altitude, the brightness and coloration, size, and of course, the formation itself. Off to the right of the dipper formation, were four objects in no particular order or formation that slowly moved together to form a crescent shape or half circle. During this time, the dipper formation stayed in place, dimming in and out. Eventually, the object at the bottom of the crescent began to flash wildly, first in it’s “natural” color, then in dark red and blue. It struck me as sort of like a morse code, or signal of some kind, and I assume it was “communicating” to the dipper formation, at which point I got spooked and went downstairs to make coffee as this was all a bit too much for me to handle. I’ve always been a skeptic about UFOs and this has pretty much shaken up my whole world view. I can no longer deny that UFOs exist. In the video link I provided, it appears that formation is regrouping into separate formations, ! and I can only assume that is the activity that I was witnessing, but I didn’t stay to witness the whole incident because I was pretty shaken, so I can’t say what eventually happened. When I worked up the courage to come back up to my bedroom and have a look out the window about a half hour later, both the dipper formation and half circle formation had gone, nowhere to be found.<n>

What clouds there were, were light in nature and sparse and could be seen at a height exceeding (approximately) 20 - 25,000 feet.  At approximately 8:35 PM, My two sons and I were driving southbound on Main street (n Crystal Lake) heading towards Rakow road when my oldest son (who was sitting in the front passenger seat of our minivan) pointed out that he was seeing some very strange lightening flashes. I told him that there shouldn&#39;t be an lightening as there was too few clouds and no rain ot severe weather at that time.  He then directed my attention to a small patch of semi-transparent clouds that were very high in the sky (as stated above).  From this small patch of cloud, bright/intense multi-colored lights could be observed flashing in a strobe-light-like fashion in what seemd like a definite pattern... there were blue, white, green lights and gold lights flashing v! ery quickly one after another and almost to the point (at times) of occuring simulaneously at times. the entire sky lit-up - but only where the small patch of clouds was, the light&#39;s did not flash far beyond the cloud patch - if at all.  As the ligth&#39;s flashed, the cloud became virtually transparent and the shape of an object could be seen. It was very large - especially considering the height it was estimated at being at and was long, thin, and cylindrical/cigar shaped.  We observed the flashing lights for approximately one to two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second to the last flash we observed, lit-up the entire cloud patch in bright white - making it completely transparent which allowed us to see a much clearer outline of the cylindrical/cigar shaped object itself!  The bright white flash stayed lit for approximately 5 - 7 seconds, which allowed us to see that the object was an orange-ish gold color and was several hundred feet long (on the low-end) and up to approximately 1000 feet long on the high-end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one last flash of white/gold light that we observed before the object vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day, my kids and I checked in with the Lake in the Hills Airport about what we had seen and to check if any one else had contacted them, and were told that there had been no other reports made on this incident.<n>

Some moved slowly across the sky, some moved very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also saw large white bands of light flashing across the sky in two different places for over 30 minutes witnessed by me and my mom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also chased 5 different larger aircraft flying very low under the clouds with red white and possibly blue?  blinking lights.  2 or 3 of the aircraft were V shaped with a possible tail.  The remaining ones had similar lights and were shaped more like a space shuttle.  They were so low I could see their shilouettes on a bright night. They all stayed at the low altitude and moved almost in a large circle in the sky moving so quickly like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.  These low flying aircraft made large noises following them from the sound barrier, much louder than a plane.  And they moved much faster than a plane.  I ran to get my mom and she saw all of the phenomenon too.  We finally came inside but the small far away crafts remained, as did the shooting white lights.  I still hear an occassional craft fly over as I type this.  I have never seen a UFO before nor have I seen any government planes or crafts that looked like this.  Some of the shapes perhaps moved together in formati! ons, it was hard to see.  I believe they did follow each other, and others moved in opposite directions than each other.   Very interesting.  I hope someone else saw this too but I&#39;m glad my mom saw it!  I know it&#39;s real now!<n>

The object remained steady at the same spot in the sky and I quickly started taking pictures of it.  I was also able to yell towards the house and both my wife and my daughter ran out and also were able to observe the object while I continued to take more pictures.  Throughout this whole process the object did not move from the location that it was first observed in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to take 26 pictures in RAW and 26 in JPEG before a group of clouds moved in and obscured the object from sight.  Eventually the clouds moved away, however the object was no longer visible in the sky once visibility was clear again.  Strangely enough the object was very similar in appearance to the previous object that I captured on October 11th of this year (as reported to the ufo center previously) except that this time it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Around 11:16pm, while having a conversation with my friends I had my head up slightly glancing at the sky. At first I thought I saw a shooting star, and excitedly told my friends, but the duration of the object was in the sky for about 5 seconds, and logically we ruled out the fact it was a shooting star. My two friends saw the last 3 seconds of the object before it went away. They said they saw it suddenly shifted to the right before it vanished. We ruled out that it was a jet or any human aircraft because of the speed it was traveling, no human aircraft could be going that fast. It looked like a shooting star but there was no tail or trail, it was as if the object was a big subtle orange/yellow light traveling through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The flight took off on time 7:25pm EST.  The weather was completely clear.  I was sitting in a window seat in front of the wing.  At approx 8:30pm EST I saw an light that I can only best describe as a &#34;Search light&#34; directly below me.  The light was a white light (nothing unusual) and it kept pace with an MD80 at crusing speed.  The light would go off completely for different amounts of time.  And stay on for different amounts of time.  There was no pattern.  The light was concentrated/focused in a tight beam sometimes and at other times a wide pattern.  The pattern was never circular or oval but at times square. I believe the source of the light to be very close to the ground.  It would sweep the ground sometimes, appearing to follow a road for example. The light would be more active in rural areas but did shine on buildings and populated areas.  At no time could I see any craft, no flashing/running lights.! I believe the American flight began crossing the Gulf of Mexico near Tallahassee.  The light paced the American flight for Approx 35 mins.  Approx 9:05pm EST when the American Flight began to cross the Gulf, I no longer saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IF the light was traveling at 500 KMH (The Crusing Speed of a commercial aircraft) It would appear as only a flash to someone on the ground.  The widest pattern appeared to be about 3 to 4 football fields.  The tightest pattern appeared to be less than one half of a football field.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My first thought was that it was a small plane or helicopter.  As we drove towards it, I pointed it out to my husband who now also saw it.  It was dark and there was some cloud coverage.  As we got closer, we noticed that there were 2 white lights that appeared to be in upper corners.  On the bottom there was a red light and a blue light.  The object appeared to be hovering.  It did not move as we drove past and I did not hear any noise other than our own vehicle.  I would estimate that it was about 300 feet to the right of the road.  It appeared to be bigger than a helicopter based on the distance between the lights, but no bigger than maybe two put together. We continued driving home about 2 miles, dropped off my mother-in-law and daughters and then drove back.  We did not see! anything, so we continued to drive in the direction we first came.  There were no lights in the sky at this time in any direction.  We are not sure what we saw, but know that it was not normal for an object of that size to hover in one place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked at my watch to clock the time of the thunder so I could tell how far away the storm might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later, I saw another flash of light in the same spot in the sky. Exactly one minute after that I saw the brightest flash of light, which lit up most of the sky. These flashes of light were blue and reddish in color. After that neither of us saw any more flashes of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There never was any thunder either.Right after these flashes of light me and boyfriend witnessed most of the street lamps on my street start to flicker a white light. All of these lights are orange in color under normal circumstances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 12:00 am my boyfriend left to go back home (which is about 5 miles away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> His roommate told him that most of the street lamps on their were flicker on an off and their lights had gone out. Even stranger, co-workers have said that they experienced electrical problems as well. My boyfriend&#39;s mother lost power at her house for close to 45 minutes after these strange flashes of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She also happens to live closer (to the south of where I live) to where we saw the flashes of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do NOT believe this to be lightning because the light was only coming from a small point in the sky and the flash never seemed to try to reach the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe the way this looked is to say that it looked like a giant transformer bursting in the middle of the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/22/09 21:30|Morden, Surrey (UK/England)||Triangle|20 minutes|Cluster of orange lights over Morden UK|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72984.html|89|ndxe200910| Cluster of orange lights over Morden UK<n> <n><n> <n><n> I received a phone call from my partners best friend about 20 minutes ago [it is now 22:00hrs] who lives locally to me asking if I had witnessed UFO&#39;s this evening.  He was extremely panicky in his voice and was running down the road at the time of the initial call as he and his partner believed that a UFO had landed on the green at the end of his road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> n his panic he mentioned &#39;the peckham ufos from 20th october&#39; which can be viewed on youtube.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left my house and went outside to see if I could see anything but I couldnt, bear in mind he lives about half a mile from us a little down hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked that he call me back when he returns home.  His return call approx 10 minutes ago I took the following information.  Apologies if this information is a bit lacking, i felt as if I was interrogating the poor bloke!  Before I start please let it be known that I asked on 3 occassions wether it could have been &#39;chinese lanterns&#39; (especially as there appears to be some kind of party going on in Morden Park which is quite local) but he swears this is not the case.  This is my assumption.  There was absolute panic in his voice, knowing him for years I have never heard him like this before.  We don&#39;t even talk normally on the phone apart from pleasantries as he is my partner&#39;s friend.  He even asked me if this could be linked to 2012 end of times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fascinated by UFOs and the 2012 end of times and other &#39;things&#39; and so he chose to call me, by which im flattered but slightly freaked as we have not discussed 2012 at all.  We have discussed UFOs though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway what he told me is exactly as I have written down and as follows...<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7 orange objects triangular he witnessed one similar object on 20th October 2009 (the date of the Peckham sighting) 1 object came very low over their house disc shaped flying over the Rosehill area silent and made no noise not flying high seemed as low as the school building opposite their house 7 witnessess including his partner and brother what appears to helicopters flying around [we live half a mile away and could not hear helicopters outside as we would expect] first sighting was at 9.30pm there was flashing lights almost like lightening and not from planes all over the sky the lowest 2 craft were disc shaped and as they passed extremely low over his house the lights went off but then as the craft passed over the house the lights returned as the craft passed over the house they were black and triangular  I have all of this written down should it be needed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I promised I would report this.  I believe it probably was chinese lanters but a few bits niggle at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have reported on here before and am of sane mind as is my friend and his partner and brother.  I do not know who the other witnesses were.<n>

I can see it glowing through the trees in neighbors backyard. To high in sky to be lights and to bright, quiet and big to be a plane. It appeared to be sickle shaped or boomerang shaped. I drove around to make sure it wasn&#39;t the moon and like I said no moon tonight. Object was no where to be found in the sky. Looked as if it was getting lower, but when I drove around to see if anything resembled this huge object, there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My Fiancé said to me look at the moon, it looks like a smiley face. While walking down the sidewalk the moon was right in front of us. Then all of a sudden I look up and under the moon there was this bright light and it was pulsating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to her, that looks weird. The light would get brighter and then darker but not completely turning out. I looked at other lights in the sky to compare and they were blinking on and off, not up and down like a dimmer switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also while looking at this it seem like it was changing color. It was moving slowly in a straight line across the sky in the south east. Then it came to a complete stop for a second or two and then started moving again. Then lost sight of it behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was weird to me because I never seen something like this in the sky pulsating, moving slowly, changing color and stopping and going. Don’t know but it was sure strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I got to the stand early and it was still very dark.  The sky was filled with stars.  I observed a light moving west to east across the sky.  My first thoughts was that it was a high flying plane but I realized it was moving much to fast for a plane that high up.  It also did not display any flashing lights which is common when you see a plane at night.  I picked up my 10x50 binoculars and focused in on the object and was surprised to see that it appeared to be a clear orb with white lights encircling the whole edge of the object.  The lights did not flash and I observed no colored or flashing lights of any kind on the object.  It disappeared in about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
10/22/09 03:15|Sweet Home|OR|Other|40 Seconds|I dont know what it was, it was like a darker fog surrounded by the lighter fog, then it... blew away. There was no wind that night.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72969.html|93|ndxe200910| I dont know what it was, it was like a darker fog surrounded by the lighter fog, then it... blew away. There was no wind that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home from a friend’s house. It was late. There was a bear sighting earlier that evening, which is rare. I’ve lived here 8 years and I have never heard about any bears coming into city limits. I decided to walk home anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pretty damn paranoid most of the way. I did not want to run into any bears so I kept my eyes open a little bit more then usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways… when I got home I grabbed my keys out of my pocket and walked up the ramp, I triggered the security light.  I knew it would happen so I didn’t pay it any attention.  I got to the door and put the keys in and I heard our neighbors dog come out barking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out and for second I thought I saw some random guy standing over by the fence where the dog was just kind of chilling there, not looking my way.  I let it go went back to unlocking the door but something wasn’t right.  I looked back and the dude was still there only this time it looked like he was looking back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the door open looked inside cause the T.V. was on, looked back and he was gone but it looked like a trail went from where he was up into the fog.  I was freaked out.  And then up in the air off to the right of my vision it looked like a thicker section of the fog just kind of blew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a light fog but I swear it was thick fog in that spot one moment and then it was like the rest of the fog. It looked like a gust of wind blew that part away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew the guy chilling over by the fence could have just been anybody. That can be explained but the way the fog was thick and then it wasn’t… like the thick fog moved away through the light fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise other then rain, it wasn’t windy either, not even a breeze. I am creeped out more then I have been my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if this sight is official or if anything taken seriously is investigated or whatever. All I know is I can’t explain what the hell happened with the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told you about the story as best I could and as short as I could so you would take me seriously. I thought you should know I was already a little paranoid that night, and it was late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, a section of the fog in the sky was thicker then the lighter fog around it… then it blew away and then that section was the same as the rest of the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m going to every legitimate looking sight I find and telling them. I know what I saw, and it was not natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What you do with the info is your business.<n>

We saw a few nice meteors, then my friend points out a satellite.  As soon as I see it drifting across Orion, it stops at the feet of the constellation.   I immediately tell my friend, this is no satellite.  We discuss what it could be for about three minutes, till it began to move again.  It drifted, dropped, darted to the lift and the right, came back to stationary, and generally danced around like a bumble bee.  Once I was sure of what we were seeing, we grabbed a few more witnesses.  At one point, the craft moved up to Orion&#39;s right shoulder and sat there.  My friend and I were afraid we had lost it, until it started to move up and down, over and over again: waving Orion&#39;s arm at us.  It had to be within 15,000 feet, because I could make out a shape, and distinguish colors of light that it flashed: red, blue, green, yellow, and white.  They wer! e brighter than Orion&#39;s belt, twinkled, and were distinguishable by a haze or glow it emitted. Several planes entered the area but stayed far away from the lights.  The night was super clear, just a sliver of a crescent moon, and not a cloud in the sky. By the end of the night, I had spotted three more disk shaped objects, two were moving in unison. Then there was one large rectangular thing with a round front end with a strange pattern of lights on it, it was much larger than the saucers as well.  I went to bed at 3:30, and they were still there, the one I saw originally at the feet of Orion was no longer distinguishable, but was a tiny bright white dot in the atmosphere. I will never forget that night, and will never deny what it was that I saw.<n>

At first I thought it was a plane with alot of lights. Then I noticed the lights seperating.It looked like a plane ontop of a plane. Then I noticed that both objects were triangel. One had three white lights in front,a red light in back. The other on had two red lights and one big flashing light in the front with a red flashing light in the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one that was on top and seperated from the bottom one took off to the left so fast it was gone in a blink. I pulled off the road to watch the other one still in sight it was standing still. Then in a matter of 30sec it was clear to the south headed toward a town called Abingdon, Illinois.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont beleive in UFOs,bur what I saw didnt look like planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was pink/purple-ish and had a large hole in it.  It was leathery to the touch and the clear gel was like soft gummybear. In the gel was a form that looked skeletal.  The lower left looked like a skull of some sort (to me) and the rest looked like a body form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried freezing it for awhile it was okay and about a week or so went by and it just deteriated and turned to goop.

These lights were not stationary at any point nor were they ever pretending to be stars. They flew PAST us. They made no noise. They came from seemingly nowhere both times, one light at a time. Perhaps the same light visited us both times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night my friend and I were at some weird place we came across called X-9 Ranch... it&#39;s privately owned land within the Saguaro National Park right by the Rincon Mountains. That night we had two very-low flying bright lights visit us -once to say hello and once as we were leaving. The light was completely silent, the object itself was indistinguishable but I believe it was just pure light. One solid bright light like a candle, with smaller flashing colors in or around it. It flew a bit quirky and nervously, as though it was drawn to us against its will. I think the attention we were giving it made it feel uncomfortable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light came from the south in the direction of the city. Though we were both looking in that direction when it appeared, neither of us saw where the light originated from nor did we see it approaching from a very far distance - it just became &#34;there&#34;. When this first light came I flashed a high-beam flashlight into the sky (the type that beams through the air and can be seen for miles) at it which caused it to start fly/floating a bit drunkardly. It tried to veer itself away from the B-line on which it was coming towards us. Then it just tried to act cool and fly smoothly, attempting to maintain a more android flashing sequence, floating away like it had not notice us.... but in a &#34;looking out of the corner of it&#39;s eyes&#34; at us sort of way. But it was too late for his ruse! He/it had already been busted out and discovered as some sort of an intelligent life form as it responded to our stimuli (both physical, i.e. flashlight; and mental/verbal, i.e. thought and verbal! command/request).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second light appeared later coming from the north. My friend and I had both agreed it was time to get going. I turned around from my view of the city to look back at the mountain right behind us and coming up from behind the mountain over the top came an identical light to the one from earlier. I said &#34;Look, they came to say goodbye!&#34; My friend turned around and said &#34;Whoa, where the hell did that come from?&#34; I was pleased and we both watched it as it floated/flew awkwardly towards us and jumped a bit in its flight path with the small quickness of a firefly. It was an entity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oct 20 12:00 am - 6:00 am Oct 21/2009  They perch over the mountains and I drive up to them. Get close to the basin of the mountain and they&#39;ll give you a private show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night before the previous incident the same friend and I were again late-night hiking, this time around the Catalina mountain area. It was a man-made hiking trail and an easy one at that, however it surrounds it&#39;s hikers on either side with fencing lined with dense bushes on the left to separate the businesses/housing area and on the right... nothing but desert and barbed-wire fencing beginning where the width of the hiking trail ends and no-mans-land begins. This desert shrubbery was particularly unnerving in an exciting sort of way because there are very dense desert trees, bushes, shrubs and so forth mixed with cacti and all sorts of hiding spots that some sort of stalking predatory animal could come out of.... You could just feel it... I sensed we were in &#34;Cat Country&#34;. I told my friend the vibe I was getting and he agreed it could very well be. Never the less we journeyed on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We found a little hidden rock area to chill and watch the stars. I had noticed while we were on the trail two aliens positioned over the mountain. (I just call them aliens, a.k.a UFOs). I had my eye on them and went back to the trail to go see them while my friend stayed on the rocks. I watched them and they were the typical &#34;posers&#34; in the sky; trying to look like stars but completely having trouble staying still and they were VERY responsive to thought. I confirmed that those were my aliens for the night and went back to chill with my friend on the rocks. Before long we heard the screams of some sort of animal - probably a bob cat or a mountain kitty - and we reckoned it was time to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we left I stopped my friend on the trail and said &#34;Look. See those two aliens?&#34; pointing towards them right above the mountain&#39;s top horizon. He said &#34;Yeah I do...&#34; I said &#34;Watch, does it look like they are moving?&#34; The aliens began to wiggle out of their stationary positions in the sky. I moved my arms, like a conductor of an orchestra, and directed them which way to go in the sky. I would lift up my arm and motion to the right, they would fly that way in the sky in tandem. To the left, and the same. Figure 8 too. I said &#34;Are you seeing this?&#34;. He said he did. He was astonished and quiet and humble. He took on the same calm awe that I had seen in my other friend who experienced the same phenomenon with me the first time over the same mountains about a month earlier. They just watched in quiet and seemed accepting of it and me, the crazy girl who thinks she is an alien who brings them to the mountains to play with UFOs.

I said &#34;Look, they came to say goodbye!&#34; My friend turned around and said &#34;Whoa, where the hell did that come from?&#34; I was pleased and we both watched it as it floated/flew awkwardly towards us and jumped a bit in its flight path with the small quickness of a firefly. It was an entity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oct 20 12:00 am - 6:00 am Oct 21/2009  They perch over the mountains and I drive up to them. Get close to the basin of the mountain and they&#39;ll give you a private show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night before the previous incident the same friend and I were again late-night hiking, this time around the Catalina mountain area. It was a man-made hiking trail and an easy one at that, however it surrounds it&#39;s hikers on either side with fencing lined with dense bushes on the left to separate the businesses/housing area and on the right... nothing but desert and barbed-wire fencing beginning where the width of the hiking trail ends and no-mans-land begins. This desert shrubbery was particularly unnerving in an exciting sort of way because there are very dense desert trees, bushes, shrubs and so forth mixed with cacti and all sorts of hiding spots that some sort of stalking predatory animal could come out of.... You could just feel it... I sensed we were in &#34;Cat Country&#34;. I told my friend the vibe I was getting and he agreed it could very well be. Never the less we journeyed on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We found a little hidden rock area to chill and watch the stars. I had noticed while we were on the trail two aliens positioned over the mountain. (I just call them aliens, a.k.a UFOs). I had my eye on them and went back to the trail to go see them while my friend stayed on the rocks. I watched them and they were the typical &#34;posers&#34; in the sky; trying to look like stars but completely having trouble staying still and they were VERY responsive to thought. I confirmed that those were my aliens for the night and went back to chill with my friend on the rocks. Before long we heard the screams of some sort of animal - probably a bob cat or a mountain kitty - and we reckoned it was time to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we left I stopped my friend on the trail and said &#34;Look. See those two aliens?&#34; pointing towards them right above the mountain&#39;s top horizon. He said &#34;Yeah I do...&#34; I said &#34;Watch, does it look like they are moving?&#34; The aliens began to wiggle out of their stationary positions in the sky. I moved my arms, like a conductor of an orchestra, and directed them which way to go in the sky. I would lift up my arm and motion to the right, they would fly that way in the sky in tandem. To the left, and the same. Figure 8 too. I said &#34;Are you seeing this?&#34;.  He said he did. He was astonished and quiet and humble. He took on the same calm awe that I had seen in my other friend who experienced the same phenomenon with me the first time over the same mountains about a month earlier. They just watched in quiet and seemed accepting of it and me, the crazy girl who thinks she is an alien who brings them to the mountains to play with UFOs. I have great friends. lol.<n>

In Brookings Oregon at Harris beach look out Parking lot on top overlooking the entire ocean  The sky was clear as a bell. I took a picture of what I thought was a bright star or rogue satellite.  It was pretty so I took a total of 6 pictures, 4 that I deleted at the time because I thought they were just bad pictures.  Tonight I noticed in the two remaining pictures. a Long, square, cigar shaped &#34;thing&#34;. its not really cigar its kinda boxed but in irregular not so perfectly even on all sides.  The thing covered the bright object I was aiming at to take a picture of in the first place. Anyway I dont know what to think of the pictures I am not an expert photographer, nor a ufo buff. maybe its something, maybe its not.  The odd t! hing that I noticed their were no lights, flashes, glowing etc.  The norm by ufo sighting of all sorts shapes and sizes. But the creepy thing that disturbs me. just What if &#34;aliens&#34; are smarter than to use lights but absolute darkness.<n>

It was hovering in the sky, then it became very bright (still blue/green) and decended straight down - vertically - and dropped below the tree line.  This was not a shooting star - there was no trail and it did not shoot across the sky. It decended straight down vertically like an elevator.

I had to put my head up against the window which was appox. 4 inches down to observe this light.  The color of this pink light startled me.  With no reference point (it was dark) it was hard to estimate the size and the height of this light in the air.  I slowed my truck down from 35mph to about 5mph to stop and get out and take a closer look.  As I justed about stopped, the pink light emitted sparks then disappeared.  The pink circular light was moving east to west almost directly above me, no sound was emitted either.  This lasted 6-8 seconds.<n>

I was inside my home looking out the windows of a french door that is in the rear of my home. The view is looking directly south. The meteor shower was being observed from west to east across my back yard. The night sky was crystal clear with no clouds being visable. I had been watching the shower approximately 15 minutes when I noticed a gun metal grey object stationary in the sky. It was just below a bright star. It stood out in the clear sky.I would say it looked more like a plate. As soon as I noticed the object, it accelerated in a straight line due south at an incredible speed and was out of site in a second. I did not hear any sound as I was indoors. There were no lights on the object. I was stunned by the speed of this object. All I can say is that I saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it began to change shape like a white inner ball with intermittent red and blue lights forming a triangle around it. I woke up my son to see this object. It moved gracefully up and down and from side to side. I put new batteries in my digital camera and went out on the porch to try and photograph it. Snapped one shot not catching the object and the camera flashed the battery symbol and went off.Then is when I noticed what appeared o be two lights on the bottom of the object. My cell phone camera would not pick up the object. My inside cat and dog were going crazy! We watched this for over 25 minutes and then I went to get my husbands binoculars and when I found them and came back to the window it was gone. T! here was no noise at all; the whole time. Then my pets went back to normal and I watched the rest of the night but seen nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Every night we go outside to play hackey sack.  Tonight, this is what we heard &amp; saw.  It started with a rumbling, sounded like a plane coming over our house, we live beside a military base, we looked up. An odd shaped flying object went over our heads. It was very low to the ground for any aircraft. It had 4 lights; a red light in the front, green, blue, and yellow lights on the back of it in a row. WE watched it go a few blocks behind our house and stop. It hovered for quite a bit...it probably still is. While we were staring at it I took a video.  Two more flying obects came behind us. We turned around when we heard the rumbling again.  They went in opposite directions diagonally. We saw a brown object come flying below the unidentified &#34;aircraft&#34; in a shooting star-like motion and disappear.  The one to our left went a few blocks, same distance as the first, turned 90 degrees, lowered behind the treeline and hovered. We c! ould see the lights flickering through the branches. The other to our right kept going quite a distance and turned left towards the other two then disappeared. After a couple of minutes, we heard the rumbling...AGAIN. I ran to the top of the stairs on our deck and only saw what I thought was an airplane. But, as it went on...it quickly turned it&#39;s nose up to the sky and SHOT UPWARDS. This one only had a red light. Possibly the same shape.<n>

Towards the end of the day we were going to hunt Quail and then head through the back country to visit a friend in Reno which was a good distance south before heading back to the Bay Area (CA).  We decided to take a back route through a network of well maintained roads crossing from California into Nevada using HWY 299 that turns into a smooth dirt road at the Nevada border then on to forest road 8A to the 447 in Nevada.  My wife was tired and wanted to rest so I got out of the car to stretch my legs and hiked up a small hill 4-5 miles into Nevada.  One of my favorite things to do at night is hike.  I am an experienced woodsman and was just wanting to sit still on the ridge and listen to groups of coyotes howl back and forth a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the car from my viewpoint.   We were parked right near a roadway sign (I think it was a &#34;turns ahead&#34; style yellow triangular sign on the left side of the r! oad facing west).   After listening to the howls on this relatively still night for at least 15 minutes, I noticed a light in the sky to the east through the pass.  It was hard to gauge distance since there were no trees in the foreground for perspective.  I could go to the exact spot and point to where it was though.  The light was distant.  That&#39;s all I can say about perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started off as a still light.  I noticed it as I was scanning for my favorite constellations (It was much brighter than Polaris) and then I saw it move, I thought it might be a plane but there were no flashing indicators and it did not move like a plane or jet.  After a few seconds it shot up at incredible speed.  I am ex military.  My jaw dropped.  I knew that it was no conventional aircraft that I am aware of. It descended in a staircase type fashion at times, then would shoot upwards and make multiple maneuvers such as a rectangle (at speeds that would render a pilot unconscious due to g-fo! rce effects).  It seemed like it was testing it&#39;s ability/mane! uverability.  There was no particular pattern to it. The light changed colors from blue through the spectrum pulsing.  I watched it for what seemed like forever.  Then I went down to the car to see if it was visible from that angle and it was.  I woke up my wife and she watched it as well.  It made no sound at all. I estimate it&#39;s distance at least 2 miles away nearest &#34;town&#34; is a ghost town called &#34;Vya&#34; In the very northwestern corner of Nevada.  Approximate location of object is as follows:  Long./Lat.41&amp;#730;36&#39;11.37 N - 119&amp;#730;55&#39;20.7&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Time was approximately 2030 hours, CDT, US.  My attention was drawn to the clear night sky by the noise/flashing lights of what were obviously military jets, about a half dozen of them, very high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Military jets are a common sight here, originating usually from a major Air Force base about 70 miles east of where I live.  Daytime flight training activity is pretty heavy usually.  However, nighttime military activity is rare, especially a half dozen jets that seemed to be canvasing many miles of the sky—they were visible essentially horizon to horizon, passing overhead and making broad, sweeping maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was curious so I sat down and watched.  As I was watching one jet, going west to east, approximately 70 degrees from horizontal, a nearly linear pattern of amber-to-red lights appeared about 50 degrees from horizontal, south-southeast.  There were about a half dozen of them that rapidly ramped up in brightness (not instantaneous).  They were stationary and maintained a fixed pattern, no variation in relative position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pattern was about thumb’s width at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a slight warbling in intensity of most of these lights, similar to distant lights on a hot night-heat distortion.  It was a similar effect, but I’m not saying that is what it was because it was a chilly night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds of visibility the lights faded about half as fast as they had ramped up—about three seconds to completely black out.  They did not fade all at once, but in a random pattern.  Of course, there was no noise except from the distant jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later there were two or three individual lights that appeared, then disappeared, in about the same manner.  These were east-southeast at about 30 degrees from horizontal.  These were not all stationary while they were visible, and were visible only one at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside, called my parents, and asked dad to walk outside (we live only about 30 yards apart), which he did and he later said he saw one of the lights.  I’m not sure he did.  From the direction he said he was looking he could not have seen what I was seeing east-southeast, but he could have be observing similar lights further to the west which I would not have seen because I was watching the east-southeast lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The canvasing activity of the jets continued for as long I was willing to watch, about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the video I have seen of the Phoenix Lights phenomenon, this event was quite similar in the way the lights ramped up, warbled in intensity, and faded out.  In fact, these could very well have been flares, which was the “official explanation” of the Phoenix event.  All I can say is if these were flares someone is damn good at placing a group of 6 and having them appear to be “tied together” on a structure or separate and holding a rock-solid pattern for several seconds.<n>

A minute or so later (time is an estimate) I saw them again to the right of where they were before.  A minutes after that I saw them to the left of where they had been originally.  Then about 5 minutes later I saw them once more to the far right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each time they were lined up horizontally.  They were pretty close to the ground.  That&#39;s how they looked anyhow.  It they weren&#39;t they would have had to be very, very big.  Standing, my head was at about a 45 degree angle looking up at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could feel the electrical current in my heart all night long.  I had a really really bad nights sleep that night.  Not afraid, but just somehow bad feeling.   I didn&#39;t really attribute this to the lights at the time but it was so puzzling to me since the 3 nights before I had some of the most peaceful nights&#39; sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked everyone I could find the next day if they had seen or heard of such a thing before or had seen anything that night but no one was able to tell me anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure anyone else was on the lake that night. I don&#39;t think that anyone was.<n>

The witness went to report the sighting to other members of the house, returned back in just a few brief seconds,  The object was no longer spotted anywhere in the vicinity.<n>

It/they were traveling very fast and absolutely NO noise, as it continued flying North to South towards Lake Ontario.  The lights were an odd blue/grey/white, like they were perhaps phasing in and out or maybe a color just barely visible in the human color spectrum.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before.<n>

We stared trying to decide if maybe it was a star or satelite.  It started to move up very fast and side to side at fast speeds. At this point, we knew it was neither.  It was a bright white light with a faint blue light. We stared at it for 10 minutes in disbelief watching it move around irradically.  It eventually dropped down out of our sight.  We are not sleeping well tonight!<n>

Yet, after 15 minutes or so of watching it was clear this was no planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light would blink in and out. it would go dark and vanish completely for two to three seconds every couple minutes or so. i was very interested so i continued watching it. after about 25 minutes of watching this phenomena, the light blinked 3 times in rapid succession and on the fourth it stayed dark and never came back. From now on I&#39;ll be doing more night sky watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He saw a round, moonlike object in the distant sky (nothern direction). The object looked like the moon, but was about 4 times the size of a distant moon. Some round light-like pulses started to emit from the object in circular fashion.  The object then split into two similar shaped objects, with the same pulses emitting from both. It started to move very fast off into the distance. He called the South African Weather service in Pretoria and they informed him that they had a similar call reporting the same objects just a few minutes before he made his call. The suggested he call metereological services tomorrow, their time.<n>

Not long after he also witnesses a &#34;quiet&#34; American born fighter jet fly above head. In a panic he calls my cousin and aunt telling them of the incident. Well instead of waiting for my dad to come and pick them up to &#34;come and see for themselves&#34; my cousin and aunt go on their own mission knowing that UFO&#39;s do not stay around for long. Driving on 96 away from white bear lake my aunt and cousin recall an even more tragic side of the story in which an extremely bright white light hovers in the sky and suddenly as they are gazing upon the white light they see several lights burst away from this light and then the bright light suddenly is nonexistent .My aunt believes she saw an apparent UFO crash my dad be! lieves he did not see the UFO&#39;s themselves but instead he saw several helicopters and the obvious jet plane that flew above him in the sky.

The time must have been around 19:45 -20:00 pm and the skies were quite clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the washing line, by shear chance I noticed 2 faint halos in the sky, which for a second I thought was just a halo/or blur around a star or light. There was a large circular (not oval) halo with a smaller circular halo within the larger one. The 2 halos were extremely faint and I had to focus very hard to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, scared to bits, I ran inside the house to call my brother to see this – just in case I was going crazy or seeing things. When we came outside again the halos had moved somewhat, and my brother too had to focus very hard to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside again to call my girlfriend, (who was in the bedroom on the other side of the house), and when we came outside for the third time the Halo’s had moved again and after about seven seconds it was not visible anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what I saw, but the 2 circles that I saw were invisible, i.e.: you could see the sky and stars inside/behind the 2 halo’s, whatever it was it was invisible or transparent. It is only due to the faint rings/halo’s around the 2 circles that I was able to see it. It also appeared to be nearby i.e.: it wasn’t in the distant atmosphere, or in space as such, like the stars. It seemed quite nearby. However I’m not sure about the distance as it’s quite deceiving at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not take any pictures or recordings, but they would not have been visible on camera anyways. I can however re-draw, illustrate them quite accuratly, as I my occupation requires me to pay extreme attention to detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can anyone explain this, or tell me that this is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer skies at night, and I should not worry. Or did I really see an unidentified flying object, and should look out for more? Or . . . .<n>

At 4 in the morning my mom wakes up to go to school. Because Milwaukee has laws about parking on certain sides of the street my mom asked me to go check on my brother&#39;s car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was parked on the correct side of the street so I start walking back to the house. As I&#39;m walking back I take a glance at the night sky, always a beautiful sight with the clouds illuminated by the stars and moon in my opinion. I saw something completely different though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 200 feet up (from what I can estimate) a yellow circle appeared. It was somewhat fuzzy and opaque. When I say appear I mean it slowly materialized, at first, transparent, then getting more solid-like. It also seemed to be flat, so it wasn&#39;t a sphere, I don&#39;t think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the middle of this yellow circle a small craft appeared. One moment there was just a yellow circle. The next, the craft was there. It was circle shaped since it was against the yellow circle I couldn&#39;t make out many details other than that it was dark in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The yellow circle then began to fade again just as it had appeared. Growing more transparent aside from more solid. As the yellow circle was fading the small craft began lighting up. I didn&#39;t have my glasses so I can only surmise at a few lights that lit up along it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then accelerated suddenly and flew south. It made no noise to accelerate and no noise while in flight. Also, no visible means of flying (no engine exhaust, etc).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Eventually it started moving very slowly and then picked up in speed until it went out of view and I lost it due to being on the opposite end of a huge building and in the middle of working anyway.  Later in the night when I was done working around 1:30AM me and my coworker went up on the roof and he said he &#34;Hey what&#39;s that?&#34; and pointed but I couldn&#39;t figure out where he was pointing and by the time I walked back to where he was to see where he was pointing, which was only a matter of seconds, it was gone.  He said he saw some kind of diamond shaped object that was moving like a plane that was dark orange and had an orange glow to it and left a trail and disappeared along with it&#39;s trail as it moved into the aura of the city lights.  I could of tried to take a picture of it with my camera on! my phone had I of seen it in time but unfortunately this wasn&#39;t possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The area we live in is a dark area in New Hampshire away from city lights/other light pollution.  We were driving on the road, headed southwest.  It was a fairly clear night and up in the sky, almost exactly overhead, but not quite (since I was able to see it out of the windshield) I saw two fairly bright red dots.  They looked like stars but clearly were not, as they were a red to orange color.  They were spaced apart, maybe the length of a 12 inch ruler if one were to hold it out at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I (a college educated stock broker) at first thought what I was seeing was seeing were airplanes, but both dots were stationary.  After about a minute, one of the dots abruptly disappeared.  The other dot stayed but slowly faded away to nothing.  I am not sure how long they were in the sky, we saw them only a minute, but they could have been there before (we had only just turned onto the road and saw them nearly immediately).  My wife (a college educated teacher) saw them as well.  My first thought was possible military flares, but we don’t have much military activity in this area of New Hampshire.  Since we were in the car, we were not able to hear if there was any noise accompanying the lights.<n>

A friend and myself were sitting in her back yard and I was starring off into the night sky &amp; stars.  Before i know it i see a blue &amp; purple anomaly in the sky at warp speed.  I screamed to my friend, trying to point it out to her.  She missed it.  I was convinced what i saw was OUT OF THIS WORLD &amp; Nothing i have EVER seen in my life. it moved at speed a plane could not have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THEN, About 3 to 5 minutes after seeing that first one, my friend yelled my name and said look!!  look in the sky!!  What i saw was something that was wayyyyyy closer then the one i saw before, and did not have the same colorful lightings as the other. BUT was JUST as strange.  It was a upside down V in the sky with what looked to be circles underneath the object on the lines of upside down V. It seemed so near to us, it also seemed to be moving slow motion at first, almost hovering now that i think about. Then before i knew it, it was gone,! at a speed UNRECOGNIZABLE. I also MUST add that this upside down V was SILENT, it made absolutley no sound. I also must say this, i saw what seemed to be sometime other man made plane in the sky around where i seen these two UFO&#39;s. Which i do belive were some goverment planes either keeping a eye or studying these objects. They know what and when something is in the sky. The goverment plane theory is just the conspiracist side of me coming out, but i wouldn&#39;t doubt it for a second. BUT I KNOW WHAT I SAW IN THE SKY THAT NIGHT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my story.

It disappeared (burned out, like a meteorite) after traveling about 20 degrees (that is, assuming 180 degrees from horizon to horizon, it traveled a fraction of that).  There were no sparks or a tail, just a bright green glow as if from a roman candle.  I was in farm country and there were no houses nearby.

We sat admiring our work while we both smoked a cigarette.  I was talking to her and looking up at the stars as it was a beautiful clear crisp night.  I noticed a brightly lit object approaching at high speed from the north.  I kept looking trying to figure out what it was.  At first it kind of looked like a big white bird gliding through the air with light from below reflecting off of it.  As it got closer I realized that it was not a bird.  I immediately told my girlfriend to look and she spotted it right away. We both watched it fly from north to south at a very high rate of speed. It was a bright white light, kind of chevron shaped. At times it kind of looked like 2 chevron shapes but the whole time as only one unit.  As it headed south it took a slight, but very noticeable, left turn to the southeast and then a right turn back to the south.  It ! was hard to judge the altitude of the craft but it looked to be maybe 10,000 feet or higher.  I have seen many satellites during my career as a pilot and for sure this was not a satellite, it was low and moved across the horizon much faster than an orbiting object.  Also, the object was very visible and large with a distinctive shape, not just a star size as a satellite appears.  The speed was definitely super sonic/hyper sonic.  I saw it the whole time from a small light to the north until it disappeared out of sight to the south.  The whole incident lasted maybe 10 to 12 seconds so it was moving fast!   There was absolutely no sound at all, I listened very close for a couple minutes after it had passed for any sort of sound trailing behind it and there was none.  The exact time was 9:41pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned, I am a professional pilot.  I am a pretty good judge of speed and altitude.  In my opinion this was not a military aircraft as it was traveling much too fast, was brightly lit and there was no trailing sound.  I’m pretty sure military aircraft, unlike civilian aircraft, are allowed to travel supersonic speeds over the continental US; however, this was at lower altitude and over a major metro area.   I know there is an air force base in central Missouri and if someone were to check I’m sure that supersonic speeds are not allowed in the area.<n>

Upon leaving the hospital I noticed a ball of light in the sky. You can see by the time I entered that it was about 7:35 pm or so just before day turns to night. I observed the object fixed in the sky. There was no sound or movement which is what struck me the most. It was a blue color that did shine very bright the starts had not yet appeared in the sky so I could dismiss that very quickly. I stared at the object for many moments till I finally had to leave to go fill a rx for my son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ended up at the pharmacy with the object in sight the whole time while at the pharmacy I allowed my wife to go fill it for me so I could watch this object. Moments later the light seemed to have released a 2nd light from the initial craft that was much smaller than the first. It seemed to be lowering it down from the primary craft. It was also glowing but more so a clear light. Then off in the distance I noticed a plane moving toward the object. Then glanced back to the ufo and both lights began to dim until they were no longer visible to the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local news would have us beleive this to be a weather baloon but it did not move at all or change its position and this does not explain the 2nd object I viewed either. there were many photos taken and many eye witnesses to this event including the ones I named along with my supervisor and co-workers. I have a photo I can text message to you if you like. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME<n>

If the center of a clock were our location, and 12 O&#39;clock was dead north, the object was north northwest in appx the 11 O&#39;clock direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was quite large for a distant object, roughly 4mm of size in appearance and circular. Incredibly bright and white, it was more intense in brightness than the intensity of the streetlamps on the street below. It gave off no amount of light to the ground or area, the idea is simply to describe the relative brightness and intensity of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be at a great distance, and was no more than white light. There was no way to determine any sort of object detail with the amount of distance, but the size and brightness was utterly striking. It was holding dead still relative to a building&#39;s roofline below it (simply used to reference). It initially appeared to be an incredibly large and bright star to the observers, however it then began acting very strangely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While continuing its perfectly dead hold, a small light resembling the size and intensity of an aircraft warning light (viewed at great distance), left it. The smaller light exited perfectly from the center and bottom of the large light and had appx 1/2 the intensity of brightness and only a small dot of size, much smaller than the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This small light moved slowly and perfectly downward with zero flashing from either object and perfectly steady light and movement (no stuttering or jumping). It had the appearance of a falling flare on a parachute in descent speed, however over the 10 or so seconds of fall there was zero lateral movement. From the original object to its lowest point, the distance was likely 2 or 3 degrees between objects. The smaller light then stopped perfectly still and hung dead still. The total journey down lasted appx 10 - 15 seconds of travel time. The object then hung for 5 - 10 seconds dead still below the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the upper object became very slowly less intense, until it reached appx 1/2 original brightness. This made the two objects the same intensity at this point. The small lower object then began to traverse upwards and to the right slightly at the same rate it had used on the descent but now at a relative diagonal. Eventually it passed the original large object on the right by appx 1/2 of a degree and continued until it reached appx 1/2 to 1 degree of distance upwards and to the right of the original object. Using the clock analogy again, with the larger object at the center of the clock, the smaller object was located at appx the 1 o&#39;clock position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this ascent the large original object began again another very gradual fade and size shift until it was smaller in appearance and eventually equal in appearance to the smaller second object. Eventually the original object became so dim and small that it was unable to be seen at all. The second object remained visible and dead steady for appx another 5 - 10 seconds before it too dimmed slowly until disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire encounter lasted likely 1 or 2 minutes total. The objects were both white light and circular / dot like. No defining shape or features could be seen. No flashing. No flickering. No trails or tails. No other movement in any directions or traversing of the sky in even the most minute amount unless otherwise described above. Zero chance of confusion with aircraft. Only possibilities could be orbital objects. Researched &#34;Iridium flare&#34; objects, wrong coloration, intensity, and timing entirely. Smaller secondary object is utterly confounding in movements. Cannot explain the utter lack of movement for larger object. Appeared almost perfectly like a star expect for extreme intensity and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

The red and blue lights were more pronounced and you could see how the red and blue lights seemed to move through one another unlike lights that would go on an off next to each other. The activity varies from minimal to very active some times going completely white for a split second then back to the colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stays in the sky at the same spot like a star from about 7:15 PM until about 7:50 where it follows the curve of the earth and disappears with the horizon (at least it did last night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I am writing this at 7:34 PM, I walked back outside to see it again and it is now gone. I started writing the report five minutes ago and it was too high in the sky to go below the horizon that quick. Damn I knew I should have continued to watch it instead of writing this report. For those who are interested watch tomorrow night and see if it comes back. Let me know and respond on this website. (The light is not very high in the sky)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We have access points up on monument peak in Milpitas CA. In the San Francisco Bay Area.  I was up on one of our towers on monument peak, swapping out an access point, when the other technician with me. Looked out to the left where our office was in San Jose.  And yelled at me to look.  When I looked out, I saw a gray, sphere object omitting light from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for several seconds.  Just wondering what it was.  And then I could see the omitting light, began to intensify.  till it got to a point where it was close to being as bright as the sun.  Which was over to my right, high up in the sky.  Far away from this object.  One the object got to this point it sustained that level of brightness, and appeared to come towards the Hill we where on.  But then Stopped, omitting such a bright light and resumed its greyish/soft omitting light. Right after that, I kinda sweep the whole bay, from where I was, and now saw 3 identical small objects show up in sequence, and at parallel height. (could draw a straight line through all 4)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I was panicking, and wanted to get off the 25ft tower I was on, and rush to my truck, just down the hill to grab my camera. (Truck was about 500 ft away from the antenas) So I did and returned with my camera. The first main object was gone, and the other 3 behind it where leaving in sequence as well. I was able to snap off pictures of the 4th orb/sphere/object, which was closer to San Francisco, out over the south Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been up there 30-40 times this year, I have never seen any lights up there that could compare, ive never seen any reflections that could compare or have ever been 1/10th as bright as these in clear sunny day light conditions. I just cant explain what these where.<n>

It appeared as if it was a bright light, though some how we could tell that it was in fact reflecting light more than any other object we have ever seen.  I saw it first and pointed it out to my friend saying, &#34;is that a UFO&#34;, and he responded that he too thought it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then moved swiftly to the right, the movement was swift and odd to watch as it did not move like any other air craft we had ever seen. It then came to a complete stop, then it backed away until it disappeared into the sky. It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.  I no longer question the existance of UFO sightings.<n>

Still converging and expanding and it followed me down around turns all the way to the MidHudson bridge.  Then it was lost in the light pollution.

I looked up to see if the sky was cloud covered because I was concerned about frost.It was dark and barely any stars shown.  So I noticed what at first looked like a cluster of stars, but it seemed to be a formation of white lines shaped like an asterisk.  Checking the sky further I saw 3 more of the same asterisk shape.  Nothing was moving and it seemed odd to me that there would be 4 of these in a sort of grid pattern spaced out straight up in the sky.  There was no flashing or movement during the short time I watched.  The asterisk was elongated with extra arms eminating from the center, more like a double asterisk lighted with white light.  They were in 2 rows evenly spaced and staggered.<n>

I stepped out in the back patio and reached down to pick-up the water hose when I came back up I saw what at the moment I thought was a kite.  I immediately concluded that the object was not a kite because it stopped moving but continued to rotate clock-wise.  I stood and stared at the object to study its form, color, &amp; shape.  This was the (MOST Obscure Object) I have ever seen… I also noticed that this object made absolutely no noise, and the most interesting aspect about it is its shape.  The object looked like a vertebrae or back bone and has it rotated it seemed to be flexing in a cumbersome motion. The color was a faded florescent blue, and the light that it emitted was even throughout the entire shape and form of the object. The size could have been 7-10 ft long and 2-3ft in diameter. The distance was about 40-50ft above me and facing north towards the Hollywood Hills. I ! wanted to go get my camera that was sitting on my desk so I backed away from the object to my back door keeping my eyes on it so I don’t lose track of its position. I ran to my desk grabbed my camera and ran back out to my patio. The object was no-longer in its previous position, It had climbed vertically straight up at what I estimated to be 1-2 thousand ft. I turned off the LCD display on my camera to see if I can acquire it through the view finder. I could not see the object, but I snapped 4 succession pictures in the general direction of the object. I could still observe the object with the naked eye but could not see it through the camera. I continued to watch the object for about another minute ½ then it passed out of view completely. I then placed a call to the (LAPD) to file a report. The Officer who handled the call listened intently and asked me 1 or 2 questions, and then offered to send out a chopper that was in the area to see if they could intercept the object.! I said go ahead but that I could not see the object anymore s! o it wou ld be impossible for me to give any position of where it might be at that moment. The Officer thanked me for calling and said that it was an interesting conversation and that if the object returns to call again immediately. I then called (MUFON) but got no answer.  After that night I had tried to make sense of what I had seen that night and the only explanation I can come up with is that it could (NOT) have been anything explained in conventional terms and it seemed to be under intelligent control because it stopped in mid-air almost at the exact moment I took notice of the object. It was like the object was watching me has I was watching the object.  And when I returned outside this thing had traveled straight up vertically 1-2 thousand ft, from the point and position from where I left it to grab my camera. This was truly the most strangest sighting I have ever experienced… I have had an Abduction experience when I was 6 years old, and throughout my life I have had UFO sighti! ng of all different types, but nothing like the 1 I had this night. I did a little research into this object and there was some video on YouTube pertaining to a sighting that Story Musgrave the Astronaut had videotaped from the Space Shuttle. Here the YouTube video Link that will give some idea to what I witnessed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jotdaXX1w2A The object I saw moved in the exact same way has the video clip of the Story Musgrave Sightings. Its form or shape hard to determine whether it’s the same Object. But its movement is identical to my sighting. This sends chills up my spine when I think about it. I keep asking myself what could it have been???<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were coming back from a party and driving right next to Murrieta Valley High School on Washington.  My friend Brandon was looking at a empty field by the school and saw a light speeding though the trees.  He yelled out “what the hell is that” I looked and saw a flying object so quite and low to the ground and the only way I knew it was a circle is its bottom faced us and all I could see was red, blue, and green lights that mad a circle, then It zoomed off so fast and I couldnt see anything any longer we were so shocked that for the ten seconds it was there all we could do was stare at it. I will never forget that moment of my life and will forever believe in aliens.<n>

Nobody I know of saw the lights come into view and I didn’t see them until we came down from the stands.  There were about 8 lights all revolving in different directions but they stayed at the same altitude and stayed clustered together in the same area of the sky.  The lights crossed each other’s path which kept me from being to accurately count them.  They did not blink or pulse and looked about 5 or 6 miles away. They appeared to be above a light cluster of clouds. I can’t accurately guess how high the lights or clouds were. The area I think is near DFW airport because there were always passenger aircraft flying over. The planes were flying lower then the clouds. We had to move on to the football field for our performance and so I did not see the lights leave. When we finished the show they were no longer there. I know there is probabl! y a simple explanation to what the lights were. I suspected that they were just spot lights reflecting on clouds but there were no upward beams of light visible.  All the witnesses I know of are in the Weatherford Marching Band. I pointed out the lights to most of the people who saw them but they took no interest in the sighting although they had no explanations for what they were. I have always had a interest in paranormal activity ever since I heard of the Stephenville and Lubbock sightings. I live close to both cities. The spotlights of the State Fair was my first guess but since the Stephenville sightings and a wave of strange earthquakes in the area, which I read are suspected to be linked with UFO sightings, I began to wonder. I just want to know what made the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was dark outside. I looked up toward the western sky and saw what I thought was a bright star. When I looked further, it appeared to be flashing colors. I then thought it must be an airplane. I kept watching it and noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving. I called my husband to come look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He couldn&#39;t determine what the object was either.

There was a orange haze around the edges of the object, probably from the main light of the object. It was night, very dark, it was hovering about 100-150 meters away at about 100 meters off the ground.

Try to take pictures but the objects would not show on pictures taken with digital camera, and then try to take video but objects would not appear on played video afterwards.  Objects disappeared into sky a bit later after taking video.  The objects where shinny but did not see any signs of a contrail so I am sure it was not a conventional craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was going through the Ontario/Pomona area. I just happened to look up and to the right when I saw what at first I thought was a shooting star. This object (for lack of a better description) took off in the W-NW direction and left a trailing bright white tail that quickly followed it. It disappeared within a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason that I don&#39;t think that it was a shooting star was because I have never seen one in the day light. At 7:02 AM in the morning the sun has already come up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object and the way it acted reminds me of how the warp speed looked on Star Trek.<n>

The single “star” remained faint for about ten seconds, then quickly grew in brightness. At maximum brightness, which was maintained for no more than 15 seconds and was as bright or brighter than Venus on a clear night, a second faint “star” appeared at about twenty degrees higher in the sky. The first “star” faded and disappeared completely within five seconds. Then, the second “star” grew in brightness, just as the first “star” did. This brightness was also maintained for no more than fifteen seconds. Just as the first did, the second “star” faded and disappeared completely within five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects remained motionless in the sky. As far as I was able to determine, there were no clouds in the sky as I could see stars all around, fully formed constellations, and even the “north star”.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw no wings or flashing lights as a regular plane would have.  It may have been about the size of a helicopter judging from the distance it was from me.  It was not a large craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had white lights at each corner.  It appeared to be perfectly flat on each side like a triangular box.  I saw it at an angle.  I also saw a darker silver line down one side like you would see if that part extended out farther than the rest of that side.  It made no sound that I could hear.  I was at the pool. I only saw it for a moment and then it went out of sight once it passed the top of the building.  It was not moving quickly but I just happened to look up just as it was passing over the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I saw far up in the sky, two strings of white lights.  One moved very slowly off in one direction and the other moved very slowly in the opposite direction for a while and then stopped and stayed there for a long time.

It flashed from red to blue to green.  We stared at it for a minute or so and it moved maybe an inch in my perspective every two or three minutes.  We decided to see if we could see anymore so we turned around looking in the sky.  We found a total of four in a diamond pattern but very far apart.  We looked online to see if we could find any answers since we were obviously a little spooked but found nothing. It could have possibly been a star but we didnt figure that there would be four of them in such a pattern that was an exact diamond.<n>

October 2009<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10.30 in the night, we were two people and we were looking at the sky over the sea. We had a visibility of 180 grades, with the direction towards the South in front of us; therefore the West was in our right and of course the East to the left. The night was clear and we were looking west where the international airport of Margarita Island is.  We were looking, just above the horizon the lights of the airplanes. It was at that instant when I saw three lights coming from the west, from the same place the airplanes were flying. The lights were moving with an incredible speed towards us. I only had time to cry: What the hell is that? When the lights already were flying over our position. At first I thought that there were three separated war planes, but when the object was on us, I could see the figure of the object like that of a perfect isosceles triangle. It had three white lights in the vertices, the colour of the UFO was very dark (Could be bla! ck). It was huge, could be the size of half football&#39;s camp. It made no sound at all. The UFO disappeared flying in the direction north-east. I think that the phenomenon only lasted of 3 to 5 second, time in which it flew over the horizon completely, with an altitude between nine hundred to thousand five hundred meters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

When it disappeared behind the tree line, it seemed to us to be maybe a half mile away, and we sped up to what we thought would be the scene of a crash site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, there was no crash, and we tuned in a local radio station to see if there had been an airplane crash in the area.  There was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area is across the Hudson River from Stewart Air base, now a commercial airport, and we are both very used to seeing fairly low commercial and military planes, including the huge C-5 Galaxy military transport planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only saw the lights for at best 3 seconds, and other than the fact that there were several colored lights which seemed to be along the fuselage of what we thought was the plane (which is unusual) the only thing we could reasonably come up with was that it was a large commercial jet.  Both of us agree there were white, green, and red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m reporting this because it isn’t possible for a plane of that size to be going that fast in a vertical position straight down, that close to the ground, and not crash.  Neither of us can explain how that would be possible, so we’ve questioned if what we saw was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the only time I&#39;ve reported a sighting to your website, but this is certainly the shortest sighting, and yet still very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

After turning onto Rt. 32, I decided to proceed onto Rt. 93 to get a better look, as I thought that it may be a helicopter. I stopped about 1 mile down Rt. 93 and turned off my vehicle. I got out and listened to see if I could hear a sound coming from the object, such as rotors.  The object made no sound at all.  Upon determining that it wasn&#39;t a helicopter, I got freaked out and left about as quickly as I had come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Driving down Highway 90, approaching Quincy, there is a stretch where the road becomes quite straight apart from the hills.  My friend turns to me and asks,&#34;Hey..dude..What&#39;s that?&#34; and points to an object in the sky with a couple lights on it.  Unconcerned, I say,&#34;It&#39;s a plane..&#34; He says,&#34;Nah dude, that&#39;s not a plane..It&#39;s not moving, look.&#34;  I observe the light and notice that it truly is not moving.  The lights are directly in front of us, so we are getting closer and closer, and the lights remain in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We eventually pass almost directly underneath the object. It looked like nothing that either of us had ever seen before, and we could not identify its origin, or understand how it was able to stay in the air.   We are able to distinguish a triangular craft, about 150 ft in the air.  There were three red lights, one on each corner of the underside of the craft, and a flashing white light in the center.  It appears to be between 18-25 ft long, 10-15 ft wide, and maybe 8 feet tall at the rear.  What I assume was the front was pointed, and the craft grew wider and taller towards the rear, which had a fairly flat and dark side.  There are no visible means of propulsion.  We slow down to about 30mph and I roll down my window to look up at it, attempting to capture a picture on my phone, but was unsuccessful due to the darkness.  The object was making no audible noise, and was just sitting there, hovering above the house where a mentally challenged boy lives.  After we passed under the craft, it started to slowly move south, away from the house and highway.  It was out of sight shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I was sitting in the backseat and was on the phone with one of my friends. My dad was passing over a railroad crossing and I looked up as we rocked across the tracks when I saw this massive object in the sky. The only way that I can describe this object was that it was in a shape of a chef&#39;s hat. It did not look like a weather balloon, I have seen these all my life and it was 5 or 6 times larger than any other balloon I have seen. It seemed to be a metal, but not a shiny metal. The only light coming from the object was out of the bottom of the &#34;tube&#34; of the chef&#39;s hat. It was illuminated as if there were spotlights from the ground illuminating the bottom portion of the object. I took a second to study it, and then I looked at my parents just long enough to say &#34;what is that?&#34; and then I looked up in the sky and it was gone. There was one small! cloud in the sky, but no way that the object could be hidden by this smaller cloud. I just want to know if I am the only person that saw this. It was huge, I just don&#39;t understand, I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about it for the past year and want some answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After a good 45 minutes, all the time stationary, it changed colors from white, to a mixture of white and red, with like a red aura around it. Not long after that, it began moving rapidly up at an angle, until it looked like a star in the sky, then disappeared. No flashing beacon.  The object was big! Got poor pictures from a cell phone camera, but there was a man taking pictures with a 35mm camera with a big zoom lens.  Many people witnessed this object.<n>

At first we thought it was two parachutes or parasails because of the odd end-on view we had.  As they got closer, we could see all the detail – black hexagons with a section missing from the leading edge.  At one point they were about 2000 feet overhead and turning towards the north.  I could hear and see other small planes in the area going to the local airport south of the area.  These things made absolutely no sound, were at least 75 feet in diameter, and maybe moving only 25mph.

I was on the telephone at the time also, so this sighting did not get my fullest attention sorry to say because this was extraordinary!  I&#39;m always looking up and on that day, I happened to see the most unusual and hard to describe object!  It was white with a few appendages - at first.  I thought it was very strange and told my friend about it and then had to check to see that the cat wasn&#39;t escaping over the fence.  I was trying to convince who I was speaking to of what I was seeing, and after seeing the cat was ok I looked back up at the object.  It had been and was hovering in the same NE position.  What I saw next was that the things shape had changed and was changing. I then noticed that two other smaller orbs were either coming out of this thing or were coming from behind it because I had not noticed them before.  I focused in on the biggest of the 2 smaller orbs once ! they came into view.  This orb seemed to kind of change energy fields(?) because of its appearance like a forcefield around it, then rotated clockwise 3 times and in an instant darted downward angling to the left at a remarkable speed and then stopped (between but lower below the other two objects) and they all stayed in their relative positions.  It was almost as if it KNEW it had my undivided attention! Two more times this happened- the smaller objects darted in different directions/angles.  I was excitedly on the phone giving this account to my friend but couldn&#39;t convince them of my NOT having a rational explanation of this event.  At that time I decided to get my son from inside the house so he could witness this.  I put my head in the door to yell to him then turned around but they were gone!  I did some research on this and the closest thing resembling this sighting is the &#34;Strange Morphing UFO&#34; in Mexico that is on YouTube with the exception that my object was CLOUD ! -white color, and the orbs in my sighting were making some inc! redible maneuvers.  Please feel free to contact me if any questions.  PS I also saw a fast moving orb near a commercial airliner an hour or two before this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time and date are approx.

The base was located at the Al-Iskandariyah power station.  Everything went as normal when our convoy came under attack from insurgent forces.  As the RTO of the convoy, I was directing communication from the convoy to the base. The attack happened at the government housing that we called “The projects.”  The housing was setup as multi-level apartment complexes surrounded on all sides by farmland with the road going up the eastern side of the complex.  Power was scarce in the area so there was no electricity at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The encounter happened about 15 minutes into the firefight.  I was standing by the driver door of the HMMWV (Military Vehicle, similar to a civilian Hummer H1) coordinating the attack and directing support with the Lieutenant. Facing west, the UFO just appeared out of nowhere.  I was looking directly at the craft when it appeared.  The craft was dead silent, had a dark hull, non-reflective, appeared cigar shaped from my angle, and had a series of blue lights on the bottom and top.  The craft was about 100 meters away from us and about 150 meters off the ground.  The craft was dead still and had no sway or movement at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds after it appeared, the (Singars) Radio’s in the HMMWV immediately started to emit a steady tone.  Our vehicle was equipped with 3 radio’s (One for platoon, one for battalion, and one for aviation.)  Two of the radios where on VHF Frequencies and one was on a UHF Frequency.  All three radio’s started to emit a stead tone on all three radios at the same time.  Our handheld radios (MBTTR Radio) also emitted the same tone.  As I switched to the different channels, every single Freq was jammed with the same tone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fire fight immediately stopped and a single shot was not fired by either us or the insurgents.  At the same time our communications were jammed, the electronics on the ITAS TOW Missile system went off line rendering the missile launcher and optics useless.  The craft stayed there motionless for about what I guess was 2 minutes when we heard 3 loud booms coming from our base.  After the booms, the craft immediately disappeared and all communications were restored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At FOB Chosen, the TOC (Tactical Operation Center) was monitoring our contact when they too witnessed the craft appear (as the base was only about 700 meters away from the craft).  Later when we returned to base, they told us to that they heard the same tone, not only from the VHF and UHF radio’, but also the tactical satellite radios.  At the same times, all the computers in the TOC went off line and became unresponsive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time, our base had three 105mm howitzer artillery cannons loaded and on standby for our contact in case we needed them.  When the craft appeared, they lost all communications with everyone and their targeting computers went off-line.  The Staff sergeant in charge of the firing line, unable to get orders from the TOC, immediately identified the craft as the cause of the blackout and considered it hostile.  Without the targeting computers and no time to do calculation manually for the trajectory, he ordered the cannons to direct lay (Essentially pointing the cannons straight at the target, instead of lobbing the rounds) toward the craft and ordered a 3 round volley to be fired.  After the cannons fired, the craft disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned to base for the AAR (After Action Review), no one could explain what we all saw.  After the artillery fired and neither us in the field or the artillery line saw any explosions on the craft, we assumed that the rounds missed the target all together.  There was an immediate concern about the rounds because after figuring out the trajectory of the artillery rounds, we saw the point of impact was in the middle of the city of Al-Iskandariyah and the concern for civilian loss of life and collateral damage immediately became priority.  We had an AH-1 Cobra on station and gave the pilot the grid coordinates of where the rounds should have landed so he could identify the point of impact and give us an accurate grid and battle damage assessment.  The pilot flew in a straight line from the cannons in the direction that the rounds were fired.  The pilot came across the radio and reported that there were no impact craters within a 1000 meter radius of the calculated poi! nt of impact and no appearance of any disturbance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning we were dispatched to the area we thought the rounds landed to ask around if anyone heard where the rounds landed and no one reported hearing anything at all and the local clinics reported no one being admitted with any shrapnel wounds or no new deaths.  We have no idea what that craft was and even more, we never figured out what happened to the 3 artillery rounds that were fired.  A direct lay shot to a static target 700 meters away should have been an easy direct hit, but there were no traces.<n>

It was motionless for about 30 seconds, then shot through the sky twords the west at a high rate of speed.  The light traveled across the sky and then stopped just as suddenly.  The object remained still for about 5 seconds before making a zig zag pattern then disapearing into thin air.  After checking this site for any other related sightings in the area, found that the exact same discription of what I saw was reported 10/14/02.  Whats the odds on the seeing the exact same thing on the exact same day 7 years apart.  People thimk Im crazy, but I know what I saw.<n>

We got into the car and proceeded to drive towards the exit for 81 south.  We were still in the drive around the parking lot when my wife screamed, &#34;What is that, pointing out the window.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over and looked out and up.  The UFO we witnessed was HUGE and black metallic bottom with several lights around the cross/weird shaped object.  It was smokey looking around the lights, possibly due to the cold  (40 degree) night sky.?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it move slowly left and right as it went away from us at 5-10mph. (approx.) There was absolutely NO SOUND, which baffled me considering it was immense.  I decided to try and follow it.  I drove around to the main entrance of the mall and we saw the UFO again and it had picked up the speed a bit.  We watched it head parallel to Hiawatha Blvd.. slightly SE/E.  As we drove through the city down Salina Street, we all started to breath a! gain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I saw a UFO of this size I was 9 years old.  I am 28 now, my wife is 25.  My 3 children were in the car as well.  One 7, second is 4, and my youngest (which I cant really count as a witness) is almost 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my dad, who lives in Orlando, Florida and told him and also called my brother who lives on the NW side of Syracuse to tell him as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am simply amazed at what I just saw.  My family is in awe and my 7 year old daughter was terrified.  Simply spectacular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

From my lanai (balcony), I saw an unusually bright, very colorful; pulsating light (noticeably brighter than the brightest star or planet in the normal night sky) above the horizon and between two buildings.  I rushed for my Sanyo Xacti Full HD camera and started handheld filming the object.  I noticed the object had moved to the west (right) slowly but rapidly enough to notice.  Then the object slowed down again and continued on a westerly (right) path. I filmed until the object went behind the building.  I proceeded to get on my motorbike and drove to the park where I knew I would be able to have an unobstructed view of the sky but I could not find the object again.  I checked my  astronomy program and determined that the light could not have been Jupiter as it was already below the horizon at the time I was recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were below the tree line. I saw them again  when I cleared the trees to my right. Orion was on my left at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Indeterminable distance but when I held up my hand they were a thumb and a half apart in the sky.  Weather was partly cloudy.<n>

I ignored it and looked at my dog again.  She said no its not a star because its moving.  So I look up at the &#34;star&#34; again but this time it was moving to the right from my point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I ignored it and told her it was a helicopter, but as I was about to look away i saw it move quickly to the left and then it caught my attention.  As it moved around in the sky my wife and I stared at this object just moving so fast from left to right.  I asked my wife if she knew what it was but she didnt reply to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What me and my wife saw that night, I dont know but it was not any airplane or helicopter.<n>

It was approximately 0245 -0300 hours in the am.  It was at the start of Belleville travelling from Toronto.  On the side of the road, 40 feet off their was a fiew lightpost near the edge to a field.  Some trailers were also parked near these lamps and I just plainly seen it hovering about 2.5 stories above the lamp post.  This thing was huge, i mean huge, and I trully, trully feel priviledged to see this with my own eyes and at such a close distance at that.  I&#39;m sure about 4-5 other cars on the road must have seen it as this this was BIG!  It was just hovering above and not doing anything, no noise or wind from the craft.  Theirs a reason why psyphy depicts them as circular saucers and this one was no exeption. It looked exactly in the movies. It had 4 circular lights under it but they were not in the middle of the craft.  They were kinda grouped and at the side of the underside of the craft facing away.  They were quite weird lights as they were clearly visible but emited absolutely no kind of lights nor beams of lights.  Just hovering in the night on the side of the road from highway 401 east.  I have never been so scared in my life.  My eyes were actually tearing as i almost crashed off the road in utter amasement.  I dont know why i was crying, its almost as if my body forced it, a natural process?  It was uncontrolable.  It was a dark color of some short, maybe black/grey.  This was kinda hard to judge as it was late and hard to see, let alone driving down the highway and seeing this thing.  So i have absolutely nothing to gain by this but hopefully this gets to the government as i am sure they keep track and what not.  If &#34;something&#34; were to ever happen years down the road, i hope we as human society will be ready because this thing was damn big and too be hovering with no noise nor wind- thats technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i may be contacted by email at ((e-mail deleted)) if anyone is interested in further information although that! s basically it.<n>

It seemed to be stationary when I first noticed it, then suddenly it shot across the northeast horizon at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving a rock truck, and was hauling high on a mountain. As I was coming off the top to go back to the loader, lights in the sky caught my attention. There were two bright, blue/white lights from something, that seemed to be stationary in the sky over us. After about 2 to 3 seconds of watching this, it took off toward the west and out of site so quickly. Like a shooting star would do. It just took off from right over us, and seemed to go right out of the atmosphere, and out of site in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/11/09 21:55|Madison|WI|Light|3 minutes|Amber orange light moving very slowly, dimming out, shooting away.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72804.html|209|ndxe200910| Amber orange light moving very slowly, dimming out, shooting away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my second story bedroom, when a bright light caught my eye. Our house is quite close to the local airport and is almost directly under a common flight path taken by incoming airplanes. It is therefore extremely common to observe planes with bright, white flight lights approaching from the south. For a number of reasons, however, this was different:  1. Even indoors with the windows closed, you can always hear approaching passenger planes. They are very loud, because they are very low. This object made no sound audible from inside the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. The path taken by planes on their approach is completely predictable (essentially, they go over our neighbor&#39;s house to the east). This went over our neighbor&#39;s house to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. It was moving very slowly. Because it was a light in the sky, I feel it&#39;s hard to say how far up it was; it seemed like it wasn&#39;t much higher than 2 or 3 times the height of the tall, mature trees in our neighborhood. Could be wrong about the height. Regardless, it appeared to be making the progress of a car going around 5mph (if it was as close as it appeared).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. The light was bright amberish orange, unlike the lights of the passenger jets that pass overhead ... bright white at first and then red and blue flashing lights as they get closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because it looked odd, I went outside to our porch to get a better look. I found it in the sky again outside. I could still hear no sound. Again, it seemed strange because it was moving so slowly. Its path was completely straight and it moved from roughly south to north. I tried to film it with my cheap digital camera, but the camera was unable to pick up the small light. After a minute of observation, it had finally reached a point parallel with our house. Then, the light dimmed out completely. As I turned to go back inside, a speck of light shot very quickly upwards from the point where the light had dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This final observation, of sudden insanely fast movement, is what really spooked me. I&#39;ve seen plenty of lights in the sky that have seemed odd, but I always felt that my impression could be a misinterpretation of something mundane. This event seemed truly weird.<n>

We commented on how it looked like a rainbow, smoke or a cloud. The streak didn’t move like smoke, didn’t have the same form as the few other clouds in the sky, and couldn’t be a rainbow for a number of reasons. We then joked about how it could be from a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes of the conversation, my husband noticed two aircraft heading toward the odd streak. He asked if I thought they were fighter planes doing drills together. We watched the aircraft and noticed they could not be planes as they weren’t moving across the sky, but hovering around the streak. There were distinctly two separate craft, but we could not tell how many lights were on them, just that they had pulsing lights that seemed to have a strobe effect and the lights moved together with the same rhythm and timing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the lights on the craft for approximately 9 minutes until they disappeared behind the trees in the distance. We tried to take a picture with our cell phone camera but the quality was poor and just looked like two small lights in a dark sky. The haze did not appear at all.<n>

Maybe they&#39;re satellites, I don&#39;t know, but they are there.  On this particular night, I was watching one of these star things when out of nowhere appear these two orange, dimly lit lights, traveling northwest in a parallel orientation. They were moving very fast, but were only visible for a few moments, then they were gone.  They were real. I saw them with my own two eyes.  What the hell is up there?<n>

At around the same time I noticed a small helium balloon (such as a party balloon) floating by up in the sky and decided to take a few pictures of it just on a whim.  After I shot the first picture of the balloon I noticed (through the view finder) a small white object moving rapidly from left to right within the view finder.  I quickly tried to take a second photograph of the object but was unable to as it vanished before I could focus on it accurately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, when I came upstairs and uploaded all of the images I had taken into my computer I noticed that the second picture I took of the helium balloon had the strange white object within its frame.  I couldn’t help (and still can’t help) but wonder what the object could have been, as it flew very quickly and completely silently before it disappeared.  The sky was also very clear and there was no other air traffic that I could see within my vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photograph of the object was taken with the following settings: Shutter Speed:  1/320 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aperture: F6.3 ISO Speed: 100 Lens:  75-300mm Focal Length: 300mm  I took the photo and simply increased the contrast on it so you could see the object a little brighter, however I will make sure to email both the original untouched picture as well as the contrast enhanced version.  I hope you folks can figure out what this is because I certainly have no clue as I have never seen an object of this shape in flight.<n>

At the time he took the picture he did not see the UFO, that is until the next evening when he was going through his pictures.  He showed us what he took and our first response was &#34;that is a UFO&#34;.  My husband and I then looked at each other and thought &#34;Oh my gosh&#34;.  My husband forwarded the picture to his cell phone and zoomed in on the object and it was clear as day, a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spoke with the boys and they did not see the UFO or hear any strange noises.  We are interested in understanding how they did not see the object and how it just appeared in the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were setting up a Halloween display in the yard. Above us circling around the area was a blimp. Not an uncommon sight, we live close to the stadium where the Cardinals play. It was there filming for the Cardinals football game. Which reminded me we must finish up so I don’t miss any of the game. I told the girls “wave” to the blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at that point I noticed a white object above the blimp. Vanessa saw it too. It was just sitting there not moving. I asked Stephanie to get my binoculars. We watched this white egg shaped object for maybe 5 minutes when all of a sudden as I have the object in view, a dark object fly’s up right next to the white one. They are just sitting there together for about 2 minutes then the dark one speeds off to the south. They were both the same size ,same shape just different color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned our attention back to the white one which had moved to another area in the sky. At one point it looked as though it was close to the flight path of planes. I remember thinking to myself “The guys driving that blimp could have seen this object, or the pilots of the planes”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altogether we watched this for about 20 minutes total till the object vanished.<n>

I decided to go out for a smoke before bed. It was about 4:45 am or so. I live in a suburban area about 20 minutes drive from an active airport.  My house is directly under a flight path and many planes fly overhead on a daily basis. I am very familiar with the appearance of planes flying at night. I can recognize them at varying distances, in all weather conditions including foggy nights, (I live in a very foggy place.)  If it is visible I can usually say if it is a plane, because of the light colour and flashing patterns that are common to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, around 4:45 some time in late October of 2009. I was outside having a smoke. It was a clear night and I was admiring the stars I could see from my porch and the drone of the nearby airport, contemplating the shape of the Universe, after watching some videos of lectures regarding the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly there was a thick arc of white light which bent from the sky toward the ground as if it were and arc fitting nicely into a 90 degree angle. I could not see if it stopped beyond the horizon as the treeline was obstructing my view. I have observed both meteors and satellites with the naked eye. They do not resemble what I saw. This was a thick white streak at least several meters wide, and quite distant. Though what was most impressive was the speed at which it traveled. I saw the &#39;object&#39; for no more than a second. And it initially appeared quite high in the sky, a little lower than the moon.  It appeared as a white arcing flash of light which left a trail that subsided  pretty well instantaneously. I was awestruck and my first thoughts were: “What?-So fast!” The other thing that struck me was the odd blur on the periphery of the arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps it was a natural phenomenon, like none I had prior seen. But my guess it was some sort of gravity manipulating craft. This is partly based upon my understanding of theoretical propulsion systems, and some of the more credible reports I have read regarding US and Canadian government activities involving UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The still night sky was very clear and the stars seemed to be very close as well as a lot of them. I got my traps into the water and sat in my chair as I heard a plane going overhead. I looked up to locate its flashing lights and I did. Seconds later I was still gazing at the stars as I always do I noticed an odd looking star. I thought nothing of it until it stared to move. I’ve seen many falling stars or shooting stars. What ever you want to call them so I’m pretty familiar about what they look like. As this particular one was moving very fast it stopped on a dime. Note this sighting was also very close. I would say roughly 200 to 300 yards away. When it stopped it sat there for 10 to 15 seconds. It then made a 90-degree turn away from me, but as it was turning it was getting brighter like flam! es out of a rocket. Then it got even brighter like a thrust or something and shot across the sky moving parallel to the canal. What ever this thing was moved faster then a plane. I continued to watch this to me a UFO until I couldn’t see it anymore. Thank for your time, and if you have any questions please contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was driving home, I had noticed that the moon was completely covered with clouds and on the other side, the sky was clear and the stars were bright as ever. 2 of the stars were extremely brighter than the others so when I got home I got out of my car and stood there looking up for awhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and my fiance came home not too long after I came in.  I was telling her what I saw so she suggested that we go back outside and look again.  It was now about 2:45am and she quickly noticed exactly what I was speaking about.  They were bright orange and shiny, and located in the southern part of the sky. We both continued to look up when all of a sudden, one of the bright things started to move - first in a clockwise direction, then it went up, down, side to side and back into a circular motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That continued for about 5 minutes when all of a sudden there was a burst of light with a trail - it almost looked like a shooting star but it never fizzled off, instead it created the trail and stopped abruptly and all of a sudden appeared another bright thing that started also moving in a circular motion, and side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched these 2 things move around the sky zipping back and forth, and creating a circular motion for about 20 minutes.  We came back inside and my fiance went to bed.  I couldn&#39;t sleep so I went back outside to see if these things were still in the sky and they were - in the same spot that they were before.  Now it was about 4am.  The objects were still moving but this time, were a little slower as if they were just hanging out.  I stayed out there for about 15 minutes and then came back in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all occurred Saturday night/Early Sunday Morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunday night / into Monday morning, one of these objects was back but this time it was in the western part of the sky. It was moving but this time it was blinking.  It definitely wasn&#39;t a plane because it stayed within the same area and never moved.  I stood outside and watched it for about 10 minutes.<n>

A small area of black was observed approximately halfway between Chicago and the beach across the lake. Further observation showed that the object was denser than what was immediately thought to be a small black cloud in the otherwise cloudless night sky. The object was slanted about 30 degress from bottom right to upper left. The bottom of the craft was flat with sharper edges on the two bottom corners and the top was flat but a little more curving. The object was completely black with a small change of color going towards dark grey from top to bottom. The object was motionless and after several minutes of observation began to turn in on itself, implode into a small sphere and then vanished into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then appeared to quickly return to its original shape. This happened again, and the second time it disappeared competely. About 5-10 minutes later, the object appeared again, although this time was above the shoreline towards the pier down the left side of the beach, a distance of about 50 miles from where it was originally seen. The object exhibited the exact same shape, no movement, although this time it was slightly closer to my viewpoint. It again imploded on its self, first forming a small black sphere and then vanishing, only to &#34;pop&#34; back out and reappear in its original shape. This happened several times before disappearing completely again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then returned again several minutes later, although this time much closer, and appearing larger. It retained the same shape, angle of the bottom, color etc. Around this time we decieded to leave to get a telescope to see it clearer as it began to faintly disappear again after several minutes of observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was quite cloudy, but as the clouds moved through the sky, you could get a perfect glimpse of the clear sky with all the beautiful stars behind clouds.  I was with my friend, she was driving that night, we were in her car when we say what we saw.  We drove to Leesburg and parked outside of an appartment complex, waiting for a friend to come out of their house.  The sunroof of the car was open.  As we waited, I gazed up at the sky, admiring the stars.  I even said, &#34;I love looking at the stars&#34;.  Right after I said that, my friend leaned back to stargaze with me.  It was cloudy, as I said, but the clouds were thick and moving quickly over the sky, and through patches of the clouds we could see the clear sky perfectly.  The incident happened seconds after my friend leaned back to look at the stars with me, through the car sunroof.  Then these two amber/orangish circular things came out of the clouds on one side, crossed over! each other where the sky was clear, then separated again above the thick clouds.  They were pretty big.  They didn&#39;t make a single sound.  My friend and I were speechless.  It was so intense that my friend denied seeing anything and got very upset with me as I was very excited and repeatedly asked &#34;did you see that?!  Oh my God! You had to have seen that!&#34;  She refused to admit she saw what we did.  She became very quiet and dropped me off at my house.  It was very strange and out of character for her.  I came down to tell my parents about it.  My mother said, &#34;oh it&#39;s the military.&#34;  There is no way these objects were military.  The way they moved through the air was out of this world, They way they maneuvered through the air, it seemed as if they were playing with each other or something.  The way they crossed over each other.  I know what I saw.  I will be haunted by it for the rest of my life.  Later my friend admitted she had seen it too.  That is how intense this sighting was.  My friend couldn&#39;t even come to terms with what we! saw.  I t scared her.  It was quite the experience.  Now I know there is something else out there other than us.  I wasn&#39;t scared by this sighting though.  It seemed as though these glowing objects were playing with each other.  The crafts did not make a single noise! Not a hum, nothing.  And I know there is no way we have the technology, top secret or not, that can move like that.  My friend and I would be more than happy to tell you about it.  I could describe it perfectly and draw a picture to and show exactly how it happened.  We are positive this was not human, or at least not from here.  I never believed in &#34;Aliens&#34; visiting Earth.  I always figured there was other life out there, but not like this.  Now I know.<n>

There is a golf course and pond in my back yard and I looked up above this one tree and spotted a bright whitish blue light.  I watched it and noticed that it was somewhat still, but then it seemed to glide in the sky as it moved slowly to my right.  It went behind the tree, out of my vision, then back into my vision on the right side of the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then out of nowhere there was another light that came from the left.  It had the same light colors and same movement pattern, but it moved somewhat faster.  Then I am on the phone telling someone about it, and as the second light moves this dark yellow light is ignited like fire, and becomes a strobe-like light near the ground on the golf course.  It burns or stays lit for about 1 minute and then it moves to the right, consecutively quits burning or strobing and blinks two or three times and disappears.....There is nowhere for that light to go except off the golf course and onto the street, but I cannot see that far due to buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Observations between two sightings.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85084.html|228|ndxe200910| Second sighting was only 150 feet away.  Observations between two sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second Encounter:  Approx. early October of 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Place:  I was driving on Hwy 260 due west of Eager, AZ, approx 2.5 miles west of 180 intersection, near a waste transfer site located on the north side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time:  16:24.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appearance:  Object was a glowing, glaring white light, approx. 75-100 feet in circumference.  I could see a curved, shiny metallic slope on the north side of the object, like an upper-dome.  Sighting lasted approx. 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sound or other emanations:  None whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Vector and Observations:  Object was moving at an undetermined speed in a Southeast direction over the desert from the direction of highway 60 to the north, heading directly toward my westbound truck.  I pulled over to the right (north) side of 260 and jumped out of the vehicle with my cellphone, which had no camera.  My camera was on the truck console, but I did not remember to use it.  The object came approx. 150 feet from my truck, directly west of me.   The sun was low over the horizon directly behind the object.  It stopped in front of me, and I jumped back in the truck and locked the door.  I called my editor of the newspaper and said “There’s one above me right now!”  She just commented that I was “Lucky”, while I described the object to her.  Reception on the phone was normal.  It stayed for approx. 45 seconds, then started to move in a slight curve toward west, and headed due west and gaining slightly in elevation, slowly, approx.  50 miles an hour.  It became harde! r to distinguish at it distanced.  It then disappeared suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 12-15 seconds later, two jet fighters came very low and very fast over the southern horizon mountains, moving due north.  They came close to my latitude, turning east and west respectively opposite of each other and circled back 260 degrees symmetrically and crossed paths, at a much slower speed now.    Then a larger jet crossed from west to east at a very high elevation, moving faster than the smaller fighters seemed capable of.  It seemed odd shaped, as if it had an object mounted on top of the main fuselage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observations:  It was late afternoon, and the sun was directly behind the UFO.  Therefore, the UFO was either creating the light itself or was bending the photons, perhaps.  It was an excellent camouflage, because the further away it was, approaching and retreating from my view, it was difficult to discern.  Also, I distinctly made out a metallic shine on the north (my right) side, not unlike the sun shining on a highly-polished Airstream trailer, and from the outline, it would fit in the shape of a saucer with a highly-sloped dome on top.  The angle was possibly not fitting for a spherical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later Observations regarding the two incidents mentioned:   Since both objects (Cell-One complex sighting a month earlier) were both approx the same elevation above ground level, the same speed, and came within the exact same proximity to me, it occurred to me that as an observer, I assumed that the size discrepancy between the two objects meant that I was looking at two different crafts or phenomena.  Later, it occurred to me that I was assuming too much based on my past experience with distance and size.  For example, if the smaller, glaring object was the same distance to me in relation to its size as the larger object, it would mean that the smaller object would be approx. 10 feet away.   If that were the case, then that means if the larger object was the same distance as the smaller one in relation to its size, then the larger object would be more like a half-mile away.  Since I could see only the glare of light, not metallic, when the larger object was approaching and ! retreating, it logically follows that if the smaller object was 10 feet away, I would possibly see a metallic property on a vehicle.  My observations here merely taught me not to assume properties by my ignorance.   This whole experience has been extremely valuable to me as a lesson in an even metaphysical perspective:  anything is possible, and as an observer, I should be keen to relationships in various phenomenon, and never make assumptions based on past knowledge.  What if size and distance is merely my perspective?   Please note that in both these incidents, there were no planes in the sky until after the object in question dissappeared from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, my newspaper publisher advised that I not write about or report the incident, to save my credibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was in my backyard stargazing through my telescope.  I was initially looking to the south and went to point my scope to the south east, whereupon I noticed a large triangular shaped craft moving slowly and silently across the sky towards the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds that night and only a slight breeze.  The object moved silently and had no noticeable lights.  Initially I thought it might be a small plane from UND or perhaps a military craft from the nearby Air Force base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I ruled these out when I noticed no red or green wing tip lights, and because the object was so large, moved slowly, and without sound.  I watched the craft move slowly across the southeast side of town before it disappeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object was somewhere between a triangle and curved wedge shape similar to XR-900 (http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/XR-900_Geopelia) from Ace Combat 3. I know that sounds a bit strange but that is the closest thing I can describe the object/craft to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While there were no lights there appeared to be a dull orange glow around the back edge of the object/craft.  I tried training my telescope on the object but because it was so black (aside from the trailing edge) I could not discern any additional details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting very much scared me and after I was hesitant to star gaze for a couple months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a bad feeling while watching the object.<n>

I remember them being oval shaped.  I had to park the car and the location of the lights were behind my building, so I could no longer see them once I passed the corner of my apartment building.  I tried to hurry out of the car with my children to go look again, but by the time I went around the building there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The skies were clear, and there were quite a few stars.  I looked to the west, and noticed, what I at first thought was an aircraft at altitude.  I continued watching it, as it was flickering different colored lights (red, blue, and white) and kept my attention.  After some time (probably 30-40 second), I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving.  Further, it made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rose from my chair, and moved to a different position in my yard to make sure it wasn&#39;t leaves on a nearby tree causing the &#34;flickering&#34;.  I stood watching it for another minute, and then went to the door to call my 13 year old son out to confirm what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him to put his jacket on and come see, while warning him not to look at any street lights in the area (to preserve his night vision).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the object out to him, and asked him what he saw (I didn&#39;t want to &#34;lead&#34; him).  He watched it for a few seconds and went through the same thought processes I did.  At first he thought it was an aircraft, until he noted it wasn&#39;t moving.  Then he offered that it might be a &#34;nova&#34; (he is studying just such a thing in school).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent him into the house to get our digital camera, and I took several photos of the object, but it appeared that the camera was unable to capture an image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for several more minutes, and noticed that it hadn&#39;t changed its location or actions.  The evening was fairly cool, so after 10 minutes or so, we decided to go in, and I would check it later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirty minutes later, I went back out and searched the general area of the sky, and the object was gone.  I looked lower towards the horizon to see if it was simply a star that may have gone closer to setting, but I couldn&#39;t locate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be going back out at the same time this evening in an attempt to locate it again.<n>

There was a bright star in the south (looked bright like Venus).  The unusual thing was that there was a second bright star (as bright as the other one) just to the west of the first one.  I had never seen one there before.  I told my daughter and she looked up.  She continued on the walk, but I stopped and kept looking at the second star-like object.  Since I had never seen anything like that before in the sky down here, I thought it might be a satellite, but it did not move at all.  Then after about 20 seconds, the bright light dimmed and then it moved quickly out into the universe.  It did not move in any other direction.  Then, it was gone and the star or planet that is usually there was alone as usual.  I saw something like that about 30 years ago in Kansas City, MO.  It was on the 4th of July and someone called it to my! attention.  We were out on a lake.  The bright object went in a straight line, then made a 90 degree turn.  After a few seconds it stopped as though it was watching the fireworks that were occurring over the lake.  It made another 90 degree turn and then disappeared.  A doctor and I watched that one occur.  It was not a satellite either because it did not follow the curvature of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At this time I looked up and noticed the same. This object had flashing white lights in what looked like the underside of the craft. These lights formed the triangular shape. There were also some red lights flashing what looked to be above the craft and some blue lights flashing periodically underneath the object. This craft was moving very very slowly towards the east. At one point the object stopped moving and abruptly dropped down what looked to be a couple thousand feet then immediately jumped back up in the sky in a matter of seconds. Everyone was talking and were astonished at this sighting. As a helicopter came to view in the sky, the object vanished.<n>

These lights looked like no more than 40 feet from shore distance wise, the height of which they were at was probably no more than 700 feet at the highest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was they had to be flares, but they would &#34;flash&#34; on and off and never descended from their altitude. They stayed for approximately 2 minutes or so the first night.  The second night at about the same time approximately the same light appeared this time much farther out.  This was followed by the same &#34;flashing&#34; on and off pattern from the night before.  After a minute or so they faded out, only to reappear much closer...one at a time.  The same &#34;flashing&#34; fo! rmation continued for approximately 35 seconds or so.  At this point they disappeared again, only to reappear at a third sight much farther out but parallel to their original point approximately 1400 to 2000 feet off shore.  The height remained about constant from both days.  This time though, my sister, my mom and I all witnessed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done some research on these Myrtle Beach lights, and have seen some video.  The video&#39;s I have seen are the exact same lights me and my family witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 5 mins. later a formation of these same spherical lights appeared much closer to us, just past and above the 1st Ave.N. pier. They formed a triangle, stayed lit for a few seconds and then faded out.  Some 10 mins. or so later, they appeared offshore, just up above the horizon, directly across from our viewpoint.  A total of 5 or 6 of these lights appeared, one by one, first 3 in a curved line (quite similar, in fact, to the Phoenix light UFO&#39;s)on the right, then 2 more on the left side of the curved formation.  Then, just as they faded into view, they would fade out of view one by one.  We saw some more of these lights over the next 15 mins. noticing higher up in the sky a pattern of very faint white or blue star-like lights appearing immediately before the larger orange lights down low, almost as if they were beckoning or transmitting to each other. Ver! y interesting show!<n>

First one large orange ball appeared on horizon.One by one 4 more appeared.They were bright orange in color, as compared to the stars visable, which were yellow in color. These lights were larger than the visable planets.These lights appeared to be moving steadily north-ward.They were clustered together. The lights appeared much larger than the stars/planets visable. (skies were clear).The lights were only there for a few minutes.We saw no streaking light. One second they appeared. Then one by one they completely disappeared, like someone hit a light switch.They were silent,we heard the usual night sounds. I have no idea what they were. I have never before reported unusual lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were organized in a horizontal pattern. First there would be one light, then another. They were larger than stars, and were fully visible for about 3 full seconds before dimming and fading out. We saw a few formations of these lights, about 5 minutes apart and in all different areas of the sky. In total, I think we saw about 5 different appearances of these lights over the course of an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also witnessed flickering/blinking lights directly after seeing the orange lights. These seemed to be moving independently and would cross the sky back and forth with no pattern at all. They seemed to be moving faster than an airplane, and had the ability to change direction or stay in one place. The flickering of these objects was white and seemed to have no constant, regular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although we were trying to get a better look at both of these strange lights through use of binoculars, they were both visible to the naked eye. This was the third night in a row I had witnessed the orange glowing lights, but the first time I had seen the blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

She described it as being very large (bigger than our house), white and shaped like a disk with dome shaped top.  It was not very high by her estimate (probable less than 1000 ft), it was almost motionless and it was silent.  Its edges were rounded instead of being sharp and there appeared to be something like windows around the bottom part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left the house and about one-half mile away she saw it again.  She became excited and told me it was aliens.  I saw the object which I first took to be an airplane seen from the side, but it was motionless and silent.  I could not stop because another vehicle was behind me but I did see it as I drove to a place to stop.  We turned around and drove back to get a look.  We saw the object which was probable less than one-half mile away.  It went from being motionless to assuming a constant speed.  It did not slowly accelerate, it just assumed a speed or velocity. It changed course, moved away from us and quickly went to a distant point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Address 1 Address 2 Address 3 Phone Email<n>

It was extremely bright and it was like someone flipped a switch and suddenly it was there. At first I thought it was a planet but the sun was rising in the east and at that time my wife noticed that it was moving due north toward us. I have a 12 power rifle scope that I bird watch with and I tried to look at the object through it. It was so bright it hurt my eye. A few seconds later the object made a sudden turn toward due east and I watched it fade away in just a few seconds. There is the possibility that it was an aircraft at high altitude but I do not believe that an aircraft could turn so suddenly. Also it seemed to be moving extremely slow though it may have seemed that way if it was flying towards us. End of report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I dont know how to gauge how high it was flying but if you were to hold a penny up at arms length thats how big it was. Maybe 10 to 15 thousand feet high.  It was still dark outside from the waning night which helped me to see its orange light that it was emitting.  The lights on it were static and I could not tell how many lights it had because of how fast it was travelling.  I had taken an astronomy class last summer so I know that it was not a meteor.  It was so quiet but so fast.  There was no smoke or sound I caught it in my right eye almost all the way to the right of the sky and in about 4-5 seconds it had travelled all the way to the left and disapeared from my sight.  I had asked myself about 15 times if I was really seeing this and I know that what ever it was I was not &#34;seeing things&#34;.  I do! nt expect anyone to believe me, so many people have cried wolf who can you believe? Also I go to the methadone clinic and do not have other witnesses so I know I will not be taken seriously but I just want someone with some insight to tell me if everything that I described is true then I might have the answer that most other people are dieing to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it might be a reflection from a ground-based spotlight, (i.e. the kind you&#39;d see at a movie premiere, or in the 20th century fox logo, etc.) but looking closer it appeared to be a shape moving in a linear southbound path.  It was faint enough that I can&#39;t be sure of a coherent outline, but my best guess is that it was bow-shaped, i.e. an archery bow without the string.  Faint amber lights were spread across it, perhaps 10 or 20 in total.  The object was perhaps twice the diameter of the moon in width.  There was fog to the south, and it moved behind that and disappeared.  I kept looking around for another 20 minutes or so, but saw nothing further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First time I&#39;ve seen anything like this, I&#39;m a skeptic about UFO sightings, and it was brief enough that I&#39;m still questioning what exactly I saw, or if it was some kind of optical artifact.  I&#39;m willing to accept that I might be mistaken about all this, but it was still affecting enough that I&#39;m here posting this account.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/7/09 18:40|Port Louis (Mauritius)||Light|3 mins|A flying orange light at dusk moving southwards. It stopped for a while before moving up and disappeared in the pale blue dusk sky.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72756.html|259|ndxe200910| A flying orange light at dusk moving southwards. It stopped for a while before moving up and disappeared in the pale blue dusk sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m reporting from Mauritius. I was driving back home from work. The sky was clear except for few passing isolated clouds. It was almost dusk. While driving I saw an unusually orange light. The time was 18:40 and it was not completely dark. The intensity of the light, its color, its size (too big to be a commercial airplane) were the reasons that attracted my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed the car and continued to follow the light while driving. It was flying to the south and seemed to be growing bigger. At that moment I thought that it must be a commercial plane or a helicopter but still the shape, color, size and intensity of this orange light puzzled me. I stopped the car as I wanted to see the shape of this unusual aircraft as it was almost flying above me by then. But despite the proximity it was with me I could not distinguish any shape behind the light. I would estimate the height of the object at that moment to be about 700m high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment the flying object stopped, which made me believe that it was a helicopter but again strangely I could not see the shape not hear the sound of a helicopter. The flying object then began to move slowly upwards and then started to climb at a higher speed. It finally disappeared without any noticeable sound in the now pale blue sky within 3-4 seconds after starting to move up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/7/09 18:33|Kaunakakai|HI|Other|30:00|sighting of unknown blue shaft of light, no object seen|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72764.html|260|ndxe200910| sighting of unknown blue shaft of light, no object seen<n> <n><n> <n><n> At  about 18:33 Hawaiian Standard Time on 10/07/2009 I saw for over half an hour a very dark blue shaft of light (color was twice as blue as the clear sky) originating approximately WSW of my location in Kaunakakai, Molokai, Hawaii. This beam was uniform in width and did not vary in width or color until the sun set.  I could still see  the same light even after the sun set  but not the same color.  I could still see the same shape but the color was gradually becoming dark grey, however it was in the same position from my location.  This shaft disappeared behind the cloud level about 55 degrees where the cloud level staeted assuming that the horizon is 0 degrees.  Below the clouds it was crystal clear. I estimate the size to be a little smaller than a full moon.  Also the shaft of light was not jagged at all, instead it was razor straight.  When I got to my next meeting, I asked if anyone else say anything and  9 of 10 men saw exactly what I saw.  One person was ab! out 10 miles WNW from me and he and his grandkids also saw the same shaft of blue light.   The curious thing was two wives could not see anything while both husbands saw the light  (18:36 at Kaunakakai). At 20:10 I phoned the police to see if anyone reported anything and no one had.  Also I could not tell if the source was from the sky or ocean (there is no land in that direction) but I suspect it came from above as the shaft never wavered in the slightest at any time.<n>
10/7/09 16:50|Wilkesboro|NC||15 seconds|Object was red and silver with no wings (cigar shaped) moving at slow jet speed.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73147.html|261|ndxe200910| Object was red and silver with no wings (cigar shaped) moving at slow jet speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting on my porch in Wilkesboro NC, I saw a number of ducks in the lake.  I got my binoculars and observed the ducks.  After looking at the ducks, the fluffy clouds caught my attention and I pointed the binoculars aloft.  As I was looking at the clouds, I caught a glimpse of an aircraft.   I observed the object at about 40 degrees above the horizon.  The cloud cover was around 70%.  Initially, (observing for ~ 5 seconds) I thought it was a jet, however; I observed no wings.  It was traveling about as fast a slow jet.  Then I lost it in the clouds.  It briefly came out of the clouds (for another 5 seconds) – same observation.  Back in the clouds, and back out for about another 5 seconds, same observation – then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My binoculars are Nikon Monarchs 10x42 6 degree.  I probably would not have seen the object with the necked eye, which means it was probably ¼ to ½ mile away (guess).  What really caught my eye was the color – bright red.  The color of the rest of the object appeared to be non-shiny silver.  The object was flying south west into the sun.  Later my wife said that the red was a reflection of the sun.  No way – it was like it was painted with red paint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was cylindrical with the front part about twice as big as the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front rounded part was red.  The back portion was silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m speechless now as I sit here. I don&#39;t even believe in stuff like this. But about 17 minutes ago I just seen something that was almost like it was magically. I went outside to smoke a cigarette like I always do before I go to bed. I look at the sky alot because I am interesting in astronomy. I look over to the right side of the porch and through the trees near the river I live I see a bright blue light.. Well I ruled it out not being a air craft because it was moving back and forth over and over again really fast. i ruled it out not being a shooting star because it was just hovering. I ruled it out not being a planet because I know what a planet looks like. I don&#39;tknow what it was. I went inside to tell my mom and sister and when I Came back out it was gone.. I looked all around where it could have been and it wasn&#39;t there anymore.. Idk what just happened.. It was like something out of a damn sci fi movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were not in any distinctive formation but spread across the sky in groups from one to four all traveling at the same speed.  The lights were not close to each other considering the high altitude. The lights filled my field of view and were noticeable wherever I turned my head to look. Higher than jet airliners usually fly over. There were no sound or “wing tip” lights visible. I went into the house to grab some binoculars and returned to find more lights still passing overhead. They were ten power binoculars, but it was like trying to focus on a star. No shape was distinguishable, just light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved along slowly in a strait line for about 3/4 of a mile, this took about 12 seconds, stoped for about 3 seconds and then vanished. It was a clear night with no northren lights.

Seemed to be almost stationary .the lights would go out and relight miles to the east or west. A few times we saw strings of five or more way off in the distance. This went on for about an hour around 20:00 pst. Was wondering if maybe border patrol has some kind of illumination suspended by balloon?  These lights did not to appear to come from the ground, rather they just appeared.  Sometimes they seemed to dim before disappearing, other times they just blinked out instantly.  The re-appearance was always sudden with no trails leading up to them, and always in the same area. There was no discernable sound from these lights,  At one point, two fighter jets appeared in the area.  These jets were accompanied by sound and were obviously moving.  Upon the appearance of the jets, the mysterious lights disappeared.  They did not reappear until the jets had left the area at which time the lights reappeared  in the same area.  There were times when only one light was visible and another light seemed to project out of the initial light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did take pictures but they are not good.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were waiting for moon rise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jupiter was bright in the south sky, but other stars were still dim. I looked up and noticed two stars as bright and large as Jupiter about 15 to 20 degrees above the SSE horizon, and asked &#34;where did those stars come from?&#34;  They were about 1-2 degrees apart, somewhat more than the distance between the stars/nebula in Orion&#39;s belt. My partner asked if they were moving - and I could see they were moving in parallel in a southerly direction, when tracked against another nearby star. They remained bright for another minute or two, then gradually dimmed in unison, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be objects at high altitude, picking up the sun&#39;s reflection, and large enough to resemble Jupiter (not small like a satellite). There were no blinking lights and no indication the objects were lighted themselves, just brightly reflecting the sun&#39;s light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If sighted by anyone else, these objects may be reported as flying over north central New Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose they could have been two airplanes flying in tandem at very high altitude, both brightly reflecting the late sun rays, but it would have been unusual to see two commercial planes flying in the same direction so close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I came outside, I did not see the helicopter but saw a plane way up where planes usually fly at, around 30,000 feet.  I really felt a kind of experience next as I looked to the west north/west in the sky and saw another object. At this moment I saw the plane and the object at the same time and could tell that the plane, moving at a fixed speed, was different than the other object. As I looked at the object longer it started to dominate my vision as the sky around the object began to turn pink and change color. It was moving towards me but in a fashion of looping circles and it was moving clearly faster than the plane as well as different directions. It than took a different direction totally and went behind a cloud. I never have seen an object like this before and I couldn&#39;t stop looking at it. I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane because of the plane of reference that it was near. The cloud was qu! ite big and I never saw the object again. But I have been a skeptic of UFO&#39;s for a long time always saying that if I saw it I would be the judge. This has made me more of a believer. I am not sure if I can explain this in more detail but I had to let someone know about it.<n>

It is not the first time i see this object it would always appear every night, never fails and always between the hours of 12AM and 3AM. The object appears to be a sphere with flickering multi color lights from the distance that i am viewing it from. I knw its not a plane or a star for the simple fact that an actual airplane would pass by and you could clearly tell the diffrence from it and you could tell the diffrence from a star for the simple fact its the only object flickering multi color lights and the stars around it are as normal as they should be. I tried video taping it but my camera would simply not reach the distance. The object would move at a steady but slow pace, and judging from the distance of my view it would ruffly move 5 inches south every 5-10 minutes. I see this object every nigh! t and it does worry me. I am a strong beleiver that we are not the only ones in this world. It would be great if someone explains to me what is there to hide.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The only thing is that it seem to stay in the same place for a long time. I knew it was not a airplane, because they can&#39;t stay in the same spot.  I was sure it could not have been a helacopter either. I still drove toward it thinking maybe it was a tall, bright street lamp. It then started to move across the sky toward Boise, to the South east. I followed for a few miles trying to get a better glimpse of it, then it was gone. I drove back in to Eagle when either the same one or another went across the sky again. We had a better look at it, and still could not figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I approached the city limits just near my house.  I noticed something in the sky moderately above the tree line.  I thought it was a firework at first.  It was a light that had an orange-red color to it.  I focused my eyes on the object thinking since it was not a firework, maybe it was a plane.  After 2 seconds, two more lights appeared above the first light.  This formation was two lights on the top and one on the bottom.  All three lights stayed lit for about 4 seconds and then it disappeared at once.  At no time were these lights moving.  It was too large to be an aircraft.  I could not explain to myself what this object was.  There was a vehicle behind me and I almost stopped the person to see if they saw this object too.  I am in excellent health, no mental problems, and I am not crazy.  I dont know what this object was.  But, I do know that this was not your normal lights that appear in the night&#39;s sky. ! It was somewhat cloudy on that night on the way home.  There were breaks in the clouds as it went back and forth between clouds and stars.  Either way, I saw this weird object and I am not sure what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Unusually low on horizon. Maneuvered like a jet/airplane cannot, hovered in air very close to my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 10:30pm and I was taking my dogs for a walk down the street. As I turned the corner to take my dogs to their favorite spot I noticed that in the clearing in the trees to the south at the end of the street, there were 2 very bright, crystal white stars sitting unusually low on the horizon line. One sitting significantly lower than the other, and slighty to the right.  As I continued to look I noticed that they had a reddish tinge to them at times so I thought they could be planets, but still very strange. I looked away for a moment to let my dogs go to the bathroom then looked back up at the objects. When I looked back up it appeared as if the lower of the two objects might have possibly been moving upward a bit, but the movement was so miniscule I thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me. That’s when the object sped up and began weaving from left to right in an upwardly fashion. This was when I first realized I was seeing something very ou! t of the ordinary.  The object continued to weave upward until in was parallel with the higher object. At that point seemingly stopped moving completely, but started getting brighter.  I realized then that it hadn’t stopped moving but was instead moving straight toward me. It was headed due north. I was frozen in place so I stood and watched as the object got so close that it seemed to be just right down the street I was standing on, maybe a couple miles in the sky, if that.  I stood there, dumbfounded for a solid 30 seconds, then a car came down the road. I stood in front of the car and tried to get him to stop so he could witness this too, but after a few honks of his horn I realized he wasn’t going to be cooperating with me. So he passed by and I continued standing there staring at this mysterious light hovering so conspicuously in the sky wondering if anyone else was seeing it. After a stare-down with the object for about another minute I began walking away keeping my head! cocked over my shoulder, making sure not to take my eyes off ! of the l ight. The very second that I started walking, the object followed. I walked about 50 feet then turned my body around. The light stopped moving as well and at that point I yelled, very loudly, 	“What do you want?” 	No response of course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So began another stand-off. After what seemed like about a minute I began walking away again, and once again the mysterious floating light followed. But this time after about 25 feet it began to ascend and head north east, gaining incredible speed in a very short time. It took about 10 seconds for it to completely disappear from sight, but as it passed by the moon I saw that it left a strange looking trail. The trail looked misty and translucent, but also unusually linear (unlike a jet, whose exhaust billows out of the back of the craft, and spreads out almost immediately). It also made a very low, faint humming noise that I had not noticed until it passed overhead. After the object disappeared  I looked back to the south to see if the other light was still there. It wasn’t. So I quickly scanned the sky looking to see if it had moved. When I turned to the north, in the exact opposite direction I had originally seen the objects, I spotted another light, but this one quickly ! shot up, then back down and out of sight behind a dense patch of trees. I then ran home and told my whole family. Theres no doubt in my mind that what I saw was not of this world. Whatever this technology was is far too advanced for anything I’ve ever heard of or seen besides the only obvious explanation.

I was sober and wide awake because I was a 3rd shift worker at the time.  The streets were deserted as usual for this time of morning. I came to a stoplight at a 3 way intersection about 1 mile from my home.  When I came to a stop I quickly noticed something that looked as though it was falling from the sky.  I looked up to my left toward this ball of rolling light as it got closer and I was just in shock.  In seconds it “crashed” on and rolled across the hood of my car and continued to roll down onto the curb and onto the side walk where the color changed from this bright yellow color to a purple gaseous color.  It was still for maybe 2 seconds and then shot straight up into the night’s sky. The light turned green and I continued to sit at the stoplight looking up, waiting to see more, but I didn’t.  It just disappeared.  I probably sat there for! 4 or 5 minutes before slowly driving home. I couldn’t believe what I saw.  It was all I thought about that night. I only told one person, who thought I was crazy and from then on I kept my mouth shut about it.  But I still think about it and I still watch the sky, waiting to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Need clarification.<n> <n><n> <n><n> December 23, 2001    To whom it may concern,   On or about October 5, 2009 I was outside at night and became interested in taking a photo of the moon through some over-hanging trees. The moon was full or nearly so, the sky was a bit misty, and it looked like it would make an interesting shot. There was a very dim incandescent yellow light behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shooting with a digital camera and had the flash off. The camera was set on auto-focus. Because it was dark I couldn’t be certain I had correct focus, and the camera was hand-held so I couldn’t be certain I was holding it still enough to preclude blurring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took 6 or 7 shots right in a row, over the course of about a minute, without changing position. I did change the zoom a bit with each shot, blindly attempting to bracket the shots in hopes of getting at least one crisp, focused, and non-blurred image of the leaves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime later I viewed the pictures on my computer. Only then did I discover that one of the images had a blue orb in it. I did not notice the object while taking the pictures.  I was using the LCD monitor at arms’ length for composition; the camera is otherwise a viewfinder that’s difficult to use, especially at low light levels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t assumed it was a UFO or a “physical” object. But I am no less curious about it, and wonder if I can have the picture analyzed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought perhaps it was a refraction within the lens. But, again, this orb appears in just one picture and not the others despite the fact all were shot at the same time under exactly the same conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When enlarging the image on my computer there doesn’t seem to be a clear indication that it is the result of refraction. Further, at maximum enlargement, the blue orb seems to have structural depth, though this might be pixel positioning or pixel structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considering the potential, however slight, for actual structural depth, coupled with a little imaginative assumption, I thought it might be a disc traveling perpendicular to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is round, powder blue, and looks like a ball. It looks much like a planet might look if observed through a powerful telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shooting more or less straight up and overhead while facing roughly ESE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t altered or otherwise fiddled with this image. You’ll notice that there are “holes” in the image, areas where my camera media-card is losing pixels. I was tempted to “fix” these, but decided against it to preserve the image “exactly as it was taken”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am e-mailing the picture to you too. Not knowing your parameters I’ll send two copies, one at the original size and the other reduced to “e-mail sizing”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

There were about 30 lights or more, all together forming a swarm of lights just moving around and making different shapes, they were brighter than the stars that were around them and some of them changed colors, from white to baby blue.

As I am looking through the sky I see this very very bright object flying across the sky at a high velocity!! faster than a air plane, helicopter, or blimp!! It looked like a very bright sphere shaped object off of ufo videos that I normally see! And it was flying very fast and as it was flying over me I saw a very very small light behind it.. So maybe it could of been a military aircraft??? but i dont think there are any military bases around my area where I live.. And I can also hear it too! But as soon as I saw my neighbor across the street I screamed his name and I said &#34;look at that ufo!!&#34; and he said &#34;oo no thats the lights from universal studios!!&#34; and I said &#34; you don&#39;t see that! bright light flying across the sky?&#34; and he kept looking at the universal studios lights.. Then I found that to be very odd... because that light was extremely bright and low to the ground... I know that sounds crazy and you might think that I have been smoking some shit, but no I dont smoke weed... But it was crazy.. Then it flew away and disappered in the clouds..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was a ball on top with a poll going down attached to another ball at the bottom.  I said “Balloon”.  My father said it was too big.  I thought it was odd how it was flying  - Not moving – If they were balloons on a string there would be some movement but it was moving like it was all one piece.  Also it was only straight up and down with one ball on the top and the other on the bottom.  I ran and got binoculars.  It was hard to hold the binoculars steady enough but I saw faint pink, yellow and then white lights on the balls. The poll between the balls was to thick to be a string. I put the binoculars down to look at it with my eyes and it flashed (Like a camera flash) and it was gone.  It was a bright sunny day with blue skies and some puffy clouds.  My father did not see the flash because he was not looking at the time.  He estimated the size as! about half that of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When i looked out, i seen a very low object with a bright white light (non blinking) and a red (blinking light) fly diagonally in my view. I tried to rationalize this saying this has to be a helicopter. But i noticed as it started to fly out of sight. a few more lights came on, at this point i started to shake, because it became startling. Therefor i cant say for sure how many lights came on, i would say 4 would be the best answer. i remember 2 of them were red and the other ones were white, a few of them were blinking. The best way to explain this sight would be a triangle flying on its side. Could this be a new government craft?, I don&#39;t know. But I know what i saw, and it wasn&#39;t anything that I&#39;m used to seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I noticed 2 bright lights very high in the eastern sky moving slowly southward. These lights appeared to go dim before they disappeared, after that we seen streaks of light in the area. This is not the first time we have seen odd lights moving through the sky here. Sometimes we have seen moving lights that emits beams of light, flashes of light, multiple lights moving together and lights moving at a high rate of speed making 90 degree turns. I guess what is really weird about all of this is we have had this happen directly over us sometimes and not one time has there been any sound?<n>

He thought it was a light tower, but my other friend who&#39;s house we had just left said &#34;there are no light towers around here&#34;. Right after he said that we spotted another one. They seemed to be stationary in the sky. We stopped on a bridge over a creek to get a better look when all of a sudden they started to move. Next more of them, one by one, started to appear seemingly from the creek. Three of them formed a perfect triangle and then a perfectly straight line(stopping for a few seconds each time). We sat on the bridge for about 10 minutes and saw about 15 or 20 orbs floating/dancing oddly but gracefully through the sky. As I stared at them individually I could not tell exactly how close or far away they where, or what was making them glow. When we started driving away I kept looking back and saw them spanning the whole s! kyline behind us. Regretfully none of us got any pictures or videos. But I found pictures and video online from some sightings in the UK that looks exactly like what we saw. That was probably the craziest thing I have ever experienced. Now I carry a video camera with me everywhere now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the left side of the car, shinning down into a valley, appeared three green (light in color) triangular beams of light, each the same proportion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we believed the lights were coming from a helicopter.  However, why were they green and triangular?<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds, I stopped the car and rolled down the car windows.  There were no sounds from a helicopter or anything else, only silence.

The objects were absolutely silent. The weather was clear and ground level winds reported at zero MPH. The objects approached from the west and curved to the north before disappearing into the night. The objects   near the end seemed to speed up as if they were trying to catch up with the main formation. From a distance the objects appeared to be spherical in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed low and at first, maybe some sort of pyrotechnic display.  After moving higher and to the north the burning cape seemed to disappear but the red glowing ball was still moving in a northern direction. To describe its path better, picture the pattern the moon takes as it is rising, but speed it up so it happens in a couple minutes instead of 8 hours.  The object went behind trees and I was able to see it once through some branches, then I never saw it again.  This object made no sudden movements, but looked like it had some sort of flight plan.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I (ages 46 and 54 at the time) had just dropped our college sophomore daughter off at her apartment (18th and Kentucky Streets) after taking her to dinner, and before we pulled out of the parking lot, we saw a strange glowing ball of light low in the northern sky and moving South in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was coming from a power line following the same direction, but quickly realized it was not, and it was so unusual (I am an Aerospace Engineer and multi-engine rated Private pilot) that I had to pull over to watch it.  We both observed it for several minutes as it appeared to continually/slowly move South and increase in altitude.  When it was approximately overhead, it appeared to quit moving laterally but continued to rise until it was out of site.  We did not hear any sounds emanating from it and saw no other aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the nearest airport&#39;s (North of the sighting area) manager the next day to ask if he knew of any aircraft departing the previous evening or of anyone launching a Chinese lantern from the airport area; he didn&#39;t.  I also Googled to see if I could find anyone reporting what I saw; I found nothing.  So, I laid it to rest, but was so mystified that I entered the date in my PC&#39;s calendar, so when I just discovered this website, I was able to check out reports for that date.  Sadly, there were none similar or in the area on that same date.<n>

I was standing in the door way looking out into our back yard which is just a giant open empty field with a few clumps of trees and I saw a light in the tree line that I thought was a four wheeler.  Basically I the only way it could have been a four wheeler or ATV would be if it was hanging in the tree.  I screamed for my boyfriend to come out of the bedroom to check it out and when he did he took one look at whatever this was ran out to grab the dog and ran back inside.  We both stood there and blinked to try and make sense of what we were seeing.  The light got brighter and bigger and was just in one spot for a minute or two. I got freaked out and ran into the bedroom and hid under the covers.  My boyfriend stood there and said that after the light became really bright it quickly shot up into the air till he couldn&#39;t see it any longer.  I was scared for the rest of the night and every noise I hea! rd made me even more scared.  I almost jumped into the car to go stay at a hotel.  And just so you know I don&#39;t believe in things unless I can see them with my own eyes and this made me a believer in something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As I looked up I saw what I thought was the light of a airplane moving across the night sky. I noticed it because it was a very clear night, I did not see a single cloud in the sky, The light was moving toward me and looked like a star, I could tell it was very far away, I watched it for about 45 seconds and during that time it moved from north to south and I saw it zig-zag a few times during it&#39; s trip, Then it stopped and I thought, There is a UFO or a satalite or something so I watched it for a few minutes maybe 15 or 20 and during that time I saw 3 shooting stars. I have no doubt it was a craft of some kind positioning it&#39;s self to watch the meteors. Man or other it was a UFO to me. If anyone else sen it report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I work second shift and got off work at 12:00A.M. At first I thought the lights were search lights for planes because the airport is nearby. I kept seeing the lights too frequently for them to be search lights or even the giant spot lights used sometimes when a car dealership is having a big sale. When I got to my exit, I pulled off to the side of the road and exited my car. I saw 4 large white lights going around in circles. They would meet in the center and spread quickly back out again. I guess I stood out there about 5 or 10 minutes just looking up in wonder and amazement. I am female, and as cars came up the exit, not one stopped to see why I was standing by the side of the road, looking up and pointing at the sky. I called my sister who works at Wal-Mart third shift, just a few miles away and told her something was going in the sky and described what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to Wal-Mart, I went in and got my sister and one of her co-workers to come outside and look at the sky. They were also witnesses to the lights. As one lady was leaving the store, I pointed to the sky and told her to look at the sky. Her reaction was, &#34;Oh, my God.&#34;  As long as I live I will never forget what I saw last night. NEVER!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I took a few side steps to the left, and as soon as the back of the car was out of my view, that&#39;s when i saw a cigar shaped object zoomed downwards in the distance probably no more than 5 miles away from where i was. This cigar shaped object flew down to much at an angle, and going way too fast to be a plane. It had two streaks of lights more towards the front. We stayed at our location for another 20 min or so and i did not see this object return into the sky, i truly believe that i did see a UFO or ET spacecraft of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I captured  them on digital video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the binoculars the glowing blue lights looked like cylinders and the smaller white light looked liked a little flying thing with a red light on it. I really could not make out the shape.  They were a little farther away to the east than they were the other nights I saw them.  From the posts I have read, these craft are hanging around for many months.  I will try to get better video if they come back again.<n>

We all asked each other if we had seen it, we had. about 30 sec later it showed up again out the drivers window (north) and we all started yelling and I pulled over, by the time I had stopped it was gone. We got out of the car and  it popped up in front of us again. So I took out my little camera and waited, a few sec later saw it way far off to the north east, really dim then it kind of blinked out and it was right in front of us again but there was 2 of them. They just hung there for about 10 to 20 sec, I got some video of them then they just disappeared. All the cars that had been behind us had pulled over and were watching, and a man pulled up next to us and asked if we were seeing this! . While we were talking they re-appeared but this time there were 3 of them, they just hung there then kind of bounced up and down, hung there again, then they were just gone. I also go a little of that on camera. All of a sudden it seemed there were jets coming from all directions, there had been no sound until the jets showed up, and after the jets came we didn&#39;t see the lights again. They were very large and bright orange, similar to looking a street lamp from about 50yards away. It really was the most awesome thing I have ever seen. I have the footage on my camera but have not downloaded it yet, I also drew a pic but I have no scanner.  My son was scared out5 of his mind, my husband and I were both really excited, as was the man that pulled up next to us. The whole thing lasted about 20 min or so we stayed and watched for nearly half an hour more and saw nothing else except lots of jets flying around. My family watched out the back window of my truck the whole way home ! and saw nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Which I won) and while looking at the mountains to the west, I saw two white lights. They were lower than the mountains and did not move. They did not flash, and they looked like the classic DC lights or something. They appeared to be very close together because I knew they were below the mountains. I only got a very short look at them because we were just driving by and I did not want to look stupid by telling everyone this. I know that in the area, the Air Force Academy does glider flights for pilot training. However, the lights were not flashing in any way and did not appear to move. However I still believe that these lights could not be explained with a normal explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Able to move very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 6 lights. 3 to the east of Denver and 3 to the southeast. Fairly stationary, although at times one from each group would change position and move up, down or either side very quickly and over time they all were seen to move around, so we knew they weren’t stars, and planes just don’t move like that. The lights were super bright, but would intermittently go dim and then come back bright again and seemed to strobe a little bit. We thought they might be helicopters, and drove to the east to see if we could get close enough to see shape with binoculars. They couldn’t be helicopters like we thought because we would have gotten closer, but we got no closer at all and  then we realized how bright they must be and how fast the one that moved around must be moving. We decided they must either be in orbit or over Kansas somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I told him &#34;yeah, why?&#34; and he proceeded to tell me that something happened the night before.  He knew that I have had at least 10-15 horrible nightmares about alien abduction since I was a child (I am 32 now and have been having these dreams since I was 6-7 years old).  He didn&#39;t want to tell me, but he told me to make sure I was okay and to go to the bathroom and take a shower and look over myself.  He was really upsetting me, I refused to go and look until he told me what was going on, and finally he told me that he had a &#34;dream&#34; that he woke up and something was holding him down and he saw something &#34;weird&#34;.  I told him it was just a dream and sleep paralysis. My husband is/was more of a skeptic regarding aliens and the conspiracy theories than I ever have been.  And he then said &#34;no, you don&#39;t understand, I don&#39;t have sleep issues, and I know what I saw&#34;.  He went on to explai! n that first he heard what sounded like shuffling around the bed.  The lights were off, but due to ambient light from a distant bathroom nightlight, he could see small shadows when he moved his eyes down as far as he could.  He said his first thought was to wake me up, and he couldn&#39;t move and he couldn&#39;t make any noise to wake me.  He said &#34;all I could do was move my eyes around, I couldn&#39;t talk or move or anything, it was scary as hell&#34;.  He said finally he was able to move his head down a little and when he did he said there was something the size of our son standing right beside the bed kind of &#34;looking&#34; at him.  He said when his head moved, this &#34;something&#34; jumped back a little, like it was surprised.  He said he then felt like something larger was in the doorway of our bedroom and he heard shuffling again like what ever it was, it was going away from the bed, and he fell asleep.  To let you know, our son was, at that time, had just turned 7 years old and was about 3&#39;3! &#34; - 3&#39;5&#34; tall.  He said that he knew there was more than one o! f these things in the room and, again, it was &#34;like something bigger was in the doorway&#34; he said to me.  I do not recall anything that happened that evening whatsoever. But my husband was so intent, he even bought a black light to inspect the carpet around the bed and got on his hands and knees to find anything that would prove it to me.  The strangest part of this was that we switched sides of the bed that evening for the first time in 7 years, because I told him &#34;I just want to sleep here&#34;.  I had no real reason why and I haven&#39;t done that since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note, my husband is not the only person who has told me this has happened to them while I was in the room with them, sleeping.  My father also explained to me that a few times in 1979, when I was a couple of months old, that &#34;demons came out&#34;, held him down to where he couldn&#39;t speak or move. He blamed it on my mother, now his ex-wife.  He said that once he was divorced from her, the &#34;demons quit visiting the house.&#34;  When they were divorced, I moved with my mother.  He told me that he remembered these &#34;demons&#34; holding him down a lot from 1979-1983 - 1983 being the year my mother left him.  My mother collaborated this story when I asked her.  I asked her if anything odd ever happened in her sleep when i was a baby / kid.  She said sometimes she would wake up scared and unable to talk but that it was just &#34;night terrors&#34;. My father told me this because he was trying to convince me that my mother was evil (bad divorce, even still today), and I personally and directly! asked my mom if she ever had anything weird happen to her while she was asleep around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another time in 1994, my best friend was staying the night with me and claimed to be held down in her sleep.  She said she couldn&#39;t see me or hear me but I must have &#34;drugged&#34; her because the room was bright white, and she couldn&#39;t move or talk.  She was extremely upset because of how scared she was, and continually blamed me.  We were not friends after this because she truly believed I drugged her with something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ex-fiance also claimed that he was &#34;so sick&#34; he couldn&#39;t get up in the middle of the night - (we were both fighting a cold at the time). He said &#34;I couldn&#39;t move or talk or nothing and it was like something was holding me down&#34;.  He also said that when he could finally move that he got up to tell me about it, but I was not there in the house.  He said that I must have got up in the middle of the night to party.  But when he woke up the next morning, he said I was back in bed with him.  He even asked me what time I got back in that morning.  I did not leave and we fought about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have dreams about abduction, they are very vivid and I can recall a lot about my dreams; however, I do not recall these dreams on the nights that I can remember that my husband, friend, and ex-fiance told me they were held down.  The details and information in these dreams are extremely odd to me - such as the texture of skin when they are holding my hand, a difference in feeling light/heavy, and information given to me.  The dreams have been nightmarish in nature because it&#39;s generally scary seeing these things, but things that happen in the dream are really not so bad.  Only once was the dream a complete, horrific nightmare and oddly enough, the aliens in that dream were different than the other dreams.

10/1/09 23:00|Fairfield|CT|Light|20 seconds|2 seperate observations. Fairfield, CT|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72901.html|309|ndxe200910| 2 seperate observations. Fairfield, CT<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figure I would submit my observations, though it has been a few weeks since the events had accrued.  I guess the events took place around the 1st of October.  I smoke cigarettes out side my home and observe the night sky every night.  I live around NYC region and see many planes travel over my home, and so I would consider my self capable of identifying a plane easily in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first observation.  I saw a bright light breaking through the tree line on a clear night, at a height I observe many planes around 11PM.  At first I figured it was a plane coming at me in a direct line, and I was observing a line of sight to its head lights, although it was brighter than most planes, so I decided to observe it longer than I typically would for other night sky lights.  The path the light was traveling was coming at me and it did travel directly over my house and off into the southern tree line.  What I would typically see when a plane travels in this fashion would be. First the head lights when it is traveling towards me. 2nd the underbelly lights as it traveled above me. 3rd the head lights would dim and fade to black as it passed away from me, and I would observe the tail lights and the underbelly lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well this light didn&#39;t follow those rules and it sutatined its single point of light through it entire traverse of the night sky and maintained its lluminosity.  It did appear to be low in the sky although I can&#39;t declare how far that would be.  It made no noise.  After it passed beyond my ability to see it, I noticed that there were many planes in the night sky, more than usual, and their paths didn&#39;t follow what is typically the flying paths for airliners and personal aircraft comiing in and  out of the airports around my area.  Made me think that I wasn&#39;t the only person to observe this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, it was over cast but it wasn&#39;t raining.  I was observing the moon light breaking through the cloud cover and it resembled the NASA Black Brant XII cloud dispersal I viewed on Youtube.  I watched the moon light break through the clouds for awhile as it sustained the appearance of the Rocket launch for awhile.  I have to mention that I felt that something was going to happen, it was odd, and it made me uncomfortable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked into the northern sky and observed a light break the tree line, it was followed by 2 other lights. They appear to hold the points of a triangle and were traveling to the south. When I declared to my self that this was not something that I had ever observed before, the 3 lights broke formation and the leading light changed direction towards the west and the other 2 lights followed, but didn&#39;t take the paths of what I would say are typical of things I have seen in the night sky (radical and some what random change of direction.) It was a short event and lost sight of them in the western tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

10/1/09 22:30|Belmont|MS|Triangle|2MINS|Triangular object with 3 lights, one in middle blinking.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72719.html|311|ndxe200910| Triangular object with 3 lights, one in middle blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my daughter were driving home, both in separate vehicles. It was 10:30 at night in rural Northeast MS.  My daughter was ahead of me in her car she saw the lights first then as I came up on them I almost ran off the road trying to see what the object was.  We both saw a line of lights with one in the middle blinking, it was  hovering above the ground just taller than the power lines. The closer we got the more triangular shaped the object seemed.  My daughter then called my cell phone to see if I was seeing what she was seeing.  By this time I had drove past the object but could still see it in my rear view mirror. I decided to turn around and go back to get a better look when I got back to the spot, the object was gone.  Nothing flying off in the distance, no trees blowing around from it, no noise, nothing.  When I had first saw it flashing in the distance I was thinking when did we get a cell tower there but as I got closer I realized it wasn’t attac! hed to anything. It was just hovering above the power lines and then it was gone. I don’t know what it was and I am not saying it was alien in origin but it was definitely unknown to us what it was.  Also in the mid nineties me and my sister where driving from our parents house to my house and as we crossed over a railroad track a glowing green orb dropped down out of the sky, hovered for a second in front of us and then flew off.  We looked at each other in disbelief then drove on home.  Of course when you tell people these things they look at you like you are crazy.  This I do know:  first I am a Christian who believes the bible is the true inspired Word of God and it is infallible,  second that I don’t believe in little green men and aliens that are visiting us and checking out how we live on earth, and third that I’m not crazy I did see something I could not identify Twice!!!!<n>

At first I thought it was an airplane but than I compared it to another plane off in the distance and they just weren’t the same. This ship was moving smoothly and the lights on it were different. It had two red lights on the outside and blue lights coming from the inside. It looked like a shadow of a disk against the dark sky. I’ve never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/1/09 19:00|Grafton|WV|Sphere|2 minutes|Orange Orb in West Virginia|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72694.html|314|ndxe200910| Orange Orb in West Virginia<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, around seven in the evening, I was driving home from the store when I saw an orange orb to my left. I was driving down Hospital Hill when I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew across the sky from my left to my right behind some trees out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I arrived at the bottom of the hill, I saw it still flying down Main Street in the Fetterman area above some houses across the street from where I live. It moved rather slow. I watched it fly over a few houses across the street from where I reside and then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was a rather small orange orb.  It had no other lights on it.  It pulsated an orange glow. It did not make any sound or noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked my car outside my house.  I did not see it reappear.  This is not the first time I have seen an orb in my area.  This is the first orange UFO I have seen, though.  The others were different colors.  I have a few on video if you are interested in viewing them.  However, I was driving this time and did not have my camera with me.<n>
10/1/09 18:00|Memphis|TN|Oval|Twice - 1-5 minute sighti|Day and Night - Saw object twice c.2009.  3-witnesses.  Very similar to that object in the Tulsa OK sighting c.1965.|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88656.html|315|ndxe200910| Day and Night - Saw object twice c.2009.  3-witnesses.  Very similar to that object in the Tulsa OK sighting c.1965.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1 Day, early evening hour, I was outside smoking on my carport.  As I was looking across the road over the tree line, a metal object traveled up and over the tops of trees.  It was silver with a copper strap that ran down the middle of it.  It was not &#34;floating&#34;, it traveled with purpose.  It stopped and start on its way.  I hollered to my husband who was inside the house, to look out the window, by the time I went to knock on the window to get his attention it moved off towards the North East, until it disappeared behind tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Day 2 - Was a night time sighting.  First seen by my husband, then me, and then my daughter driving up the road from her work. We are in the country, no streetlights, so we saw it very clearly. It was the same object I had seen a month or so ago, (Day 1) but it was illuminated from within. No lights flickering, no blinking parts, no noise or sound.  It traveled slowly up and over the same tree line, then moved paralell to the tree line, and the illumination went off. We could not see or track it from then as it faded into the dark sky. Haven&#39;t seen it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was the size and shape of the pilot cockpit of a hellicopter. Silver with copper strap down the middle of it.  It traveled with purpose and silent.  Was not a balloon or blimp. NAS Millington could not confirm nor deny seeing it on radar.  And basically made my husband feel like an idiot for calling with the information and sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a photo of what I saw.... I was watching a UFO special on TV one day and saw the exact same object on the TV!!!  I rewound it and took a photo off my TV screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw is very similar to the photo of the sighting of Tulsa, OK c.1965.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The light was only visible for seconds then disappeared but was able to get a picture of it. It was approximately 3:38 P.M. and I was chasing a storm through Whitefield, Oklahoma.  After this event there were no other similar happenings along the storm&#39;s track.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Got out binoculars and saw a gray, triangular object tilted at an angle with lights at corners. Object hovered and stayed in one place for about an hour. Checked on it periodically. It was quite high up, near clouds but could be clearly seen with binoculars. Did not appear to be a plane or anything else recognizeable. Could not determine size but must have been fairly large to see at that distance. Was not a reflection in my skilight. Too high for blimp or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then it hovered over one area for about 5 minutes then slowly moved east. It had two blinking red lights at the bottom of it and didn&#39;t make a sound as it hovered. It also had white lights that didn&#39;t blink at all. It also appeared to have some sort of windows, but it was getting too dark to see. I&#39;m positive it wasn&#39;t a plane or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While still in his bathroom he heard a vibrating hum outside, then went back to his bedroom and looked out the window.  He saw within 20 feet of his window an object hovering slightly up and down, holding a position between our house and a wooded area approximately 100 feet away from our house.  The object appeared to him at this close distance to be approximately as wide as his room, about 12 feet wide, and approximately 5 feet in height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was shaped like a flattened football with a dome on top.  My son said if looked down on from above the object would have been shaped like a circle.  The dome appeared to be made of green glass.  The object was colored all black except for a pattern of three sets of square-shaped lights on the side which alternated flashing lights of green, blue, and red.  The object appeared to be disc-shaped, but the left and right edges, from his perspective, had blue lights that glowed continuously and did not flash.  The object hovered there for a few seconds and then moved slowly up and away from our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and not raining.  Behind the object was a dark background of dense trees.  My son&#39;s window is approximately 15-20 feet above our basement patio, and my son said it appeared to be close enough to be partially over the patio.  The patio extends out from the side of the house approximately 15 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke when I heard my son opening and closing doors in the hall when he was going to the bathroom.  I heard him speaking to his younger brother for a few seconds, and then he came to my bedroom and told my husband and me what he had seen.  It was then that I checked the time and it was about 4:35 a.m.  My son was afraid, but calmly related what he saw.  Later this morning after breakfast I asked him with nonleading questions to describe what he saw and to draw a picture of it.  He described the incident the same as he described it at 4:35 this morning, and the picture he drew matches the description of what he described verbally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
