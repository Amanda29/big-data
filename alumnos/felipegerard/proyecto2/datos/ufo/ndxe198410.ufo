( th|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40552.html|1|ndxe198410| Driving in a thick pea soup fog. Car headlights went out suddenly. I had seen &#34;Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind&#34; a few years ago.  (therefore the date I gave above is only an estimate)  When the lights went out suddenly, I pulled to the right side of interstate 70.  I was headed south.  My 2 companions were go-go dancers.  I was taking them home. I stopped the car and thought that the senario reminded me of the aformentioned movie.  The fog was thick but when I looked to my right I saw a farm house  thousands of yards away that had a large red light above it.  It illuminated the whole area.  I thought at first it was a helicopter searching for some lost kids or something.  But the red light stayed fixed on the farmhouse.  I noticed there was no sound. The huge red light and no sound made me suspicious.  I tried to figure a a reasonable explanation for it, but could find none.  I kept thinking that the red light would move, but it didn&#39;t.  The light was so large, I reasoned, that it could not be a helicopter, either. ( I had not read any ufo books on abductions at this time.  Only later did I realize that what I saw appeared to be a classic abduction case.) After watching it for a half hour or more, I realized that this could be a UFO.  I raised my right hand,( in a form of greeting, with palm foreward) and said in my mind.  &#34;I have a son at home, please don&#39;t take me.&#34;  I felt immediately a tingling sensation on my palm, like they had heard my message.  I tried to awaken the two women in the back seat.  However, they did not wake up, no matter how I tried to make them.  I blieve I finally saw the light move some to my right, slowly. Still no sound.  After some time of watching the red light, I fell asleep.  I drove back home  hours later when it was light, as my lights still did not work.  I took the car to a repair shop and asked them pointedly about what caused my headlights to go out.  They said they did not know.  I had to have both headlights replaced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This UFO has been describe|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46178.html|2|ndxe198410| My wife and I saw one of the more common UFO&#39;s that have been seen in New Mexico, Arizona, and other places. This UFO has been described as having several lights that are turned on and off, and described as being very large, square, pizza shaped, and very quite or silent. And capable of moving extremely slow for it&#39;s size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the UFO up close and analyzed it closely to try and figure out how it was able to stay suspended at such a slow speed, and wondered how it was powered, and naturally if it was human.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I noticed first off, was that the body skin was made of dimensional metal that was riveted. This told me that it was indeed an Earthly craft. I then noticed a retractable landing gear that was in fact folded up under the wing structure, that I also see as being earthly in structure, shaped for a gear and tire setup. Then the two most telling and interesting features that I noticed was; the thickness of the wing and craft structure, the center fuselage and intake and exhaust louvers. These features, not only were all suggestive of human engineering, but explained clearly how the craft worked as it did. This craft was able to fly slowly and quietly because it was designed to use the very large wing structure as both a muffler for the internal jet engines, and as a source of lift, similar to that of a hot air balloon, by trapping the exhaust heat within that large thick wing structure, thus allowing it to fly very slow and quiet. In trying to guess the thickness of the wing structure from what I was viewing, I’d have to guess that it was between eight and twelve foot thick, plenty of room for both the jet engines and the space to create the volume of heat storage to create the lift that was needed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusion is this; Not only is this a human aircraft, but it is in fact an American made aircraft. In my opinion it was designed and built to fool the naive and the inexperienced, so as to stimulate fears within the American public for the intention of justifying research and development projects that would otherwise be deemed unnecessary. A way of continuing to justify some ‘special interest groups cash flow’. That is partly why this individual UFO effort is done most always at night, and when not done at night, then from great distances away from people’s analytical view. Are we to believe that the American air space is this vulnerable to invasion? And if by chance this is the case, then we need to do something about that!  We should not allow our selves to be fooled by such ridiculous efforts. And we should cut all funding to those who are responsible for such antics. Our time and hard earned money should be spent on justifiable projects, not hoaxes. Don’t get me wrong. Though, I do not logically believe that any physical spacecraft could ever cross the vastness of the space between earth and it’s closest star safely and within a reasonable and rational amount of time to justify ever doing it   with living creatures inside, because it would take at least 100 years at extremely unsafe speeds as we know them. A small pebble would pierce any spacecraft that we humans could potentially  build today, if able to travel anywhere near the speed of light which is only half as fast as would be necessary to even get close to traversing such a vast span of space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could how ever rationalize potentially sending a very small, strong, highspeed craft that was projecting different types of signaled information, across our galaxy for the sake of it potentially being heard someday by another intelligent and more advanced planet, within our own galaxy, that possibly could sent something back directly at us to let us know that they are too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don’t think for a second that I don’t believe in unexplained objects seen in space, because I myself have seen such phenomena, and absolutely could not rationalize what it was, that I was seeing. These objects or images were both viewed on clear nights without any apparent visual interference about 30 years apart. They were to far away to have a shape or visual image other than a single light source. They both were actually being see as faint stars that just suddenly seemed to start moving. Both changed directions several times. They both gave the appearance of extreme acceleration for the distance that they were considered to be at. Then they both appeared to accelerate directly towards us, in that the small faint light grew to several times the brightness then both seemed to turn and fade as if traveling away, then streaked off very quickly and vanished as if flying out of view distance wise very quickly or as if turning the light way or off as it accelerated. Neither one flickered or turned off as if it were actually a mechanical light. Neither one ever was heard, thou other small aircraft could be heard and seen around the same time in other parts of the sky. Those events really boggled my mind, because of the situation that was taking place at the moment that they appeared. I was left with pondering a potential spiritual involvement as much as anything else. I can explain later if anyone is interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!

First, there were distinct flashing colored lights (red, green, maybe blue)around the perimeter of the light, blinking on and off. Most importantly was it&#39;s movement - it would move quickly from right to left or up and down (or vice versa) and then come to a dead stop before immediately dashing off in another direction at a 45 degree angle. This was observed by my college roommate and myself while we attended Grand Valley State College in Allendale, MI (near Grand Rapids). We first noticed the &#34;star&#34; moving through the night sky while we driving back to our dorm. I thought at first it might be an illusion, because we were driving, but then my roommate (who was the driver) mentioned it to me. We stood in the parking lot outside our dorm and watched it moving, occasionally confirming to each other which way we observed it moving, just to make sure that we were both really seeing this thing. We watched for about 15 to 20 minutes before going inside, the object still doing it&#39;s manuevers in the sky. I could kick myself now for not reporting it to campus security or trying to document it somehow, but I was just a goofy college kid!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

10/15/84 23:00|New Boston|TX|Egg|1 hour|Controled flight. Extremely low altitude. Extremely slow speed. NO SOUND! Observed at close distances.|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39854.html|5|ndxe198410| ((Follow-up report from same witness.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Controled flight. Extremely low altitude. Extremely slow speed. NO SOUND! Observed at close distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to Peter Grabiel&#39;s new video on MTV as I walked out and stood in the cool, crisp, night air of mid-October. The East Texas sky was clear and, as usual, filled with millions of twinkling stars. I could see the Dairy Queen sign that stands beside HWY.8 and was watching the extremely light traffic as it moved east and west along the highway. As I looked further east, just past the huge, blue water tower that stood between me and the highway, I noticed a pair of lights. I assumed it must be a special heavy hauler rig and I waited anxiously for it to pass by the water tower so I could get a better look at it. The lights were above the normal flow of traffic, but I never suspected that they were high enough to be flying and the &#34;truck&#34; was moving very, very slow. As I waited for it to pass the water tower and reappear, I assumed that it must have pulled over...The lights that I had been observing west- bound, at just under a half-mile, was now traveling south-west. As it manuevered around the water tower at about 1800 yards distance, I could clearly see that this was an aircraft. It&#39;s altitude was less than 35 feet and at it&#39;s present speed it would be directly above my head in about 15 minutes. My camera was out of film but I had a M-1 carbine with a 30 round clip full of tracer rounds. I went in the house and got it. A line of pine trees marked the boundry where my backyard joined my neighbor&#39;s yard. 45 yards beyond those trees lies the street that runs in front of his house. The craft was now above the old boat factory, about 300 yards, and as I watched it float, ever so slowly, I saw a bright-white light come on which was located directly in the center of the bottom of the craft. I flipped the safety off of the carbine that I was holding as the UFO approached the street which runs in front of my neighbor&#39;s home. Directly above the street, the rear of the craft came about as it again, changed it&#39;s direction and followed the street west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now sixty yards from this craft as it floats through the air so low that the orange reflection from the newly installed amber street lamp was clearly visible on it&#39;s shiny, brushed aluminum appearing skin. NO SOUND! NOT A WHISPER!!NOTHING! It was moving so slow, I had to stop moving to make sure that it was not hovering. My neighbor&#39;s home is a low, ranch styled home about 80 feet long. I observed the craft through the pines that joined our yards as it moved over his home. As it centered his home, about 20 feet of the craft extended beyond each end of his home, giving it a length of 120&#39;.I readied my carbine and aimed at the center of the bright-white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom of the UFO was flat with a slight hump toward the rear of the craft. It had a light on each of it&#39;s three, rounded corners. These outer lights had the old, yellowish glow, like older vehicles. The top-half of the craft was rounded and egg- shaped and reached a height of at least 15&#39;-20&#39;. I moved across my neighbor&#39;s yard and as I stepped into the street, I observed the craft pass directly over a family&#39;s home, and comparing the two, the UFO was 60&#39; across the rear and was about 15&#39; across it&#39;s nose. I didn&#39;t shoot at the UFO . Those tracer rounds could have bounced off of it, stuck in one of my neighbor&#39;s roofs, and could have burned their house down. I watched the craft as it stayed it&#39;s course and went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I witnessed this UFO, I was a conveyor mechanic for a government contractor. I&#39;ve worked on air bases all over this nation and there are no aircraft available in our arsenals that can hover 30&#39; off the ground without making a sound. If a human being stands within 60&#39; of any hovering aircraft made on this earth, with the very latest, most advanced, technology known to man, that human being WILL hear that aircraft!! This sighting makes nine UFO sightings that I&#39;ve experianced over the years while living in East Texas. These entities are real, people. What I&#39;ve described here is true. That craft was just as real as the 1985 Chevrolet Silverado that&#39;s setting in my driveway. I hate these things. I hate what they&#39;ve done to peoples lives. I hate the way they can come and go and stalk us. If they are so damned intelligent, then they know what they are doing to us is wrong. Make no mistake about it, I will pull that trigger to stop the threat!!<n>

I had spent the weekend w/ my father &amp; step mom when they were getting ready to take me to my moms in Springfield (10 miles away).  We walked out to the truck after dark &amp; obout 1 mile away in the sky was a light formation that was just hovering.  I was studying the solar system in class so I was always interested in the sky &amp; stars.  As we drove closer, the formation still hovering became more apparant that it wasnt a regular aircraft.  My dad thought it was a helicopter but once we were directly under the formation we stopped the truck &amp; turned off the engine.  This is in the middle of the country so no sounds of cars or trucks could be heard.  We listened....dead silence.  Then the formation took off at a very smooth yet fast pace &amp; flew up &amp; away in the sky.  It then was gone. I have thought of this experience every since.  I truly beleive what I saw was a UFO.  I have had no other experiences yet, but I do look forward to the next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Due to not enough parking in front of school I parked in the back side near the play ground.  As I was walking toward the classrooms suddenly there was something hanging in the air.  No sound at all, not sitting on any legs for feet, just hanging there and about 16 ft in diameter.  It was metallic with lights around the bottom in blue, yellow, red, green and purple.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing so I walked back toward the car and it disappeared.  Walking toward the classrooms again and there it was once more.  It was as if it was cloaked in some way that unless you were within so many (6) feet of it, it wasn’t there at all.  While standing underneath it I tried to reach up and touch it but it was just high enough that it was out of my reach so about 6 feet high.  The upper part of it had w! hat appeared to be blackened windows. Suddenly a man came out of my daughters classroom walking very fast toward me.  I figured he had just got finished with his teacher meeting and also wondered why he had on sun glasses in the dark. He also had on a black suit, white shirt with thin black tie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got his attention right away by requesting him to look at this, what is this?  Right away I could tell he was very nervous and asked me, look at what?  I said look at this medal thing just hanging here. He said it’s nothing and I said yes it is something what is it?  He said it’s for advertising.  It flies around advertising. I said to him that no it wasn’t for that at all, there was no sound and no air so it wasn’t a helicopter or airplane and it didn’t have any feet or legs; it was just floating there and we had nothing that would do that.  Again I tried to reach up to touch it and he looked at the window and nodded. What was that about? I had no idea.  Then something happened to me and to this day I don’t know if I went into my meeting with my daughters teacher or not.  Actually I don’t remember at all how I got home, it seems that months and months are still missing from my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I feel that this man knew exactly what this was and that he had in fact came in that thing to his meeting. Either this man was an alien himself or someone working with them.  Of course that’s just a very strong feeling I have and also I believe that UFO’s are always there, right in front of us but we can’t see them unless we get within so many feet of them or if by chance light hits them in a certain way.  I know as fact that it was a UFO! I have no doubt about it at all.<n>

I looked up towards the sky and I could see and object coming towards me at a very high rate of speed. It stopped over some trees it was disc shape with a white glow there was no sound.  I could see it hover very slowly.  As I was watching it I noticed another one coming again at a high rate of speed it stopped to one side of the first one. One thing I noticed is the speed they were going but how fast they could stop. After a short time one of them headed towards the same way it came from it took off without turning like a plane would have to or helicopter. Then the second one left the same way.  It was a clear night.  I was very close 150 yards and the objects were above the trees not very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Answer to your questions:   They came from the East and went back the same way.  I started working this part time job in 1984 and also worked in 1985 so I guess it could have been in 1985 I am not sure.  I went to full time work in 1986 and I am sure it was not  during that time I was working full time for the church.  I hope this will help you in some way.  I have never said much about it as I figured no one would think I was telling the truth anyway.  I have no doubt to what I saw it was very clear that night and it wasn&#39;t that far away.  Thanks for getting back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

My experience began as I left a friend&#39;s house early one morning.  I drove to the end of his driveway, stopping to look each way.  The road, Pekin, is dark and deserted, with scattered homes and small farms on each side.  As I looked to my left, a line of brightly colored lights rose above the treetops 100 yards away and stopped in mid air. There were six lights, flashing on and off similar to a moving sign, or what you might see on a tiny portion of the Goodyear blimp.  They flashed red, green and white as they moved, from left to right.  I rolled down my window, expecting sound, but there was none.  Extending my arm out the window, and using my left index finger as a gauge, I noted that the line of lights were as long as my finger, from tip to palm, and that they were about half the thickness of the finger in diameter.  Puzzled, and not really sure what I was seeing, I just turned left as I always did, going east on Pekin.  As I started down the road, the lights moved to their left and crossed over the road from my right just as I passed under them.  I remember looking up through my windshield to see them, then they dissapeared behind trees as I drove on. A half mile down the road, there is a stop sign for Sperry road, where I would turn right.  I wondered what the blimp was doing out here so late, it&#39;s too rural for the blimp, so what was it?  I was now approaching the stop sign, and that&#39;s when I saw the lights come back from my left and stoped, hovering over the road at the same altitude directly in front of me and out about 200 feet.  I had the impression &#34;it&#34; expected me to continue through the stop sign and towards it.  My hair stood on end when I realized what these lights were, and I quickly turned right and sped off as fast as I could.  Looking left, I saw the lights were pacing my car at the same speed, at which point I became very frightened, shouting &#34;Not tonight, not tonight!&#34; Within a mile of that intersection, I lost sight of the lights, continuing on to Mayfield road, where I stopped and go out to look back.  In the distance, at least a mile back, I could see the lights hovering, still flashing their colors, at about 600 feet, I would guess.  Since then, I have interviewed four differnt persons of different ages, from 13 to 65, who have seen this craft in the same area.  In addition, Tim Good&#39;s book, Above Top Secret, contains a piece concerning a man who lived 30 miles east of Cleveland, Ohio, who observed a UFO on the ground for 20 minutes.  This location is exactly 30 miles east of cleveland, and the gentleman named in the book lives on the same road.  There is a lot of activity in this area, and it should be investigated.<n>

When I Came across glowingdome about 50 yards off highway. this gets weird all i can tell you is that the closer i got to it my car acted up and barely had the power to go by.I remember turning around 3 differt times to try to figure out what i was actualy seeing before i got too scared to proceed. so i started heading to vernal ut. but when i got to town it was not vernal it was heber city ut. which means that i turned around 4 times not 3 and it took 3 hrs it should have taken 1. I just had to tell after listening to you on coast to coast im not sure what made me think that it was 3 times not 4 on my turning around or that i want to know.it is so vivid in my mind but how i missed the extra turn around is beond me.?i did see 1 other about a mounth later tell ya another day not as grafic<n>

I was a Police Officer on duty (now retired) with a partner in the car besides me when I looked into the nighttime sky and saw this hugh shape with lights spaced intermittently crossing the dark sky. No noise was heard and it was not like the shape of anything I had ever seen (flying) before. It seemed to have taken up the whole sky. Upon seeing this thing I brought it to my partners attention and when he witnessed it his spoken words were &#34;oh man, don&#39;t get me involved with this&#34;. After little thought (realizing there would be many jokes and ridicule aimed at me) I radioed HQ&#39;s and told them my sightings. They asked my location and I told them same. They came back with a reply that they had gotten many other phonecalls from the same area seeing the same thing. They (HQ&#39;s) then said they had called the Westchester County Airport and was advised it was the Air Force. To this day I dont believe that. Not being involved with Airplanes or anything as such I know I have never seen anything like this object flying in the air or anything close to it in shape. It seemed to be the size of a football field. It seemed to have taken up the whole sky. Believing in what I saw I made an official Police Report on same. My partner would not admit anything for years, for what ever reason, until finally one day he started to back up my story and admit to what we had seen. I know this happened many years ago but I never told anyone (other than by mouth)and except for the written  P.D. report......in any Official manner.       Thankyou<n>

I could see across all of Traverse city all the way to the airport. I first seen something that was almost translucent but football shaped. the day was cloudy and it was fall chilly day. I asked a friend if he seen that thing over on the horizon. He looked a bit and I pointed it out. He did see it, and we both had a wierd feeling. It wasn&#39;t a helicoptor or a plane. It did spend some time moving up and down, and around the same area. Now we do have a coast guard station at the airport, and a kid who saw us looking started looking for the object. we pointed it out to him, and he just couldn&#39;t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could still see the shifting of it and moving up and down. the one kid who just couldn&#39;t see it turned sour grapes and said it was a coast guard helecoptor practicing his touch and goes. I guess It could have been, but I seen something that looked like a translucent football. Almost like a floater in your eye. One other kid seen it and a few others around seemed to be watching the area but didn&#39;t say anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I have asked a few people what they thought, and nobody has ever heard of a football translucent colored ship that was seen around traverse city airport, and I probably never will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I didn’t think that you would be interested, but as I listened to you on Coast to Coast I understood that I should write it down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking around 5am to the bus stop to get to my job and I usually took the shortest way to the bus using back door of my back yard. Back of my house was facing the bayou and across of that was just empty space (later on apartments were build there)    As I started to walk I looked at the sky and saw full moon on my left across the bayou over the empty space.  And something felt strange: moon looked reddish and was low, not up in the sky.  And then I looked to the right of me, and there was a real moon in the sky!  I suddenly was scared and run as fast as I could to the bus stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next morning I decided to take a long way to the bus stop (it was a different stop and it would take me 10 minutes longer, but I would by walking by houses in the neighborhood).  As I turn to one of the streets I saw a black van parked on the street in front of one of the houses and in near the van I saw 2 tall men standing and watch what I thought several children playing on the front yard; I am nearsighted so it took me sometime when I came near the children to see that it was not children, and either I blocked instantly what those beings look like or it was blocked from me.  I was terrified  from what I saw and I could not even describe it immediately when  I happened.  I started to run (in my mind I heard that they were amused my terror).  I run all the way to the bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is my 2 experiences which I want to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the sightings are approximate.

10/7/84 19:00|Chigwell Essex (UK/England)||Other|15 Seconds|High Altitude RED fast moving (later violently manouvering) oval/ bean shaped object Essex UK|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39652.html|16|ndxe198410| High Altitude RED fast moving (later violently manouvering) oval/ bean shaped object Essex UK<n> <n><n> <n><n> I (((name #1 deleted))) was with my friend (name #2 deleted)) waiting outside another friends house for him to get himself ready. I lay down on a low brick wall which afforded a perfect place to lie back and look up from. It was a very clear night and the stars were easily visible all the way to about 30 degrees above the horizon where the sky became more orange as in dusk. (With a little light pollution thrown in from nearby street lights but certainly not enough to obscure our vision from where we were) I was just lieing back when almost immediately I saw a small oval, like a straight  small bean, red object (uniform brightness,red in colour) travelling fast directly above and behind my head.I had to twist as i jumped up to keep it in sight and i quickly saw that it was travelling very quickly!. if it was as far up as it appeared to be, as in almost like a satellite, it was obviously way too fast. I had seen satelites and recognised loads of them as a youngster then and many since, but never have i seen any travelling this fast. Likewise I had observed loads of aircraft at night and during the day due to the fact I took a keen interest in old WW2 aircraft and jets etc so I knew their behaviour fairly well. This was travelling at a speed which would suggest an aircraft which was a lot lower, yet it appeared to be very high and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Luckily I was able to grab my friend and direct his view to the object, with a pointed finger, as it continued to streak accross the sky in a straight line. Then Just as he said &#39;Yes&#39; to my &#39;there! can you see it?&#39; question (by this time the object was almost into the orangey part of the sky and i thought my friend would miss it) it suddenly zipped left, right, diagonal up down etc (it was so quick we barely managed to maintain a view on it so i cannot accurateley describe its movements from memory). We both at the exact same time swore in amazement and it disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dramatic manouvers(?) lasted I would say about 1 second to 2 seconds. (I know i had to really move my gaze to keep it in sight. When it dissapeared I continued to look thinking id missed its last move.)The whole incident was very quick and hard to keep clear from memory but we both STILL talk about it and we have always kept an eye out for anything which sounds similar over the years.(This archive will be invaluable for that and this is why i posted here.The more info available the more it will help i think).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps somehow. We both would like some sort of answer but doubt we will ever work out what it was. We have had to remain open minded about UFO stuff ever since because of this one incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

But upon exploring your database, I was prompted to. My mom, brother, sister, a friend and myself were coming home from a football game one evening. My mom, who was driving, suddenly stopped the car in the middle of the street we were on and just stared up and out of the windshield. I remember her saying &#34;what is that?&#34; and pointing. I got out of the car immediately and looked toward where she was pointing. They were impossible to miss. Three round objects hovered perfectly still in the form of a triangle. They appeared to be burning but there was no heat or cast-off light or even any noise. I guess their color was something like red-orange. We finally drove down the street to get a camera and tell my dad about the objects but they were gone when we looked for them again.<n>

Just going for a ride one evening when we noticed a very bright light approching us from the east, we were traveling north. It got so bright that we stopped the truck, shut off the engine and got out to watch.  We saw a triangular thing with a bright headlight and red lights round the edges. It was so very close to us and it had no noise what so ever. It stayed above us for about 15 seconds and then with amazing speed, still silent, was gone in maybe 3 seconds.  My only thoughts were &#34;I&#39;m never going to see my children again.&#34;  I was scared.My husband and my friend didn&#39;t report it because we were afraid of ridicule.  Who would believe such a crazy story?  On thursday night Art Bell replayed a tape of a man who had wittnesed almost the same thing in Phoenix 2 years ago. I thought you might be interested to know this sort of thing happens in rural New England too.<n>

It was impossible to tell the relative size of the object or its altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought there must have been a test from Lom Poc as they did launch many test missiles from this location throughout the time I lived in the west valley and they often caused some very strange displays in the sky.  But as this &#34;light&#34; approached our position leaving no contrails, it suddenly made a 90 degree turn, shot straight up through the clouds and rapidly ascended out of view.   The cloud cover parted in its wake in a perfect circle which continued to expand like a smoke ring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t quite sure if I had actually seen what I saw.  My mouth dropped open and I turned to my husband as we both spoke at the exact same instant:  &#34;Did you see that?&#34;   Neither of us could explain what we had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve told this story to a few people over the years when the subject of UFO’s would come up in casual conversation and to this day it gives me chills yet I can tell my listeners want to dismiss my story as just that; a story.  The overactive imaginings of youth.  I have never claimed the object was extraterrestrial; however I always do remind them that UFO only means the object was unidentified and flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still a practicing skeptic, but I just don’t have any rational explanation for what we saw that evening and as of yet no one else has either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/1/84 01:00|Waldport|OR|Light|10 minutes|Bright light of a  fast moving craft frightened me in the night on the Oregon Coast.|3/16/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16755.html|20|ndxe198410| ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright light of a  fast moving craft frightened me in the night on the Oregon Coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to the ORegon coast in summer of 1984.  I am guessing the date to be in October of that year.  I was up late.  My husband was asleep in our travel trailer which we were living in at the time.  An unfinished cabin was on our property, where we had our belongings stored, and our dogs were sleeping out there.  I walked over to the cabin, checking on my pets.  There was a window facing west to the ocean.  Our place is about one quarter mile up a hillside from the beach.  I looked out the window at the night sky, which is clear and pretty there when it is cold.  A point of light in the sky began to grow rapidly.  There was no sound at all. It grew brighter and larger, and closer.  I cannot tell you how I know that it was closer, I just know. For some reason it made me afraid (other than it was unusual)  The dogs moved from the middle of the room and crouched against the west wall, to the left of the window, looking upwards at the window and whining.  I could not hear any sound, but it seemed that they could.  The light grew so bright, it seemed to spread outward from a center point and lit up the entire sky.  Again, I don&#39;t know why I was so afraid, but I crouched down in the corner with the dogs against that west wall, so that I could not possibly be seen from the &#34;sky&#34;.  This &#34;object&#34; seemed to be now very low in the sky.  From peeking out the window from time to time, it was my impression that it was moving very slowly to the north, but very near to the tree line.  Then the light seemed to be &#34;sucked in&#34; to the center point again. Then what was left at the center concentration moved suddenly and extremely fast in a Northwest direction and was gone out of my sight.  The dogs would not come out of the corner for some time.  I was afraid, and went back to the trailer and woke up my husband to tell him what I had seen.  He didn&#39;t take me seriously and just went back to sleep.  Eventually I managed to get back to sleep.  In the morning, I heard a radio report from the Salem area (towards the center of! the Sta te, about 70 miles away) that lots of people had called in the night before reporting seeing lights.  They were making fun of the reports, and I didn&#39;t hear anything else about it. If I could liken the craft to something that was normal I would describe it as a helicopter search light, except there was dead silence, and the light was so incredibly bright and actually &#34;grew&#34; outward to fill the sky.  I felt like it was &#34;searching&#34; for something.  dumn, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it.  I guess I got scared because my instinct told me not to let myself be seen.…<n>
