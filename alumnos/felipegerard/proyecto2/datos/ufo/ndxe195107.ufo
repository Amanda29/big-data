We all noticed a very bright light which came from an object fixed in the cloudless sky, quite high up and motionless for about 10 minutes. Then it suddenly moved away with enormous speed at a steep angle until we lost it from our eye sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/15/51 14:00|Spokane Valley (Otis Orchards)|WA|Sphere|2-3 hours|UFO over the Spokane Valley 1951|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89855.html|2|ndxe195107| UFO over the Spokane Valley 1951<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident probably occurred in 1951 when I was 4, and I checked with my sister who would have been 14 at the time to make sure the details we remember are correct.   This happened in Otis Orchards, in the Spokane valley, in July or August, and was witnessed by my sister and me, our mom and dad and grandmother, as well as the family we visited that day which would include 4 or 5 others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family was getting ready to visit friends who lived nearby.  My mom saw my dad sitting in a lawn chair in the back yard looking up in the sky and asked him if he was ready to leave.  He replied “No, I’m just going to sit here and watch this flying saucer.”  Of course we all looked up and then saw a bright white sphere in the southern part of the sky, over Mica Peak and a little to the southeast, seemingly very high up.  The weather was beautiful: no clouds, very clear sky, no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for some time, and the object was unmoving, just sitting there in the sky.  We finally got in the car and, watching the ufo all the way, drove a few miles to our friends’ house, where they continued to watch with us for a while.  Finally someone decided to report this, and called Fairchild Airforce Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon 3 jets approached the object, and when they got close, the object took off at high speed towards the southeast, straight and very fast.  The jets did not pursue it, turned  and went back in the direction of Fairchild Air Force Base to the west.  My sister thinks that there was an article in the Spokane Daily Chronicle about this incident, but I have been unable to locate it using online search tools.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Looking at your site, I do not see this account posted so please review - The UFO sighting took place at about 11:30 am in the morning.  It was a clear July day with, zero clouds, and a bright blue sky.  My boy friend and I were playing near the foot hills when we notices a gray object hovering at about 8000 feet above us.  We thought that it was a weather bloon.  It was not moving around and just seemed to stay in one place.  As we watched it, the object, that appread round from our point view, rotated on its axis, so that we could see that it had the shape of a saucer.  It was gray in color with no flashing lights, noise, or windows that we could see or hear.  We had to use one hand to block the sun from our view.  The saucer shaped object then started to move slowly towards the West.  We ran to some of our neighbor&#39;s homes and asked them to come out and look at the object.  The object moved slowly West until it appreared to be over the city of Orem (about 2 to 3 miles from our homes).  The object then accelerated North at a extreme speed, up over Mount Timpanogos and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have invited the witness to locate some of the other witnesses, and have them submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>
7/3/51 12:00|Green River|WY|Sphere|5 to 7 min|Glowing white spherical large craft (50 to 100 ft dia) travels across mountain range near Green River, Wyo|10/15/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25602.html|4|ndxe195107| Glowing white spherical large craft (50 to 100 ft dia) travels across mountain range near Green River, Wyo<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was taking the family from Rock Springs, Wyoming, in the summer of 1951 to Green River, Wyo.  approx half way we saw cars parked on both sides of the two lane highway with everyone (about 20 people) looking north at the peaked hills (small mountain range).   A spherical craft that appeared &#34;glowing&#34; white was slowing moving over the mountain range.  Some said it might be a weather balloon but it was traveling &#34;horizontal&#34; and seemed to be steared rather than floating on it&#39;s own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to watch it for about 5 to 7 minutes and my dad said, &#34;Well there it is Freddy, a flying saucer&#34;.   It eventually went behind one of the peaks but never came out on the other side.   Also it was very large, I would guess about a good 50 to 100 feet in diameter.<n>
7/3/51 03:00|Calaveras County|CA|Disk|???|A female alien leader visits a catholic school boy in California .|5/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36683.html|5|ndxe195107| A female alien leader visits a catholic school boy in California .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a annual summer camp trip from Ukiah, CA. to Calavera&#39;s county in 1951 when an event happened that changed my whole life!  I had spent that day as any normal kid would, playing with my best friend then we raced across a small creek and my foot was cut through my tennis- shoes.  The cut was very deep across the pad behind my left big toe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend ran to get a Conselor to help me.  The cut would not stop bleeding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He carried me on his back piggy style.  I had to pull my pant leg cuff to hold my foot up because of the throbbing pain.  I went to bed that night as the other boys did, (gabbing til sleep).  Somewhere in the night I woke up and startled as heck, realized I was sleeping on the cement serving place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cement circle was where the conserlors set all the giant serving food pots which was about 4 to 6 blocks from our cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What woke me was this weird blue-ish green light that I could see with my eyes closed.  It was about 2 telephone poles above me slowly rising with a small noise in my head.  It looked like a huge (city block wide) black disk with pieces of silver around it&#39;s edges.  In the center was that blue-ish green light.  It slowly rose over me straight up then zipped out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t scared, I was actually very calm and relaxed untill I noticed where I was, (in the wilderness at night) I got up, steped down off the cement circle and yelled in pain!  I forgot my foot was injured.  All the pain came back again as I tried to walk on that heel.  As I entered the dark cabin, I accidently went to my best friends bed and grabbed the covers, (It was my friends neck I grabbed and boy did he yell) I tried to tell him what went on, but the other kids yelled , &#39;shut-up!&#39;.  The next morning we saw my bloody foot prints coming from the cabin front door to my friends bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to explain to our &#39;conselors&#39; what happened and they said, I must be mistaken, there&#39;s only God in the heavens.  And then the memories came back.  A female entity, large head, giant shinny black cat eyes, dull white skin tone, small being. It sounded like a soft gentle female.  It spoke to me with tenderness.  She said her name was, I couldn&#39;t say it right, so she said,&#39;NANE&#39; that&#39;s close enough.  She said she was the leader of a force that protected her planets security.  In an instant, we were on a planet who&#39;s color looked like white-ish grey everywhere. My feet weren&#39;t on the ground and she said, It&#39;s not safe for you. I said where am I, she said, your at the &#39;place of ashes&#39;  she said, you call it The moon.  She said a huge civilization lived there a long time ago.  She said, those craters are not from things hitting the moon, their from a great all out war that destroyed the planet.  She pointed to a UFO in the distance and said, many visitors from other planets come to the &#39;place of ashes&#39; to remember, and collect &#39;artifacts&#39; to take home. She said the Universe was a big giant highway,just like our highways on earth. When she talked, I didn&#39;t see her mouth move, I heard her in my mind.  She told me about different UFO&#39;s, aliens, planets, She said the story of &#39;Jesus Christ&#39; was just that,a story She said governments on earth just used it to control the people! She said, do you think a real all loving God would let Disease,murder,war,hatred,- death,natural disasters exist!!!!?  She said she could do everything and more all by herself than anything I&#39;ve ever read. She has visited me about 3 times and say&#39;s she&#39;s always near.  She has shown me and told me so much that it&#39;s sort of scary!  I am now a movie actor with one academy award film and I still don&#39;t talk about my encounter to anyone. (people think your crazy as the government likes it to be on this topic!) All I can say is, my life &#39;s not the same since that encounter!!!  I can do many,many, different things that I never studied, perfectly!  When I look into a persons eyes, or touch them it&#39;s like a fast visual movie of their life!(I don&#39;t like it at all!!!) When that visual thing happens, it makes me want to throw-up!(feels like I&#39;m going to die!) I&#39;ve learned so much from&#39;NANE&#39; that it would take a lot of writing to explain it, and it&#39;s coming true!  I&#39;m going to write an E-Book on the net about, &#39;NANE&#39; and give it away free, just download it.  I want other people to know what happened to me! And just maybe, just maybe, there&#39;s others who were visited that night and I could meet them.  There&#39;s so much more she said that I believe is perfectly true!  The free &#39;NANE&#39; E-Book has been ready to download but, I&#39;m a little worried about my movie career! Will people think I&#39;ve lost my mind!? A person can only shut their mouth for so long!  Time to tell the other people what happened! She showed me so much! I hope all read this with intelligence and wisdom for it will come to pass!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will contact the source, and request that he/she attempt to contact any of the other youngsters at the camp, to try to corroborate parts of the story.  PD))<n>

Horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1951, my father and I were playing catch in our front yard of our home about ½ mile So. of Trent Road, NNW of Liberty Lake in Otis Orchards, WA.  I was 8 YO at the time. I spotted a Cigar shaped Disk in the sky to the SSW, darting back and forth, East and West (Covering ~ 5 or 6 miles, each “Zip/Dart”).  This activity was taking place at just less than a 45 degree angle from our location, above the So. Horizon. Liberty Lake lies just to the So. and that seemed to be the end of each “Zip/Dart” to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my father, “What is that?.  He turned around, observed, and stated, “That’s a Flying Saucer. People from outer space are here to visit.”  We continued to watch for about a minute or so.  I turned around and ran to the front door to call my mother, so she could see it as well.  When I turned around after calling her, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this report has been written  since June, following Peter’s  appearance on Coast, and never reported, please reference a similar Sitting, the same summer in Otis Orchards.  In that report, Mica Peak is about 4-5 miles, EES of Liberty Lake.  The activity I saw was about 4-10 miles directly West of Mica Peak on the same East/West axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://maps.google.com/maps?q=mica+peak&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=47.664694,-<n> <n><n> <n><n> 117.061043&amp;spn=0.178268,0.308647&amp;sll=47.653565,-<n> <n><n> <n><n> 117.326088&amp;sspn=0.011144,0.01929&amp;hnear=Mica+Peak&amp;t=m&amp;z=12<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the Mica Peak report was a “Bright White Sphere”, all I saw was a “Cigar shaped Disc”, and no Jets from Mc Cord or Fairchild.  Perhaps this/these sittings were part of an Alien “Operation”, with this area being their AO. ??? (The “A” on Google Map is “Mica Peak”.)<n>
