At first we thought it was an aircraft, however, there was no noise and the light appeared to grow bigger and then dissapear and then reappear and then change shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very strange coloured light, very bright but changed from a blue colour to a white colour.  We stopped our car on the side of the road and observed the strange light for almost one minute. The light would fade out and then reappear in a different spot, it was moving very quickly.  It then left a trail of light and dissapeared.  We decided at the time that our friends and family would think we were crazy if we told them, so we both decided not to discuss it with anybody.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/30/95 19:00|Monroeville|IN|Triangle|2 min. or so|UFO in Monroeville Indiana|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68508.html|6|ndxe199509| UFO in Monroeville Indiana<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, my family and I lived in Monroeville, Indiana.  We lived in a huge mint green farm house about a mile out of town.  Many of summer nights we would lay on out trampoline and gaze at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes we would see what we thought as strange activity, such as lights that would disappear and reappear and lights that would fly at each other and almost touch but I told myself it was my imagination.  In town we would hear stories about people seeing strange objects in the sky and I never thought much of it because I didn&#39;t see it myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in 7th grade at the time.  My mother and little brother picked me up from the Junior/Senior High school a few miles down the road.  At the time, I was in basketball and I had just got done with practice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were almost home when we saw a little (I think red) car stopped right in front of our house.  We got very close to them and I saw they were looking up at something. I looked up.  The car sped away (so I know someone else saw the same thing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right in our huge roundabout was a hovering object flying above us.  It was feet or inches above the tall oaks.  There was no wind, no sound.  It was triangular with spot light in the middle.  It had a white light in one corner and one side had a row of white lights with one red light.  It was spot lighting the grass and trees in the roundabout then it flew a few yards and spotted the house and then the back field where we had a huge garden on the corner of a farmer’s field..  As it moved, you didn&#39;t see it move.  We all gazed in amazement and fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother pulled in the drive way, put the car in park and ran into the house to get my father.  My brother and I started to scream and hold each other.  Then it was gone.  All the while, it never acknowledged us but of course it had to see us, right?   What is weird is that I don&#39;t remember telling my dad or the rest of the night, maybe because it was not important or because I was slightly traumatized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I drew pictures but for some reason my memory had changed.  Now, I could only remember clearly how I felt and what I was thinking as I looked at the object and the things around the object but the exact memory of me staring straight at the object was gone.  My mother said she can&#39;t remember as clearly either.  What is strange is that I remember in pictures.  We didn&#39;t talk about it much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother thinks it is a governmental experiment, not aliens and I like that answer.  This is what I tell myself and I find it reasonable.  There is an air force base very close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day there were military helicopters flying all around.  What this means, I don&#39;t know. Were they looking for something?   Was this a foreign government spying on the U.S.  If the object didn’t want to be seen...then why fly into peoples yards and hover around.  Why did it care about us and what could it possibly learn or want from us.  I guess we will never know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t expect you to believe this because I wouldn&#39;t.  It is hard for me to believe but it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in late 1995.  PD))<n>

I was sitting in the front passanger seatand observed one firery object which I thought were plane lights.  Then I thought it was a missle of some sort.  A ballof fire with a tail.  A comet no.  The ball of fire was traveling on a level plane. The fireball was quite close say 100 yards. It did not come from some distancejust poped in then poped out. (In to a dark small cloud but diddn&#39;t come out the other end.)  My family did not see the objectbecause I did not tell them. (They know I study ufo&#39;s, and they think I&#39;m Wack.)  A big storm hit that night. I recently moved to Arizona10 day prior.  I don&#39;t feel I&#39;ve never been abducted, my life has many oddities that might say that I was.)

It caught my eye as a blur, but as it flew almost overhead it looked solid; as it left our position it became a blur again--like camoflage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were entering our backyard. As it entered our line of vision in the south, and left it in the north it was just a narrow band of orange light as if it had camoflage; but while over our yard and the neighbor&#39;s yards it was clear, blocked out the light of the stars, silent and steady. The six round, pale orange lights were all the same size and close together, perfectly equidistant from one another: one at the narrow end of the tri- angle, two in the next row, and three across the broad end; of course, the narrow end was the leading edge. It did not seem to become a blur in the north until it was about a mile beyond us going north: it did not disappear so much as blend slowly into the appearance of space.

It moved to fast for us to see it move but we followed the red glow as it trailed like a small tail of ionized air behind and below the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it moved 3 times and the second time it hovered over a cow and it was lifted in air to the crafts middle at which point we started jumping up and down in excitment to what we were seeing, we unwittinglly attacted the attention of the craft and 1 second later it was over us! the beam used on the cow was now on us!  we could not look up at it as we were both paralysized physically in this beam but we could scream and we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the light beam looked like white laser light. you could see particles of sort in light like thick light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Inside Craft : then we both blacked out and i awoke in this craft my friend lying beside me, we were on 2 clear tables- 2 foot by 5 foot (no probes - lol) and were paralysed from the neck down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All white round room inside.

I suddenly detected the movement of a dimly lit object in my periferal vision in the sky above me. The object appeared to be nearly twice the size of a full moon when it appears directly overhead. It was traveling from west to east. The object was blueish-white in color. Its body was slightly arched like the mid-section of a rainbow, with a pod-like appenditure on each side. It appeared to be composed entirely of light, as if it were a hologram. Against the backdrop of a clear night sky, it was initally just bright enough to catch my periferal vision, but as the craft advanced toward the east where the sky grew hazier, it became brighter, apparently because the water droplets were beginning to reflect the light that the object was emitting. Innitially all I could see was the underbelly of the craft, but as it proceeded to the east, I could see the back of the craft rising like a mammoth wall from the bottom to the top. The object was three-dimentional and sharply defined. It maintained its size, shape, and speed throughout, with only a slight ajustment in course from slightly south of due-east to due-east. I watched the object proceed eastward, where it disappeared in the midst of a cloud. The object made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It flashed like a strobe light at about 4 second intervals.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05096.html|31|ndxe199509| Huge flashing someting passed overhead. It lit about 1/3 of the sky. It flashed like a strobe light at about 4 second intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were prospecting and camped at the base of a canyon (Painter spring). We has eaten dinner and had gone into the tent. We began to hear a low rumbling sound off towards the desert floor. It continued and became louder. It sounded like a 2 1/2 ton truck approaching. Since the only way to our campsite was the road from the desert which no large truck could take, we went outside to see who was approaching. We looked west towards the desert and then there was a bright flash in the sky - almost like a flashbulb. It lit about 1/3 of the sky. After about four seconds, it flashed again. It continued this strobe light effect all of the time that we observed it. It was a dark night with stars. We never did see an outline of the thing (I guess that our eyes never got a chance to adjust). It moved from the west deseret, overhead, and on up the east canyon and over the ridge. The whole event lasted for about 1 minute. It moved very slowly and rumbled. After it had gone over the ridge, we looked back towards the desert. We saw two sets of lights coming towards us, following the path of the other object. They were moving about as fast as private airplanes move. They didn&#39;t make any sound. There was a red light in front and a green light in back (in a straight line). We figured that the lights were on the nose and tail of the crafts. They were flying in staggered formation (about 8 seconds offset). The two sets of lights passed overhead, up the canyon, and disappeared over the eastern ridge. We could never see the shape of these things (not even when they passed overhead). We could only see the lights. One of these things came back over the ridge, made a large sweep over the upper canyon, and returned over the ridge. We looked around for about a minute. We then saw two sets of lights coming from the desert towards us. They were moving fast. As they got over us, we could hear the sound of jet engines back on the desert floor. Their outline was clear. They were two military jets flying in offset formation (one was about 3 seconds behing the other). They went overhead, up the canyon, and over the ridge just like the other craft. About a minute later, we saw a small light (looked just like a star) up in the sky to our southeast. It was moving in straight lines i.e. it would go one way, and then change direction left, right, up, down, in straight lines. It kept in an area of the sky that covered about an inch at arms length. We saw one of the red and green light things come over the ridge and move quickly towards the moving light. When it got almost to the light, the light simply went out. This thing made a circle over the area and then went back over the ridge. That&#39;s it - never saw anything else.<n>

We investigated and found there was no road or surface from which lights could be projecting.  We experienced electrical disturbances with our vehicle.  Our next recollection is being about half way down the mountain with all of our gear neatly packed.  Neither of us have any recollection of breaking camp or packing our gear.  We continued to experience electrical disturbances with our truck while driving down the mountain.  We did not talk about the experience for over a year following the event.

I was staying with my gradfather for the weekend so i could take her to a dance function at her school.  It was a cool night but foggy in places along the major highways and on the back roads.  On my way i see what looks to be a blue light flash across the high way.  Even though it was foggy you could not miss it, it was half a mile away but high enough to fly over the grain silos that were off in the distance.  I thought nothing more of it and went on with my bussiness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had picked up my ex-girlfriend and had forgotten her gift.  We still had time before we needed to be there so I drove back to my grandfathers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way back however I saw the light once again but this time it flew over the right side of my car not more than 60ft off the ground.  Then it stop very suddenly, then shot off into the distance with great speed.  All i could see was a blue light however when this light traveled it was as if it were a cylinder shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it really bugged me and to make sure i was losing it i ask my ex-girlfriend if she saw &#34;it&#34;. She said yes. We arrived at my grandfathers house and told him what we saw.  He had also seen somethinng from out side his front window.  I asked him what color it was and he said blue, and it moved very fast.  He also said that it wasn&#39;t the first time he&#39;s seen something like that.

It accelerated and followed the hilly terrain at a speed well above any normal fixed wing or rotor aircraft.  It departed from the horizon still accellerating and dissappeared into the overcast which I estimated to have been 2500 ft agl.  When It dissapeared my wife noticed another such object following apx. 5 secs. behind.  It follwed a similar course and dissapeared.<n>

WE HAD DRIVEN ABOUT 5 MINUTES OUT OF GREEN BAY WHEN I NOTICED 3 HUGE, BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHTS IN THE SKY TO OUR LEFT. I POINTED THIS OUT TO MY BROTHER. AS SOON AS WE BOTH HAD OUR EYES LOCKED ON THE LIGHTS, WE REALIZED THEY WERE CONNECTED TO AN ENORMOUS TRIANGULAR CRAFT. THE CRAFT WAS NOW TRAVELING FROM OUR LEFT TO RIGHT DIRECTLY OVER OUR VEHICLE. I OPENED MY PASSENGER WINDOW. I HAD HALF OF MY TORSO OUT THE WINDOW STARING UP AT THE OBJECT.IT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO DISCERNABLE SOUND WHATSOEVER. SOON THE OBJECT WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. WE WATCHED THE OBJECT SHIFT DIRECTION SILENTLY IN MID-AIR SO THAT IT&#39;S &#34;NOSE&#34; WAS POINTED IN THE SAME DIRECTION OUR CAR WAS HEADED. THE OBJECT SIMPLY FLOATED IN THAT STATE, ABOUT 45 FEET  ABOVE THE GROUND. IT SEEMED TO TAKE FOREVER TO PASS IT ALTHOUGH BY THIS TIME TRAFFIC AHEAD OF US SLOWED TO ALMOST A CRAWL. WE WERE BOTH SO ASTONISHED TO SEE SOMETHING SO HUGE AND SIENT. IAM ALMOST CERTAIN THAT OTHER TRAVELERS NOTICED THE OBJECT BECAUSE OF THE SLOWDOWN IN TRAFFIC. WE NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO TALK TO ANYONE ON THE HIGHWAY THAT NIGHT. AS SOON AS THE OBJECT WAS PASSED, PEOPLE SEEMED TO RESUME THEIR NORMAL SPEEDS. I PLACED A CALL TO THE OUTAGAMIE SHERRIFS DEPT.

I flew perfectly, I was happy at first, but, then I got scared because of being by myself. I was in college so the next morning I tried to tell everyone and they thought I was crazy. I even told my mom, in which, she passed a few weeks later. So if I wouldn’t lie to my mom, then, why would I lie now to anyone? I’m an artist and I can draw exactly what I seen. The scary part about this is, not that only one or two passengers can walk on earth as I heard in the pass, in which, I didn’t believe. There can be at least fifty aliens on earth at one time.

9/15/95 22:30|Wyoming|PA|Unknown|10 minutes|I was driving home late at night an observed 3 columns of green light in a field.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13156.html|67|ndxe199509| I was driving home late at night an observed 3 columns of green light in a field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: West Wyoming, PA. I was driving home at about 10:30 pm on a Sunday evening on approximately 11/15/95. This part of the town is a wooded area with no street lights. A light caught my eye to the left as I was driving and I looked out of my driver&#39;s side window. I continued to drive for about 30 seconds and there was a clearing in the woods where a house stood nearby. I saw the light very cleary. I pulled my car over to the side of the road to get a good look. I remained in the vehicle the whole time. I saw three (3) distinct vertical columns of green light. Each column of light was perfectly cylindrical and tapered at the top and bottom. The lights were about 30-40 feet high, 5 feet in diameter and approximately 10-15 feet equidistant from each other. They were about 5-10 feet from touching the ground. The color was green and  somewhat muted or hazy, almost flourescent-like. I rolled down my window to make sure that it was not a reflection or glare on the window. I observed the lights for about 1 minute. I did not see a physical craft above the lights. There was no movement of the lights and no sound at all. I continued to drive home dumbfounded and this is when it really hit me that it was something unusual: About 3 minutes later I saw the same lights higher in the sky (about 1000 feet) but they were moving in a south-west direction and increasing in altitude. I was also traveling in a south-west direction (same direction as the lights) and I continued to clearly observe the lights until they were totally out of sight.  This continued for another 5 minutes.The lights stayed in the same shape (3 columns of green light) as they moved off until they were so small that I could no longer see them. The total time from when I first noticed the lights until I saw them disappear was about 10 minutes. Background of observer:  I am a  30 year old male Professional Engineer with a BS degree in Electrical Engineering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This reported event occurred approximately 15-20 minutes after a very dramatic event occurred in New York Harbor, which was witnessed by dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of observers on the Staaten Island Ferry, just west of Governor&#39;s Island.  The NYC event gave rise to the production of a video tape about the incident.))<n>

After school everday I always delivered newspapers and the last house on my route(this is a rural area) was my friends and usually I would stay and play baseball or do whatever then bike back home late at night about 10-11 depending. the road I live on has tree&#39;s and my hoause has a field in the front bordering the road and the road down to my house turns right coming from my friends house (the highway). I was coming along the road on the straight stretch before the turn off on my road and was sort of just looking around daydreaming like I always did coming home and I happened to look sort of up and behind me to the right. I saw a large glowing ball that was gold like and had a ring around it like when it&#39;s foggy out and the moon has one around it I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called. At first it didn&#39;t really click in what it was I thought it was the moon but I thought wait a sec, the moon&#39;s in front of me to the right and it was only about one quarter full so it scared me a little at first but I was biking along the staraight stretch(I first saw the ball at the corner to start the stretch)and biked all the way to the turn off of my road which was about 200-300 metres long. all the way I kept looking back to see if it was there every few seconds or so and it was all the way. When I turned into my road I looked up to the right it was still there, then looked down at the road for a couple secs. and when I looked up at it again I saw it shoot up into the sky like a flash and it was gone. I swear to god this happened to me. I have seen one other UFO in my life which was last summer and 3 other&#39;s saw it too but I will make another submittance for that as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Caller reported the following:<n> <n><n> <n><n> The caller reported that at 2208 hrs. (eastern), she was riding the Staten Island Ferry from the tip of Manhattan to Staten Island.  Just as the ferry was passing Governor&#39;s Island, she became aware of a commotion on the east side of the ferry boat.  People were rushing to that side of the ferry, shouting, pointing, and generally raising a ruckus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She decided to try to determine was the cause of the disturbance, and walked outside onto the passenger deck.  What she saw shocked her.  The object was huge, and it obscured the passengers&#39; view of Governor&#39;s Island.  Many of them reported that the object looked like a city, with lights and a skyline.  However, its presence apparently roiled the water beneath it, causing a froth to appear on the water&#39;s surface!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> For days afterward, the witnessed handed out leaflets at the ferry terminal, hoping to contact other passengers who had seen the object.  Those same people approached 9-1-1 facilities, requesting copies of the tape recorded reports of the object, which was also seen from Governor&#39;s Island, but the tapes were either missing, or not made available, they were told.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A video tape about the incident was prepared, a copy of which is in the possession of NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident apparently was VERY dramatic, and it was witnessed by dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would be most grateful if anyone else who was present that night would please submit a report about what they saw that night.<n>

What was strange was that it was so low, the fact that it was the only thing in the sky, and it was too warm to have ice crystals in the air. I brought my mother&#39;s attention to it and we stopped in the could-a-sac long enough to see it change colors multiple times. We then ran to a neighbor&#39;s house and pointed it out to her. She didn&#39;t believe that what we saw was anything special. Later on we heard that :clouds&#34; like this should be reported as a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Person B noticed and turned as well. Both persons witnessed an orange light about ten finger-widths above the horizon. The object was moving in an erratic manner, with signifigant altitude changes every second.The object then started to move in a southerly direction and dissapeared behind a treeline near the horizon. Both persons, after discussing the object turned and continued walking in a SW direction. After an unspecified amount of time (less than ten minutes, we believe) Person B also felt as if he was being watched. At that point he turned and witnessed a second orange light. traveling about in the same course &amp;the same erratic manner.In further detail of the odd behavior that was observed of the two objects;they were both moving EXTREMELY slowly across the sky, with rapid peaks and descents in their altitude. They would jump in altitude(at least one finger width)and then dop in altitude (at least one finger width) within a seconds time.<n>

My original report may have been written better than my recent one.  To the readers, I apologize for this shortfall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke recently with the other witness and I have made a composite drawing of our accounts.  I neglected to describe the presence of &#34;portholes&#34; or windows in the side of the UFO.  The oversight is the result of poor preparation.  I apologize.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps a more personalized account of the event will shed some additional light on the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred on September 11, 1995, the day after my father-in-law died.  My friend and I were traveling in my 1985 Pontiac Sunbird south along highway 97.  The time was certainly between 4:30 to 6:00 pm because the sun was still fairly high in the sky, but was beginning to cast long shadows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, but there were high clouds, the air was fine and all things considered, it was a fine day for a drive.  I’ll recount the thoughts in my head in italics as the event unfolded:  &#34; JUST DRIVING. Great weather, nice drive; dry pavement, sunshine, cool breeze As we headed south towards Pierce City, I was driving 50-55 mph and was getting prepared to slow down in a few moments, the edge of town was in sight from the hilltop and we began to crest down it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A BLIMP? What’s that to my left?  Big Silvery metal-looking thing. Floating just above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On down the hill, in a field to my front and left I noticed a cigar shaped object with bright lights coming from the center below it.  I assumed it was a blimp with a flashing advertising sign underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT’S TO ADVERTISE? What are they trying to sell?  There’s just trees and squirrels out here.  Where’s the gondola (where people ride).. Oh portholes! how weird, retro, looks like something from a Jules Verne novel! Cool!  HAH At this point, I had noticed that there were porthole windows inside the object itself.  That is odd, blimps have big windows on the little gondolas that hang beneath it.  I remember seeing a single row of about 10 little glassy portholes along the side.  The lights below it were very bright, which I expected were just advertising lights.  Then I laughed out loud and pointed the object out to my friend.  I said,  &#34;Look at the blimp!&#34;  He knew I was wrong immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a later conversation, we discussed the number of portholes, I thought there were between 7 and 10.  My friend said there were twelve.  When I asked him if there could have been 9, he said in a very matter of fact tone, &#34;There were TWELVE.&#34;  Rather than get beat up over the matter, I dropped the topic, and now that I think about it, 12 seems about right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THOSE ARE BRIGHT LIGHTS! Those are bright lights on that thing. Ow they stab my eyes.  Maybe it’s just a reflection from the sun. &#34;Damn that hurts, why is the car all lit up??  Why is he being so quiet? In this very short time I found myself being confronted with bright lights, an awestruck passenger and a UFO, even though I still thought it was a blimp.  My laughter died when I was being  &#34;flashed&#34; by the lights.  If you’ve been flashed by a car on the highway at night, you can begin to understand the annoyance I was going through.  The car had a reddish-yellow glow on the inside from the lighting and I could see my own shadows in the back and passenger’s seats.  My friend was absolutely catatonic with his stare at the craft.  It was only then that I began to realize what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOT A BLIMP AT ALL What’s he gawking at?  That’s no blimp. There’s no tail on it, no writing.  No gondola.  No propellers!! No tail fins!!  crap. As soon as I pass this tree, we can get a good look at this thing.&#34;   At the point I realize it is not a standard blimp is the point where my mind begins to race.  It should be noted that my eyes had a burning sensation. And we both felt a strong &#34;current&#34; going through us.  The current is no more than that weird feeling you get by standing to close to a microwave or watching tv from less than a foot.  (We both agree that there was nothing to get excited about) &#34;Because I am an avid reader and a speed reader, I have terrific eye speed.  I was able to search the craft for humans, writing and propellers.  It had none of them. As we began to approach a roadside tree, we were on pace to be alongside the craft in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A SILVERY STREAK Alright let’s see what this is. Around this tree.  What?  Where is it?  A streak, going up  and right.  IT&#39;S  OVER THE ROAD  &#34; Gone!  Gone  GONE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn’t know it was a UFO until the thing just vanished!  As I prepared to look as the tree passed from view, it plainly wasn’t there.  My friend just made a weird &#34;huh?&#34; noise and I noticed it was streaking up and to the right.( for you geometry people the rate of angle was 60 degrees, straight and at the speed of a blur).  When I say blurred, I mean the craft flashed like a strobe light and at a high speed.  It was quickly overhead and then disappeared completely.  The object had moved from a hover to a speed I would estimate as a little faster than the speed of aerial rockets in fireworks displays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What WAS that? I didn’t know then and I still don’t know now.  But I have happily reported all I know to the people of the world.  My friends have seen UFOs but they won’t report them.  That’s too bad.  But it is their own business, and I respect it.  I encourage others to report what they have seen.  It’s doubtful that the government will send thugs to your house, or aliens will abduct you for talking.  I don’t really believe in either entity much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was moved by my sighting, as was my friend.  He would see another one later.  I know I shouldn’t tell his story, it’s not mine to tell, but I’ll share it anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we saw the UFO in 1995, we searched the skies looking for another.  I haven’t seen one since, but in June 2003, my friend saw his SECOND UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had been waiting for over 7 years to see one again.  He calmly pulled over to the side of the road, parked his car, and reached into the back seat.  What he was reaching for was his camera.  He had it handy.  He pointed and clicked.  But he had forgotten to wind his film.  He quickly wound his film and aimed.  As he got the UFO in the viewfinder, it disappeared!  Now he keeps his camera wound and ready.  He’ll get them next time I’m sure! It might sound like a made-up story, but I believe it, he’s not the type to kid around.  He just sighed and laughed, because he knows I believe him, we’re not crazy, and life is still too good to worry about things like that.<n>

We were on highway 97 heading south.  The sun was shining bright that day and there were only a few high clouds.  About a mile north of the city, there are a few hills and valleys.  As we came down a hill, I noticed an object floating about a hundred feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed it was one of the Goodyear Mini-blimps that they have for sports events.  My first thought seemed reasonable, that it was flying somewhere for a big sports event, I had seen one fly over my house in 1985, so it was not a big surprise to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But two things caught my attention immediately.  First, it was a little skinny for a blimp and secondly, it seemed to be flashing a bright spotlight.  I laughed and pointed it to my friend in the passenger seat.  I had to watch the road, so I looked away for a second to drive, as we passed a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became concerned because my friend&#39;s jaw was wide open, and he had a look of total blankness.  He was able to get a really good look at the object.  As we passed the tree I suddenly realized it was no blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no GOODYEAR written on the side, no propellers, no tail fins, no flashing signs.  What I thought was the harsh reflection of the sun on the skin of a balloon was in fact, a bright light coming from beneath a large (100&#39;) metallic cigar shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only about 100 or 150 yards from the road.  It was barely above tree top level.  I had assumed I would get a good look at it as we continued down the highway.  The object continued to hover for a second, then vanished into a shadowy streak, climbing altitude and disappearing over the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted about 5 seconds.  The craft made no sounds.  A few hundred yards down the road, we saw a family bar-b-que outside, but they were totally oblivious to the sighting.  There were no other cars on the road, so it seems there were only two witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend got a much better look at the craft then I did.  He told me later that there were beams of light shooting out from underneath it.  I can remember being hit with the light, which was very bright.  Because the sun was starting to set on the other side of the road, to my right,my thought was that an unlucky reflection was hitting me in the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I didn&#39;t see, that the passenger did, was that as we came down the hill, two beams of light (like search lights) poured out from the craft and pointed at the car. The light was very bright, but annoyed me to look away. Very quickly, I began to have difficulty remembering the shape of the craft and what it was doing.  A couple of days later, I had forgotten about the lights and was forgetting the shape.  The only thing that was clear to me was what went on in my mind.  I remember what I was thinking just as clearly today as then (8 years later).  I have trouble remembering what I SAW.  That&#39;s odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fortunately my friend remembers it all.  He doesn&#39;t talk about it much, I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll ever say more about it.  We have all the details locked in our memories between us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFOs are pretty common here in Missouri.  There was a sighting this morning (Sept. 19, 2003) outside of Carthage MO (64836)- but I didn&#39;t see it- so I can&#39;t report it.  Four cars saw it, maybe someone else will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We will invite the witness to submit a second report about the apparent sighting in Carthage.  PD))<n>

It stayed there for 15 to 20 seconds.  No trail no sound.  I flicked my lighter to see if it would come and see us.  It then took again in the same direction towards the west but at a very slow pace.  Then with a double click it shut of its light.  The night sky was full of stars and in its immobile state above our heads it was well camouflashed.  Good thing ((deleted)) seen it coming,  no clouds that night and no wind.  No trail and the double click for shutting down its light had an electric feeling to it.  As we were walking through the woods something came to visit me but ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)) didn,t see this. Knowbody neither is there one single sighting reported with this type of creature, neither will I ever talk about it,  that was a gift for that lighter clicking. I contacted an expert and such a creature does not exist. I am reporting only our sighting of the super fast white light because we were three to see it.  Me and ((name deleted)) sent an e-mail yesterday, but we didn&#39;t use this form we sent it to the director I think, there is a better description.  The day I see a sighting where there is creature similar to what I saw is the day I will talk about it.  However nobody would of ever guessed this.  I can only tell you that it is very small.  September sunday the 10th 1995 at 9:12pm to 9:27pm is important an I believe this can be verified.  If you have any questions about the white light it would be a pleasure for me to answer them for you.<n>

We were three fisherman that evening fishing in our secret fishing spot on the jauques cartier river by shannon and the military base.  We have never publicly reported this sighting since we fishing on the wrong side of the fence, inotherwords at the first bridge on the military base valcartier.  The great thing is that we were three witnesses that seen this incrideble sighting.  This was the last legal trout fishing day and even though we were fishing on the wrong side of the fence this sighting could of been seen from the shannon side off the fence.  So from my opinion this has nothing to with the military and I claim this because of a different reason which I mention in this report in detail since I was the only one to see this. And I will wait and see if somebody seen something similar inorder to make sure that hoaxters wont use this part of information. Now me and my friend are writing this report together to get the details as accurate as possible.  Our third friend has moved a few years ago, so he is not with us for now.  So at 12 minutes after 9 that night it was a crystall clear night.  There were so many stars out that night and not one single cloud in the sku.  There was absolutely no wind and it was starting to get cold.  All of a sudden my friend shouts out to me and my other friend hey look at that wow. So I looked at the northwesterly direction and there was this very precise white ligtht slightly larger than the north star, bigger than any star in that present night sky full of stars, so there is nothing blurry about this light.   And when I seen this way high up in and coming so incredibly fast the power and speed is just out of this world, I Immediately knew that this is it.  I have worked as a dog handler in west germany for the british of the rhine and I was out for many nights with my dog and I have seen many meterites and have more experience than most people with meterite sightings, and this is why I knew that this is it.  My two friends were afraid a little but I had the instant reaction of looking at my watch for the time and in my head I said that I am not going to blink my eyes once.  Believe me I had tears running down my eyes by the time this was over. So this light came in so fast and slowed down to a complete halt right above our heads, I was so happy inside off me because I instantly knew I was dealing with the real thing.  And it stayed there immobile without moving at all.  this maybe for a good 6 minutes.  If we didn,t see it coming we would of never noticed it because with so many stars out that night it was very well camouflashed in a sense.  But right from the beginning off this whit lights stop I pulled out my bic lighter and was jumping up and down and shouting at it hey come down come, and my friends stopped me because they were really scared at this point.  But I wasn,t  I am the type of guy that would jump right into the saucer with them were this to happen.   I respect all life in the universe, and I believe this is very important and a very evolved way of thinking.  I would like to mention that humankind may not reach this goal with the way we treat our enviroment and wildlife.  Mankind may need another 20,000 years or so of research in order to be technologically adavanced enough to surpass the speed off galactictic expansion. Anyways I respected my two friends, and to be honest I had a little heart beat myself.  The whole time it was in its immobile state I tried to figure out if whether there was any movement whatsoever but from being under neather it there was no movement whatsoever,  it seemed to be descending it hard to tell.  Also with my lighter clicking I was thinking to myself that if this was a saucer it must off seen my clicking, I even held the lighter in front of my nose to make sure to make sure that what ever was up there seen my face. Well all three of us still fixed on this because if I would of looked elsewhere and looked back at it with so many stars out that night I might of lost sight of it, then again maybe not because in a sense it was the biggest star three times the pinpoint size of a normal star. Besides all off a sudden it took off again in the same direction it was going to in the first place but really slow and constant towards the pmq section of the military base valcartier.  I think a tiny plane could off went faster than this ridicoulously slow pace, compared to the full power high speed it came at.  So to recap, it took about five seconds from the complete far horizon since we were standing in an open space to come to a complete halt.  Then it stayed in this camouflashed starlight state for about at least 4 minutes, Then as it was over civilisation well the pmqs. it all of a sudden shout out its light with a double flicker, we are talking milliseconds here,  my two friends didn,t see this shut down electric feeling of the light, but this is where I believe my keeping eyes on it the whole time payed off.  This double flicker electric feeling is hard to explain in writing but I think I am describing this well.  And thats it.  I would also like to mention that there was absolutely no trail and sound whatsoever.  At about 9:40 we could hear a small plane coming from the west and we could hear this so well.   So we packed our bags, and headed back through the woods in a very dark trail towards the shannon bridge. Something very strange happened though.  My two friends were well ahead of me and without giving any information of what I saw amazed up to this day.  All I will say to you is that it is very small and alive, and 1 inch long.  I will never tell anybody what that was because I will wait and see if there is any report that has seen this same thing.  It is a gift for my lighter clicking because even though it is similar to an earth creature, it doesn,t exist in the books, and nobody ever seen something like this.  The last hint I will give is that it came and looked at me straight inbetween the two eyes. So beware to any hoaxters you will have to be very precise in your sighting to match what I saw.  This way I will be sure the day somebody reports something exactly the same, well then I will tell you what this was.  Up to now no one ever has mentioned something similar so we will leave this at that.  I developed a great interest in sightings in the past few years and whenever there are those people with white light sightings I listen very carefully.  I would like to give a final opininion, about this, I don, think that the military has anything to do with this.  I have a very good reason for that. So I am absolutely not ashamed to report this sighting since we are three fisherman that seen this.  I don,t care what anybody says, but If anybody could off seen the tremendous speed and deceleration of this machine, and the sneaky way of camouflashing itself in it immobile state well I think anybody would go nuts.  But what happened after is a payback for the courage of flicking that lighter on and off. I hope this will be well recorded in the history books of the future, even though it is more or less a simple sighting compared to some other sightings.  Maybe there are radar system records archived somewhere inorder to verify this sighting.  I would also like to congratulate the UFO reporting center for thier work in trying to solve the mystery,  I am now positive that humankind will succeed in proving these ufo sightings. So I tried the best I could and as honestly as I could in this report. This sighting terminated at exactly 9:28 PM September the 10th 1995<n>

We live in the mountains of Southwest Virginia. We heard a humming sound that caught our attention at the same time. We looked around to see where the sound was coming from and then we both looked up to see a huge triangle- shaped aircraft hovering over our house.At the time, we both were having a hard time realizing that an aircraft larger than a football field would be hovering a few hundred feet over our house making so little noise. I guess it didn&#39;t dawn on either of us that this could be a ufo. We actually were just discussing the aircraft and how strange it looked. There was a gondola-like structure (round) which hung underneath the black aircraft.. I thought it might be a stealth plane, but knew they had no such gondola. We could actually see many people moving around in the gondola that were far enough up that they looked minute in size.It was, as I said a huge craft.We thought that the gondola-like center could possibly move up into the ship. There were lights on the corners and smaller lights around the perimeter.As my daughter and I watched, the humming sound became louder and the craft began to move forward and, gathering speed, flew over the small mountain beside our house and then banked left and speeded up even more,and, flying to the left, was quickly was out of sight. After it was gone, my daughter and I just stood and stared at each other and wondered why in the world one of us didn&#39;t run in and get the camera.Before this time I was a serious sceptic about ufos..but now my daughter and I don&#39;t doubt so much. For years, we really haven&#39;t  told anyone except family about this, but now, it seems like it might be a significant sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (<n>

Moonlight night. Easy to see detail as an object,but not airliner,either moving very slowly or stationary at about 800-1000 ft.  We&#39;re both watching the object as we see side view to the East out of car&#39;s side window. Description: wing shaped (chevron),black, running lights on front edge of wing (red), larger than a single engine plane, smaller than jetliner. As I slowed the car down to pull over, the object appeared to be stationary (not moving forward) and did not make any sound at all. A friend later said that it must have been the stealth bomber here for the air show. My question is &#34; why was it hovering over a residential neighborhood in St Charles at 12:30 at night. This description was noted in my diary the next morning in 1995.<n>

I was surprisingly calm and they took note.  After a few minutes, the star field is incredibally brilliant and I am allowed to walk freely to a window or screen.  A matallic cylinder of great size begins to fill the view in the left of the window.  There are white and blue lights running the entire length of it.  Later, before being returned, I saw four species of beings inone place together and I did not feel like a laboratory specimen to them.  Concious memories returned more and more on their own and later went to one of the best regression therapists known (Joe Nyman) in months after for additional support and recollection.   -Respectfully submitted,  ((name deleted))<n>

It made no noise that I could tell.  {the windows were rolled up and the stereo was playing at a moderate volume as my wifes son was a sleep in the back seat.  As this white light flashed through the trees past us, going South in the opposite direction of our travel; I looked in the rear view mirror out of reflex and as I did my wife turned her head and looked over her left shoulder, out the back window. Of course we both saw the same thing. Pitch black. We looked at each other for a second but said nothing about the incident to one another till much later.  ((name deleted))<n>

I went outside in the rear of our home facing the pasture, opposite of where the noise went. I was facing west. At that time something with an approximate wingspan of ten feet flew from east to west, 2o meters from the ground above the Elm trees next to our home. It had a large head and thin hominid body, wings like a moth or insect but did not flap them. This entity landed. My wife saw it also. It was ten or twelve feet tall, red oilish skin, smelled as ammonia. This creature spoke in a very strange manor. I demanded it speak in English of which it spoke in older European dialect. It did us no harm but we fled afterward. It referred to itself as Ivan Cole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an analyst and was a complete skeptic until this event. I would have preferred it never occurred.

I&#39;m not saying what but  they were highly irregular anomalous lights. I live about 1/4 mile north of LAX and have been there over 10 years. I know what types of aircraft are in the sky but more important how they approach and leave the airport and at what time of day. So at 5:45 am this morning I left my apartment for work. I walked out back to the alley which runs parallel to Manchester Bl to get to my car in the carport. Looking due west down the alley, about this time, I noticed a pair of lights, white and blue-green, about 45 deg. above the horizon traveling southwest. It was just before dawn. The air traffic at this time makes its approach from out of the West to land at LAX. So it is very quiet since all the jet noise is over the water. I thought the lights were a helicopter but it turned sharply due South then stopped moving. Helicopters do this but usually at lower altitudes. I would estimate the altitude around 10,000 feet at 2 miles. These lights which seemed to be hovering  had my attention and still I didn&#39;t hear any noise. This time of morning you can hear a pin drop and you would never know you where next door to an international airport. No traffic on Manchester either. Silence. Then I noticed the white light grow very bright and begin moving east toward me.  As it moved east, the space around the light began to glow and spread out in a wider diameter from the source in a  truncated cone shape. The light seemed to be moving through some high altitude clouds but there did not appear to be any outside of its beam. In other words, this area of the light seemed to be filled with swirls of vapor. I followed this light until I was looking nearly straight up with my head bent back. Then the light stopped moving. I thought maybe  the light source was slipping behind a fog bank. But that was not the situation. There were no low clouds or fog. The point source of the light  finally just seemed to disappear in the middle of this bright glow which  was left behind to fade in the clear dark sky and spread out in a sharp afterimage looking like high altitude vapor which was being illuminated by the sun still below the horizon. This entire sighting lasted 45-60 seconds.<n>

Shortly after, the entire area would flood with overflow from an old storm.  I believe at the time we were in 7th grade and enjoyed playing near the forest.  Have heard from others strange things have happened in these exact same woods and sometimes you need to steer clear of these places to be safe.  Perhaps someone else has had a similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not say it is demonic in nature, perhaps closer to alien like activity which is why I believe it may be of interest here.  Supernatural in the same sense, we can push aside such folklore and myths of the past to suggest it may have been some type of extraterrestrial, not the traditional cliche grey though something much more fearful scary and sinister, a reason to look your doors and windows at night.  It may be taken as demonic by some except that would be not be the full understanding of such a being and how it would see us.  I am not sure if it &#34;radiated&#34; we ran so fast away from this  being of great dark power.   The closest approximation of it&#39;s appearance would be a nightmare imp from Doom. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=90383333  I doubt this artist&#39;s vision can give it justice though.  I advocate for others to share if they have run into this same situation, whether it was a hallucination, dream, or something else. Perhaps it could be something far worse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None the less people need to keep their eyes and ears open for such a &#34;person&#34; as it is worthy of study.  This has been discussed on the web and no one has really offered a rational explanation beyond the obvious; it was a hallucination, or even a imaginative reaction to the shadow people folklore, perhaps a hysterical occurrence of normal origin mistaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My own opinion on this matter is if you encounter this being you could stay to see exactly what this person is and what they are doing, though it may be wiser to turn a blind eye and run very fast never looking back.  You would be better off protecting yourself than learning what this exactly is and leaving it alone at just that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The light lasted about three minutes and then it dissapeared. My mom told us all to out and up towards the sky to see if there was any thing in the sky. We didn&#39;t see anything after that, the car that was in front of us had pulled over along side the road and when we passed it, the two people in side were trying to wave us down, we were all a little nervious so we kept going until we got home.

I heard an airforce jet,so I looked up.  At about 1:00 oclock high, the jet was heading  north.  It had six star-like objects following it.  Moving at a rapid pace.  I called my daughter outside to see them.  The size of the objects were about the size of a ping-pong ball.  They were following the jet.  The duration of this sighting was about one minute.  My daughter and I went back in, and were in shock.  I kept looking out the windows for more objects,but none.  At about 11:00 oclock a.m., my daughter had finished the dishes, and the water had to be pumped back up again from the well.  As soon as I opened the door, there, at 12:00 oclock high were anywhere from 150 to 200 of these objects.  Star-like, shapes varied in size and shape.  This time however, they were lower down about 100 feet.  The objects went up and down and side-ways.  Time frame of sighting to finish on this group was aproximately 20 minutes.  These were bright lights, and they appeared at times to dance across the sky.  One object came fairly close to my daughter.  Within 20 feet.  She saw a metalic like center in it.  Since then, she has had several medical problems.  One being no thyroid function.<n>

Verified next day by independant witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heard you want past reports, so here you go. Before I&#39;d ever heard of Art Bell or triangular craft, I had an experience that shook me - literally. I was deep asleep one night when something stirred me. In that dreamy consciousness you get I remember feeling like I was vibrating. I thought I heard a noise and remember thinking, &#34;What is a jumbo jet doing flying over Ocean Shores?&#34; The noise got louder over several minutes until I thought to myself &#34;this thing is going to crash right on the beach.&#34; I sat up, fully awake. The noise was gone and I realized I hadn&#39;t actually heard it audibly, that it was more like a sub-sonic vibration. I ran outside and looked up into the sky and saw a formation of seven red lights overhead. At first I thought it was a very slow moving formation of helicopters. But then I back and got my glasses. When I returned I could see that it was instead a single, triangular shape. I could judge this because the it was a partially overcast night and I could see the orange glow of the town&#39;s streetlights (about half-mile away) everywhere except between the small red lights. I stood stunned as the craft passed overhead slowly, moving from south to north along the coastline. I estimate it was only a couple of hundred feet above and travelling about 10 mph. I can&#39;t estimate the width, but see the following diagram: craft \---------------/ \             / \           / \         / \       / \     / approx. 60 degree angle ------ me -------- Next morning I was ready to write the whole story off and convinced myself that it had actually been a squad of helicopters. Later that afternoon I was in one of the local shops talking to the owner when a friend of her&#39;s came in and said he had seen something exciting. I had never met this man before, or told anyone about my experience, but he went on to describe what he called &#34;the mother ship&#34; exactly as I had seen it. He added that this was not the first time he had seen craft of this type in the North Beach area. When I asked, the man said that his sighting had been in the Copalis Beach area, about 10 miles north of Ocean Shores.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The diagram, embedded in the text, did not survive the transfer from our e-mail program to our database.
