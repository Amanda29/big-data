Saw first hand object and passengers inside.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34341.html|1|ndxe197305| Saw a U.F.O. over backyard at very close proximity to house located across from airport.  Saw first hand object and passengers inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I remember it so vividly was our son was a small baby three weeks old.  I was up watching TV after having fed the baby and put him back down.  I got up to get a drink of water in the kitchen.  I did not turn any lights on in the rest of the house just the light from the TV set.  The drapes in the family room were closed so it was hard to see just the light from the TV screen.  I got to the kitchen sink and looked up and there it was right over our back yard.  It was just a few feet from our kitchen window over the back yard.  I was just paralyzed for a shor time and stood in awe of it.  It was pulsating light and I could see figures inside but couldn&#39;t tell what they quite liiked like.  I finally made my body move and I ran in the bedroom to get my husband up.  By the time he got going and we got back out to the kitchen it was gone but not completely.  It hovered around out about a half mile.  I watched as it dove and spun and glided so gracefully.  My husband never did see what I was pointing out to him and to this day I think he thinks I lost my mind but I know what I saw and I know how close it was to me and I know how frightened I was at the time.  Now I wish I had called the police to report it but my husband said no way he didn&#39;t want anyone to think his wife was a fruit cake, but I know what I saw and I know I watched the thing fly around for almost 15 minutes.  We are directly across from the Greater Peoria Airport and I wanted to call the tower and ask them if they saw it but I didn&#39;t do it and now I regret that decision also.  I have talked with several other people who have also had an experience that was of an out of this world kind and I want to record it so that others know they are not alone when they say they saw a U.F.O.  I did see it very clearly and I did watch it for quite some time before it finally glided out of my line of sight.  I went to bed but I did not sleep well for several weeks after that strange occurence.  I am not a nut case I can assure you t! hat this is what really happened.   I would be glad to talk with you by phone if you wish.  Thanks for letting me record this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My ship was a 327 ft Cutter.  It can be viewed if you google Coast Guard Cutter Spencer WHEC-36.  I have tried to the best of my ability to recall the date, but since we stood so many Ocean Stations, it is hard to remember which of those this occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The conditions were warm, seas calm, and sighting occured during the night.  There were 140 mean aboard the Spencer, and a large number of my fellow crewmen witnessed what I did.  Officers and enlisted men saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember a ((specialty deleted)) had some state-of-the-art photo equipment.  I think he had an Olympus camera with telephoto lens.  He was at least one crewmen photographing this UFO.  We were in the middile of the Atlantic, all running ligh! ts on as usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember someone saying come on deck, there&#39;s a UFO.  The UFO had bright lights that changed color.  It was if the UFO was checking us out.  A ship with all its running lights on would be easily seen from above in the Atantic.  I was ((specialty deleted)).  Some names I remember were fellow ((specialties deleted)).  ((name #1 deleted)), ((name #2 deleted)) and ((name #3 deleted)).  I can&#39;t be sure they were aboard for this Duty, but I&#39;m sure at least one was.  I can not remember the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO would come down hovering above us.  We could see what I would describe as portholes.  I rotated as it hovered.  The lights changed color.  Then it would go up in a second becoming very small.  Then it seemed to show off, as if it knew we were watching it.  It would accelerate across the sky in a split second while doing right angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many photos of this craft were taken with telephoto lens.  I remember I couldn&#39;t wait to see the photos after they were developed.  I never saw them.  The show lasted about an hour.  Messages of this sighting were sent to Washington, DC.!<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were relieved from Ocean Station Duty, we headed back to Governor&#39;s Island, Yankee Pier, where was our home port.  We were not expecting the reception that we received.  As we were docking, I saw quite a few &#34;Men In Black&#34; waiting to board our ship.  Usually after docking, if you did not have duty, we were granted liberty of usually 72 hours.  No one was allowed to leave the ship.  We were all interrogated one by one by these &#34;Men In Black&#34;.  We were told to sign an affidavit, stating we saw nothing.  We were warned that if we mention this to anyone, we would be gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were told not to go to any news media, and try and tell this story.  If we did, we would be prosecuted by the govenment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found out later that my friend, the ((specialty deleted)) had all of his photo equipment, pictures, and developing equipment confiscated.  He was not reimbursed for any of his expensive equipment, it was simply taken from him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will end the story here, to be brief as possible.  Please give me a call at ((number deleted)) my home phone after recieving this, so I know you received it.  Please keep this confidential as possible.  I&#39;m sure you will.  I will research the Internent and my old photos, to see if I can get some crewmember names.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in the early 1970&#39;s is approximate.

It had lights spaced around it at the center and fired a beam at one of the aircraft. I could tell more if I can find someone serious about this.

We saw what looked like a star moving from east to west.  Another star like light moved from the north to the south and intersected with the craft.  Followed it for a distance and then headed south.

5/15/73 22:00|Chugiak|AK|Rectangle|several minutes|Black oblong boxes, connected by what looked like a hose, silently floating at tree top level with no lights about the size of big rigs|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31169.html|5|ndxe197305| Black oblong boxes, connected by what looked like a hose, silently floating at tree top level with no lights about the size of big rigs<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember the month or date, as it was so long ago, or the zip code for then as things have grown and changed. I have never heard of anything like this. We lived several miles from both an army and air force base and their helicopters were a constant nuisance, flying way lower than they were supposed to do. So low, I could see the faces of the pilots and it would shake my house and wake up my babies, drowning out anything I was watching on TV or radio for several minutes at a time. I would call and complain to whoever I could and they would deny they were their helicopters, as they were required to fly no lower than 1,000 feet and not over residential areas, having different flight paths, I was told. I got nowhere with stopping them. I would call when they were pounding noise over my house and tell them to hear this and tell me they weren&#39;t coming over my house, but it did no good. They only denied they knew anything about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived out in a remote area, where houses were spaced out and far from town, however we had houses and an apt. building within sight of us on a lonely country road surrounded by acres of thick woods. My house was a mobile home placed on a brick basement down in a dip or hollow of the dirt road with rises of hills on either side of us. We were surrounded by woods and tall skinny trees. Aspen, birch and pine. There was nothing on the other side of the road from us and behind us but woods. We also had thick woods on either side of us, but at the top of the hills, were houses. We had a dog that was about 98% wolf and Malamute. He was big, fast and fearless. He was always barking at moose or bear that would come into our yard and was afraid of nothing and no one. We kept him leashed on our deck at night. He usually kept silent watching until an intruder would come too close and then I&#39;d hear his chain sliding across the wood before he&#39;d start barking to chase them off, pulling on his chain to give chase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He ran free in the daytime with me for protection from bear and moose as I&#39;d take the baby up the road for a stroller ride. One time he saved the life of my 1 yr old baby and myself when he lept out of the woods to get in front of her stroller to face 2 St. Banard dogs that were threatening my daughter, growling at her, inching closer to her with teeth hanging out and intentions to attack her. I didn&#39;t know what to do with her in front of me just 2 feet from those hostile dogs. Afraid to make any sudden moves. But then, there was my protector, with fangs bared, hackles raised, head lowered, long legs spread ready to pounce, and this terrible rumbling sound coming out of his throat, my dog stood his ground before them giving me time to turn around and run down the hill to my house while he tangled with them both. I thought they&#39;d kill him, but he came home unscathed and smiling, pretty happy with himself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides the helicopters that bothered me so much, I had interference with my TV that only got 3 channels in those early days in alaska broadcasting. The screen would suddenly get snowy and then I&#39;d hear intermittent beeping noises that were very strange and sporadic, like a code or signal of some kind. Very high pitched. If I watched the snowy screen, after awhile it seemed to form into patterns I could see somehow in conjunction with the beeps. Usually after that, the black helicoptes would come flying over my house so low I would run out and curse them, shaking my fist at them. My wolf dog would watch them, unbothered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this one night, I was ironing while watching TV while my husband dozed in his chair and my babies slept in their rooms. The dog was out on the porch. Suddenly the TV did it&#39;s snowy beeping thing that made me mad because I was watching a movie. But while it was quiet, I heard the dog&#39;s chain sliding across the wood deck like it did when something or someone came into our yard, and then I couldn&#39;t believe my ears, as he was whining like some terrified dog next to the house wall. I had never, ever, seen or heard such behavior from him for any reason. He got louder and louder and was scratching and banging on the wall in the corner of the deck, trying to get off his leash and run away. Trying to hide for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t believe this and without thinking I could be in any danger, as he would be taking on any bear or moose that could be there, I opened the door to see what could possibly be wrong with him. What in the world could be out there to make him be acting this way? This was a first and I wanted to see what would scare this brave dog. When I opened the door to tell him to stop it, I looked to my left where he was cowering without looking to my right. I was scolding him when I noticed he wasn&#39;t looking at me, but over my head, behind me, while he was trying to back himself into the corner of the house, pushing back with his front paws as he sat down with his back to the wall and nowhere else to go. Something in his eyes, the look on his face of pure terror made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and I wondered what he was seeing behind my back that I hadn&#39;t looked at when I came out on the deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around and was so shocked by what I saw that I almost fainted. I noticed at the same time that the night had taken on a very loud hush. Not a sound was to be heard and it seemed there was a heavy thick feeling in the air. The silence was profoundly loud, somehow. Total silence, giving me the sensation that time stood still or suspended as nothing but my dog moved behind me or made a sound. Everything felt slowed down somehow. Slow motion for me. Slow thinking, responses, maybe shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And in this total silence, there hung at tree top level on the hill above my house, two oblong black boxes, just hanging there, sort of floating, not moving or making a sound. One was right at the tree top level, the other one was slightly behind it and higher. A cord of some kind connected the two boxes like a gas hose, coming down from the higher one and bending like an &#34;S&#34; to the lower one. Reminded me, in later years, of the way our airplanes refuel each other while flying. But it connected them from the back of the lower one to the front of the higher one. There was nothing discernable on or about them to say which was front or back or anything distinguishable in any way. They were smooth without anything sticking out or raised or reflecting any light. They had no lights either. They were about the size of the freight containers that big rigs pull, or bigger. Very long and square edged. They were solid, dense, black. No shine. I couldn&#39;t comprehend how these heavy looking solid huge box shaped things were defying gravity to be so silently hanging there. Just there where nothing should have been floating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly hit me that my wolf dog was still crying and trying to dig a hole thru the deck behind me to get away and I was all alone standing there facing this dangerous situation outside in the dark. I hadn&#39;t even heard him for that time in space. I felt very threatened by it. It seemed malevolent. Brooding, watching me. Caught in the act, whatever it had been doing as they floated there. I felt watched like a bug on a slide. That it would somehow grab me or hurt me any second, the longer I waited out there all alone. It was obvious my protector was not going to be protecting me this nite. No one knew I was out here, either. My hair felt like it was standing up all over my body, like electricity in the air. After staring at that for I don&#39;t know how long as I seemed too stunned to move, it was like I &#34;woke up&#34; suddenly, coming to my senses. I turned to the front door I&#39;d come out of to dash back in the house and was so afraid, I couldn&#39;t get the door to open or the knob to turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pounded hysterically on the door, calling to my husband to open it up as I thought it had locked behind me. All the while I pounded on the door and screamed for help, I was aware it was still hanging there to my left, watching me. I was afraid it would take me I was making so much noise, if the door didn&#39;t open. I don&#39;t know why I thought going thru that door would save me. After what seemed like an eternity of banging, the door opened and I fell in the door to the floor, yelling at him to shut the door, shut the door. He was confused, not knowing what was going on, saying the door hadn&#39;t been locked and what was wrong with me and the dog? I hurridly told him about the black oblong boxes hanging ominously outside up on the hill and he laughed at me like I&#39;d been dreaming. Maybe 15 seconds had gone by since I fell in the door and I dragged him outside to see for himself but they were gone. Completely gone. Not a trace. We went back inside, I was shaking all over, telling him over and over what I&#39;d seen. The beeping stopped on the TV and the program came back on and then the helicopters came by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told many people about this story, hoping to find anyone else who has seen such a strange thing but no one has. I called MUFON several years ago to ask if anyone had ever reported anything remotely similar to it, as it has bothered me for all these years since then, wondering what it was, if I had been in danger, if I had missing time. It seemed to be later when I was back in the house than when I went out there. I thought I was only out there for less than a minute, but at least 15 minutes had gone by or more when I came back in. What took my husband, who was sleeping in his chair not 5 feet from the door, so long to wake up and open the door with all the commotion I was making? Why was my wolf so terrified when nothing fazed him in his life before that? I wondered what my dog saw that I didn&#39;t or didn&#39;t remember seeing? Or what he heard or sensed that I didn&#39;t. The man that I talked to at MUFON said that around that time in Canada just a couple, or maybe a few isolated cases of black oblong or square boxes were reported, but never again or from anywhere else that he knew of. He had no clue about it anymore than I did, saying it was fairly rare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know what they were, what they were doing there, if anyone else has ever experienced anything like it or has any ideas about what we experienced. It was also strange that it was so quiet and no one else seemed to know about it. Other dogs weren&#39;t barking or whining. How did they leave so fast? I am not a good person to measure distances, but I&#39;d say the tree was maybe 4 carlengths (end to end) high, and it was maybe 5 or 6 car (van) lenghts (end to end) from my property up to the hill where the tree was where they were at. I don&#39;t know how far that measures, but they were close. And what about those black helicopters? I always thought they were associated with the military bases, but what were they doing always going over my house and that beeping on my TV?  I&#39;ve seen other things at different times in different places, but maybe I should make a different report out for each one. Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

((name deleted)) was living with his family in Madison just north of the base so I would go there often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8pm ((deleted)) said come outside as he saw something so I grabbed some binoculars and the camera and we climbed on the roof of the house.  We could see over treetop level to the secret part of the base where was hovering just above the trees a saucer shaped object with spaced flashing red lights on the rim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about fifteen minutes two large jet aircraft (possibly C134) circled around and one would dive at the UFO continuously for several minutes until the UFO shot a white pencil beam of light like a lazer at the nose of the jet.  The jet flew directly over us and I saw the jet numbers but figured I better forget and the jet left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes later a jet fighter came in diving at the UFO.  I noticed that the width of the saucer was about the length of the fighter about 60 feet.  I didn’t take any pictures this whole time for certain reasons but we could see clearly especially with the binoculars. Finally the UFO must of got the hint and settled down below the trees.  The two jets circled for about 45 minutes then left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this whole time the Huntsville airport is usually busy but not one plane was heard until around 2am as we could see it from the top of the house.  Since I have space I’ll mention the first incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can’t remember if it was the same night or the night before at ((name 1)) house we heard on the radio that the spacelab was launched and would fly over us about 8pm and that part of it was built at Redstone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood outside and saw it going by from west to east like a moving star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then from the north another object intersected with the spacelab, followed it shortly then went south. We thought we don’t have anything that can do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later we heard on the radio that the meteor shielding was ripped off the skylab but that it happened during launch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

A friend and I were looking in a northwest direction above the horizon, when we noticed a very fast moving object heading north along the coast.  It was too far away to describe a shape, but appeared to leave a white tail.  As it was gaining in altitude, after traveling 5 or 10 miles, it suddenly made a 90 degree turn (I mean, a complete left angle)heading upward in a west direction and quickly disappeared through the atmosphere.  There was no sound.  It was incredibly fast and quiet!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was May of 1973 in Texas City, Texas.  I was 11 or 12. It started getting dark.  Everyone dispersed after an hour or so.  I stayed outside and set quietly on the grass in front of our new house.  Directly across the street lived a family, I will call Cark. I could see in their front window.  The family was all sitting around the TV. Their family room was brightly lit. Envy welled up in me. I so wanted a normal family life.  My step-father was a drunk.  There was a lot of dysfunction in my house.  I diverted my attention to the sky. It was an unusually cool spring evening with little or no humidity.  The sky was bright with what looked like a trillion stars.  The pollution was non-existent from the refineries that were close by and the air was light and crisp.  I closed my eyes and listened to the sounds of the bugs and distant cars.  All of a sudden there was an abrupt silence that fell over the area where I sat. Wh! en I opened my eyes, I noticed something hovering over the Cark’s house. I couldn’t make out a shape, because it was so bright.  Later I remember thinking that it had a half oval shape.  I remember feeling like I was getting a tan on my face.  I couldn’t move and I didn’t even feel like I could blink.  I tried to open my mouth to holler at someone in my house, but I couldn’t utter a sound.  My mind kept saying that I was not seeing what I thought I saw.  The last thing I remember was a feeling of terror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed like a minute or two had passed and I found myself standing about three feet from where I was originally sitting.  The bright object was gone and the Cark’s were back to watching their family show together. The sounds of the late spring night had returned and I felt a chill go across my body. I turned and ran into the house.  I went straight to the bathroom to wash my hands. I felt dirty and kind of sticky. When I looked up in to the mirror, I saw my face. It looked like I had been at the beach all day long. It didn’t hurt, but I put aloe vera gel on it anyway.  I went in to the kitchen to get a glass of water and noticed that the clock showed the time to be 10:30 p.m. I immediately went in to my room to confirm the time on my alarm clock.  My alarm clock said the same thing.  &#34;There is no way 2 ½ hours could have past,&#34; I thought. It seemed to me to have been no more than five minutes. I walked around the house to tell anybody, but my step-father was passed out, m! y brother and sister were asleep and mom was at work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fear overwhelmed me and I ran in to my room, jumped in my bed and put the covers over my head.  I thought about it for a couple of days afterwards. I even asked the Cark boy that was my age, if he heard or saw anything.  He said that he didn’t.  I didn’t think about it again until 1988 when I had an out of body experience hovering over my self and my new baby while we slept in bed.  A bright light came in to the room. It was pitch black outside, but it looked like broad daylight in my room.  The fans stopped and it there was no sound at all.  The next thing I knew,  I was back in bed and it was pitch black dark in my room.  The fans were blowing and I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1990 I had a child and needed a C-section.  After my surgery and recovery the doctor asked me when I had my fallopian tube and ovary cut out.  I told her that I never had that kind of a surgery.  She documented the information and had nurses verify.  When I told my family, they said that the doctor had probably accidently cut them out during the C-section.  I bought the idea.  Since then, I have spoken to friends of mine who are doctors and they said that it was highly unlikely that one fallopian tube and ovary would have been cut out on accident by the doctor.  I have recently been writing in a journal I started in 2006 and as I came up to the 1970’s, my recollection of the May 1973 event became refreshed in my mind.  I did not feel the need to report this until, my 22 year old daughter who I have told the story, told me about a case called Dortery (sp) that occurred in a near by city of Alta Loma, Texas, in the same year of 1973.  I don’t know if there is a correlation, but ! I wanted to give all of my truthful recollection and let the professionals make that determination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

5/1/73 09:00|Gaithersburg|MD|Disk|3-4 minutes|Disk-shaped object with sequentially-flashing green lights around the perimeter -- 5/73 -- flying low.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47586.html|13|ndxe197305| Disk-shaped object with sequentially-flashing green lights around the perimeter -- 5/73 -- flying low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I have entered this before -- but in July 1973 by mistake.  It was in the SPRING. ..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was entering Rt. 70S from Fields Road (70S is now 270).  The ramp dumps you onto the road about 50 feet before you go under the Shady Grove Road underpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was heading under I noticed something round up in the sky.  As I emerged from the underpass I was already looking up to see if I could see the object.  At first I couldn&#39;t and I wondered if it had changed direction, when all of a sudden it came into view, not high, but at a much lower altitude than at first.  It was crossing the highway in front of my car going roughly from NW to SE.  I think it was flying too low for legal airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, since I was almost under it, it looked just like a big black disk, but a second or two later it got far enough away to see the edge of it -- which was a band of sequentially-flashing green lights.  That&#39;s when I knew this wasn&#39;t anything ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued in the SE direction -- I sped up to about 90 MPH because it was the only thing I could do to see more, but I couldn&#39;t keep up ... I think it must have been traveling 300-400 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object go into the distance and noticed that it kept descending, so that eventually I was looking straight out at it.  My location on Rt. 70S was high ground, and in 1973 there wasn&#39;t much built up along it, so there was a pretty clear view of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After awhile it was so far that I couldn&#39;t even make out the flashing lights anymore.  It began to veer slightly toward the east. ....<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, in almost the exact spot, WPGC announced that the Air Force said that the object reported by some observers the day before was &#39;an experimental airplane with sequentially flashing lights.&#39;  The announcement did not include anything about the fact that this object had no wings of the type our aircraft usually has. ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred about 9 a.m. over a highway that in those days wasn&#39;t as busy as it is in 2005, but there was other traffic besides myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll never forget this and am still hoping to find someone else who saw it and did the research to find out what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the radio announcement said the Air Force made the statement, and the object did kind of veer off toward Andrews AFB, I never talked about it for 28 years.  (I can draw a sketch of what I saw if I could talk to a researcher.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
