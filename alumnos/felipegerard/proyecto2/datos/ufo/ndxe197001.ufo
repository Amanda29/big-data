It was three colors: bright orange on the bumps, a bright blue middle stripe, and the bottom was green.  It would start with the bumps on the top bright orange, then the blue would be the brightest, then the green and it would keep rotation the brightness of the colors.  I was driving on I-70 between Denver and Golden, headed to Golden.  I saw it from the left side of the car at about eye level.  My car engine died and would not start until the thing disapeared.  I stayed there for about 20 minutes with the colors kind of in a strobe mode from the top to the bottom in order of brightness.  I was eighteen and headed to Golden to get my graduation pictures for the school album.  After 20 minutes it just kind of faded away.  There were no sounds.  I have only told this to one other person until now.  I will send a crude drawing, it would be impossible to really draw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/22/70 10:00|San Mateo|CA|Sphere|30 Seconds|Schools kids witness UFO|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84924.html|2|ndxe197001| Schools kids witness UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1970 I was attending Bayside Middle School in San Mateo, California.  I don&#39;t recall what time of year it was, but because of the weather I believe it was either early Fall or early Spring.  It was a clear crisp morning with blue skies and no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with a small group of students, about a dozen of us, and Mr. Ford the Physical Education coach doing calisthenics near the swimming pool.  We were waiting our turn to run laps, when we were all suddenly mesmerized by the sight of a UFO.  No one said a word as we viewed this object for about 30 seconds before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was spherical in shape. It was a bright silver metallic color.  The sun was reflecting off it&#39;s surface as it rotated in a revolving motion.  Similar to a planet rotating on it&#39;s axis.  It appeared to be about 200 feet above the ground and 150 yards from where we were at.  It made no sound, and hovered in one position until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most memorable thing about this sighting was how the UFO disappeared. Almost as in slow motion, it looked like the sky opened up and the UFO slipped in to it.  The best way I can describe what this looked like is if you were to lay a coin on top of a piece of paper.  Cut a small slit in the paper the size of the coin.  Then slide the coin through the slit, so you can no longer see it. That&#39;s how this UFO appeared to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting, Mr. Ford was in shock and disbelief.  He told us not to say a word or tell anyone about what we saw. I never understood his reason why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I tried to contact him.  Unfortunately he never returned my message.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note. At that time I was a newspaper delivery boy for the San Mateo Times, and recall reading a newspaper article about UFO sightings near Coyote Point in San Mateo.  I have tried finding the article at the local library, but without success.  Bayside Middle School and Coyote Point are both on the San Francisco bay just south of San Francisco International Airport.<n>

They were observing me and had forced me pull over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One Sunday evening in the winter of 1970 about 7:pm, I had decided to go to my fathers house which was only about 6 or 7 miles away.  I turned left off Hy. 60 which led me south on a rural road.  I had proceeded no more than about 100 yds. when I was stopped by what ap- peared to be police lights.  Having pulled over, I looked back and was perplexed not to see a police car. (I thought it was the local pol- ice because I was now in the city limits of town.)  I thought per- haps I had been speeding or something.  At that moment, the interior of my pickup was flooded with light.  I then realized that a ufo had pulled me over by using simulated police lights and that they were now observing me.  The craft was by now very visible and exceedingly close.  It was about 50 yds. off to my right and about a telephone poles&#39; height from ground level.  It was very luminous and quite large; as big as a football field.  It seemed to be constructed of a shiny material somewhat like aluminum and was the typical saucer shape.  (Like two saucers put together.)  I observed the craft for a few moments and left as I had read of abductions and I didn&#39;t want to be in that category. (scared stiff)  I saw no aliens. There were several things about this sighting that to me were peculiar.  The first was the use of police lights and the second was the fact that this happened in a well-populated area (a church and hospital were nearby) as well as in a residential area.  Also, the craft appeared suddenly and disappeared just as quickly.  (It didn&#39;t just fly in or out, it literally disappeared.)  There was absolutely no sound of any kind. I would like to point out that I have never been prone to hallucinations and have always been a very moderate drinker. (At this particular time I didn&#39;t drink at all and in any event I have never drank so much that I would see things like that.) I have always considered myself a normal, well-adjusted person and have always kept an open mind to the ufo phenomena.  I am now a staunch believer.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.<n>

I had gone outside ahead of the rest of my family, saw the object about 20 feet from me hovering about 10 feet off the ground, I stared at it for a few min. then I walked back into the house and my sister  asked me where I had been, that she had been looking for me for an hour.<n>
1/14/70 21:00|Algiers (Algeria)||Rectangle|60seconds|Bright and low flying UFO's|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25803.html|6|ndxe197001| Bright and low flying UFO&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event was observed by the National Observatory in Bouzareah in Algiers and reported in the algerian &#34;El Moudjahid&#34; newspaper the day after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure which day of the month  it really was,but at about 9pm in January of 1970,I was playing soccer with my brother when suddenly a fleet of UFO&#39;s crossed the sky right abbove us. There were bright orange, very luminous but the source of light could not be seen, the were rectangular, almost square with rounded corners. They each had a small flame in the back. They were large and were flying at a relatively low altitude about 1000 ft I would say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were quiet (no sound), flew from one horizon to another in less than 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were flying all at the same constant speed, in a very organized way. They were flying in rows of 5 or 6 and basically were forming a matrix like unit. There must have been 3 or 4 dozens of them, may be more. They were hard to count because of their constant change of position of the trailing fleet elements to the front of the fleet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most striking thing was that some of the ships in the last row would come out of the fleet perpendicular to the fleet, still moving at the same pace as the fleet, move forward with amazing acceleration, and get ahead of the pack sideways inward  to form an element of a newly formed first row. Basically the trajectory was linear and never did it curve, but rather changed directions at right angle! The next few, I kept observing the sky and there was a lot of activities. One time I saw bright spots moving in the daytime sky. Some of those would be still, and then accelerate very fast toward space and their visibility would fade.<n>

I passed between a barn and house following an old tote road used by snowmobiles. I entered woods bordering both side of the trail. I had gone about 50 feet and infront of me possibly 50 yds ahead, I saw three large circular lights. I only saw the lights. They were blue and red and blinked in some timed fashion. I don&#39;t remember hearing anything and that&#39;s what surprised me most. It appeared as if wind was blowing around the lights, yet, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Then the sirens on base started going off &amp; the craft was still making passes at a very fast speed  and doing manuvers that no air craft I have ever seen do at high speed ( back then or since ) I also had a time loss of about three hours that night, and was late 3 hours getting home I have memories of the  Dr.s &amp; the nurses at the Base Hospital holding me down to try to get something  out of my head &amp; they couldnt restrain me &amp; had to call in my father to help them hold me down ( I was only between like 6 - 10 years old ) and I remember the Dr. approaching me with a very large syringe with a needle approx. 3-4 inches long and I just knew I didnt want them to stick that thing in my head as I got older ( Im 38 now) I lost some hair (baldy) ha ha .I have a noticable mark on my upper left side of my head bluish green in color about the size of a large guage needle or slightly bigger anything like this on record anywhere else?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

This was something I witnessed as a young child and there are things I simply cannot remember.  I was approximately five years old at the time this event took place. The year would have been around 1970.  The exact date and time cannot be established.  It was a beautiful sunny day, typical of most days in Puerto Rico.  My account is  mundane, but it is the true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was in the US Navy, stationed in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  My parents were visiting friends who lived near a playground.  Across the street from the playground was an empty beach.  My older brother and I went to the playground along with the children of my parent’s friends.  We had only been there a short while when we witnessed a silver saucer shaped craft either fall or land in the ocean.  I don’t recall details of the actual descent; but it didn’t make much of a splash.  It just bobbed in the water.  No one emerged from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I think we’d better go in now,&#34; my brother said.   We went inside and did not mention what we’d seen to our parents until years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting I was not afraid, though my brother seemed apprehensive.  I know there were cars traveling on the road between our location and the ocean, and I’ve often wondered if anyone else saw what we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

1/1/70 12:00|Grand Rapids|MI|Disk|30 Minutes|Low flying, zig-zagging disc with lights in the 70's|11/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32969.html|10|ndxe197001| Low flying, zig-zagging disc with lights in the 70&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am telling this story as a second hand experience as told to me by a couple that is extremely good friends with my family- the couple babysat me as a youngster, I grew up with their youngest son, and they still remain very close friends with my parents.  The story begins while my family and the couple mentioned, along with their son, were vacationing up north on Portage Lake.  In the cabin one evening, we all decided to share strange occurrences we had experienced in the past- paranormal events and stuff like that.  I thought this was strange for my friend&#39;s parents to bring up because they are such content, sincere folks- the type of people one wouldn&#39;t associate with UFO sightings.  Anyways, they started off by asking one another if they remembered what they called &#34; the flying saucer&#34; in the field back about thirty years ago.  Then they proceeded to tell us the story of the disc they saw during the seventies over the field that is only a block from my current residence.  As I describe the story they told, I will refer to the couple as &#34;Dan&#34; and &#34;Ann&#34;.  Here is what they told myself and my family of their experience:<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day (unsure of exactly what season they said) Dan was riding his bike back from the local grocery store a few blocks away.  On his rode home, he noticed a large, blackish-metallic, low flying disc with lights around its perimeter near the water tower down the road from the grocery store.  Being only a few blocks from home, he peddaled home, as fast as he could, with the water tower and stationary ufo on his right and the field and his home on the left (Dan and Ann&#39;s home at the time was right at the field&#39;s edge).  Dan immdeiately got Ann to come and see the spectacle outside.  When they both got back outside, the disc was over the field, moving slowly in the direction of their home, then it stopped.  Dan and Ann watched the disc for several minutes, as it slowly changed direction, heading back toward the direction of the grocery store Dan had just came from.  As it! flew, it slowly spun (I am almost positive they said it spun) and was outlined with greenish-yellowish, almost fluorescent lights. During flight, it silently zig-zagged slowly back and forth while still heading in the same direction.  Dan and Ann watched the disc until it flew out of sight.  They never heard of anyone else seeing it or of any reports in the newspaper or on tv.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ~ These people I have known my entire life telling me of this event now, to me, makes the phenomena of UFOs and otherworldly life a reality.  Another thing that the couple emphasized in the telling of their story was that the disc moved as if it wasn&#39;t effected by the same scientific barriers as we on earth currently are- the way it zig-zagged during flight effortlessly gave them the distinct feeling that this craft was either other-worldly or far, far, far ahead of its time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (the date, time, and year of the sighting are mere estimates- I am absolutely sure that it was in the 1970&#39;s, though).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

1/1/70 02:00|Joplin|MO|Unknown|30 min|Large object moved slowly over the city|7/6/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75909.html|11|ndxe197001| Large object moved slowly over the city<n> <n><n> <n><n> This not a first hand report.  I&#39;ve had this event in my memory for many years, and I am wondering if any one can substantiate or add detail to what I&#39;m calling an event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it happened between about &#39;68 and the early 70&#39;s.  My father worked as the attendant at one of the few all night gas stations along the old Rt 66 as it passed through Joplin, MO -- locally known as East 7th Street.  The station sat near the crest of a very long up-slope and so at night one could see back across the city quite well.  He was the introverted, serious type person.  Many of the local cops patrolling the city made this station a regular night-shift break stop and they shared all the &#34;cop gossip&#34; with him.  He stated to me the following when I visited on a weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night he saw an illuminated metallic craft moving slowly just above rooftop level across the city.  The motion was steady and it exhibited a controlled motion.  It apparently did not come directly over the gas station.  This activity continued long enough for several police cars to engage in trailing the craft around the city, as he saw the roof lights on their cars in the distance and heard sirens.  He said that the craft eventually gained altitude and simply faded into the night sky -- there was no sudden vanishing, it just flew off very calmly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that same night, many of the cops converged at the gas station and began relating to each other what they had witnessed.  My father, of course, heard much of the chatter between officers and on the radios.  All agreed that they had seen a very large metal craft that simply glowed with no apparent source of light.  Some reported what appeared to be windows and various details about the skin, much as you might attempt to describe the surface of any vehicle after having been up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few nights, the various cops on duty the night of the sighting resumed their regular break stops at the gas station.  All told my father a similar thing: They had all been instructed to forget that they had seen any thing and to speak no more of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dad said that the Joplin Globe Newspaper ran an article on the UFO as soon as they gathered the early police reports, but then the story was never given any additional press by the newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I repeat that this was told to me by my father years ago.  I buried this for so long that I lost track of when it happened.  I wish that I&#39;d had enough presence of mind to have at least written down the date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
