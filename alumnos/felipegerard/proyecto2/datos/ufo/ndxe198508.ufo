8/28/85 02:30|North Bay (Canada)|ON|Disk|20 minutes|A very close encounter near North Bay, Ontario. It was totally silent and so close I could have hit it with a rock.|7/8/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37780.html|1|ndxe198508| A very close encounter near North Bay, Ontario. It was totally silent and so close I could have hit it with a rock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot remember the exact date, it was late August or early September around 1985. The date can be correlated to a day when a Russian satellite fell from orbit and crashed in Lake Superior. That was the explanation that was given by the radio station in North Bay the next morning, as the reason for the lights that were seen and reported by multiple people from the previous night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother-in-law and I had a much closer encounter with this craft. Hunting season had begun and in deference to the hunter&#39;s, we would go riding our ATV&#39;s late at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been riding about three hours this night on trails in the Almaguin Highlands, about 20 miles south of North Bay, Ontario. This is Crown land and as such there are no buildings of any kind for many miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped on a ridge and shut off our machines (altitude 1400&#39; - we checked on a topographical map on our return) for a &#34;pee&#34; break. It was a beautiful, clear starry night with not a whisper of wind. We could see from the ridge the darkness that represented Lake Nippising and the lights of North Bay, some twenty miles distant. While taking our break I could hear a dog barking, perhaps five miles away in the valley below. I only mention that to emphasize how incredibly quiet it was where we stood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother-in-law asks me, &#34;Did you see that flash of light?&#34; I replied that it must be the red flashing light from the radio tower in North Bay. Twenty seconds later he asks again, &#34;Did you see that flash of light?&#34; I turned to my left to face him and over the ridge top behind us, about twenty-five feet above the trees, came this craft with glowing lights on it&#39;s edge, the lights going yellow, red, orange, blue, green along the length of the craft. My brother-in-law saw my face and turned to see it as well. It was approximately 100 feet in length. It moved slowly from our left to right, following the ridge line and staying twenty feet above the trees. Suddenly it gave off a flash of light, like a camera flash, only it lit up the entire area around us. I could clearly see every tree, bush and rock, when moments before it had been totally dark. The craft and the flash made absolutely no sound. It was so close I could have easily thrown a rock and hit it. I whispered to Ron, &#34;Do you see it?&#34;, not believing my eyes, but also not wanting to be heard by it. I&#39;m not kidding - it was that quiet, so much so that I was afraid to raise my voice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept moving to the right and let off another flash. The brightness was ruining my ability to distinguish any features other than the glowing lights and general shape, much the same way a flashbulb causes you to see spots before your eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started to drop away, following the contours of the land, staying the same distance above the trees. As it passed us to the right, the 30 - 40 foot pine trees in front of us, started blowing about madly, buffeted by the strong winds generated as the craft passed, much the same as the wake of a boat hits the shoreline. As it dropped out of view, the winds calmed and everything returned to the stillness of before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my mind I thought, &#34;You can&#39;t fool mother nature!&#34; What I mean by that is, I may not believe what I&#39;m seeing, but the violent wind proved that something huge had just passed by, causing the disturbance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took compass headings for the next ten minutes, as we watched the craft move down the valley. It flashed the bright light approx. every twenty seconds, lighting up acres of land below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the Canadian Air Force for two years, working around jets and helicopters and there is nothing, other than a glider, that can fly without making a sound. Even then you would probably hear the wind pass over the wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to say I was brave and unmoved by this event, but the truth is, it was so unearthly that my first instinct was to want to hide under a rock. I was terrified and it took me twenty minutes to calm down enough to get back on the ATV and ride.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning there were multiple reports to the local radio station, from people claiming to have seen a UFO. The explanation was that it was the Soviet satellite crashing into Lake Superior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft we saw was flying, not crashing and Lake Superior was approx. 600 miles west of where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve told this story to many people over the years, mostly met with skepticism. After reading many of the sightings on your site, I felt compelled to contribute my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/25/85 22:30|Allenspark|CO|Light|60 seconds|An bright white light flashes 10 times.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103588.html|2|ndxe198508| An bright white light flashes 10 times<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked down to the mailbox at about 22:30 on a clear night to get the newspaper. As I turned to go back to the house, I saw a large white light in the sky to the east, maybe half the size of a full moon as it would appear above the horizon in that direction, and glowing steadily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light began to flash off and on, and I had the impression that I should count the flashes. In total there were ten flashes of about 2 seconds each with intervals of 2-3 seconds darkness.  After the tenth flash it remained dark and I could no longer perceive any object there.  The pattern seemed very regular and impressed me as being mechanical; the color remained a bright white. The object appeared to be 100-200 feet above the North St. Vrain creek and just downstream from the bridge on Highway 7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked back up the driveway, I caught sight of a large meteor well to the north of where the flashing light had been.  The meteor broke apart and left a glowing tail.  It occurred to me how the meteor and the flashing light seemed to be very different classes of night sky phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen a similar light in this area on October 5, 1980.  I am filing a separate report on that sighting.  I am aware that a large light in this same area had been observed by at least one other person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am presently a psychoanalyst in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S.  Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful and scientifically oriented observer.<n>

We both got out of the car and watched in total amazement as this huge object passed right over the top of us.  it was massive in size! it looked like a flying sky scraper!   It made no noice, total silence.  It continued flying over the town of friendship heading towards the town of belmont.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The craft was a large bright orange ball hovering above the lake &#34;Clear Lake&#34;. My friend and I watched this object for a good half hour just sitting above the lake. There were no noises of any kind at all. When the craft it it was gone in 5 seconds. The unusual thing too was that I was watching the news two weeks later and the same object was sighted over New Zealand. This was not the first time I have seen crafts in the area as I have seen at least two others in same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Blinking white lights.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53535.html|6|ndxe198508| Disk hovered over Hamilton. I viewed from Rt 4 on a hill overlooking the city. Blinking white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving in my car down Route 4 coming into Hamilton from Middletown direction which sits higher than the city.  It was completely dark outside and as I was driving I glanced to the SE of the city (my L)and seen a metallic oval shaped ship. It had blinking white lights that marqueed around the middle section. It hovered approximately 1000 ft above the ground and for about five minutes. I had time enough to pull my vehicle over and stare in wonderment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it took off straight up it almost disappeared it went so fast. I checked into local airports and no testing was indicated. I also reported this to Wright Patt in Dayton.<n>

Just as we were settling in my friend jumped out of his sleeping bag and yelled for us to get up and see this thing in the sky. As we sat up this bright white sphere came around the lake. It started at the inlet end of the lake and we were near the spillway end. The sphere bounced eratically moving up and down in a zigzag motion with the zigs covering at least 50 or 60 feet as it traveled from the inlet end past us to the outlet end and then around us and back towards the inlet end but as it went back the way itcame it just gradually went higher and higher untill it disapered into the clouds that were above at a higher altitude. We talked about what we had seen and we all had seen the same thing. It was about 20 feet in diameter and it was between 200 and 300 feet in altitude untill it started to climb as it left the area. It was the most briliant white light i had ever seen but it didn&#39;t put off much light to the ground or the water that we could see. i haven&#39;t seen anything like it since then.<n>

At first we blew it off as just an airplane.  But, as it got closer we noticed it hadn&#39;t been blinking nor did it make a sound (we had seen dozens of planes that night and this was not one).  When it reached us, moving maybe 10 miles an hour (jogging pace) we could see a shape but no real body to it, kind of like a shadow but you could not see through it at all but yet you couldn&#39;t see it, if that makes any sense? We noticed it seemed to be following the streets we lived on hovering just above the treetops. Being a football fan I can better measure distance in yardage, and I would say that the craft was flying no more then sixty yards above us and it had a triangle shape that was maybe fifty yards from point to point to point and each point was lit with a large bright white circle but it didn&#39;t hurt at all to look at them. The three of us walked and jumped under it yelling and waving at it as it turned down my street.  I ran to my house and woke my mother who came out to see it as it slowly drifted upwards and further down the street until it reached a certain hight, then took off faster then anything I have seen since, making crazy zig zags as it disapeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strange thing about the whole thing is that none of us were frightened of this object.  Infact I had the impression it was playing with us...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was the size of a bus.  It made no sound.  The tree tops beneath it swayed in all directions.  It was a clear moon lit night.  My grandfather said &#34;do you see that? &#34;  I said &#34;yup&#34;.   He then noticed the hands on his watch were spinning.  We both looked at each other.   As he said, &#34;its time to get the hell out of here!&#34;  He started up the out board motor and we headed back to camp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over 20 years later, my dad and I returned to the same lake to find it a dead lake.  No life in it at all.   It was teaming with baitfish, gamefish, panfish and wildlife 20 plus years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

No lights, no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking some classes at the University of Houston during the summer and there was a summer pool party at night. My room mate was telling my others friends a joke. I was bored and looked up and saw this enormous triangular shaped craft. I would estimate to lenght to have been 1/2 mile. It was totally black, had no lights and made no noise. I screamed &#34;Look, look&#34;. Only the girl sitting next to me looked up. I asked her &#34;What was it ?&#34;. She made a face of &#34;Idon&#39;t know&#34; and turned her back to me not wanting to discuss it. It has been 17 years now and I hope I will know what it was before I die.<n>
8/15/85 20:00|South Nags Head|NC|Triangle|20:00-20:30|While walking on beach, two teenagers witnessed football-field-sized triangular craft over water from distance of approx. 50 feet.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04195.html|13|ndxe198508| while walking on beach, two teenagers witnessed football-field-sized triangular craft over water from distance of approx. 50 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In August of 1985 while my family vacationed for a week in South Nags Head, NC, a friend of mine and I watched a triangular-shaped craft above us at the beach one night.   Although I do not recall precisely what week we were there, this incident took place on a Friday night.  I and my friend, both females aged 14 at the time, customarily strolled along the shoreline in the evenings.  I estimate that our &#34;sighting&#34; occurred around 8 p.m., but that time is not absolute.  I recall that night as very dark, both starless and moonless.  However, it is possible that the fear I felt after we encountered the craft skewed my impressions of the environment; to be certain of the moon phase, I&#39;d have to check a calendar from back then.  I do remember absolutely that the evening began clear and temperate, with just a few stringy clouds hanging here and there over the ocean.  I was looking down, trying to avoid stepping with my bare feet on the sand crabs that come out at night.  So it was my friend who first saw something odd in the sky. &#34;Do you see those lights?&#34; she asked me.  I followed her gaze, then, and I saw five lights in a tight triangular formation...the center light was red, and it was the largest.  It was flanked on either side by two smaller white lights.  I do not remember any of the lights flashing; they all maintained a kind of focused dull sheen, if that makes sense.  They did not emit beams or illuminate the sky around them.  Together, they formed what we later interpreted as the &#34;nose&#34; of the craft, although we did not at first notice any other lights or even an outline of the craft&#39;s shape because the night was so very dark.  I am guesstimating the craft&#39;s distance from us as about 50-100 feet -- very close -- and about the same distance up in the air from the ocean, but the darkness and the lack of earthbound objects (i.e. trees) by which to judge height/size made it difficult to pinpoint how large or how close this object was. As I looked up, I caught this &#34;nose&#34; emerging seemingly out of nowhere.  In retrospect, I believe that I decided on-the-spot that the craft must have been behind cloud cover because that was the only way I could rationalize its sudden appearance.  But as I said above, what few clouds there were that night were unsubstantial and spaced far apart from one another.  As farfetched as it seems, I have to consider that the craft may actually have been &#34;cloaked&#34; in some fashion and then it revealed itself...?  I feel ridiculous writing that, but I have no other explanation.  It&#39;s possible that my friend and I just happened not to see it until it was dead even with where we stood.  But the enormity of the craft and its apparent proximity to us makes that possibility seem unlikely to me. Regardless of how the lights got there, from the moment my friend and I first noticed them, some inexplicable quality they seemed to give off made us both vaguely uneasy.  I think that strangeness was why my friend had to ask me whether or not I saw what she saw, and it was why I didn&#39;t question her needing my confirmation.  I&#39;m not sure how long it took us to realize that a big contribution to this strange &#34;vibe&#34; we were experiencing was the craft&#39;s utter silence.  It wasn&#39;t merely an absence of engine or other familiar aircraft noise; it was an intense, all-pervasive silence that was eerily powerful precisely because it was so absolute.  It was a consuming silence, the likes of which I cannot recall experiencing in any other situation. I have always remembered that silence and have tried to describe it on the few occasions that I have discussed my &#34;sighting&#34; over the years with friends.  But it wasn&#39;t until I happened to catch a bit of a cable program the other night that I heard another so-called witness state that she had viewed a completely silent airborne object.  That was the first time I had ever heard a UFO-sighting detail that matched my own experience, and it made me snap back to the events of August &#39;85.  I researched online and came across this site; now that I&#39;ve read numerous other reports, I understand that very many people indeed have witnessed silent crafts.  A few have also seen triangular crafts (another detail from my personal encounter that I had never heard elsewhere).  Obviously, I have not made a point of keeping up with ufology!  Hearing and reading some other people&#39;s testimony has encouraged me to share my experience now.  Although I have never doubted the nature of what I saw that night, the content of other witnesses&#39; reports lends credence in my mind to my personal memories, legitimizing them somehow. So I will continue with my report:  I and my friend stopped walking to watch these lights for awhile.  At some point, we became aware of a sixth light.  It was the same color and size as the large dull-red light which marked the center of the &#34;nose&#34; of the ship, and it was straight back from that light.  (Imagine an arrow, designated only by five points outlining the tip of the arrowhead and a single dot at the base of the arrow).  Here is where my friend&#39;s and my accounts differ; one of us thought that the space between the original five lights and this single sixth light encompassed about one football field&#39;s length, but the other thought it was closer to two football fields long.  After all this time, I don&#39;t recall which of us insisted on which length.  Let me reiterate how hard it was to determine size and distance in that environment. Now that we saw the sixth light (it, too, just quietly asserted itself; it may have been there all along, or it may have appeared after the others), we determined that the entire area in between must be one giant craft.  This final light marked the middle of the third leg that formed the base of the triangle.  I know that my friend and I agreed that the ship was triangular and basically flat, but as far as I remember, we couldn&#39;t actually see an outline.  It was like this ship swallowed the whole night sky above us.  I remember just barely discerning the distant horizon break between the dark blue ocean &amp; the deep black sky, and my vision was 20/20 at the time.  So if the night really was as dark as I am remembering, the craft was either pitch black itself or it was utterly transparent. We never questioned that the sixth light belonged to the same craft.  All of the lights moved in tandem.  They slid so smoothly and slowly across the sky that their motion was almost imperceptible.  They moved in the same direction in which my friend and I had been walking, and then shortly after we stopped to watch them, they stopped, too.  After I&#39;m not sure how long, we tried moving forward again, and the craft moved with us.  We stopped again; it stopped again.  I think anxiety started seeping in to me about then if it hadn&#39;t already.  Perhaps the coincided movements were an optical illusion, as when you view a painted portrait from many angles and it seems to always be looking directly at you.  But my friend and I got the very definite impression that the craft was watching us.  We reacted by speaking in low murmurs as if it could hear us, and for some reason I got it into my head that we ought not stand looking at it for too long at a stretch or it would overpower us.  I kept having to shake off a certain numbness -- not so much a physical numbness as a mental one.  It was very easy to fall into a sort of spellbound state as we watched these lights. Eventually, we decided to head back in the direction we&#39;d come from.  I think we were both beginning to feel frightened, but the onset of fear was slow.  We turned and walked back down the beach, and lo &amp; behold -- the craft switched direction, too.  It did not turn; it just moved &#34;backwards,&#34; so that the sixth light -- the second red light -- now became the &#34;front.&#34;  I remember feeling a bit scared, but more giddy.  It was like a game we were engaging in with this strange craft.  Now we stopped and waited for awhile to see what might happen.  My friend felt less anxious than I did, and I took courage from her equanimity at first. I don&#39;t know how long we stood there.  It was probably under 10 minutes, maybe even under 5 minutes, but it could have been hours.  I had absolutely no grasp of time.  I know that I got that numbness again because I realized at some point that my friend had sunk down to the sand and I hadn&#39;t even noticed.  She and I had stopped talking.  The object mesmerized us, or we allowed ourselves to believe that it did.  It continued to merely hover, stationary. After we had watched it for some time, rain began to fall, lightly at its start.  Maybe it was the rain that jolted me back to my senses or maybe I just &#34;came to&#34; again of my own accord, but whatever the reason, I forced my attention away from the lights.  I bent down to look at my friend&#39;s face.  I had to get close up to her because of the darkness, so when I looked in her eyes, we were only a few inches apart.  I remember that what I saw in her eyes sent a chill through me.  She was smiling a strange little smile and her eyes were all glazed over.  It wasn&#39;t like she was totally unresponsive or anything, but there was an unnatural excitement and faraway attitude that she conveyed.  (I should clarify here that we were both very much drug-free).  When she spoke -- something like, &#34;you&#39;re in my way, I want to see them&#34; -- her voice quality had changed, too.  It was then that I understood that what I&#39;d taken for her equanimity was actually closer to her willingly &#34;zoning out.&#34;  That really scared me.  The rain started to fall harder. Then, quite suddenly, the whole craft just took off at a speed that made my breath catch in my throat.  Again, absolutely no sound unless it was quieter than the rain.  The craft went up the beach about a half-mile at approximately a 30-degree incine, and there it stopped near a short cliff.  At first we thought it wasn&#39;t doing anything, but then we noticed that the positions of the lights relative to one another seemed to change.  That was because, as we soon figured out, the craft was turning around.  It did not bank at all -- the nose did not dip down.  The whole craft just turned on a flat plane.  Oddly, as it turned, we could see all of the lights all of the time.  It was as if the inside of the craft were invisible -- we could see the &#34;nose&#34; lights through the &#34;tail&#34; light like no craft was in between.  Yet we had no doubt that there really was a craft in the shape of a triangle, not just disconnected lights.  So I think that the ship must have been very, very flat. Another few minutes went by, during which we couldn&#39;t tell what the craft was doing.  But then we understood that, in a slow, steady, direct line, it was returning -- it was approaching our area again.  It was moving so deliberately and so directly towards us that at first we hadn&#39;t been able to perceive its motion.  Somehow, seeing those lights begin to get larger with the perspective as the craft neared again, my friend and I finally got filled to bursting with a sort of elated terror, and we ran all the way back down the beach where we&#39;d come from and then up a gravel road to our cabin.  The rain was furious now and blinding.  I am not a sportive person, but I ran fast and hard that night with no regard for my bare feet on the rough gravel.  They got fairly cut up from our run. I remember seeing other people on the beach as we ran back.  Being 14, we yelled loudly all the way home, garbled giddy warnings about &#34;the lights!  the lights!  don&#39;t let them take you!&#34; and so on.  People flitted past in a blur as we ran, but I do remember some puzzled looks on people&#39;s faces.  It occurred to me later to wonder whether they even saw these lights at all.  But when I and my friend finally got back to our empty cabin (my parents were out for the evening), we slammed &amp; locked the door and turned on all the lights and pulled down all the blinds -- and as we yanked down the blinds, we kept peering through the windows.  We couldn&#39;t see the lights where they should have been.  The whole run back had taken maybe 5 minutes and we hadn&#39;t checked behind us to see the location of the lights since maybe 2 minutes earlier when the other houses had obscured our view.  Now, gazing through a back window, we finally located the lights again.  Maybe the reason we had gotten puzzled/startled looks from people as we ran was because the craft had zoomed off, far past the area where it had made that no-bank turn earlier, and higher up.  It must have moved very quickly.  The fact that it had flown away again rather than continue to move toward where we had been standing excited us because that &#34;confirmed&#34; that the craft had actually been focusing on me and my friend.  We decided that it had wanted to abduct us and that it nearly had.  I&#39;d still like to think that.  But who knows.<n>

It was several minutes until the sun light was gone. She was driving and I noticed to my right a County Squad car was parked on the wrong side of the road on an over-pass above I-94. The red lights were on and I could see the officer looking toward the west (the direction we were traveling) with his hands at his head as if holding binoculars. Traveling further west I commented on how fast the on-coming traffic was traveling. Speed limit is 45 MPH and cars were heading east-bound traveling at an estimated speed of 75 MPH or better (estimated of course). We had crested the first hill and I commented on a low flying what appeared to be an airliner. The &#34;plane&#34; and us closed distances after we crested the second hill and I said, &#34;I think he is going to crash&#34;. I then told her to speed up because I think that he is going to crash on us. It came to a stop above a 20 acre pond and just hovered there. I told her to stop the car and she slowed down to about 15 MPH. I opened the car door and looked up about 250 ft on an obtruse angle. I remember looking from one end to the other judging it to be approximately 300 yds in length and just as wide. At that time two huge bright lights came on shining straight down on the pond illuminating it like daytime. I told her again to stop and she floored it as she was scared and crying. When we arrived home a few short minutes later I grabbed my camera and returned to find nothing there. The object made no sound. When the lights came on you could feel the energy in the atmoshere. It reminded me of tank xenons. The craft appeared like cutting a 747 in half then adding that like fron section to the rear pointing backwards. The width of the craft was the same and intersected at the middle of the first described assembly. Light from the center of these sections (starting half way up from the center-line toward the top) graduated from dim to quite bright at the ! top. Thi s is what made it look like the cigar configuration. I called the Sherrif&#39;s Dept. (anonymously) and asked if anyone had seen anything that night. The answer was, &#34;No&#34;. I then called the Eau Claire Municipal Airport and asked if they had any traffic that night. Again I was told no. That airport has not had any airline (large planes) for years. People laugh when I tell them the story but I know what I saw quite clearly and I also know what I did not hear. Take it for what it&#39;s worth but that&#39;s the truth.<n>

I know this is from 1985 but I have no doubt that what we saw was a ufo.

It had a car-sized thin silver rectangular panel on top aimed eastward, angled up at about 45 degrees, shining brightly from sunshine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It &#34;hovered&#34; stationary a thousand or so feet over a long mountain ridge a thousand or so feet tall just a couple miles west of highway 95, around 30 to 45 miles north of Winnemucca Nevada, sometime around noon, on a clear hot dry windy summer day with unlimited visibility on a Sunday in August of 1985.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the target through a 7x monocular from northeast of it for about 5 minutes as a passenger in a van traveling south on highway 95 at about 60-70 mph, paralleling the mountain ridge. When we got as close to it as the highway was going to allow, I still could not identify what the object was even though I was seeing it clearly. Then, after having driven onward 2 or 3 more minutes southeast of the stationary object, it &#34;pixillated&#34; to total invisibility within 2 full seconds of gradually evaporating into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My observation altogether included those several minutes approaching the closest point the highway got to the object and just a couple or few more minutes continuing past, thus allowing me to see it for quite a while from a wide span of angles before it faded into oblivion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My stomach sank as it started to pixillate. Inside me I growled &#34;don&#39;t you dare disappear before I figure you out&#34;! Then the 2 seconds were up and it was completely gone. I said not a word out loud, however, and never once spoke to anyone of the incident for about 15 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4 other adults in the van initially acknowledged the obvious black stationary target with shiny top panel in the clear blue cloudless sky, but without magnification they paid it little interest as they enjoyed laughter &amp; conversation on our way home from an adventurous weekend on the last day of the Boise Idaho hot air balloon festival which we had just participated in. I haven&#39;t yet been able to nail down what exact date that was to the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awake and sharp as ever during my sighting. I had been involved extensively in hot air ballooning for half a decade up till then and nearly a decade since, so have had my eye in the sky observing flying machines quite a bit. The bulky, big black crystal&#39;s rock-solid stationary stability during my 7 or more minutes total observation seemed impossible on such a windy day. Its disappearing act was especially confounding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a clear night. As I approached the Smokey Point Exit, I noticed a very bright white light (the size of a bright star) traveling from the east to west. It was several miles north of my location. At first, I thought it was a shooting star. But it wasn’t moving as quickly, and it was blinking at the rate of about once per second as it moved across the sky. I watched it for several seconds, and thought perhaps it was a satellite. As soon as that idea crossed my mind, the light suddenly shot back the way that it came, zipped up, zipped north, and then shot east again...and disappeared. It startled me quite badly, and I felt nervous as I continued off I-5 at the Smokey Point (#206) exit. I kept searching the sky, looking for the mysterious light, thinking it might reappear near the place that it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned east and came to stop at the light at Smokey Point Boulevard, I glanced around and looked directly up. I was terrified to see an extremely large triangular object hovering directly above the intersection. It was so low that the streetlights shined on its underside, highlighting large rectangular shaped panels and what appeared to be rivets that were spaced very far apart.  I can’t describe the size of the craft, because it extended beyond my scope of vision lengthwise, and I could see clusters of small white lights that indicated the shape. Could it be that they saw my headlights, and traveled to the intersection where I was heading toward? It HAD to be more than a coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t believe my eyes. I looked around for other people who might see what I was seeing, but there were no other cars around, and no people to be seen at the 7-11 store on the corner.  Even after all I’d witnessed, I really hoped that my imagination was playing tricks on me, so I looked up and expected that &#34;it&#34; would be gone. But, it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed that it made no noise and created no turbulence in the air. I got SO frightened that I ran the red light, turning north onto Smokey Pt. Boulevard and drove as fast as I could all the way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard any other reports of this.  It has bothered me ever since, and I am uncomfortable to this day about looking skyward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

At one particular point, I was the only car on the road, and it was pitch black (no street lights), and I was driving past a farm field with woods surrounding both sides of the road.  It was then that I noticed a large rectangular object hovering over the trees to my right and slowly starting to move across the sky in a northeastern direction.  This object was completely lit with many colorful lights on it&#39;s underside.  I remember being completely aware of what I saw, and knew at the time that it certainly could not have an airplane, because of it&#39;s shape and many, many underlying lights.  It was completely rectangular, approximately the size of a football field.  I also remember thinking, &#34;I can&#39;t believe there aren&#39;t any other cars on the road to witness this with me.&#34;  Although I thought that was strange that I was alone to see this, I also felt very certain that I was supposed to see this. It&#39;s as if it waited for a car to come by so it could show itself.   As it slowly crossed over the road ahead of me and headed toward the trees, it disappeared with no sound.  I felt this was a very deliberate incident.  Like others, I was looking for news stories about this occurance  for the next several days, even mentioning it and questioning others about it.  However, there were no other sightings or news reports that I could find.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother witnessed them first, but believed them to be meteorites. I had been laying on my back on a picnic bench and immediately rose to my feet saying &#34;That&#39;s not a shooting star, they&#39;re ufo&#39;s.&#34; At the time we where in our backyard, my brother was also with us, and had told me the time minutes earlier. He did not witness the objects before us, even though he looked directly upon them. They were close enough that you could hit them with a tennis ball, just above normal tree top level. Direction of flight from East to West. Approximate speed; 10 miles per hour. Shape of crafts; As of two coffee saucers put together. Center rim, seamed seamless, otherwise, no other discernable features. Color; From a distance of approximately 5 car lengths, ships appeared gray. As they moved closer, one could see a sandy colored metallic appearence. Size of objects; About the size of a VW Beetle. flight pattern; in straight line at first, when they observed us, or vice-versa, went into sea serpent acrobatics, all in perfect alignment and harmony. Truely intense. Mothers testimony;  was somewhat different from what I seen. She was behind me, by about 15 feet. She saw them as red and orange pill shaped objects. Older Brother; witnessed nothing, but shined flashlighht directly at them. Reason he did not see them is unknown to us. Missing time description; as I tried to get a better vantage point, missing time was experienced. The lapse only felt as of a second, but profoundly and deeply recognizeable. Objects floated of into the distance as far as I can recall. This phenomina was not experienced by Mom, though she appeared awe struck and stationary until I took her by the arm and went inside the house to ask her what she saw. I asked her &#34;what did you see?&#34;. Her reply; &#34;I saw what you saw.&#34; Personal reflection of incident; When being in closest proximity of said objects, I felt like a child again. Also felt that crafts were studying the meteorite showers or just enjoying the big show.<n>

Due to his occupation the gentleman had to travel back and forth at that time between towns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were working on contracts at two different jobs. One late night, around midnight they were on their way back to Houston from Burns Lake, B.C. and were about 5 kilometers east of Houston. There is a long straight stretch before you climb a small long hill on Highway #16 which takes you right into the town of Houston. While traveling on this straight part of the Highway the witnesses passed the local golf course, looking straight in front of them and a little to their right, sits Mount Harry Davis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On top of the mountain there sits the VOR (Visual Omni Range), at this point on the drive both men watched a large bright, white object rise from the VOR vertically into the air. They wondered if it might have been a helicopter with one bright light on it, but they soon ruled this out due to what the object did next. When the light/object reached a certain point in the night sky, it split into two balls of light and each ball of light &#34;shot&#34; off at an incredible rate of speed in different direction. The witnesses were so surprised that they stopped their truck in the middle of the highway, flew open their doors and stood watching this event unfold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both men started looking at one another wondering what it was they just witnessed as it was so very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were so curious to know what was up at the top of the mountain, plus they wanted to look around for any sign that something may have been there, that shouldn&#39;t have been, they drove up the winding road on Mount Harry Davis and finally reached the VOR on top of the mountain. Nothing unusual was noted around the area, but they sure were baffled at what they saw the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

AS WE WATCHED, IT SLOWLY APPROACHED. WHAT SEEMED UNUSUAL WAS THAT IT WAS MOVING SO SLOWLY, AND WAS TO LOW TO THE GROUND TO BE A LARGE AIRCRAFT. I GOT MY BINOCULARS OUT AND WE BEGAN TO WATCH AS IT GOT CLOSER. AT IT&#39;S CLOSEST POINT IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT AS LARGE AS A CIGARETTE HELD AT ARMS LENGTH, AND SINCE THERE WAS A FULL MOON, WE WERE ABLE TO SEE IN DETAIL. IT WAS NOT A HELECOPTOR. IT LOOKED LIKE THE WASINGTON MONUMENT SET ATOP A PYRAMID FLYING, OR HOVERING HORIZONTAL TO THE GROUND. IT HAD A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT AT THE TIP, AND THREE RED AND WHITE LIGHTS AT THE BASE, AND THESE WERE BLINKING ON AND OFF IN A CIRCULAR PATTERN. WE WERE ABLE TO VIEW THIS OBJECT IN DETAIL FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AS IT SLOWLY MOVED ACROSS THE SKY. THE OBJECT WAS SOLID AND THERE WERE NO OTHER LIGHTS. WE COULD SEE THE STRAIGHT EDGES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE MOONLIGHT WITH THE BOTTOM SIDES IN SHADOWS. WE BOTH AGREED THAT IT WAS NOT CONVENTIONAL, AND THAT IT DID IN FACT LOOK LIKE THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT FLYING ON IT&#39;S SIDE. WE CALLED THE POLICE TO SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE HAD SEEN ANYTHING UNUSUAL, BUT NOTHING ELSE HAD BEEN REPORTED, AND WE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT.

There were Human looking,dark clothed extremely pale white skin persons inside.They did not seem to have a skin pigment.They had very black hair. They all looked identical. The 4 of us ran back inside.In a moment of fear we all looked at each other and screamed and cried frantically.My first thought of panic was,we need to breath-I hope they know we need air.Then we ran back out side to look agin,confirm to ourselves something had really landed.The craft lifted to about as high as the telephone pole and sat completely still in the air,its lights changed direction like it was looking at the previous landing area.Then a shrill sound began.it increased in repition to a hum.It left straight up,high speed.At a point in the sky we could no longer tell if it was there,it blended in with the twinkeling stars.In the sky above us was a neon blue streak where its path had been.We called local police who said they had calls of lights of a downed airplane or helicopter from other locals.They were looking into it.An airplane with a satelite dish on it flew by after.It looked like one of our comercial airplanes except for the big dish.The next day we looked at the ground.Our field grass was laid down in a cicle appr! ox 12-15ft round.The craft its self was not round but its landing area was.There were no burns or damage to the grass wich was long and laid in a cicle pattern all in one direction.We later compared the sound to airwolf,the only show we could relate a description of the sound to only faster.The phone lines and electrical lines to our home were not damaged,although they would have been severed if the craft had a propeller of any kind.It landed extremely close to our pole,lines and fence not damaging anything.After,on some days I would see a white Dodge Airies type vehicle pulled over at the roadside there.An elderly gentleman would be taking pictures.Nobody ever questioned us or gave an explanation.Towns people talked of something crashing but there was no crash.My childrens father who would not come outside with us to look because of fear says it had to be a jet helicopter landing because of the sound.We know it was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

About a week before my incident, a neighborhood friend was claiming on the school bus that he saw a UFO and was carrying his camera and was saying that he was going to photograph it.  I obviously disregarded his story. About a week later, a friend and I were staying at my home in Alexandria, MN (chain of lakes area) and we decided to sneak out for some adventure.  We were walking up a very steep road which used to be a winter sled hill.  The road runs approximately east to west from the lake on the east.  We were about halfway up the road/hill, fields and trees to the north, neighborhood to the south, when suddenly a triangular object with a light on each point appeared about tree top level.  I only had about enough time to say &amp;quot;wow&amp;quot;.  All I remember after that was looking at my friend to say, &amp;quot;that was strange&amp;quot; and we walked home and went to bed, not saying another word.  We never talked abo! ut it except when I started having memory flashbacks.  My friend denies seeing a UFO and says it was a &amp;quot;stealth fighter&amp;quot;.  My friend on the school bus, whom I talked to many years later, says that there are &amp;quot;many of us out there&amp;quot;.  Whatever it was has the ability to block and influence memory.  It/they are unimaginably superior to us.  I debate with myself if it is a spiritual force rather than an actual &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; force.  This could be similar to shape shifting events of other types of sightings;  we see things that are real, yet never can obtain physical evidence.  I tend to believe that we are seeing is likely at a spiritual level or from a dimension parallel to ours but having the ability to influence.  We have not developed the ability to cross over to these dimensions; however, they are real, yet not something we can get our hands on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was riding with a friend and as we pulled in there was another truck stopped and the driver, our supervisor,  was speechless and just pointing directly above us from his drivers seat.  We craned our necks and could make out something quite large and round passing , what seemed like, directly above us.  What was weird was that it wasn&#39;t making any noise.   There seemed to be light on the edges.  You could just feel its presence.  Suddenly, it accelerated in a westwardly direction.  We all began to follow it.   It was travelling well to the west of the road we were on and I lost sight of it completely at this point. By the time we had pursued it a few miles , we noticed it joining three other like crafts above Urraca Mesa.   That was where we stopped and just watched.  They began to move in formations.   a box...then a line....all the while moving at incredible speeds.   Then just as quickly as we saw them manuvering ...they all exited ...following each other in a line up Urraca Canyon.   They exited to the west.   We stood there in silence then went back to the bunkhouse.   I asked the supervisor about it a few years ago and he says that he has no memory of such an event.<n>
