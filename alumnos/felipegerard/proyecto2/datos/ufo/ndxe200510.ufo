When we got there we decided to go on the beach and look at the stars. We could not quit looking at the sky because of all of the shooting stars. Then I noticed an eratic quick jerking moving star. There was a field in which it stayed and as eraticly as it would move it would always move back to the same spot in which I first saw it. It would do zig-zags, and drop straight down, and go to the left and the right, and then back to the same spot. Every person that was there that night saw what I saw. Sorry to say  I got too frightned and made everyone leave even though it was still there. There were red, white, and blue lights on the &#34;star&#34; object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These reportees were within a 50 mile radius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Descriptions are almost identical of a slowly descending object which was relatively N.E. of this area:(36.5950°N, 82.1890°W) and began at a high elevation.  Relative size, according to witness(es) descriptions was that of a golf ball initially.The object meandered slowly as it descended, became a bright &#34;plasma-like&#34; light twice during it&#39;s descent and exibited the appearance of burning paper before being described as &#34;melting and dripping plastic&#34; by witnesses. All witnesses described that the phenomenon had not terminated before descending below their horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequent inquiries have not confirmed our suspicion of this having been a meteorite or man-made space debris.

The fireball was traveling N to S we assumed it was space junk or a satellite, because it had a fire trail behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball went out several seconds after it appeared, but the burning trail lasted for a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the naked eye we saw blue and white colors only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was this just a satellite?

It was about 9:00PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden my mom, boyfriend and I saw a bright electric blue flash, like heat lightning, that lit up the whole sky and interior of the car.  Out of the driver&#39;s side window my mom noticed a trail going through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She pulled over the car so that my boyfriend and I could get out to see it.  It looked like a vapor trail with a bend in it. It was fairly short, if I had held a ruler up to the sky in front of my face it would have been 4-6 inches long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a greyish blue color and came down from the sky at about a fortyfive degree angle.  It faded away in about 1 minute or less from when my mom had first noticed it.<n>

My wife was driving, I was sitting in the back seat driver side of the car next to my infant son&#39;s car seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 2 flashing white lights approaching us in the sky from the west.  We are next to a military base and see plane&#39;s lights in the sky all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an aircraft enthusiast and can make out aircraft by their lights at night.   At first I thought these were wingtip lights of an approaching plane, but these lights were flashing much faster than an aircraft&#39;s lights (almost like strobe lights) and not in the same pattern.  I also caught glimpse of a red light between the two white lights, but it was hard to make out with the rapid strobing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, who is not an enthusiast, even recognized it as something strange and said,&#34;What is that?&#34;  The two lights approached the highway and then came to a hover, not directly over it, but near it.  It was at an altitude of perhaps 500-750 feet.  I was still trying to figure out what it was, and said I thought it might be a helicopter, but I had seen helicopters at night, also, and this was not one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were still heading toward the craft and as we passed to the side and under it, another light came into view and it was recognizable as a triangular shape craft with a white light at each point.  The red light I had mentioned earlier was not at the center of the points, it was just blackness in the middle, so it must have been on the one side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed by it, I got a sort of panoramic view of the light formation and could approximate it&#39;s size to be that of slightly larger than the rotor radius of a newscopter type helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish we had stopped, but we didn&#39;t as the highway was busy, and it went out of view behind us.  With the amount of traffic on the road, there should be atleast a few hundred more witnesses to this.<n>

Something about them caught my attention, and then I realized it was that they were moving towards us, all at once, together, as one it seemed.  I watched them for a few mins until I was sure of what I was seeing, then I told my daughters to look up and they saw them/it too.  They slowly came almost directly over our heads, and as they got near to us they started to bank and turn towards the south.  I didn&#39;t realize it at first but as they got closer to us they were also descending. I could see any edge or shape to this craft, but it was blocking out the view of the sky and stars behind it as it moved...  As it straightened out towards the south after making the turn, it wobbled once or twice and then shot off to the south 3 to 5 miles (estimate), also elevating as it moved, and then just stopped.  It covered this distance in the blink of an eye, but it also seemed like maybe who ever or what ever was controlling this thing, wasn&#39;t having the results they wanted.  The Movement was somewhat erratic and unstable.  Changing elevation and direction and stopping and going, and that wobble before it moved quickly to the south, just didn&#39;t seem as controlled as something that could move that fast and that quite should be.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but I have never seen a plane or helicopter that could move like that and not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking west, when I first noticed these lgihts(stars),  As they got closer, they must of been part of one craft, because thier movements seemed to be dependent upon each other.  I told the kids to look and they saw it too.  just about as it got over our heads it started turning towards the south, and elevating.  at what seemed like the point were it started elevating it wobbled for a sec or two, and then shot off and up to the south.  I never mentioned it to any one except my wife, and nothing was mentioned on the TV or Radio that I heard of.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Craft came from the west and first appeared as 1 star, then 2 &amp; 3.  Some how I focused on it and realized all three stars were moving in unison and coming right at me?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it was right over head, and turned 90* to the south.  As it was approaching me it was dropping in elevation, until it seemed like it was relatively very low and over head.  Then as it turned south, it seemed to try to elevate again?  As it tried to elevate it wobbled.  Finally it shot off at a high rate of speed, but seemed to stop about 15 - 20 miles to the south at that point it seemed to drop out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my girls didn&#39;t bring her glasses, so she couldn&#39;t see it, my other daughter ((name deleted)) saw it rise and go to the south.  It was silent and seemed to have definition but I really couldn&#39;t make out anything but the 3 lights.  It did black out the sky I think, but it was impossible to see where its edge stopped and started?  It went both slow and fast, but the wobble tells me it&#39;s human made, Alien craft would be flawless...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also seen other UFO type objects, both at night and in the day in AZ..  I filmed a UFO 05-06-2011 seen in Surprise and Gold Canyon AZ.  This seen twice that day with a witness also.  I saw what I think was the Superstition Lights on a day a few weeks back, but not sure it was a craft and not just a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/UgAVCwmB7qE  --((name deleted))<n>

10/31/05 18:00|Poughkeepsie|NY|Light|1 1/2 hours|Several bright lights moving erratically for extended periods of time, including growing in size and brightness, and disappearing.|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47350.html|29|ndxe200510| Several bright lights moving erratically for extended periods of time, including growing in size and brightness, and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of halloween, October 31st at 6:00 to 7:30 PM in Poughkeepsie NY two college students observed several unidentified flying objects, over a course of an hour and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have been one object disappearing and then reappearing, or several different ones.  It was a large, bright, orange light the size of a large planet that was moving erratically for continuous periods of time ranging up to 30 minutes.  It was moving, stopping, hovering, then moving, going up and down, side to side, and in curving arcs with akward angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to move fast and with great agility. In addition there was a sharp, crisp, but slow-moving streak of light across the sky as an outlined object descended consistently in a straight line over a large area of the sky and heading directly to the large orange object described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This streaking object disappeared right before reaching the actual object.  This orange object eventually disappeared behind the trees.  It was found later at another point in the sky - on the opposite horizon.  This appeared suddenly - in a point in the sky earlier scanned - it had not been seen there moments before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one moved erratically for two minutes as before and then suddenly grew in light, color, and size - to an overwhelming and startling appearance - this flash/flare was 2 seconds in length, after which it disappeared entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally another bright orange orb appeared, moved consistenly in one direction across a large portion of the sky before akwardly and suddenly reversing direction, angling downwards towards the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object then grew in intensity and brightness and size, with sharp and protruding white light, in such a fashion as to create the distinct impression that it was coming closer to the viewers - approaching the point of observation. This action caused fear for the viewers as well as immense apprehension, to the point where one viewer began running away towards the vehicle out of fear and panic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object quickly thereafter diminished and turned to another direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final phenomenon was a different bright red light above the horizon to the East that both viewers saw clearly at the same moment. It then disappeared from view - vanishing - while in the periphery of both viewer&#39;s vision and was afterwards nowhere to be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm on Monday, October 31st, 2005, over the Vassar College Farm in Poughkeepsie New York.<n>

Northern Pkwy (zip code 21206).  This object was traveling in the sky from North to South.  Aberdeen Proving Grounds is North of here off I-95 and what I saw had to be alien something or a military testing something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but I saw no wings or top or side propellers. It was very shiny, like silver chrome.  I did a double take because it did not fly like an airplane or helicopter I have ever seen.  It had a flight pattern like a hummingbird does...I heard no sound (I had my car radio on). And it was like zip, zip gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have to squint to see it but it was close enough to be rounded on the top and botton like a pipe that is placed horizontal<n>

While warming up my truck this morning I stepped outside to look at a bright &#39;star&#39; that I thought was Jupiter.  The light was about as bright as Jupiter or the space station gets at it&#39;s fullest and was a white color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light intensified for about 30 seconds, while I was waching it.  It then &#39;dimmed&#39; quickly to a really &#39;faint&#39; light still visible and then dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first guess was a supernova, but I have no idea what it was.  It was stationary the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds visible in that section of the sky and even with the time change this morning, it was still dark outside at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration was about a minute or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking for mars and looked over at the white light because of it&#39;s bright intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking due SOUTH, about 10-20° to the EAST from SOUTH.

A very quiet and still night, no traffic. Listening to my walkman, I turned my head to the right to the overlooking valley during a clearing in the trees facing south towards NYC. I Immediately notice a thick orange-colored ball of light heading north in my direction; seemed like a low-flying plane still a few minutes away. I thought I heard a young male voice shouting under his breath: &#34;Hey!&#34;. The way somebody might say &#34;boo!&#34;. It was definitely not from my walkman which set to AM, but from inside my head like FM-style of broken audio interference. Ignored it and kept walking further (west), until the next available view over the valley twenty seconds or less from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I look to find the orange light already passing over the street, behind me, where I just walked. Something didn&#39;t feel right, so I stood watching it; still flying north at reasonable speed. Then, the craft seemed to slow down as it was perpendicular to me, and then sped up to do an incomplete U-turn and stopped dead in one spot. At this point it is 40 degrees up in the sky or so, and I&#39;m curious. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then moved diagonally down-right in the sky to a lower point, but seemed closer at the same time. The orange color was gone, and it was dark and blinking a white light and a red light. Blinking white, white, red, could not detect any pattern to the flashes. Now I was getting very very nervous and started to take a few steps backward further up the hill in the direction I was originally going. Then jogged a few more paces and turned right onto a side street and waited behind a house which covered that part of the sky completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It swung to the right of the house, (west). It was definitely under one thousand feet up, and seemed small. Only could make out the flickering red and white lights, and a reddish glow that would brighten and darken as it moved. The lights seemed higher up on it, and the glow was on the bottom part of it. Watched it for 15 seconds or so, and became scared beyond belief and made a run for it, looked behind a few times and it was pursuing, swinging wildly left and right to keep a view of me. I turn another two corners in my run and stopped to get my bearings. It was nowhere in the sky to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feeling jittery and worried for my safety, I walked for a good 20 minutes. Constantly checking the sky, listening to the radio and trying to calm down. Finally returned home, and sat down to relax calm myself. Probably was in shock, but was fine in a few hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It stayed in one place the whole time without any movement, so I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not a helicopter or another craft of the sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape seemed to be two circles one on top of the other connected.

But we are stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I ran to see where this object had landed in the trees I saw a jet/fast plane come up behing it almost immediatly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no impact.

This is where the sightings took place, and apparently have been taking place for several weeks now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While standing on a large hill overlooking a wide open golf course, we witnessed at least 3 at any given time, orange bright lights that almost looked like planets, that twinkled at times and flickered erratically at other times.  The lights would rise up slowly from the horizon, and then the light would go out and be replaced by a fast blinking red and white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought of an airplane, but then when the lights began moving from side to side up and down and in zig zag patterns, we knew that any aircraft in existance could not perform manuevers like we witnessed.  We also witnessed the 3 lights forming triangular patterns (perfect ones i might add) and this triangle moved in unicen and at times seemed to rotate on an axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw an unbelievably bright blue streak that almost looked like a commet streaking through the atmosphere but the width of the two &#34;tales&#34; was too wide to be a commet.  Between the tales were blue streaks and it moved very quickly over our heads and disappeared without a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been coming to this location almost every night and it seems as if the activity continues, but the lights get farther and farther away each time.  When my brother initially spotted these lights they were the size of a silver dollar in the sky, but have since become slightly bigger than a star and orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects can be seen only in a wide open area that is at a high altitude along route 63 in litchfield ct.

It was about 2-300 metres above me.In my opinion it couldn&#39;t have been a plane because there were no flashing lights and it was too quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also couldn&#39;t have been a shooting star because it was too low and it didn&#39;t fade out at all it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the matter of counting to ten slowly and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing it I went around to my Aunties place and told them what I had seen, on the way back I ran into two boy&#39;s which claimed they saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

10/30/05 21:30|Silver Spring|MD|Triangle|25 minutes|solid triangle with white lights and no sound hovered and glided|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54694.html|47|ndxe200510| solid triangle with white lights and no sound hovered and glided<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a senior -level executive at a major media company and I hesitated for several months to contact any organization regarding this siting because I was convinced that what I saw was a military aircraft. I first contacted the Center for UFO Studies in Chicago in 2006. I am reporting it here because I am still perplexed by what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear Fall evening in Silver Spring, Maryland and I was reading a book in my den.  The window shades were pulled up and the windows were open because it was a relatively warm night.  Above the treeline, I spotted what appeared to be a star or planet that seemed to be unusually bright.  I glanced at the object from time to time between reading the book and listening to my teenage kids who were home at the time.  I grew slightly intrigued by the object because it appeared to be hovering while the other stars seemed fixed in there locations and an occassional plane would fly by in the distance.   I thought it may have been a helicopter but the there were no red lights, blue lights or search beams that I associate with helicopters.  Downtown Silver Spring is an very urban area located 5 minutes from Washington, D.C., so helicopters are not an unusual sight at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object disappeared below the tree line and re-appeared about two minutes later. I called my then 17-year old daughter and asked her to look out the window and tell me what she saw.  Her first words were, &#34;what in the world is that?&#34; She stated that the lights were not like anything ahe had seen.  And, she was right.  The lights were white but had a halo effect that seemed to indicate that they were pulsating. There was a slightly bluish tint to them also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be 500 ft above ground level not even a quarter of a mile from the the house.  For 25 minutes I watched it(my daughter did not want to watch it anymore)hover, glide horizontally, rise vertically, but never leave the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it began to glide towards the house (I say glide because it was not flying like a helicopter or a plane.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my father who lives six blocks away and asked him to go outside a look in the sky and tell me if he saw anything unusual. He said he wasn&#39;t sure but there were so many stars out that night.  While I was talking to him the object glided above the corner lot located two houses from our house.  It then glided over my neighbors house at tree-level, probably not three hundred feet above ground.  I was amazed at what I saw.  It was a black triangle about 3/4 the size of a football field. It was definitely a solid object.  It made absolutely no sound at all.  I know this because it passed over my roof while I was outside in my front yard.  Again, it was a very clear night.  It then disappeared, I guess that is way I can describe it but I don&#39;t know.  Let&#39;s just say that I could not see it anymore.  I called my newsroom and local stations. No reports had been received.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I approaced my neighbor and before I could say anything she asked me if I had seen the object.  She stated that she had never seen anything like it and, in fact, she and her friend tried to follow it down our street but it vanished in the sky.  Again, I have no idea what this object was, but it was an experience I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/30/05 21:00|||Fireball|10 minutes|Some light or fireball hovering over a small town|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51577.html|49|ndxe200510| Some light or fireball hovering over a small town<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me, some family members and friends were outsided talking about of the day of the dead like what is done in our mexican culture. I cant remember the exact day but i know for sure it was no so far away from holloween. Well, the 7 of us were talking in front of a friends house, from this view we could see another town across which is like less than a mile away and we can have a good view of the whole town. Since i was the only guy there i was just standing near the entrance door. There was steps in the entrance door so when i was standing on these stairs near the door i had a way better view of the town and the road the travels along the side of the town. Since my friends were talking aobout some spooky stuff, i wasnt paying attention. At this point i was just standing by the door looking around everywhere and mostly directly to the other town. Forgot to mention that the town i was looking at was San Miguel Tecuitlapa. My parents home town has a name but i rather not give it. I was looking around everywhere. Sky was dark with stars in the sky, cold, little bit of breeze. During this month, there is usually alot wind and is very cold doesnot rain is like dry cold and in the mornings there is always alot of fog then fades away like at 10 am. But at night its all clear. Since i was standing up all the time, i sat down, i could still see the town from my position, then i started wondering again, trying to keep warm, and for some reason i turned to that town i had an urge to look, i saw a light. First i thought it was the towns radio guy, since his big speaker sticks out and has a flasing light(only turns the light on when he is on standby and has important anouncments to make to the town, which is rare). But i double checked and the light was right above the town cuz, first it wasnt blinking and second there was no blinking light on the anoncers house. i king of just like didnt care at first. But the light was there for 2 min already and i started to wonder. than i told everyone else about it and started looking. They started talking about what the light is, like legends and stuff, that that like is a witch and stuff. I told them &#34;no it cant be, why would a witch stay hovering like that for more thatn 2 min, thats an easy target for any sharpshooter around there&#34;, and everyone kept quite. everything was quite, no breeze, sky was clear, cold, then i started telling them &#34; its a UFO,but be quite lets observe very well. Dont freak out okay&#34; and so we were mostly quite just whispering. The object was moving slowly and didnt move alot its just move probobly like 200 ft at most. We were still whispering and all of us were just looking at it, didnt move our eyesight from that point. Suddenly it just disapeared. JUst faded. The light just faded as in a light bulb turns off when u turn of the lights. got small and disappeared. Everyone freaked out everyone went to their houses exept me. I stayed with my friend at the door, i just stood their.............had goosebumps....my friend asked me if i was okay...i said yeah im good........im going home lol......i got home connected my camera. Now i have the best room in the whole housei get the view of pretty much the whole town i live in, i can see San Miguel, this other town called Santa Ana, part of San Juan Atenco, the road that travels along San Miguel.........so i stood by my window for a while and nothing.... That was it i was hoping to see it again and record it but no .....nothing......<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reminder: Almost all towns are surrounded by thousands of acres of crops..Around San miguel there isnt much, but on the back of the town there is lots of hills with alot of green. Behind our town there are alot of big hills and lots of crops, lots of trees and really dark at night. Around San Juan atenco there are alot of Fields of Corn around there that widespread all the way to Santa Ana. Our town has historic places....like two old Ranches that were big before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats all i know about this for now.....ill then give more info if i have more or remember more..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

WE WATCHED IT FOR A WHILE AND WONDERED WHAT IT WAS AND JOKED ABOUT UFOS. WE WERE THE ONLY ONES IN THE PARKING LOT. SINCE WE WERE RUNNING LATE AND HAD GET TO LAS VEGAS,WE DECIDED TO GET ON OUR WAY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE WERE ABOUT TEN MINUTES DOWN HIGHWAY 375 WHEN MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TOWARD MY PASSSENGER SIDE WINDOW BY THE BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT THAT WAS IN THE WEST NOW.  I HAD THE FEELING THAT IT WANTED US TO OBSERVE IT. SO WE STOPPED THE TRUCK AND GOT OUT TO HAVE A LOOK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS WE STOOD THERE WATCHING THIS EXTREMELY BRIGHT STATIONARY ORANGE LIGHT IT CHANGED TO YELLOW!  WE HAD A PAIR OF BINOCULARS IN THE TRUCK.  WE GOT THEM FOCUSED ON THE BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHT. WHAT WE SAW WAS A TOP-SHAPED OBJECT THAT WAS SO BRIGHT IT WAS LIKE MOLTEN, FIREY,WHITE-YELLOW METAL. THERE WAS AN AURA OF RED AROUND IT, AND IT WAS PULSATING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SUDDENLY THERE WAS ANOTHER LIGHT SMALLER VERY BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHT THAT APPEARED ABOUT A FOOT AWAY (OUR EARTHLY PERSPECTIVE) TO THE LEFT OF THE BIGGER FIRY BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHT. IT TOO WAS STATIONARY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE TURNED AROUND TO THE EAST AND THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE SECOND LIGHT.  IT TOO WAS BRIGHT AND STATIONARY.   ALL OF THEM APPEARED THE SAME AS WE VIEWED THEM WITH THE BINOCULARS.  WE COMMENTED THAT THE BIG LIGHT MUST HAVE MOVED TO THE EAST FROM THE WEST WHILE WE WERE DRIVING; AND THAT THE OTHER TWO LIGHTS WERE NOT PRESENT WHEN WE FIRST NOTICED THE BIG BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE EASTERN SKY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE GOT IN THE TRUCK AND CONTINUED DOWN THE HIGHWAY. AS WE WERE TRAVELING ALONG, THE DRIVER WAS SUDDENLY STARTLED AND SAID SOMETHING BIG AND BAT LIKE JUST WHIZZED PAST HIS TRUCKS LEFT FENDER AND SIDE WINDOW , SO VERY CLOSE THAT HE COULD SEE IT. WHILE HE WAS MENTIONING THIS TO ME, ANOTHER ONE WHIZZED BY AND STARTLED HIM PLENTY. IT WENT BY FAST, BUT NEAR ENOUGH FOR HIM TO NOTICE AND THEY WERE TOO BIG FOR BATS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE STOPPED AT A CONVENIENCE STORE IN ALAMO. THE BIG BRIGHT LIGHT WAS STILL THERE ONLY BIGGER AND BRIGHTER NOW, AND THE OTHER TWO SMALLER BRIGHT LIGHTS WERE NO LONGER VISIBLE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE CONTINUED TO WATCH IT.  BECAUSE IT CHANGED POSITIONS, WE KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT A STAR NOR A PLANET, AND IT WAS NOT MOVING AROUND LIKE A CONVENTIONAL AIRPLANE OR HELICOPTER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHEN WE WERE TEN MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD WE STOPPED ONE MORE TIME TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE LIGHT AND IT BLINKED OUT!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the witnesses were not observing Mars, we do not know what it was they were looking at.

Scale and distance are hard to guess, but we thought it might be on the order of 25-30 miles distant.  Much farther than that and the scale of the object would have been rather immense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our location at the time of sighting was approximately  38°13&#39;59.74&#34;N by 122°15&#39;34.61&#34;W, elevation about 88 feet ASL.  Skies were pretty much clear all around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing about it was that as the fireball disappeared over the horizon there was a tremendous flash of light, very much like lightning in the color of the light and how it lit the sky and backlit the hill between it and us.  It was almost a disappointment that we did not hear a corresponding kaBOOM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received several other reports from California about this incident.  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally good witness, and exceptionally credible.  PD))<n>

It caught my attention because the normal air traffic pattern in this area is North/South with very little variation. The only craft I have ever seen traveling East/West are military aircraft of some sort.  I saw this object traveling almost due East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a very bright light that was constant with no flashing or blinking as with normal aircraft lights.  The object appeared to be at a lower altitude or was very large.  I could hear absolutely no sound as it flew over.  I would normally hear a jet engine if it were an airliner or normal military craft.  We have an airport for smaller prop planes near the city, This was definitely not prop driven as we can always hear those planes overhead. Not sure what this craft was, but never have seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was the biggest object in the sky I have ever seen!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright white light,about the size of a large softball, with red flames 3 to 4 feet jagged behind it!  There was also a brown trail mixed in with the red flames at the bottem of the flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The giant meteor was so bright and close we thought it was going to hit the houses!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it extinguished itself about 100 feet over them because we were going up the hill.(25-30 mph)  for a few minutes we could close our eyes and the brightness of the light was still there with the shape we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen many shooting stars, meteroid showers, and I have never seen a meteroid/star so close and big!<n>

PD))|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74314.html|63|ndxe200510| Black Triangle Craft Spotted<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Gentlemen,<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 years ago on a very cold moonless winter morning at approximately 3:00 a.m. my car pool buddy and I were on the way to work at a “remote location”. We were on Mercury Blvd. on the East side of the EAFB dry lake bed. Think Space Shuttle landing strip runway that runs West to East in front of the notorious “South Base” Birk Flight Test Center.  We noticed a very large black triangle shaped craft coming off the runway and slowly gaining altitude.  We pulled over in time to have it come directly over our heads.  It appeared to be quite “thick” almost as though it were a balloon with somewhat puffy panels on its sides.  Underneath were very bright lights that reminded me of recessed counter top lighting.  Once it passed us it gained altitude VERY RAPIDLY and it blended in with stars above and was no longer visible.  It was way cool indeed.  We were speechless for a bit and felt very lucky to have seen it. Our thoughts were that the lights somehow adjusted to the star patterns above and also adjusted for altitude for viewing angles.  It was completely silent.  Obviously we assumed this was a re-con craft because we watched it carefully and lost it not to be found again.  We are talking seconds here.  It was definitely not an alien craft.  After asking around Northrup came up more than once.  Who knows?

I freaked out when all three stars light up at the same time and then vanished.  We witnessed this for a whole minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened just 15 miles south of Flagstaff on I-17.  I called Lowell Observatory later that morning and asked if anyone reported anything strange or if they saw anything that resembled what I saw and was emmediatly laughed at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I saw this object.

It was not moving at all and seemed to be very low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a ufo so I stopped the car and looked out my window to get a better view.   As soon as i stopped the car the craft began moving, but at an extremely slow speed.  It was making absolutely no sounds which was so wierd because of how low it was flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As is slowly passed directly over my car I could see that it was in the shape of a diamond with 4 bright lights, one on each corner, but i could not really see and structure in between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved past us to the east, with out any obvious changeover at all the light started moving in an oval shape very randomly. they were now red green and white and were very flashly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this way until it disappeared into the distance after about 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see this??<n>

Two things got me more interested in this flight.  Whatever it was, it was not running regulation navigational beacons, and it was entering restricted airspace over Edwards AFB (northeast of my location).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What at first looked like landing lights, started to slowly pulsate.  As the object traveled further east, this pulsating light was still visible, making it impossible to be landing lights.  If you are thinking this possibly was general aviation, I have seen a few general aviation &#34;off-regulation navigational lights&#34; in the past, but read-on -- this gets better).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a pair of binoculars and was able to follow the object for another minute, as it got further east.  I lost it when the glare from street lights interfered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My most interesting (and without explanation) observation of this object was when what appeared to be two smaller lights separated from the main object.  The lights were colored (one was red and one green or blue).  They seperated vertically, one departing straight up and one straight down. They were visible just for a second.  At this time, I was viewing the object thru binoculars.  After the sighting, I viewed the area of seperation again, just to see if it was possibly caused by binocular glare/reflections, but could not see anything that would cause the effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, oh yes, I have seen military aircraft fire off flares before.  These were not flares.<n>

We turned off Interstate 71 about 15 miles south of Columbus on State Rt. 62 at the Harrisburg/ Orient exit.  We were seven miles south of I-71.  The terrain is flat for the most part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon approaching a rise in the road, (much like an overpass), the road curves to the left.  As we were approaching the rise there was a bank of four white lights came on above the rise.  They were straight ahead and beyond the rise/curve maybe 500-1000 feet past.  They were 300-400 feet high.  They were street light sized and intensity and spaced 4-5 feet apart in a stationary horizontal line.  I know the height because I routinely climb a 200 foot tower for work.  At first I thought they were maybe a cell phone tower.  I did not see a strobe or beacon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was awake and saw the same thing.  We didn’t say anything about it at the time.  The time was approx. 2100 on Friday the 28th of October.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were chatting normally for the next few miles maybe 5-7 and the we saw exactly the same thing on the opposite side of the road.  This time we both looked at each other in amazement. She asked what the heck was that and she indicated she had seen it back at the curve.  I replied that it was probably an aircraft or cell phone tower.  We kept talking about it and then we wondered if maybe we had seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did exactly the same thing each time.  All four came on for about five seconds and then went out one at a time from left to right at one second intervals.  Each time it looked like we were passing the object because the viewed angle changed as we moved forward.  Speed was approx. 60mph.  The object stayed motionless.  No sound. No shadows.  No illumination of the surrounding structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was very clear. Moon was maybe a crescent.  Air was cool, about 35 deg F.  We were well into the country. Not much ambient light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued talking about it the rest of the trip.  We arrived at out destination at the expected time, about an hour later.  We had not been on this route since May but had been this way many times before.  We decided not to worry about it but to look closely on the return trip, which was two days later. It would be daylight on the return trip.  Thirty-six hours later we were on our way back home.  We had decided to watch closely once we were north of Washington Courthouse.  We would then know if there were indeed cell phone towers in the area.  There were NO cell phone towers anywhere in the vicinity of Rt. 62 north of Washington Courthouse and all the way past the overpass where we first noticed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just curious if this type light pattern had ever been reported and if there were some reasonable explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))<n>

10/29/05 18:51|Seattle (Boeing Field)|WA|Other|5 sec.|Twin-engine jet fighter seen to STREAK west to east over Boeing Field in IFR conditions.|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47325.html|75|ndxe200510| Twin-engine jet fighter seen to STREAK west to east over Boeing Field in IFR conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident probably has nothing to do with a UFO sighting or event, but I include it here because of its utterly unusual nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday night, October 29, 2005, at approximately 18:51 hrs. (local/Pacific), I was driving south on Interstate 5, and was just north of Boeing Field, near the Albro/Swift Exit.  I was driving in the right hand lane, which affords the best view of Boeing Field of any of the lanes, given that it allows a person to look down on the airport, located on the west side of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite the fact that my car radio was on (tuned to KING FM 98.1), and despite the fact that my windshield wipers were operating at a &#34;continuous&#34; setting, I became aware of the roar of jet engines, set at a high power setting.  Assuming that the aural report was from a jet aircraft taking off from the long runway (34 right), I glanced down at the airport to my right, expecting to see a jet beginning its take-off role.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, my attention was drawn to a jet aircraft that was streaking across Boeing Field at very high speed, and very low altitude, transverse to prevailing air traffic, i.e. it was streaking across the runway, flying from west to east!  Although I could not see the fuselage of the aircraft, I could see the cones of white hot exhaust, together with the shock cones clearly visible, streaming out the exhaust nozzles of the aircraft, permitting positive identification of the aircraft as a military, twin-engine jet fighter, therefore probably an F-18, an F-15, or an F-14.  As the aircraft passed over Interstate 5, having passed over Boeing field at approximately mid-field, it executed a slight, e.g. 5-10 degree, roll to its right, and it disappeared from my vision, passing over the slight hill to the east of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate that the aircraft was below 1,000 feet altitude, and perhaps below 500 feet, and it was traveling at between 200 and 400 knots.  The weather was poor, and the (lateral) visibility was not more than one mile, I estimate.  The ceiling, I suspect, was at approximately 1,000 feet, or less, and I was driving in light, though continuous, rain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my thirty one years in Seattle, and during the 28 years that I have held a commercial pilot&#39;s license, I have never witnessed such a dramatic event in the vicinity of Boeing Field.  Given that the weather was so poor, I presume that conditions were conducive to IFR (instrument flight reference) only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident is being investigated by personnel who work in air traffic control.  They report that at least one other witness reported the peculiar incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no reason to believe that the incident was, in any way, related to a UFO sighting or incident.  I report it here, only because of its seemingly truly bizarre nature.<n>

THE LIGHT DID NOT FADE NOR DID IT&#39;S HORIZONTAL LINE STAY STRAIGHT.  IT STARTED TWIRLING AND GOING ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IN THE SKY, I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS FIREWORKS BUT IT COULDN&#39;T OF BEEN BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY BRIGHT THICK LIGHT IN SKY.  IT ALSO CROSSED MY MIND THAT MAYBE IT WAS A JET DOING REGULAR FLIGHT TRAINING SINCE WE LIVE CLOSE TO AN AIRBASE, BUT THAT LIGHT NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN FROM A JET NOR THE THICKNESS OF THE LIGHT. THAT LIGHT WENT WAS MOVING AT AN EXTREMLY QUICK SPEED AND MANUVERED IN A WAY THAT NO JET OR PILOT WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL, THEN THE LIGHT WOULD DISAPPEAR FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS AND RETURN. I THOUGHT MAYBE IT GOT LOST IN THE CLOUDS BUT THEN REMEMBERED THAT THE SKY WAS SO CLEAR THAT THERE WERE NO CLOUDS THAT NIGHT SO HOW COULD THAT LIGHT DISAPPEAR AND THEN POP BACK UP AGAIN. I TOLD THE 2 OTHER OCCUPANTS IN THE CAR TO LOOK AT THE FALLING STAR AND LOOKED AT IT BUT ONCE IT STARTED MOVING IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND AT AN EXTREMLEY FAST SPEED THEY ALSO NEW RIGHT AWAY THAT IT WAS NO STAR, NOR NO PLANE. ONCE WE GOT TO OUR PLACE OF DESTINATION APPROX 5 MIN WE JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR TRIED TO LOOK FOR THE SPEEDY LIGHT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE IT FOR ABOUT ANOTHER 30 SECONDS AND IT DISAPEARED AGAIN BUT THIS TIME FOR GOOD. I NEVER BELIEVED IN UFO&#39;S BUT IT ISN&#39;T UNTIL YOU SEE IT YOURSELF, THAT ONE BELIEVES.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was blue and mostly cloudless, only a few cirrus clouds here and there.  I was driving due north in a rural area.  I looked up through my window and noticed several airliners at normal altitude.  We are in &#34;flyover country,&#34; so it is not unusual to see airliners traversing the sky and leaving contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the &#34;normal&#34; airplanes, I noticed approximately 5 or 6 contrails very close together, to the northwest of me (about 10 o&#39;clock high from my perspective driving north).  The closely-bunched contrails were forming parallel to each other.  They appeared to be on a southeasterly heading.  I could not see the airplanes leaving the contrails, which led me to believe that they were at extremely high altitude.  The contrails were clearly moving (growing in length).  As I continued to watch, several more contrails began to form to the sides and behind the original few.  All told there were probably around 10.  They appeared to be very close together, which led me to believe that they were high flying military jets in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing was that the contrails faded very quickly.  I grabbed my cell phone and called a friend to have her go outside and take a look.  I asked her &#34;Do you want to see something unusual?  Go outside and look up to the northwest.  There is a bunch of contrails very close together.&#34;  By the time I got those words out, the contrails had faded, so I told her to forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My overwhelming impression is that they were military jets in formation, VERY high in altitude.  Once again the odd thing was how the contrails faded.  It was as though they just &#34;turned off.&#34;  Very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the witness that the objects almost certainly were contrails.  Probably not UFO-related.  PD))<n>

It was a partly cloudy day with mild weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked facing the north just outside the gate to my residence, what I though was a very bright star suddenly appeared about 50 degrees in front of me.  As I looked at it, it moved quickly to my left and stopped.  It then rose slowly changing from a bright start to clearly a solid inverted saucer shape dark brown in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered and as I looked at it, I saw out of the corner of my eye a second bright star that moved in the same manner and direction.  It also stopped and rose slowly in the sky to the same altitude/height as the first craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood looking at the two of them a third one appeared from the same spot in the sky and moved in the same manner as the other two. The third one, however, hovered without gaining altitude like the first two and remained in appearance like an extremely bright star.  They formed a &#34;V&#34; formation in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood in disbelief at what I was seeing and decided to call 911 on my cell phone to report what I was witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object moved slighly back and forth leaving straight lines behind it.  I felt that they knew I was watching them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was on the phone with them, all 3 objects simultaneously moved behind clounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for several minutes afterwards, but never saw saw them come from behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did get copies of my 911 tapes from the Dallas Police Dept. and DFW Airport.<n>

10/28/05 20:15|Carlsbad|CA|Formation|5 minutes|2 Flashing red lights pass directly overhead in perfect formation at very high altitude with no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Aircraft.  PD))|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47270.html|83|ndxe200510| 2 Flashing red lights pass directly overhead in perfect formation at very high altitude with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work at a place in Carlsbad, Ca., which has 24 hour security.  I was doing these security rounds at about 8:15pm at night when I had my sighting.  I had just walked out of the Southern part of a building, into a courtyard between the offices buildings, turning East to walk back towards the main building.  I looked up into the sky as I usually do and spotted what I assume in Mars.  I remember reading a news story about how Mars is supposed to pass close to the Earth again and look bigger than normal.  I noted this must be Mars as it looked bigger than any other star and seemed to have an orange tint to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to the right of Mars, off to the ESE, I then I spotted something I&#39;m not used to seeing at all.  In that part of the sky, I saw two very far off red flashing lights. They did not flash at the same time, rather one and then the other. The first thing I thought was that these were military helicopters, flying at a very high altitude. They seeming to be flying to my right, which was South. I assumed they were flying from Camp Pendleton to Mira Mar, both Marine bases in San Diego. This would not have been unusual if this was the case. I&#39;ve often seen helicopters fly a NNW to SSE flight path over Vista and San Marcos down to Mira Mar, even at night. I stopped for a moment to watch them... and they blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was completely clear. You could see every star. There were absolutely no clouds. I was stunned. I waited. I wanted to see them again. I wanted to make sure that maybe they didn&#39;t just fade behind a very thin cloud that I was unable to see in the night sky. I expected them to pop back out further to the South, possibly leaving my vision on the SE horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when they reappeared alomst directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up, surprised by their new position, but then I realized that they may not have been flying SE at all. They may have been approaching and flying directly West. I just percieved the wrong thing at first because they were so far off on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were now directly overhead, just South of the zenith. I watched them pass. They still appeared to be very high in the sky, however, the red lights flashed a lot brighter. The stars were even more clear in the sky. I thought that I might be actually seeing a black tringle. So, I carefully watched the sky between the lights to see if I could see an edge or perhaps see stars &#34;blink out&#34; as it passed by. I did not, so I was able to rule out this was a single craft. The two red lights were two seperate objects. They matched each other in speed and brightness so well, though, that if was hard to tell. I had to look just to make sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I ruled that out, I still noted no sound. I called my roommate on a cell phone I was carrying and reported what I was seeing to him. He was at the apartment, a few miles to the NE of my position, in Vista, however, the apartment faces NW and he doubted that he would be able to see it. Even as I spoke with him, the two lights were slowly making their way across the sky and out to the Pacific Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch them, never taking my eyes off them, as I spoke with him and watched them bank to their left. The two lights took on a 45 degree angle in the sky as they seemed to turn from going West to SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, the lights met with the horizon of another office building and I had to walk away because I could no longer see them from my point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thoughts are that I believe this was military. It could possibly be either fighter jets or military helicopters flying at the highest altitude, however, what gets me if the total absense of sound, nor any other lights. Now, in the flashing of the red light, there could have been a smaller white one mixed in there, but the lights were so high up, and the red flashed so quickly, that I was unable to tell for certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this just in case I&#39;m wrong and the military didn&#39;t fly these two crafts tonight. I am familiar with the two red light sightings in San Diego around the 4th of July and New Years. I&#39;m reporting this just in case these may actually be tied into those sightings as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: As an added note, there was tons of air traffic tonight. I saw at least 5 other small planes in the sky returning to the main building. Three of which seemed to be flying up and down the coast of Carlsbad at the same time as my sighting. One plane was landing at Palomar airport at 8:18pm. It&#39;s possible other pilots in the Northern Western part of San Diego County may have seen these two lights and can be a better judge of altitude and position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS; SUBMITTED 10/28/2005 AT 21:02 HRS.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Flashing red light returns, alone this time, flies same path overhead, and disappears over SW horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> Refer back to 20:15 sighting in same location.  This is the same person reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights came back.  ((NUFORC Note:  at 21:40 hrs.))  One of them did, anyways.  This time there was only one flashing red light in the sky as it passed overhead, going the same speed, same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I really am wondering if it&#39;s military aircraft circling.  However, as always, because the lights would completely stop flashing and go out for a few passing moments, and because this still did not have any sound, or any other lights associated with it, I wanted to report it here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I can give you something else I didn&#39;t note the first time.  There was a sequence to the flashing lights.  It flashed in sequence of 1-2-3-stop... 1-2-3-stop... each time it stopped, there would be no lights at all.  I could only still make out a red light.  I watch it blink out while overhead this time and still could not even make out a shadow of a dot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it fly west, all by itself, and bank to the SW again before I returned to what I was doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, I&#39;m sorry, but it turns out that these aircraft were fighter jets from Miramar MAS. They returned a third time later in the evening and I had a witness with me who was able to say with certainty that these are what they were. During the third sighting, we actually saw four of them, flying the same exact circular path, two by two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He agreed with me, however, that it was very strange that the pilots were turning off all their lights. Again, right over the area of Encinitis, Ca, the flashing red lights would turn off and they&#39;d fly a short distance for about a good 10 seconds with no lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also during the third sighting, things were finally quiet enough in the area that we were both able to hear the very distant rumble of fighter jet engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologise for posting these reports, now that I know what they were, but, like I said in those reports, the fact that I couldn&#39;t hear them at first and the fact that they were actually turning off all their navigational lights was throwing me off. I guess they thought they were flying high enough that they didn&#39;t need to worry about commercial and private aircraft hitting them. I wonder why they still did that, though...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess you can still post the reports based on that weird fact. Maybe they didn&#39;t want to be noticed and were flying at such a high altitude because they were flying something unconventional. I have no doubt now, though, that it was military aircraft from Miramar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END CORRESPONDENCE))<n>

Lee vs Mesquite High School Football game.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before the game started I noticed the light to my left.  I beleive I was facing West sitting in the East stands.  The full moon was high in the sky approximately at an angle of 50 degrees West from where I was sitting and 55 degrees approximately above the horizen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the Moon just before Kickoff about 7:20 p.m. I noticed a dim very small circle of light hanging in the sky very close to the Moon. I tryed to get my wife to notice it but she was more interested in the introductions for the game. There was to much noise on the field and in the stands to get anyone close to notice the light.  It was almost to dim to catch anyones attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about three minutes the light started to move.  It was obviously a great distance away. Perhaps very close to the distance of the moon. The light moved very slowly, at least to me it appeared slowly away from the Moon to the East a short distance.  It was definitely not a star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turned up and made a tight turn back toward the Moon and continued the turn until it approached the path it had previously taken in the East. It continued the Easterly direction and was either moving away or down when an even smaller ligth emerged from either the Moon or from behind it. The smaller light was a little brighter than the large light but not by much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to head toward earth for a moment then turned at a much higher speed and appeared to race after the larger light.  As it reached the larger light, they both faded out and disappeared. I didn&#39;t see a collision.  The lights were definitely under the control of an intelligent sourse. The large light was to me about the size of a pin head and the smaller light about a third that size.  Obviously they had to be extremely large objects to be seen that far away and their movement was deliberate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really doubt that anyone else saw these lighted objects because the were so dim, so smal! l and we re only visable for such a short time.  I guess I should have stood up and shouted for others to look but at first I expected to discover some natural cause for the big light and the small one moved quickly and was gone in about 30 seconds. The lights of the object did not shine like an electric light sourse but were rather dull. However they were extremely far away. The larger light was about the color of the yellowish Moon and the small light a little whiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects date of sighting, which was October 28, 2005.

We were returning home, which was about 1 mile past the Fayette and Jessamine County line on Tates Creek Rd. As we traveled along Alumni Dr. to my right (West) I saw a large diamond shape object above the trees. It was the size of my thumb. As Alumni meanders, it seemed to stay in a constant attitude. No movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we reached home, I walked to the front of the house and it was then, south, but the same size and stationery. This was about the time either Mars or Venus was supposed to be so close. My friend thought it must be that. But, what I saw did not resemble a star or planet. It was diamond-shaped with the tallest points verticle. It was very bright and clear, possibly lit from the moon&#39;s glow. This was night time. Through the center was a green belt. The entire surface was faceted, as though it was made up of millions of tiny crystals, including the belt. Since distance can fool you, I can say that it appeared to be between the earth and it&#39;s moon, however, the moon was to my north-east. I am 60 years old this spring, and even though I haven&#39;t flown since the mid 80&#39;s, I do hold a 3rd class, single engine, land rating. So, even though I have had only about 100 hours flying time, I have had some training in observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, I thought I would walk out to see if anything was there. Again, it was there, in the same position, and looking the same as before. I went back into the house and retrieved my binoculars and viewed the object through them. It was so bright, I could never get it in good focus. Since it never did anything but set there, I went back inside and forgot about it. Three or four days later, I checked again, but did not see it at all in a 360 sweep.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our company|11/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47487.html|89|ndxe200510| On friday Oct. 28, 2005, a co-worker and I (of 7 years) were sitting outside our plant near the loading dock around 2:00pm.  Our company allows us to sit down after our work is completed for the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this day we decided to go outside and sit.  It was a mostly clear with a little wind blowing to the west.  Our plant is near the railroad tracks so we watch the trains and the jet airplanes as they pass by (there were several that day as always).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed the objects (at least 3 maybe more) they were northwest of our location.  My first thought was that they were gulls (birds) because they appeared to be white in color.  They were circling each other when I said to my co-worker &#34;look at that&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point one shot off in a southeast direction at a high rate of speed (much faster than any jet we have ever seen).  When I looked back to where they were the rest were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was maybe this was a mylar balloon.  That is when I noticed which way the wind was blowing (the other direction).  As the object moved across the sky it sort of changed colors.  As I said, it first appeared white but as it moved it would look metallic or silver in color. This might be because the object appeared to be banking or rocking back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it had left our sight (because it went over our building), my co-worker said &#34;what was that?&#34;.  I ask him if he had seen the other ones, to which he replied that he had only seen the one moving to the southeast.  He also stated that he had never seen anything like that before (me either).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound or if there were it was covered up by work being done on the railroad. After discusing what we had just seen, we ruled out a jet (moved much faster, at least twice as fast), a gull (they don&#39;t look like metal), a mylar balloon (it was going against the wind), we decided we didn&#39;t know what it was, except a UFO.<n>

As is was 1.30 am,I decided to get up and investigate when a bright light caught my eye as it looked like an aircraft going in the wrong direction.  We are on flight path into Larnaca airport and this object was going in the complete opposit direction.  Then the object appeared to stop and hover.  It had green, amber and white flashing lights around it.  It moved in irregular directions, back and forth and side to side.  Difficult to tell how far up it was but the lights were large as the size of an aircraft on on its final approaches to land.  I observed it through binoculars for approx 45 mins and could see it was a triangle shape, and woke another family member to witness it.  I wanted to video it as the video has a very strong zoom.  When I tried to video it, it was like someone put a hand over the lens as I was unable to see anything.  I checked the camera at other places into the sky and room and was able to see perfectly but again, when pointing the camera at the object, it went black and I was unable to record.  When my younger daughter came into see the object, it moved behind the tree and stayed there.  We could see the lights through the tree but it wouldnt come back out for a proper view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were on highway 280 driving on our way to Redwood city from San Francisco when we saw these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was my wife who pointed these two mysterious objects out as I was driving.  She tapped me on the shoulder an told me to looked up to the upper right corner of the sky.  I saw two bright stationary objects (they appeared to be brighter than the sun or anything I have ever seen in my entire life. There was a large object above a smaller one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not look at them the entire time because I was on the high-way and I did not want to risk an accident with another car, so I turned away and started driving.  When there were not any cars around and it was safe to slow down, I looked back up into the same spot of the sky I had just looked at and saw five white lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were as bright as the other objects I had seen except this time they were smaller.  As I watched them they appeared to be falling towards the earth (I do not know how high up the objects were). I asked my wife and children what had happened and they told me that the object had exploded in the sky after a light green object emItted some kind of a beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to my wife and children, the two bright white objects had been obviously been attacked and destroyed by the green object.  I would have taken a picture but my camera phone does not take pictures of far away objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I live in reno Nv, I was on the football team;Hug Hawks.Game over my dad drove me and my girlfriend home, his truck did not have the dip stick for tranmisson, he knew of this and told us to go to the bathroom now because he is not stoping. About a hour into the dive i fall a sleep, my dad keeps go ahead on I-80 west. My dad had to go to the bathroom so he pulled over and his truck take a dive; rocking the truck. At the same time a cop put his lights up and pulls my dad over. He says my dads tail lights did not work, but he falt bad for my dad because he put over 5k in the truck and had the bill to show that he just took the truck to the shop. But my dads truck did not start, the cop called for a tow truck... We wait for a hour then my dad calls everyone to get some help, then my girlfriend said she got (AAA) to tow the truck. I my dad and girlfriend wait for a half an hour, then I start watching my game that I just played. After watching the game I heared the bus that I rode on to get to the game pass bye. I start to fell a sleep, then my dad wakes me in a vocie that I could tell something was wrong. He ask me to look at a light at some what the top of the hill, I say about 500 foot hill. I looked at the light I said its some house light, then right one time the light starts to movie to the right fast, going over all hills, rocks, bushes, and not rocking the light. It was a soild beam of light pointing right at me and my dad. Moving very fast the beam of light was all way on us. The light moved side to side about 45deg left and 45deg right very fast. Then I woke my girlfriend she said the same thing i said the frist time but I and my dad said just look at the light now all 3 of us was look at a beam of light high in the hill, as it start to move my girlfriend jumps in the truck. My dad pointing a flash light at the light and it stoped and as all way was about 5 feet above the ground, my dad truned off the light and the beam of light would start to move toward us. Right away my dad turn the light on the beam of light would stop but not for long. It would start to moving side to side, and come closer and closer to me and my dad. My dad was not very happy with what is going on he gaves me a knive, and the light. He starts to call the tow truck tell the what is going on and we need to get out of there. As times pasts it get down the hill and now in the valley, now about 500 yards way form us. I with knive in hand and light start to walk towards the light, the beam was moving side to side so i just walk in a straight line form the truck. I pointed the light at the beam of light and start to walk away form the truck about a 50 yards my dad was about 25 yard way. He was talk to the tow truck guy. I think it took them 3 hours to get there. But any way as I&#39;m walk to the beam of light I heard no sounds, the beam of light came at me so fast it was not funny. It was so close I could see the bushes and the little hill on the land, at the same time I saw the light in a better veiw. It did not light up anything that was not in the beam, like a lazer. I ran to the truck and my dad fallowed, we all jumped in the truck and waited. As the light movie side to side it was about 200 yards a way. We just waited as it got closer then start to back up, but then it would move so fast i dont even really think any would go that fast then stop and move to the right and left. I was scared my dad was scared my girlfriend was scared. As we watched the light move for about 30 more mins. The tow truck guys came, the frist thing we said was can u look at that light, as he did he was like its nottin, just like me the beam of light started to move. He went to work get us out of their, 15 mins of look at the light we were got out of there. But as we left the light rose form the ground and start to fellow us about 5 miles the light went away. I cant say the light was a UFO or something esle, just because the street we broke down on name is Grave Yard or something like that. Just that makes me fill I cant say what it was, all i can say is I saw what I saw... It Was a clean Light like a lazer. ((name deleted))<n>

Living in a fairly rural area with fields and forests all my life I am accustomed to seeing the occasional deer, fox or if I am lucky Moose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that night I came around the corner of my street and saw in the light of my neighbours driveway two upright beings that stood at around 7-8 feet tall and did not appear to be clothed.  At first I thought it was my neighbours walking at night, but when I saw the height, I was surprised and the their walking movement was much different then that of a human being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Consequently I was a bit nervous, but as I turned the corner and had them in full view they walked into my neighbour&#39;s driveway out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came by my neighbour&#39;s house the two beings were no where to be seen, there is a 16 foot cedar hedge and large overgrown field next to my neighbors that&#39;s where I think they may have gone.  Once I came home I recounted the situation to my family and haven&#39;t really thought much of it since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, the night of the 26th of October 2005, my father asked my brother to bring the garbage out at around 9:30.  To my surprise he came running to my room out of breath and recounted what he had seen in front of my neighbours driveway.  To my surprise his sighting sounded very similar to mine accept for the fact that he only saw one being and not two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel kind of stupid and I have spoken to my girlfriend about it and she just laughed at me, but I know what I saw and I feel kind of stuck because no one will believe me  accept my brother who has witnessed the same sighting.  So I came on to the internet and decided to look for places who studied aliens and other strange sightings as this and I came across your site and decided it would be best if I wrote to you about the situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just wondering if anyone else has seen anything similar and if you have any explanations as to what my brother and I saw.  I would like to thank you very much for your time and hope to hear from you in the future. I remain. Contact me via e-mail.<n>

I was flying patterns at the Eloy Airport just south of phoenix. While in the downwind for runway 2 I noticed that there was 6-7 amber lights in to the southwest of the airport. I am guessing that they were ranging from 9000MSL to 12000MSL in a formation pattern sloping up from left to right. I believe that they were around 20-50 miles away hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A while after i spotted them they slowly started to disappear from left to right one by one. There was two of us and we both saw these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just got home a couple of hours ago and started to do some research on this and found the phoenix lights.  My sighting was very similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One last thing i dont know if this has any relation but a couple of mins after the lights we witnessed what looked like a small meteror or something of that sort about 100-200 yards from the aircraft.  There were some other aircraft in the area anyone else see anything?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be an exceptionally good witness.  He provided a seemingly quite accurate azimuth to the lights, which suggests to us that they could have been over the Gila Bend Firing Range.  PD))<n>

This time an extremely bright light was spotted through a window as I was sitting about 6 feet across the room.  I immediately went outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was in the SW sky about 4 thumbwidths from the horizon.  I flashed a flashlight into the sky in the direction of the object.  When I did that the light changed shape many times.  It went from a vertical line, to sideways chevron (&gt;), then it turned into a square and finally into a triangle and back to a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to have rays of light radiating in all directions from it which could have been an optical illusion, although the rays disappeared within 20 minutes.  When I first went outside, every dog in the neighborhood was barking.  The light appeared to pulse after I flashed a flashlight at it.  It also morphed into a triangle multiple times-the morphing happened for the first 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw five airplanes fly in opposite directions above and below it with one looking like it nearly collided with it.  After about 25 minutes it began to dim and had very slowly descended behind a tree and within 30 minutes it had floated down and to the west too far to be seen from my vantage point.  There was no sound associated with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a similar light this morning at 7am in the same part of the sky but dismissed it as a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and the temperature was about 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. The nearest Air Force base is several hours away, an Army base is 3 to 4 hours away and the nearest commercial airport is an hour away.  This light was 10 times bigger than a star and probably 20 times brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former teacher and currently provide homecare to an invalid with multiple health problems. Therefore, I act as a nurse in certain respects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and son saw the light as well.<n>

I waited for my brother to come in, but he didn,t.  They were all standing there, staring at the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted--witness #2))  (my brothers friend) was acting as weird as normal.  But his mom was in an extremely intense conversation.  When i looked up there was a big ball of light, at first i thought it was a blimp.  It got closer, and looked like a large lit up ball, it hovered near our neighborhood for a while. then took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When ((name deleted)) mom was off the phone she said, &#34;Well you guys, I admit that I haven&#39;t believed in aliens until now.  The police said that they are getting tons of calls about this and no one knows what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;My brother ((name deleted)) called my mom and she said that they were seeing the same thing. ((name deleted)) dad and brother called and told us about what they saw.  Then i saw jets flying after the sphere and pointed it out to every one else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ufo, seemed to be doing tclical manuvers, and that ruled out the theory of a blinp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story may not sound like much, but at that tme i was watching, wishing that the whole world was seeing this with me.  IT was disturbing, yet exciting, and it all just felt weird, to accually be a person who can talk about their experience with the unknown.  I have no specific number of witnesses, but i know of at least nine.  As I said, ((name deleted)) friend&#39;s mom said, the police were getting alot of calls about this, and no one could prove what it was. But there have been more sightings around the U.S. that explained the same thing, and the government is probably hiding the truth from us, making random excuses for each one, look for truth!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I almost called someone last night but figured she would think i was crazy and then this morning heard on the radio lots of people saw lights.

10/26/05 18:50|I-495S/I-95S|VA|Light|50 minutes|Bright, white light moving horizontally/vertically visible from I-495/I-95S in Northern Virginia.  ((NUFORC Note:  Pilot report.  PD))|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47233.html|116|ndxe200510| Bright, white light moving horizontally/vertically visible from I-495/I-95S in Northern Virginia<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I begin, I would like to qualify myself just a little.  I am an experienced aviator with more than 12 years of flying experience.  Over my flying career, I&#39;ve seen several things most people would believe to be UFOs, but my experienced eye can immediately &#34;debunk&#34; (e.g. bright planet on the horizon, aircraft landing lights in clouds, etc.)  What I saw last night is not easily &#34;debunkable.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  Date/Time: October 26, 2005, 1850-1930 E.S.T.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  Witnesses:  Myself, but there have to be others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  Weather: Clear skies with broken clouds at approximately 2000-6000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4)  Narrative of Event:  At 1850, I was traveling south on the &#34;outer loop&#34; of the Washington, D.C., Beltway (I-495) heading towards I-95 south.  After passing the exit for US-50, a strange light configuration in the sky came into view on the right side of the highway (to the west or southwest) and it caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could clearly make out the lighting pattern of a helicopter and to the left of it were two white lights that were too far away from the helicopter to be attached to it but seemed to be keeping pace with it.  The aviator in me immediately wondered if the helo was flying in formation with another aircraft, and if so that sure was a weird lighting configuration.  The helicopter was moving towards the highway ahead of me at an altitude of about 1000 feet or so, and the two lights remained in perfect formation with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to the helo (I was travelling at about 70 MPH), it was just crossing over the highway.  I rolled down my window and could hear the sound of its rotor blades and could briefly see portions of the fuselage of the helo illuminated by ground lights and its own rotating beacon.  It appeared to be a Blackhawk helo, but between watching the road and looking at it I couldn&#39;t make a positive identification.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What kept me focused on it was the two weird, white lights to the left of it.  As it crossed over the highway just in front of me, I couldn&#39;t make any sense out of what the two white lights were.  If they were attached to another aircraft there was no visible fuselage, and I continued to watch as the helo and the lights crossed the highway in perfect formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the point when it was closest to me, I was able to discern that the two white lights were not part of an aircraft or the helo, but instead seemed to be just &#34;floating&#34; in the sky next to the helo in perfect formation.  I then lost visual contact with helo and the white lights because of trees along the left (eastern) side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my mind I thought, &#34;Hmmm, they must have been hauling something underneath or trailing wires of some kind with safety lights so other aircraft wouldn&#39;t hit them.  I put it out of my mind and focused my full attention on driving again.  I noticed my speed had dropped to 55 while I was watching the helo and some cars had stacked up behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I increased my speed back to 70 and kept driving.  In my mind I just thought &#34;Wow, that was kind of weird,&#34; and I more or less put it out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later (1855 or so), I was travelling SE on I-495, and when I was near the exit for 620 (Brook Hill Road) a new, bright, white light appeared in the sky to the right (SW of my position) of the road and immediately began to drop straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being an aviator who had just seen a helicopter, I immediately thought &#34;Wow, they&#39;re dropping flares now, I wonder what&#39;s going on.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keeping my eyes on the light, I watched as it dropped straight down with an increasing rate of speed.  As I watched it fall I thought &#34;Wow, that&#39;s pretty bright for a flare.  If that&#39;s a helo&#39;s landing light, he&#39;s auto-rotating and he&#39;s going to crash!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought that perhaps it was a meteor burning up in the atmosphere, or perhaps I&#39;ve just got a weird angle on an aircraft approaching Dulles airport from the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw next is very difficult to explain in terms of my aviation experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After falling straight down for about 5-7 seconds at an increasingly fast rate of speed, the white light just stopped (on a dime) and became stationary in the sky.  12 years of aviation experience immediately told me that was no helicopter, and certainly not a flare.  Meteors burn up and the light extinguishes.  I couldn&#39;t explain how the light just stopped after dropping straight down vertically.  The light remained stationary for quite some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove on, I-495 got closer to I-95 south and I had intermittent visibilty with the bright, white light.  During about a 10 second period of visibilty I was able to clearly discern that the light had started moving horizontally to the south.  I-495 was now taking me SE to almost E, and I lost visual contact with the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me a few minutes to get to I-95S because of traffic and once I got onto I-95S, I checked the time and it was 1905.  I was looking for the light after I got out from behind the sound barrier walls on the sides of the roads, and immediately regained visual contact with the light.  It was now clearly moving horizontally to the south and would stop for short periods of time then continue moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way it was moving didn&#39;t seem quite right for it to be a helo.  It would go fast, then slow, then fast again.  Sometimes it would drop straight down for a second or two, then continue moving horizontally.  (A key point here: I never saw it move straight up!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was now travelling S-SW on I-95S and I scanned the horizon for aircraft.  I could clearly make out 2 low flying helicopters.  One was to my left (east) and another to my right (west).  I could see other aircraft flying at much higher altitudes, but the prominent feature in the sky was the bright, white light to the SW of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using my fist, I checked the distance from the ground to the horizon and made a note that  the white light was about 15 degrees up from the horizon.  It began to move south again and I wanted to follow it.  I got off of I-95S and went west on Prince William parkway to try and follow the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then became stationary again.  I knew there was a Wal-Mart nearby and that I could park and look at the light from there, so I went to the Wal-Mart parking lot at 1400 Worth Ave, Woodbridge, VA and got out of my truck to look at the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep a pair of binoculars in my truck (I&#39;m a country boy) and I took them out to look at the light.  I focused on the light which was stationary again and all I could make out was that it was white, bright, and fairly large.  It remained stationary for so long I began to think that I must be just making something out of nothing.  Perhaps it was just a bright planet or star on the horizon and the fact I was moving when I was watching/following it is what made me think it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to just write it off as an overactive imagination when I looked at it again through the binoculars and it slowly moved horizontally out of my field of view.  Thinking that perhaps it was me, I spread my legs shoulder width apart, stood firmly and regained the light in my field of view.  I was not moving, IT WAS.  It then dropped straight down out of my field of view, and when I regained it, it was stationary again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, it was almost 1930 and I had been drinking coffee during my drive.  I had to go into Wal-Mart ((deleted)).  I put the binoculars away and walked (at a fast pace) into Wal-Mart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was visible in the sky to the SW the entire time I was walking in.  What struck me as odd, was that no one was looking at it or noticing it, and having seen everything I had just seen I thought &#34;Wow, there really could be UFO activity over a populated area and most average citizens wouldn&#39;t even notice!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into Wal-Mart, used the restroom quickly, and when I came back out the light was no longer visible in the sky to the SW of Wal-Mart.  I looked for it on the horizon but couldn&#39;t find it anywhere.  I went back to my truck, got out my binoculars, and scanned the sky visually and with the binos waiting for it to reappear.  While I was waiting for it to reappear, I noticed there were two aircraft flying high-enough that I couldnt&#39; hear them and in a tight formation (that appeared to be military) flying SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light never reappeared, and due to all the buildings and ground-based lights I realized I couldn&#39;t really see much anyway.  I got in my truck and left at 1945.<n>

Even though at a great distance with each strobe flash it would be quite a distance away from the previous one and then not at predictable areas that you would normally guess to be its next location, sometimes it would increase that space and sometimes it would appear to just move a hair in distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that really got me watching intensly was when it started to move up and down then left to right and then the opposite direction.  I tried to come up with some sort of explanation such as since it was so far away that it could be that it appeared to be moving all around but just traveling away from me and changing altitude and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived around many military bases and am familiar with air craft and such.  I have never seen anything that could do the things that this flashing light did!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Who knows!

It was a beautiful day with bright sunshine.  I always love to look at Gods beauty in amazement, and I am one who has seen other sightings in the past so I always am on the look out for any strange things in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you know when flying over the Nevada area there is more openess with less trees,  so when flying over this large area of wilderness, I was thinking I would hate for the plane to crash out here in the middle of nowhere! I&#39;m not good at judging distance in numbers, so I would discribe the altitude as not being able to SEE the trees, but knowing they are trees because of the green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just coming into Colorado mountains when I saw this bright glint of light amoung all this vasness of green.  It was silver in color.  There was nothing else that could be out there in all that vast wilderness but the possibility of a space craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were flying over, I was so shocked to have the sun reflecting off of what ever that was out there.  But I could see it was silver, like some sort of metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Since there was no electricity, after the sun had set, sleep came quickly to my family. Me and my brother were still up, listening to the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up during the break and looked out the window at the sky and I saw a strange dot of light hovering over downtown in the east. It was bright yellow and moved up and down, and in generally peculiar directions for an aircraft. Suddenly the craft began moving westward. It came nearer and nearer to wear I was located. I was generally disturbed by the aircraft but, nonetheless, watched it diligently. I called my brother over as the aircraft neared. Eventually, the I realized the craft did not have one light, but was triangular shaped with three bright lights. It continued westward, and as it got closer, the radio started giving off strange sounds. It was a strange high-pitched static-like sound. The craft continued westward constantly, we watched, mystified and yet paralized with fear. As the craft passed our home and eventually our field of vision, the radio returned back to normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep in mind this happened the day after the hurricane, our infrastructure was obliterated and no airplanes had been flying (or flew) for days afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I went out on the back patio around 9 PM to enjoy a fire and stargaze. After seeing the occasional shooting-star we decided to call it a night and head back inside about 10:30 PM. As I took one last look at the sky an object caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wasn’t sure that I was actually looking at something, but as my eyes began to adjust I could see that there was something there and it was hovering or moving very, very slow. What immediately alarmed me was that this flying craft made no noise on a night that was so quiet that you could have heard a car engine a mile away let alone the engine of a large aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my wife and asked her if she saw what I was looking at and after pointing it out she saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first spotted the object it was between my location and the southern end of the San Tan Mountains, about a mile and away hovering at what I would guess about a 1000 feet high. As it began to slowly move in a southerly direction I got a better glimpse of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no running lights and was dark in color and I could see its shape and size silhouetted against the starry sky. The object did seem to produce a light greenish auora at times, but it was very faint. It was the biggest flying object that I have ever seen, much larger than a 747 and shaped like a &#34;boomerang.&#34;  My wife and I observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared over the southern horizon. It spooked us both and she still doesn’t like talking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went online to several UFO reporting websites and filed a report with one, mainly to see if I would get a response from someone else in the area that might have seen this thing too. The funny thing is a few days later my posting of the sighting had been removed for no apparent reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I knew nothing about the mass sighting over Phoenix in 1997, but after some research and hearing accounts of what people saw that night, I would say that we observed was something very similar to what they did. A giant, silent flying, wing like object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know some time has passed since this UFO sighting occured, but I feel obligated to report none the less.  I still gives me the chills to think about it...<n>

10/24/05 20:30|North Miami|FL|Light|10+minutes|MOVING STARS|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51732.html|132|ndxe200510| On the night of Hurricane Wilma I honestly couldn&#39;t tell you the exact time but I&#39;m guessing it must&#39;ve been at least 8:30pm or so. Of course that night absolutely nobody in my neighboorhood or surrounding neighborhoods had any electricity at all. Most of Dade and Broward counties we pretty much pitch black. I don&#39;t even think anyone in our near by neighborhoods had any generators until at least 1-2 days later or so, and  our area alone went about 2-3 weeks without electricity. That night my 10yr old brother, my mother and I were outside our house in the porch area. We were grilling some food and pulled some chairs out. We were looking up at the skies and really just admiring the stars and how beautiful it looked since you can&#39;t really see &amp; appreciate them in the city. It was really, really dark and had a perfect view of the skies. We were just staring up a few minutes when my mom said look at that star it&#39;s moving. All the other stars in the skies looked normal and in place except this one that was actually moving. We could not see a shape or outline of any sort. I couldn&#39;t say that it looked like a saucer or diamond or anything it just simply looked like a moving star unlike the others. Just a bright light but not abnormally bright and it looked very, very far up in the sky. Of course the three of us just looked at it and followed it&#39;s movement as it was heading north. We were mesmerized and couldn&#39;t take our eyes off of it we kept saying it can&#39;t be a plane because to our knowledge their were no planes flying that night due to the hurricane. And it just seemed so far up I&#39;ve never seen a plane fly that far up before. Then we noticed another moving star behind the first one almost like out of nowhere so here there was two moving stars that seemed to be flying pretty fast and not necessarily in a &#34;perfect line&#34;. I&#39;m not going to say it was doing any crazy twists and turns or anything like that either just not a perfect line and a plane couldn&#39;t make those fast movements. My mom and I just kept saying it can&#39;t be a plane besides there are no planes flying tonight. We kept asking what is that? Do stars move like that?   And if so why are these the only 2 stars moving like this and the others are standing still? My brother kept asking me is that a UFO? We followed it for a good 5+ minutes eventually when it got past a certain distance we couldn&#39;t see past our roof and lost it. But right when we thought we lost it almost immediately after that over our roof we saw what looked like a shooting star. I don&#39;t know much about shooting stars or anything like that but whenever I&#39;ve seen a shooting star or seen it portrayed usually it seems to shoot downward and this shot upwards and it was brighter then anyone I&#39;ve ever seen and almost in a line not &#34;arched&#34;. That could&#39;ve just been a coincidence I don&#39;t know about that I just thought the timing was either weird or perfect. We just kept looking up and kept asking ourselves what was that? Did we just see a UFO? Then when we thought the action was over we continued to look around and I noticed another moving star this one was brither and bigger then other two but it couldn&#39;t be the same one because the other two had just past over going north this one was just approaching us and it was on the west side there was no way it could&#39;ve turned around that quickly in a matter of a minute! I said look  another one up there,my brother asked where?I pointed at it, as I said it was approaching us and this one didn&#39;t look as high up as the other two. He still  couldn&#39;t find it. I told him give me your flashlight. We had one of those long black flash lights like the kind cops use a good bright one  nearby he got it and gave it to me. I turned it on and said see look up there and pointed the lit flash light in the direction of the star. As soon as I turned on the light and pointed in it&#39;s direction the star dimmed it&#39;s lights!It just looked like one of those really dim stars but you could still see it  moving, and he said why did you point at it, it must&#39;ve seen you! Now it&#39;s going to come after us and he actually got scared. Shortly after it dimmed it&#39;s lights it disappeared behind a cloud. This one we only saw about 2-3 minutes. We waited for it to come out the other end of the small cloud but it never came out. And how weird was it that it immediately dimmed it&#39;s lights when I pointed my flash light in it&#39;s direction. My brother kept asking what if it comes back later tonight? Do you think it saw us? He was actually scared and we just told him that if it was a UFO it was gone now. We stayed looking up for another 15 minutes to see if anything else would happen but that was it we didn&#39;t see anything else. My mom&#39;s friend claims that she saw the moving stars also that night. I actually went out the rest of that week every night with my little brother for a couple of hours a night to see if we saw anything else but we never did.I was not scared I don&#39;t know if mom was she didn&#39;t say so. I was more intrigued and mesmerized then anything and I do believe I saw a &#34;UFO&#34; and I&#39;ll never forget that experience. I don&#39;t think my little brother ever will either. He was scared but intrigued also and is now all into UFO stuff which is how we found this site surfing the net.  We still talk about it of course, my dad laughed it off didn&#39;t take us seriously and my husband just said that&#39;s great honey. But the three of us know what we saw and it was not &#34;normal&#34;  it was amazing there was something out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (p.s. I am open to being contacted if this is of any interest or help of any sort to investigators)<n>

We live here, and make this drive at night constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was much bigger than a star, and very very bright, reddish orange, and it was definately not a plane, there were no trails, and they didn&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surprised, we looked at each other making sure it was real.  It didn&#39;t move at first, and it wasn&#39;t on the mountain, or a car. It was in the sky. It just stayed there for a bit, then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later it reappeared in the same spot and stayed for awhile, and another, same size and shape, appeared a little below it. The second ball disappeared after a few seconds, and shortly after that the first ball disappeared.  It kept appearing and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally it went away, and we never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen anything like this before, and were actually a little shaken by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  At first glance, we thought the report might be addressing a sighting of the planet, Mars.  However, there should not be two of those planets visible in the night sky, and they should not suddenly disappear.  PD))<n>

The fall day was clear, no clouds in the sky, and the temperature was in the low 70’s.   The Sun was low in the western sky and blocked by high rise building.   The jet reflected the silver off the body of the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just happened to look off to the side and I noticed a small rice grain shaped object that was a reddish brown color, very subdued.   I watched it and at first I thought I was watching a very high flying bird or weather balloon.   I now saw another object that appeared to be about the same size.  I looked at my clock on the wall and it was 17:25 (5:25 PM MST).   I continued to watch for about 5 minutes as the two faint objects went around each other.  If I held out a silver dollar at arms length the two things would have circles that item.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 17:31 (5:31 PM MST) I noticed a very bright object appear.   Now that looked like a weather balloon, very bright, silver colored and the other two objects circled it.   One of the smaller object started to move southeast and a slow rate, about the speed of a satellite crossing the night sky.    The larger object and a smaller one stayed in the area of the northern sky, high angle to me.   I was under the impression that the objects were reflective and the light was reflected from the Sun and they were very high in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time a friend, lady was leaving the building and I showed her the two small objects and the larger one.   The objects were as follows.   The small one was traveling south east and I showed her.   The larger one was in the northern sky with one of the smaller one.   At this time another small object just appeared.  We both saw it and the lady stayed for a few minutes and watched but left to get a bus to go home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 17:36 (5:36 PM MST.   A friend that worked with me came on station, (Court Security Officers) and I showed him the objects.    The first small one was moving slow and almost east of us and the larger one was moving in that direction.   I lost sight of  the two and as my friend and I watched, two more appeared, we looked at each other and I said, “God they look like weather balloons but they move as if powered.    The first small one was still moving southeast and went behind a building and we lost sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright, larger one was moving south east and as it was east of us just stopped.   At this time the two lost objects came from the north and passed by the larger one with in 30 seconds and were gone out of sight.    The large bright object appeared to have stopped and I I would not have seen what took place I would have thought that I was looking at Venus or Sirius at this time.  Several other people came by and we showed them the object, they saw it and thought it was a star or weather balloon.   One of the younger men stated that the bight object looked cylindrical in shape and was reflective.  That object stayed in the east and I had high rise buildings covering 75% of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am ((deleted--sixties)), retired ((civil servant; considerable responsibility, ((deleted--three decades)) years in the military, active and reserve, I have had a telescope sense 1957 and have seen everything in the sky that could be observed in that time.   I in my life can not explain this one.   I would have thought it to be a weather balloon at first but not the way it moved and stayed in position.  The reflective silver of the one object and the five others were a reflective redish brown color and fainter the large one.  When the large object just appeared with the two smaller ones I was floored, I can not explain that sighting.   I you need to contact me please do so.<n>

I was driving at the time along a very dark roadway (clear skies with a waning partial moon) looking for the correct turn toward Wells, Nevada, when the 3 of us that were awake saw an object above the truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wide-awake, for we mandated that a ‘co-pilot’ always stay awake to keep the driver alert and it was still the early part of the trip.  ((name #1 deleted)) was the co-pilot while ((name #3 deleted)) and sleeping ((name #2 deleted)  were in the back seat.  ((name #3 deleted)) was helping us navigate correctly (extremely minimal highway signage in that part of the country).  ((name #3 deleted)) could also see the object while sitting in the back seat of the 4-door pick-up truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The truck we were in is a 2005 Chevy with a lift-kit, thus the headlights (on high beam at the time) shine higher than a normal truck and are very, very bright covering a good distance and a wide, high area.  I don’t believe that we would have seen the object if the headlights operated as manufactured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The surrounding countryside was devoid of anything except relatively flat land with low brush and the roadway.  All three of us saw the unidentifiable object in the lower sky, traversing relatively fast from left to right.  I’m surmising South to North or SE’ly to NW’ly.  It was sometime between 10 PM and midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My rendition of the sighting: I recall the object traversed a visible distance of maybe 1000 feet and was seen for about 4- 5 seconds.  It appeared to be about 300-500 feet in front of us (about 1/2 the distance of the traverse or less) and at 200-300 feet in altitude (about 3 times the visible length).  For some reason at the time it reminded me of a ‘flying boxcar with windows’, I don’t know why but that’s what I sensed it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The definitely-visible portion of the object was roughly rectangular in shape and hazy around the edges (long-ways parallel with the ground) with several (4 - 6) dimly lit ‘windows’ along that length.  The ‘windows’ seemed more square-like in shape as I recall, rather than round-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At each end of the object was a roughly-visible indistinct area that was darker-than-the-sky and about 1/2 the definitely-visible length, or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A distinct outline of the entire object wasn’t evident and it seemed there was no distinct bottom.  Again, as previously stated it appeared to look like a &#34;flying boxcar with windows&#34; or to a lot lesser degree a passenger train car, while sensing at the time the feeling that a massive, heavy object was traveling in the wrong place, the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light intensity reflecting off the object was similar to watching a car maybe 20-30 feet away drive through the beam of a fixed flashlight held horizontal.  The visual clarity was slightly dull with no sort of glowing or trailing evident.  I definitely recall the object was absolutely silent and colorless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that I can judge distances fairly well because I like to hunt upland game &amp; waterfowl and am also a licensed land surveyor.<n>

I estimate the object to be somewhere over the Cherry Valley/Beaumont area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light was at first a single, clearly visable light and was easily seen with the naked eye and seemed to be hoovering in one general area with some slight but quick movements. Small flashes of light appeared to drop from underneath the object, appear brilliantly and then fade out (not a flare).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few of these lights were seen the single light turned into three lights, possibly four, but the three lights formed what could be described as a triangle shape (clearly seen on the video in still frame).  We counted 6 of these objects being dropped on video before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In reviewing the video there appears to be some form of movement above the light which I thought could make it a helicopter (not sure why a helicopter would be dropping something over a populated area though)?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side note: I and my family (wife and two sons have witnessed this same type of light on 6 seperate occasions beginning last May.  I have two seperate videos of this object, (although one is very short and doesn&#39;t show much detail as it was a cloudy night) in roughly the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other times that we have seen it we have not had our camcorder to record.  I am keeping a vigulant eye to the East in hopes of catching more footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else in the Yucaipa, Calimesa, Cherry Valley, Beaumont, Banning or Cabazon area has seen these lights, please leave desciption of your encounter.<n>

My friend said hurry and make wish you saw a shooting star I felt very luck to have seen it it was very beautiful and wish I would have seen it outside of the car and not behind the windshield of a car.

As it is almost directly over me I can see a faint red lights with a large red light in a diamond shape glowing on the botton of this B2 shaped aircraft.I even flashed my flashlight at it because it appeared to be going so slow and had the altitude of an f-18 in the break or on aproach but it was bigger maybe by 20 feet but slower like helicopter speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But here is what baffles me as this thing gets about at a 45-degree angle away from me I hear a faint jet noise?  Now that means it was very high up and must have been very-very large or this is some new noise suppresion gear for turbo jet engines.15 minutes later it comes back or there were 2 of them!  Traveling the same flight path, but a few more lights in strange positions, 3 white lights right wing as it flys away on right leading edge area shining down and a few others strangly placed, but everything else was the same.Same craft or 2 of them I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m and ((specialty deleted)) on ((type a/c deleted)) and now work on ((a/c deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen all aircraft fly,this was very strange.<n>

The size appeared to be that of a small bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball exploded into a bright flash of light that completly lit the night sky up, and right after that, a small, round, sphere the size of a giant beach ball shot out and to the south.  Right after that everything disappeared, and the sky returned to normal, and everything was as it was before--nice and calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time the fire ball was seen, there were no signs of any aircraft in the area, there was no sound with the explosion, and there were no smells of any kind.  This could have been a meteor, however, I have never seen one do what this did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been told by several other individuals that they also saw this at the same time.  They were about 3 miles away looking to the west when they witnessed it, and it appeared to be less than 1 mile away from me and about 15,000 feet vertically.

(Estimation of its size: about 10 meter).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took about half a minute to do the complete circle over the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 minutes, my friends got in their car and went home, I kept on looking to this beautiful light and went inside after 15 min. One hour later, I went outside to look, it still was there, but less bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can guarantee you that it wasn’t a laser from one or another disco- the house is situated in the middle of creeks and agriculture. And we were standing right under the light, and saw not one vertical projected line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It felt like a very peaceful and special experience, without any feeling of fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote a letter to a specialist, and got the answer and confirmation that is was an UFO from Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, there were a lot of other signs on and around the house, which confirmed again the presence of UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hoping this information can be taken as a message or a sign, and can be shared with other people, I send you my kindly regards<n>

The light pulsated slowly and the view of the street seemed a little misty or foggy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I next heard a low sounding buzzing or humming and about one minute later the light was gone.

That immediately caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second later I’m starting to make out a &#34;V&#34; shape in the sky.  I’m first thinking it must be geese, but in a fraction of a second, I realized I’m looking at an incredible object of great size, almost as big as a commercial airliner, almost right on top of me by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also am very aware that there is no sound whatsoever, not even the movement of air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was &#34;Y&#34;- shaped, traveling at great speed in an east south easterly direction.  I noticed on the bottom of this object, there were round concave or perhaps bulging circles.  I can only estimate the number but i would say approximately 12 of these circles were laid out very symmetrically along the Y.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object had no lights or no self luminescence.  The only way I seen this object is because it was only approximately 150 feet off the ground and the street lights reflecting from its great size allowed me to see these for only 4 seconds at the most, but those 4 sec. have left an impression on me that I&#39;ll always remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it came over, our two dogs and both neighbors dogs were barking like crazy.  I then ran into the house to get my 3 children.  I was so shook up, I was babbling, trying to explain to them what I had I just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel really fortunate to have witnessed this phenomenon.  Had I not been where I was and looking up during those 4 seconds I would have never seen this great object.  Like I said earlier there was no sound to alert me to look up.  I was just fortunate.<n>

(Most people in Chicago were at home watching the first game of the World Series that the White Sox were playing.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was very clear and starry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:35 p.m.,  in the east/southeast sky, about 35 degrees above the horizon, several of us parents noticed a bright light that we assumed was a airplane moving toward our location many miles off.  The light did not fly in a straight line and we all took notice of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The motion of the light was very fluid back and forth as it flew toward our location from the east.  As the light approached closer, still miles away, the light became larger and red in color and the light from it appeared to have  rays or spikes  radiating from the center (like a stereotypical depiction of a bright star/star of Bethlehem).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light began to dramatically fall some distance.  It grew much brighter and glowed orange-red, and we all assumed this must be a giant meteor coming down. It did not fall too far though, and again gained some altitude, started flying again and proceeded extremely fast mainly south-southwest.  It was never flying in a straight line and always wandering from side-to-side or up-and-down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then appeared to explode, but the light did not disappear, it again looked more white and flew very fast far to the south.  We lost sight of it as it went over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light never got very close to our campsite and at the highest was about 50-55 degrees up from the horizon.  There were about 200 people present, most of whom were paying attention to scout activities around a very large campfire.  I would estimate that about 20 to 30 people were actively watching this strange light with amazement.<n>

Straight up, and directly above my head, I saw what appeared to be no more than just a white object - just a white point of light.  It hung motionless.  The object looked kind of like what a very bright star might look like during the middle of the day, and it appeared to be very, very high up, but I had nothing to relate size to, so I can&#39;t exactly gauge altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and bright blue, and it was between 3:30 and 4:00 (MST)in the afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more my eyes became accustomed to the sky I realized another identical object to the right of the one I had been looking at.  It also appeared motionless.  On further observation I soon located a third identical white object above the two I was looking at, and the three of them together formed a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They remained completely suspended for several minutes and did not move.  They were all, in fact, stationary when I first located them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the two objects which flanked the middle one fanned out to form what was now an arc.  This was the first movement I witnessed.  Their movements were sudden for having been suspended for so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they had formed an arc formation they once again quit movement and suspended themselves again.  They were all equally spaced in this formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple more minutes I noticed a fourth identical object coming out of the southeast at a very high rate of speed.  It approached the middle object in the arc formation and suddenly came to a very quick stop next to it.  It looked as if it was going to bump the middle object.  In fact, I have described the fourth object as racing in and &#34;flirting or dancing&#34; with the other object.  It would approach it as if it was going to bump it and then it would back off and repeat the motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the two other white objects, which had remained stationary all this time in their formation, fanned out again, but this time to line up in a perfectly straight line with the middle object which was still being &#34;taunted&#34; by the fourth object.  Once the three lined up they suddenly started moving northwest at a consistant speed and evenly spaced.  During the duration none of these objects ever changed shape or color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon the original three were gone over the horizon.  The fourth white point (object) remained suspended where it had been when the others left it.  After a few minutes it began to slowly move in the same northwest direction as the others.  I watched it move quite a distance, much more and it would have disappeared over the horizon like the others, and then it suddenly stopped and suspended itself again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming out of the southeast was a fifth identical white object also traveling at a very fast speed.  It was headed directly for the &#34;straggler,&#34; the fourth object, which remained motionless.  Again, this object seemed to &#34;dance&#34; with the other object once it got close to it.  It went through the same taunting motions, and would make passes at the other object, looking almost like it was going to hit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so of this &#34;activity&#34; the fifth and newest object proceeded alone on the same northwest course as the others.  The &#34;straggler&#34; remained suspended for a few more minutes before it too resumed the same northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The full experience of what I have just described took place over about a 20 minute time period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked our local news and have talked to a few people around town and no one has made mention of seeing anything like this.  I would be more than interested in knowing if there is anyone in my vicinity who may have witnessed the same thing I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it, nor can I think of anything that &#34;we&#34; know of that would act in such a manner in space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first sighting.<n>

It just sat there I watched it and it watched me the light was moving around back and forth up and down just floating in the sky and it looked like little white lights would go around it once in a while and seems to give off some sort of light flashes it was bright there was like light branching off the top to the left and right of the object, kind of like when you squint your eyes and look at a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 6:30 now I went in the house to lay down I was still tired too earlty to get up yet. I dozed off and woke up about 7:05am sure enough the light was still up there moving around and bobbing up and down, then just all of a sudden it vanished just as strange as it appeared! There was no engine noise the whole time I had been viewing it and it was approx. the height of the smaller planes when they go by I know it was not a star or a plane or jet or satlelite!

10/22/05 03:00|Yuma (outside of)|AZ|Disk|5 Minutes approx|Large object on the ground..then it vanished before our eyes!|5/29/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89097.html|163|ndxe200510| Large object on the ground..then it vanished before our eyes!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving on I-8 early in the morning through Arizona, outside Yuma I believe it was. I do know there was an airbase in the distance, close to the border, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Straight ahead there were very bright amber lights I kept seeing go on, then off..over again. I thought I was seeing things. Then I thought it was a plane flying really low or something. It did that 3x before I finally realized my mind wasn&#39;t playing tricks on me. I asked my husband who was driving if he had seen them, but he had not. They blinked on and off rather quickly at first. However, as we got closer he finally saw what I had, but this time there were several lights that had went on at once, and they stayed on longer than before and then some would go off slowly, while others turned off quickly..if that makes sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove closer to the object, so apparently it was sitting still. We came up on it rather fast. We were slightly elevated from the hill we were driving over, if I remember correctly, and the object was in the flat desert area. That&#39;s when we saw the object close to the ground in full view, near the highway. There was no one on the highway but us at the time from what I remember. It frightened us once we got close enough to it. It was massive. The lights were incredibly bright, but you could look right at them. It was so big. The amber glow was nothing like I&#39;ve seen before. Maybe 5-6 lights..they kept going off and on, but not in succession like one right next to the other. I don&#39;t know for sure if it was a pattern per say, it just wasn&#39;t the same every time is what I mean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband actually became startled and he pulled over immediately since it seemed as though we would drive next to it if we went further. I&#39;d say we were about 1/4 mile away. We got out of the car immediately, and then we heard jets overhead. We counted 4? They were in a V pattern initially from what we could tell, then they scattered overhead. The object was illuminated slightly by a large light that was next to the highway, and there were some lights next to the water storage units that we had parked by in order to get out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was dark metallic in color, I&#39;d say like pewter. Absolutely no sound, no dust from the sand underneath. It was larger than a commercial plane I&#39;m guessing, maybe twice as big?  After the jets scrambled, we looked back at the disk(?), which was rounded in the front, although we couldn&#39;t make out if it was round completely, just the front of it was bowed. I saw things on top, but they weren&#39;t sticking out. It looked more like welded doors maybe, I dunno for sure. It happened rather fast, and it was hard to believe what we were seeing. We didn&#39;t have a camera or recording device..and honestly, that wasn&#39;t the first thing we thought to grab at that time. I don&#39;t even remember how we got to the other side of the highway. All I remember is that there was a water storage area next to the highway, and it kind of hid us from view. I think my husband just didn&#39;t want us to be spotted, that&#39;s how startled he was (and he rarely gets startled). I just remember rushing to get out of view and that we wanted to turn our lights off as soon as we could so that we didn&#39;t draw any attention to ourselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we looked back down at the disk from looking at the jets, it literally...I mean literally...vanished before our eyes.  No dust.  No sound.  No hovering and then shooting off...NO NOTHING! We literally saw it vanish!  How is this possible?  Has anyone saw this before, how can something vanish as if it were never there? It was so big, and then nothing.  The jets were still flying overhead, and then they finally left.  We were both just stunned..and then drove on as soon as we could to get away from the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We actually didn&#39;t talk about it the rest of the way to our destination..I still cannot believe what happened.  We&#39;ve only told very close family what happened. I&#39;ve never seen one that close before, nor vanish before my eyes.  I will never in my life forget the color of those lights.  The most brilliant beautiful amber, so crystal clear..incredibly crisp light..yet it didn&#39;t hurt my eyes to look at them. Has anyone else witnessed this?<n>

10/21/05 20:00|Heflin|AL|Sphere|30 minutes|Huge ball of light seen on the ground in Talladega National Forest / Sweetwater Lake|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47563.html|167|ndxe200510| Huge ball of light seen on the ground in Talladega National Forest/Sweetwater Lake<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occured during a weekend hiking trip with my brother and a friend from college.  We had to night hike for a few hours on Friday.  The exact location of the sighting was across from a dirt boat ramp on Sweetwater Lake, which our hiking trail passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we broke into the field that runs along the lake and watershed, the fog was very thick.  This is when we first noticed flashing that we assumed to be heat lighting or something similar.  By the time we reached the boat ramp, we were away from the field and completely out of the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashes were coming from 3 points.  Two points were far away enough that the source could not be seen.  The 3rd flashing was across the lake and only a short distance inland (I guessed around 100 yards at the most).  The light was flashing at various intensity, length, and time.  Ranging from a very small fraction of a second to nearly a second.  The intensity also ranged from:  just enough of a flash to see the low level clouds light up with a white ambient light, to a bizarre ball of light that peaked over the tree line by many feet.  When the ball of light was large enough, it resembled plasma.  The colors were red, yellow, white, purple, etc.  The ball also appeared to move around, by maybe 30 yards to the left or right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than describing it as plasma, my friend suggested the side of a huge water tower was reflecting the flashes at us.  There is no structure at all in the area.  The flashes were coming from the center of the Talladega National Forest, indeed, there is no plumbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also note that the &#34;ball of light&#34; as I&#39;ve called it, was only 300 yards away at most, and completely silent.  We watched the 3 flashes for about 30 minutes until they became quite infrequent.  It was such a strange thing to see and we still have no good idea as to what it was. I hike there frequently and may inspect the area sometime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess to date is that we saw military testing of some kind. Heflin, the nearest city, as I now know, has many reports of strange sightings and some other odd things.  The Fort McClellan Military Reservation was to our West as we watched the light to our East.  The Comanche helicopter was supposedly tested in that area. Also, that whole area of Alabama is a huge military arsenal.  The military has installed solar powered sirens throughout the forest recently and some old timers explained that there is a history of weapons buried in the forest during the Cold War era who&#39;s keepers died with the knowledge of their location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Backgrounds of Observers: age 24 - College Senior in Software Engineering age 22 - College Junior in Chemistry age 18 - High School graduate<n>

10/20/05 22:00|Pueblo|CO|Unknown|45 minutes|A bright white light hovered over Pueblo Blvd. bridge over the Arkansas River, about 30 ft. above traffic, but no traffic seemed to see|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61722.html|174|ndxe200510| A bright white light hovered over Pueblo Blvd. bridge over the Arkansas River, about 30 ft. above traffic, but no traffic seemed to see<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were parked in my friend&#39;s car at Pueblo City Park, in the dirt lot directly behind the skate park. We were parked right next to the drop off to the Arkansas river and the fence to the little basesball park behind the skate park. We were facing the bridge of Pueblo Blvd as it goes over the Arkansas River. We were sitting there for about 20 seconds before we noticed there was an odd light hovering above the Pueblo Blvd. bridge. It was a bright white light, but the light from this object seemed to only radiate outwards horizontally, diagonally upward, and seemingly upwards. It did not appear that the light could have been seen should you have been lower in elevation than it was in the slightest. The elevation of the craft was approximately the same as our current elevation, as the bridge seemed to be 25-30ft lower in elevation. We could not see what the shape of the craft was. We were amazed because it was hovering directly over passing cars, but those cars apparently were not aware of the bright white light we saw above them and no glare from the white light shown off the cars or the road. It sat there for about 15 minutes, ever so slightly wavering back and forth along the length of the road, and to our amazement no cars beneath were aware of this bright white light above them. Then the light turned off and there was nothing where it had been. About another minute later the white light turned back on, but it was closer to us, over the river, about halfway between us and the bridge it had previously hovered over. This time, there were two more lights apparently attached to the craft. The big white light on top, a small orange light to the bottom right beneath the white one, and a small red light to the bottom left of the white light, just slightly lower than the orange one. All of these lights were round at this time. The white light appeared to shine like a light bulb, in every direction equally, and out of the middle of this appeared part of the light was focusing like ! a spotli ght. The glare from the shifting spotlight effect started at our upper left, then appeared to scan across us to the bottom right, then back to the upper left. I began filming the light with my video phone, and the light moved closer to us over the river. This was the closest it had gotten to us. Just as my 45-second recording ended, we noticed a pair of headlights behind us driving toward where we were, and we watched to see if it was a cop. You&#39;re not allowed to be in the park past 10pm, which we were doing, so we wanted to know if it was a cop. Well, it was. We could see the spotlights on it and the emergency light fixture on top. It drove up behind our car and we started our car and started to drive off, the whole time the ufo was still shining brightly, proudly displaying itself over the river. The cop followed us out of the skate park area onto a one way road out of the park with no turn offs. We didn&#39;t look back, but the cop&#39;s headlights were very bright and very close behind us. All of the sudden the headlights turn off. We look back, and where there had been a cop driving behind us not even 30ft behind, there was nothing but an empty road for about 125ft behind us. There was no where for the cop to turn off and the road behind us was well lit by a street light. That cop car simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night we returned to the same spot. There was that same light hovering over the same bridge, but this time the light was just slightly dimmer, and the white light attached to the craft appeared to be a pyramid-shaped bright white light that was rotating counterclockwise. Each edge of this pyramid shaped white light seemed to be darker than the flat surfaces emitting the light. Again, while it was hovering over the road it did not have the lower orange and red lights turned on. It hovered over the bridge for about 10 minutes, then the light turned off and it vanished. About five minutes after that, it turned its light back on, appearing on our side of the bridge, but off to the right above the tree line. This time, the red and orange lights were turned on again and the white light was too bright to see the pyramid shape. It kept the same elevation the whole time, but moved around very very slowly over the trees. It then turned all lights off and vanished again. About 5 seconds later, it re-appeared in the direction of the Arkansas river, but at least 4 miles farther away. It moved back and forth for about 15 seconds, then turned off again. About 5 seconds later, it appeared even farther away on the horizon, moved around for about 15 seconds, then turned off again. We sat there for about half an hour and it re-appeared between us and the bridge, over the river, but this time slightly lower in elevation to us. This was the closest it had gotten to us. The red light on the bottom began to slowly increase in intensity, then decrease, then increase, and back and forth. The main white light appeared to scan us again and the craft began moving even closer to us. This time it didn&#39;t appear it was trying to scare us off by slightly moving toward us, this time it looked like the thing was coming for us. My friend started his car, peeled out backing up while turning around, then peeled out toward the exit to the skate park area. The white light behind us came right up to where our car had been parked, and m! y friend floored it toward the exit to city park, as it exits onto Pueblo Blvd. The light did not follow us out of the skate park area, it just came right up to where we had been parked and we lost sight of it. At the closest, this light was about 4/5 of a football field away from us. The only thing we could think is that it was a military drone aircraft of some type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, this craft never made any sound we could hear. Both nights it was about 10pm and both nights were very dark with very little star visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/20/05 21:00|North Myrtle Beach|SC|Disk|15 seconds|Saw lights of rotating, saucer-like object off of coast.  Was completely silent, close, and very large|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47180.html|176|ndxe200510| Saw lights of rotating, saucer-like object off of coast.  Was completely silent, close, and very large<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend, brother, and myself we on our last day/night of vacation in North Myrtle Beach, S.C.  It was nearly the off-season and was pretty empty at the pool/patio area where we were.  We were at a table talking on the patio that borders the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT was a clear night and you could see stars, airplanes way up in sky, etc.  I was facing the beach, my brother on the left of me facing my girlfriend who was seated on the right of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two lights appear about 400 yards out over the ocean  (orange-ish in color) that looked like wingtip lights of a large airplane that would be flying directly at us.  However it was much too low to be an airplane and it wasn&#39;t moving.  I got the attention of the two others with me who watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A 3rd (center light) then appeared.  The object was silent and not moving.  Then the lights disappeared.  It was there for a total of about 5 seconds.  We watched the ocean, waiting for something to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4 minutes later the object reappeared closer and a bit to the left now.  It was now at about 200 yards (close) and it was not moving at all.  It was completely silent and you could see 3 lights rotating to the left (clockwise).  It had more lights but you could only see 3 at a time as the object was rotating in place on it&#39;s axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all shocked and my girlfriend who is a complete skeptic just kept saying &#34;Oh my God, Oh my God.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed in the same spot (silently hovering) for about 15 seconds and then the lights turned off all at once and it was gone.  It did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed about 5 guys gather on the beach after this occured who were pointing toward the ocean.  I believe they saw the object also but to my regret, I did not ask them about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know airplane types, sounds, and statistics VERY well and this object was not an airplane, balloon, or normal aircraft of any kind.  It was very large (about 20 yards across), silent, and extremely stable.  It was almost like it was looking at the coastline from the ocean, then left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, my girlfriend is now a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We unfortunatly did not have our camera on us so we are having a hard time convincing friends of what we saw.<n>

10/20/05 20:14|Gainesville|FL|Triangle|~1 min|Slow moving low flying black triangle with dim star-like lights|10/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47112.html|178|ndxe200510| Slow moving low flying black triangle with dim star-like lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out of my apartment to the sidewalk to get into my car and a movement overhead caught my eye.  It was hard to make out but the motion of the object was obvious- It was very slow moving and either very very low overhead- as an approaching plane- or it was absolutely enormous and flying at a normal altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first when I recognized the dark triangular shape, I thought perhaps it was a stealth bomber, but realized it wasnt possible as it was so low, moving so slowly, and did not make a sound.  Two guys my age (mid-20&#39;s) walked past me, and I asked them if they had seen &#34;that&#34; but neither had a clue to what I was referring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything echos in my apt complex, so it must have been silent or the guys would have heard it.  It was a perfectly clear night with the stars shining. The moon was just rising as sunset was only about an hour prior to the event. (maybe to help the ship blend in they chose that time to be fly so low, since the background sky wouldnt be as bright from the then waning moon)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object which was barely noticeable, except that it seemes the object had either very dim lights around its edges- roughly as bright as the dimmest stars you can see- or it distorted the background skyscape to conceal itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved due East and I watched it until it passed over the roof of the adjacent apartment building.  I actually followed it as best I could in my car since I was originally leaving my apartment to go to my destination which was also due East- but no luck- nearly got in an accident trying to look for it though!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidently, I have a BS in psychology, and am pretty even keeled, but when I saw this I was afraid I was having a psychotic break from reality brought about by stress, but I knew I had seen SOMETHING, even though I wasn&#39;t sure that it could be a UFO- the only other theory I came up with is that it was a hangglider- but there aren&#39;t any open fields around here to land- its pretty heavily developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say though, getting to read everyone else&#39;s claims, especially those that are similar to mine made me feel a little more credible- funny thing is I&#39;ve always believed we were not alone, but I couldn&#39;t believe I had actually seen one.<n>

10/20/05 20:00|Springfield|MO|Unknown|4-5 seconds|Green light seen hovering over south Springfield, then moving southwest at a rapid speed.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53835.html|180|ndxe200510| Green light seen hovering over south Springfield, then moving southwest at a rapid speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my school&#39;s marching band and we were having a rehearsal outside on our football field, it was around 8:00 at night and it was mostly dark, because I think that the sun had set by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our football field is laid out so that the end zones face north-to-south, and there is a set of bleachers on the west side of the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were marching in a way such that the entire band was facing the west, towards the bleachers.  While we were marching I noticed a bright green spherical light source move from behind the bleachers, form the west or southwest, and move northwards and upwards so that the light source was, from my perspective, north of the bleachers and slightly above them, I&#39;m guessing 1 to 1.5 miles away from the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light source paused for about 4 seconds, not getting any brighter or fainter, which meant it was probably holding its position relative to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped marching when I saw the light source appear.  For those 4 seconds a friend of mine who was also marching (he was a few yards away from me in the same formation), took notice of the light source and stopped marching as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 4 seconds the light source suddenly began moving away from us, towards the southwest, and increasing in altitude.  The source appeared to leave a small trail in the sky, most likely just a blur because of the speed at which it was moving.  Within about a second the light source was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend confirmed that he had also seen the object, and also described the things above.  If I were to estimate, I would say that the light source was about 80-100 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light source did nothing when it was hovering, making no known sound, not changing brightness, emitting nothing.  My friend and I seem to be the only people in the marching band that had seen the light source, even though it was plainly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have asked around, and nobody else claims to have seen it.  We have not done any research to find of anyone in the area had reported the sighting of ! the ligh t source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was one year ago; we didn&#39;t report this at the time because nobody else had seen it, so we dismissed the event as just an illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But recently I watched a TV program that reminded me of the event, and I asked my friend if he still remembers the event, which he still does.  We&#39;ve only decided to report it now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of our stories have remained unchanged, and we both can recall the event very clearly and mutually.<n>
10/20/05 19:00|Surprise|AZ|Light|2 hrs.|followed 6 lights in a circle shape|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47132.html|181|ndxe200510| followed 6 lights in a circle shape<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother, myself and my two nephews were traveling back to Surprise from Wickenburg on Hwy 60 headed east.  When the white tank mountains came into view, we observed three (3) lights (white) that looked like they were on top on the north side of the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for at least thirty minutes dimming on and off.  There were no strob lights or the normal plane lights one would see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived at my house we observed a large bright white light to the southwest of the white tank mountains.  This one was either much closer or much bigger than the other three that we had been watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbors came out and started observing the big light with us.  About that time my wife and daughter,husband and two kids came home.  My daughter went and got my high powered binoculars and spotting scope.  With these we could see is a bigger brighter light. It seemed to have a red glow around it at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother deceided to drive down sun vally parkway west to give chase to it as it was moving off to the west.  By now an hour had passed.  As he got north of the white tank mountains they could still see they smaller lights above the mountains still stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But now the biggest light was center of the mounatins some three or four hundred feet above the mounatin top headed west.  Sun Valley parkway turns at some point and heads due south, as they were now headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They started gaining on the object and could see 6 lights in a circle.  They followed it and watched it head toward the Palo Verde nuclear power plant.  They watch it for another 45 minutes before it finally fadded away.  I believe all air craft are required by law to have (strob lights) these had none..  They were diffently not flares, nor choppers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time in a year I have seen these lights over or behind or on top of these mountains..whats weird is we watched jets from Luke Air base flying all around but seemed to be oblivious to these lights.  I will be watching this site to see if others report anything?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter<n> <n><n> Thanks for taking the time out and speaking to me about this incident..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to add I am a Vietnam Combat veteran and have seen every type of flare.  I have shot off hundred&#39;s of hand held flare&#39;s myself while in Vietnam.  I know what a flare looks like and how it reacts to wind and other climates.. These lights were NOT flares.. Flares do NOT move horizonally at the rate of speed these traveled when they left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will send you a map and try and get asmuth&#39;s for you..  I spoke to the friend in Tonapah, Az, whom I called that also wittness the light but unfortunately he doesnt want to get involved..  But I still have his location..  If you can send me your fax number I will put together a detailed map and fax it to you in the next few days..  I&#39;am going out tonight with my camera and camcorder in hopes it will come back tonight..<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother who was in the chase vehile will collaborate this story and give us a very good line of site on the map..  He wrote down the highway marker as they sat watching these lights..  He also would not mind speaking to whom ever is interested in listening<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again..

I saw people pulled over on the freeway and thought it was wierd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 seconds later I noticed an army helicopter flying in a circle.  I looked straight ahead and saw a MASSIVE silver thing flying across the freeway from downtown towards the mountains.  This thing was shiny like my wedding band, and shaped like a cigar.  The helicopter was following this thing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It crossed over I-25 about a mile ahead of me, and about 1000 - 1500 feet up in the air and was about the length of a basketball court.  I watched this for about a minute, and actually pulled over and got out of my car.  I lost sight of it over Invesco field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DID YOU SEE THIS TOO?   I need to talk to someone that saw this thing too, so that I know I&#39;m not crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been sort of a skeptic but I SAW THIS THING!   It flew slower than an airplane and it had NO WINGS,  NO FINS, and NO PROPELLERS.  It was like seeing a cigar dipped in silver flying slowly across the sky.  What was it?  There were no lights or anything.  It passed in front of a cloud and you could really see how big this thing was.  I wish I had a camera!  Did anyone else?<n>

We usually just observe the stars and planes in the sky. Well, about a quarter mile from our house we were roun ding the last curve before you get to our house and to the right in the sky there was a bright red light in the sky. Now, this looked like a tower light but the thing is there isn&#39;t a tower in that location. We watched the road again and then my brother looked up and said, &#34;It&#39;s moving!&#34;. I looked up and the red light is flying to the left of us in the sky. The thing is, is that there were absolutly no blinking lights of any sort on this craft. Plus it was hoverin g stationary to begin with. Thats why at first we thought it was a tower. I was flipping out. I had never seen anything like that before. It is just something we saw and when I tell about it, som e people think i&#39;m crazy or either making it up. I hope I have another encounter of some sort where i can make out a craft.

Circular or Triangular Object<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out on my porch to have a cigarette.  I was there for about a minute before I noticed the object hanging silently above the treeline.  Out of the corner of my eye, I figured it for a plane, but it didn&#39;t move, and that&#39;s what got my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably a few blocks away from me, but hanging right above my street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a row of strobing lights, tilted at about 25 or 30 degrees.  The lights strobed very fast, from left to right, emerging from around the side of the object, and disappearing around the other side.  They were mostly white and red, with a few blue strobes near the middle of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way the lights disappeared made the object appear to be either circular or triangular shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hung in the air silently for about one minute after I noticed it.  It was still hovering when I ran inside to try and get it on camera.  (I did what I could, but I used the video setting of my digital camera, and it came out very dark, and I don&#39;t have the technology to lighten it.)   After I returned, and tried to film it, it began to slowly move southward, down my street it seemed, and then curved to the southeast, out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It frightened me when I first saw it. Really scared me.  It took awhile for me to realize I could capture it on film.  When I got my camera, I fumbled it around a lot. I was shaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was not a plane.  Two planes flew by later, following their normal east to west, or west to east paths that I see all day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was very low in the sky. Probably less than 500 feet above the ground.  It was close enough that I should have heard some sound from an engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also huge. I can&#39;t say how big, but from one end of the strobing lights to the other, it was far bigger than any plane I&#39;ve seen.  I&#39;m even familiar with the sight of C-130&#39;s flying at night, having lived for two years at the Marine Military Academy, right next door to the Confederate Air Force, and an airport that allowed C-130&#39;s to practice touching down and lifting off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object had a solid row of strobing lights that moved in one direction.  I&#39;ve seen no plane look like that before. It was not a plane.  It was also not a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing it COULD have been, besides being an unknown craft, is a blimp.  Actually, come to think of it, it couldn&#39;t have been even that.  A blimp would have blocked out the sky above the lights, and that was not the case.<n>

He was killed 2 miles from my house in a one vehicle crash.  On 10/19 his wife (friend #1) asked that we (3 friends) go to her house to get his burial clothes because she did not want to go alone.  We took my car.  The time there was somber to say the least, we reminisced a bit and left for my house.  Upon backing out of the driveway friend #4, sitting in the back passenger side said &#34;What in the heck is that?&#34;  Nobody looked because she has a drug problem and we never take her seriously.  Her sister (friend #3), sitting in back, driver side looked and said &#34;Oh My God look over the house!&#34;  I looked and stopped the car (in that order) and all I can say is the first thing that came to mind was &#34;Is that an old car?&#34; I immediately dismissed that idea because it was ridiculous and I continued driving.  I figured it would &#39;disappear&#39; but it didn&#39;t.  I came to a stop sign within a mile, rolled through it and the object was moving closer to us from the direction of Friend #1 house.  The object was not as high as a cell tower (I don&#39;t feel comfortable stating measurements in feet).  It was pewter in color.  It depended on the angle it was looked at, as to what it looked like.  After a while I didn&#39;t see the old car resemblance, I saw a futuristic car.  The car comparison is due to what appeared to be big fenders, like a 56 chevy.  The closest thing my mind could compare it to was the car in Back to the Future.  Its movements were as quick as a thought, there was no stall when it stopped.  At one point it backed up, stopped, waited and continued when we did. It was more of a rectangle shape than a disk at one angle.  Every edge was rounded and where there could have been doors there were no seams.  It appeared to have a windshield because the front of the object had a darker color in the area of the windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend that had died in the wreck had seen them many times out there as orbs and lights and triangles, always at night.  We have video that he filmed.  I watched some of it, I saw an orb but I&#39;m not sure what to think but he was definitely convinced it was abnormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area we were traveling is in a very rural area and the road from their house to town is narrow and winding with trees hanging over the road.  Most of it follows a bayou for the first 5 miles or so.  Then it is open pastures and farm land for 5 or 6 miles to a city of 20,000. I live on the opposite side of town so we drove through town on a four lane highway until we stopped at a gas station 3 miles from my home.  Then we proceeded to my house through farm land.  Through the entire route the object stayed to our left as we headed north and then west.  It was hard to see it clear when we first left Friend #1&#39;s house due to the trees but we could see it.  It followed us along the winding road.  It stopped when we stopped and we all commented about it stopping.  All of us are fairly cool-headed so no one panicked.  It was the first time any of us saw a spark of the normal Friend #1 in the past few days.  We didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or cry so we all started laughing, everybody found a cigarette to puff on and we watched it follow us for the next 10 miles until we stopped at the gas station.  No one outside of my car seemed to see it.  We were all looking up and while on the 4-lane I watched other cars and it was as if they didn&#39;t see us either but that&#39;s not unusual these days.  When we stopped the lights from the gas station were so bright that we couldn&#39;t see the sky.  I never noticed that it would cause a blind spot when you try to see past the fluorescent lights at dusk.    While we were in the store I remembered I had a dang camera in the car!.  After 5 minutes we started back out and it was waiting on us over a field still to the left, passed a bridge.   Now it was dark.  I pulled my car to the right and jumped on my hood with my camera and started taking pictures and when I did the dang thing started flipping literally.  It now had red, white and blue lights (we triple checked that that night).  I got one shot of it in video (I attached it P1010006.MOV), if you have problems opening it I can co! nvert it Everyone was moving around in the car so all the still shots look like slivers of light.  I hollered for them to stop and they did and that is when I got the video.  They were all freaking out about me being on the hood.  I guess they thought I may get beamed up.  After listening to coast to coast, I have realized that may not have been the smartest move.  The object shot up so far in the sky it was just a blink of a light so I got down and drove us to my house. When we arrived at my house we told my husband what had happened and he looked at us like we had been doing drugs.  We pointed it out to my husband who quickly saw we weren&#39;t making it up.  He saw the 3 lights and estimated it was 1/2 mile up. He manages road construction so I trust his judgment on the measurement.  It was higher now than it was when we first saw it.  Friends #3 &amp; #4 left and I offered to take Angie to her Dad&#39;s in Monroe so we could talk about what had just happened.  When we left, the object didn&#39;t immediately follow us.  My husband said the lights started getting closer to our house, so close that he went inside in fear of what may happen if he didn&#39;t.  After 15 minutes we saw it again while heading south on Hwy 165.  It was high in the sky (1/2 mile I guess) hovering.  Once I got her home I headed back to my house and I did not see it again until 10/19/2008.  I saw the same type craft in the sky roll out of the path of a jet.  To the day and the hour!<n>

I said hello but she faded away, but then i felt like i was being made to look at the open gap of my window big enough to let the cat in and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first saw what i thought was a normal plane until it stopped suddenly in its tracks and then traveled backwards and began to perform zig zag motions.  The plane then turned into light, shaped like a cigar still zig zagging around darting all over the place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i pulled back the curtain to take a closer look, the object changed shape again into a circle.  It was waving around as if someone was holding a flashlight waving it around in the air.  The light had turned a green/red colour and looked fuzzy as if looking through an out of focus telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i went back to bed the ufo turned cigar shaped again and flashed like lightening every now and then still zig zagging around.  The object hung around all night,  It was approx 25 yards up the road from my house and was about 150 to 200ft in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it first appeared as a plane, i thought it was low and moving very slowly, the plane looked a cream colour, light in contrast to the dark of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a calm night, a few clouds and quite warm.  I was made to feel the presance of the messia all over the earth!  I asked over and over what they wanted and they communicated with senses and feelings.  He/she is here!   It maybe the child I saw?   I can&#39;t be certain but the child guided me to see the craft which choose me to communicate too!<n>

It definitely had a mass to it and didn&#39;t appear to be something that was projected, as I could notice a bit of light reflected off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its movement was very fast and it almost seemed to move from one part of the sky to another by &#39;zipping&#39; along and then suddenly slowing and stopping.  I&#39;m not sure how else to explain the odd movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe in aliens or anything of the like but I know what I saw and I do not believe it was of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I knew it was no star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside immediately and stood watching it for at least fifteen minutes.  The larger craft was so bright I could not discern a specific shape other than round.  It was in the southwestern sky and appeared to be a couple miles away or more.  The lower one appeared round and either was changing from white to red or was strobing.  They seemed to be at the same altitude as a small plane flies.  (I do not know anything about planes or altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and son also observed them.  Other than the lower one appearing to strobe they did not move.  The bottom one grew dimmer but they remained in place the whole time.  I thought at first that they may be helicopters but there was no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching for at least fifteen minutes and they did not move, I convinced myself that they must be stars.  However, my husband went outside about 45 minutes later and they both were gone.<n>

Some very faint stars in the background approximately 70 degrees in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went to pick up and give a ride to a lady, she had watched this object off and on for a half an hour.  She pointed out the brightly twinkling object to me, it was then we noticed the object separated into two and at arms lengths it was approximately 6 to 8 inches apart.  The objects moved back together again.  This separation and merging happened a number of times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady went to her condo and returned with a pair of Bushnell binoculars.  This was then approximately 1:30 AM.  When looking through the lenses she was extremely ecstatic at what she was seeing and quickly passed the lenses to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light had separated into 4 parts, 1 large, and three smaller parts.  These structures were gyrating, twirling, twisting and dancing like a lariat in a ribbon like manner at extremely high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This dance continued over a small portion of the sky.  Each ribbon like structure had unequalled clarity and brilliance composed of distinct red, green, yellow and white sections. At the time we were passing the lenses back and forth, the ribbons coalesced into a brilliant luminous sparkling white ball. The white ball then formed the shape of a oval gem with subtle opal like colors.  It was extremely beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the gem state, the ball turned brilliantly white and sparkling again and seemed to rotate.  There appeared on the left side of the white ball high speed circular colored rotations of light.  From this state the ball turned into a state that looked like the top of a round diamond with thousands of brilliant facets.  Awesome!!  The gem and diamond states were the most beautiful objects I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next state the white ball started to fade in brilliance and the perimeter of the ball became extremely luminous and erratic as if it were rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouds came and the object passed from view as if had moved a little toward the north.  It was then 3:00 AM  *Other times the ball appeared to be a brilliant luminous sparkling ball of twine.

Then it took off so incredibly quickly, that a bird didn&#39;t seem likely either.  It also appeared to be way too high to be a bird, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not a perfect circle, but close.  No lights as far as we could see...as the moon was so bright that night, it just seemed black against it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time it disappeared (I&#39;d guess toward the northeast?), we were certain it was not a familiar creature to us, but something much more mysterious.<n>

The light from far away seemed to have another light that was flashing on it.  A person came by and said what are you looking at, so we stopped looking at the white light and looked straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a kind of black triangle shape with 3 white lights on it, and a red, blue, and white light. The blue light was flashing. The object made no noise, but looked like it was flying very low.  It flew into the clouds and out of sight after about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes after we saw that.  The white bright light was moving slowly, and the white light was fading and coming back.  The light disapeared and came back about 10 minutes later, then finally disapeared for the entire night.  There were about 10 witnesses for the far light that was disapearing and coming back.  I believe there were two ships, since another report from last week, described the white light, and when they used binoculars, they saw what we saw flying above our heads.  Only the white light we saw earlier was still there.<n>

When I looked at the photo, I saw a white spot in the right center of the picture, which I first assumed was a reflection or flaw in the memory chip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon closer inspection, I thought it could have been a lighted glowing object racing across the lakefront at a very high speed - which would not have been seen by the naked eye, but was captured by the very fast shutter speed of the camera.  It appears to be heading east to west, leaving a small trail of light in its wake, similar to a jet exhaust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took numerous other photos of the same area under similar conditions that night and some days later, but could not reproduce the object, whatever it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a full moon that night, but I don&#39;t know what time it rose or set.<n>

I saw that others saw this craft being chased by jet aircrafts and figured this was the day of the occurance. I will re-tell. I was doing a delivery at a resturant in New Jersey. I was on the side of the building at the loading dock. It was a warm fall day with a lot of puffy white clouds in the sky. I was taking a smoke brake and happend to look up in the sky, it was a lovey day. I saw to the east quite a few forming contrails from jet fighters. This was not uncommon on the east coast and evan more so since 9/11/2001. At first I saw three contrails all heading in the same direction coming closer to each other, then a 4th. then a 5th, and I noticed the plains making them. they were much lower then normal. they all seemed to be convirging. I them followed them to the point they would meet and saw the lead fighter jet. It was lower and much closer then the rest. It was almost over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is when it got strange. In front of the lead jet was an object. It was a very light pink color. It was as light a pink as the sky was a light blue. If the object were to have shifted color to as light a blue as it was pink you would not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that being said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was traveling east to west. The lead fighter jet was right on its tail. There was no exhaust coming from this pink object. There were no visible lights. It seemed more organic then metal. its shape is hard to discribe. It was like an hour glass with it&#39;s ends pointed, but the middle was not as narrow as an hour glass. It was flying across the sky and went behind some clouds followed by the lead jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited hoping it would come visible again and then ran into the resturant to find someone, any one to come out and look. This only took seconds. When I returned outside I scanned the sky but the clouds blocked any further sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we stopped for a few seconds, I looked up at the sky, which is my habit to do. At about 75 degrees up from the horizon, I saw what looked like a small star emerge from another, larger star...this was probably an illusion,as I believe the smaller object simply passed in front of the larger one. But it was this emerging that got my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought, &#34;Cool...a satellite&#34;, as the small object moved from west to east. I then noticed the quality of its illumination, which seemed to be more of a glow as opposed to reflected light or from an incandescent source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 4 or 5 seconds, as it moved at what seemed to be a believable speed for a satellite(don&#39;t really know, as I am not familiar with this enough to know for certain), when it came to a complete stop.  While stopped, it remained the size it had been (a bit larger than pin head), so I do not think it was coming more in my direction, but was at a standstill.  If I had held a ruler up to the sky along the path it traveled, it would have gone a few inches over a foot, in a straight line, before stopping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a second or 2, it bolted in a more northerly direction...this was at about a 30 degree angle to its stopped position, and moving at least 4 times as fast as it had been ( I say this as it appeared to cover as much space going in this new direction in a little over a second as it did when moving in the beginning of my sighting, which lasted 5 seconds).  As it bolted away, it never seemed to get any closer to the horizon, which also struck me as a bit odd.  It remained very visible, and then, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will draw an illustration of this event, scan it, and send it via email soon.<n>

I am an aviation enthusiast, and I am always observing things in the air.  Professionally, I am a ((deleted--media person, involved with cameras and production)).  One of the subjects I ((deleted--interested in))  is aircraft and air-shows.  In the past few months I have shot F-18’s flying at extreme rates of speed, Harriers going more up than out, high level bombers cruising at altitude, and, of course, the slower and more conventional vintage war birds.  I do this work as an officially ((specialty deleted)), not just an enthusiast.  I am not an aviation know-it-all, but I have carefully observed most known aircraft, including rockets and space shuttles.  What I saw tonight doesn’t fit into any known aircraft category in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out into my back yard after 7:25.  I wandered toward the west and I saw something streaking from south to north.  It was not lit up like an aircraft should be, and it was moving faster than anything I‘ve ever seen.  It wasn’t too far away, but that was hard to judge (maybe a few blocks?).  It was moving so incredibly fast that I might have thought it was an aberration in my eyes, but then I saw it slow down and head more easterly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every hair on my body stood up perpendicular to my body.  It wasn’t static electricity, it was the chills.  I was terrified at that moment.  I ran under the big tree to hide from it.  I stayed there for about 10 seconds, but I couldn’t stand it.  I went northerly to get out from under the tree, and there it was--almost due north of me!  It was traveling east-south-easterly at a more normal rate of speed, like a small Cessna would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were absolutely no lights visible, inside or outside.  I couldn’t see any windows or markings of any kind.  It was relatively hard to see, and even if I’d have had my TV camera with me, it probably would have been impossible to shoot, because it was only visible due to the bright moon that was rising to my right.  At that time it appeared almost like a cloud, sort of in the shape of an oval from my perspective.  It seemed to be gray in color. I thought the oval-like shape was weird, because when I had first noticed it (when it was moving very fast) it seemed more angular, almost like a long rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it paused when it was NNE of me at about 100-300 feet off the ground.  It seemed to stay there for about 10 seconds, then as it was getting larger, I thought it was coming toward me, and I got more scared and ran toward my back door (to the south).  Then I watched it from there for what seemed like 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the dog two doors down was barking, and that was all I could hear.  He is usually a very quiet dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object got smaller, or farther away.  Then it just seemed to get a little smaller still, and then it was gone.  It may have gone north or east, but I can’t be sure, because it disappeared very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked all around for a few minutes, but it was gone!  I don’t know how close it came to me, but it is possible that it came as close as a block away.  If it was a block away, then it must have been about 30-40 feet long.  I went inside to document the time, and it was after 7:50, so it must have happened about 7:46, and it only lasted what seemed to be a minute or less, but maybe it was longer, because I was outside for up to 25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very surreal to me, and I can’t be sure about that.  What I am sure about is that the experience was exceptionally unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary, when it wasn’t moving so fast, it looked sort of like a small cloud on a moonlit night.  However, it definitely went easterly.  I noticed a short time later that there were a few clouds in the north heading westerly.  I verified this less than two hours later on the Weather Channel when I was trying to figure out what had happened.  The clouds are definitely going toward the ocean tonight!  There were no clouds in that direction at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had I not seen it moving so extremely, I would have thought it was just a cloud.  I don’t know what it was, and, unfortunately, I was alone, so I don’t have a witness or a second opinion of any kind that I’m aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness via telephone on three occasions, and we deem him to be an exceptionally capable, and reliable, witness.  We do not know what it was he witnessed.  PD))<n>

As I watched the object slowly turned and headed in a westerly direction (towards Pike Peak)As the object changed directions it seemed to simply fade from existence and disappeared.One of the most striking characteristics of this object was its ability to blend in with the night sky.It seemed as if you could look through the object and see the stars and sky but you could still see the outline and fact that this was a solid object.Very impressive.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No she couldn&#39;t, so it couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter and it hovered low to the ground for about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister said she noticed the air kind of foggy by her house, at that time but nothing seen or heard).  It was a clear night so I don&#39;t know why it would be foggy?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway my husband and son also were looking out the window and they couldn&#39;t figure out what it was either, but my husband who always tries to make sense of any situation could not for this one, he knew it was a real object with lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden it moved off sideways and disappeared among the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out looking for it but couln&#39;t find it, we did see a low bright light in the sky for about a half hour and it seem to get smaller, but that may have been a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Which I will see if I can see it tonight because it was unusally large, bright and very low in the sky to the north.<n>

It was moving in that direction as well.  It appeared to change shapes when you looked at it.  Sometimes it was a bright light with a little splash of red in the center and other times it appeared to make a star-burst pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband outside to look and he watched for a couple of minutes and went back inside.  The object was just above the tree line (very large oaks in our region) and moved extremely slow.  I must have watched it for at least 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what I saw (it could have been the space station), but, it was very interesting to watch as well as &#34;spooky&#34;.   Whatever it was, was very large in size...located approximately 3-4 miles away from where our ranch is located.  I don&#39;t ever remember seeing such a bright star in that direction at the ranch.  The ranch is located in a remote area with no lights to interfere with the sky.  The moon was very bright as well last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a ((deleted)) designer with a B.S. degree and my husband has his Ph.D. from ((school in the southwest)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Mars.

We had layed down on the blanket and stargazing when I spotted a shooting star.  This prompted curiosity and wonder therefore we both searched for possibly more shooting stars.  The shooting star that I saw had tail and was falling. The following sightings were completely different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four different lights were seen.  They had no tails like the shooting star. The direction of travel was more across the sky rahter than &#34;falling&#34;.  They were very high in the sky.  They looked like moving stars but the speed was very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one was about twice as high as a normal jet but traveled across the sky about 10 times faster.  It was traveling South by South-East.  After crossing about 3/4 across the sky, it shot straight up into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second one was about 5 minutes later traveling in the same direction as the first but a little more eastward.  It was about twice as high as the first.  This one&#39;s trajectory was not straight like the first.  It wavered back and forth as it traveled like an oscillation wave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third was even higher than the second one.  It too wavered.  The direction was not southward but due east.  This one traveled across the sky briefly and then shot out into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth one was as high as the third and traveled in the same direction but continued straight and further across the sky before shooting onto space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four events occured within a time span of 20 minutes.<n>

I myself have never in the past seen anything like this or any other UFO&#39;s. I still don&#39;t know what we saw but it was really wierd and surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were having a smoke out in our back patio.  I happened to look out towards the west and saw a bright object.  At first I thought It was a really bright star. I said to my boyfriend, &#34; Isn&#39;t that a really bright star?&#34;  He agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more we looked at it we realised that it couldn&#39;t have been a star.  We&#39;re not too far from Vandenburg air space so we tried to rationalise the whole thing.  But then it started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the left of the bright object a flashing red object appeared.  Naturally we thought it was a plane, but the more we stared at it the more we realised that it was not moving like normal planes.  It would hover down then go up suddenly.  But naturally we tried to rationalise what we were witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red-flashing object was getting closer to the bright star object and circled it once and then quickly hovered away.  The more you tried to look at the red-flashing object it seemed to go out of focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to get my camera, and as i came back out both me and my boyfriend witnessed something that almost made us S*** in our pants.  The redflashing object stopped floating and became as bright as the bright star object for just a few seconds and dimmed out quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i tried to focus my camera on the redflashing object, I noticed another redflashing object that we had not seen before.  As I panned out to look at it, not through the camera lens, I noticed that it was THREE more redflashing objects higher up in the sky that weren&#39;t near the original one we initially saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to take pics of them and as i tried to fit them into the shot i noticed that they were traveling at a very slow pace in a triangular pattern.  One was all the way at the top or the point of the triangle, and the other 2 were below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say that I&#39;m not a UFO nut, never been something I&#39;ve been interested in, but this night sent shivers down my back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back inside after having enough of what we saw.  We really tried to rationalise.  After watching tv an hour later I decided to go back outside to see if anything was still going on.  When i stepped outside I was stumped to see that everything, the flashing red objects and the bright star looking object were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only had a disposable camera and the flash kept going off. i have yet to develop the camera.  I was really hoping that i would read any similar sightings on this site.  There is no way me and my boyfriend were the only ones that witnessed this.  The object was bright like a comet coming towards earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very scary, but I am convinced more than ever that we are not alone.<n>

Ive seen these lights all together 4 times. The first time i saw the lights was a while back i cant remember it was around 2000 maybe.i saw them about 2 months ago in december and there was 4 in a row and one would fade away and it would come back and and then 2 would go away and they would come back and they would never move until finally would all fade away slowly one time and faster the other times. In fairbanks we dont have any buildings past 15 stories so it couldnt be a building and the airforce base is 20 miles. its the same exact thing that is shown in ur video on your website. i just wanted to tell someone about this and i know its nothing new thought someone might like to know. and if they come back i can get video and better pictures. i got 5 pictures but there real bad and you cant see much . please contact me back .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights.

So I am guessing there were four lights on the object spaceed close together.I am going to say it was about a third to a full mile away or more. This is a very rough estimation of how far away it was. It was the brightest object in the sky even brighter then the star sirus. I also counted six to seven airplanes flying by it. Then it very slowley deceded down behind the trees so I dont know if it landed or not.I said it lasted ten to thirty minutes, but it is hard to guess how long it lasted when something like that is happing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/15/05 23:00|Schuylkill Haven|PA|Light|10 - 15 minutes|Amber colored lights in sky.|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61785.html|242|ndxe200510| Amber colored lights in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home late one night in October 2005 (around the 15th) with my family we looked up into the sky and saw between three to five circle lights high in the sky.  They were amber-yellow in color and were in a line-like formation.  We stopped the vehicle and exited to get a better look.  We heard no sound and the lights remained in the same location in the sky for a few minutes.  While watching, the lights would disappear one by one and reappear in a different location.  Eventually the lights all disappeared at the same time, vanishing completely.  The reason I am reporting this incident over 2 years later is because today for the first time I saw a show on the Discovery Channel which showed almost exactly what we witnessed.  Before seeing this show I thought that we had been the only people witnessing such an event.  Although the show is taken from 1997 footage I have never seen it before.  The difference from what we saw and the show was that the lights we saw disappeared and reappeared in different locations in the sky. Also, instead of seeing nine or so lights we saw between three to five at any given time.  I also witnessed these same lights at a different time and location while driving home with a friend from a band competition.  It was around 1:00 in the morning and these lights were in the opposite sky (east instead of west).  My friend and I did not stop driving but watched while we drove.  These lights seemed to be moving across the sky in the same line-like formation.  After I made a turn the lights were behind us and a few minutes later we looked back and they were completely gone.  There was also a third encounter with these lights on a different night around the same location as the first where I was alone and saw the same lights.  I was unable to determine if these lights seemed to be individual or that of one craft.  I have not seen these lights since 2005.  All of the witnesses are well educated and do not believe in supernatural beings which is one of the reasons we d! id not w ant to report until now.  I am currently a college student half-way through my second year pursuing a chemistry degree (at the time I was a senior in high school).  My mother is also a college graduate with a B.S. degree in English.  My father is not a college graduate but has schooling after high school.  My brother is a high school student preparing for college. Finally, my friend, the last witness is a college student.  None of us can agree on what we saw and do believe it was something very unordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Three friends, my wife, and I were on our back porch overlooking Echo Lake talking about the weather and such. We were outside, because we are smokers, and we dont smoke in the house.  Anyways let me explain to you what we all saw. It was close to midnight and we were out on the porch looking at the clear skies when suddenly, an unusual looking object (heading north) flew right over the lake. The object was a bright orange, almost yellow, and very bright. It was pretty low to the ground (around 300 to 400 feet) and it was moving pretty quickly; over a lake where it takes me a minute or two to get across with my boat, the craft flew over it in a couple of seconds. When it came over the lake it was pretty low, then after it got over the lake, it went up , not straight up, but at an angle, because it was still moving. And it wasnt like an airplane (which goes up in a sort of curve upward) This thing was like it went up quicker than you could snap your fingers and it was in a straight line, like it had a course to follow. We had never seen anything like this in our whole life. The next night we were at a local tavern in gleason and had heard a gentleman and his friend talking about something they had seen that night too, only a little earlier. And he described the object as being almost the same as what we had seen. It was a very strange week here in Gleason.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were talking, like we always do, out on their deck in the back yard overlooking the lake. We were all looking out over the lake. (my wife and I, and our two friends and their 19 year old son) Then suddenly, on the south end of the lake (near the boat landing) we saw this really wierd orange ball. We have talked to a few people in the area that we see once in a while and they have also seen an object almost exactly like this one we saw that october night. The craft really wasnt all that big, and it was very low to the ground. (maybe a couple hundred feet) and it flew all the way across the lake; from the south end to the north end. and it did this at amazing speed. I am talking seconds to make it across a fairly large lake. it was the most amazing thing. and then when it got to the north end of the lake, it gained altitude very very guickly. we had never seen anything like it before in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As he looked, I said &#34;that&#39;s not a falling star, what is it?&#34;   We both watched as a bright star-like light descended straight down from the sky, becoming larger and changing to a green (my view) or blue (my son&#39;s view) and then descended behind the tree line and out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching the sky and I looking for anything to help explain what we had just seen.  It appeared to descend less than a mile from us.  Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the roads in that area as I wanted to try to find the landing area of the light that we had seen.  We told a few family members that night that we had just seen our first UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went to work on Monday morning, I decided to share this story with a work-friend.  As I started to tell her the story, her face changed and she said, &#34;Oh, go ahead.  Tell me your story&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I finished, she explained that while she was sitting outside on her farm near Liberal, MO, with her husband, sibling, and in-law on the same Saturday night, approximately 30-60 minutes after my son and I saw the light, she and her sibling and in-law witnessed a similar light that they initially thought was a falling star that descended straight down.  Their view was blocked by a shed as it approached the ground and did not see it change color or grow larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both found it fascinating that we both saw similar and unusual sights on the same evening approximately 100 miles from each other.<n>
10/15/05 22:00|Seattle|WA|Cylinder|1.5 min|Cylindrical object hovering past my car at close range|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55742.html|247|ndxe200510| Cylindrical object hovering past my car at close range<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: Heading southbound on Highway 599, on the ramp just before it merges with I-5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a male, and was 37 years of age at the time of this sighting. I work in the printing industry and have a background in fine art. I feel these two facts enhance my testimony and illustration provided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed two stationary extremely bright white lights, side-by-side horizontally in a fixed position at about 400 feet above the ground, in the sky directly in front of me. At first it appeared to be an aircraft coming in for a landing, the bright lights being standard landing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several seconds I noticed two odd things about these lights. Firstly, they were a bit too far apart for an ordinary plane configuration and secondly, they were barely moving  closer to me despite my driving towards them. This clearly indicated to me that the object was in fact stationary and not moving forward as an airplane would do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed my car down considerably since nobody was driving behind me, and started carefully observing the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights remained in their fixed positions for a moment and then began banking slowly and steadily to the left, all the while not getting any closer to me. After tilting to about 45 degrees the lights began approaching me smoothly and steadily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights came nearer, the object started to pass me to my left at  an altitude of roughly 40 feet, and travelling approximately 20-30 miles per hour. It looked to be about 30 feet in length, and 10 feet in width. It remained tilted at a 45 degree angle the remaining duration of the sighting. The two extremely bright lights had now dimmed, or perhaps were no longer pointed directly at me and only seemed dimmer because of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it drifted past to my left, I got a very good look at it since I had slowed my car down considerably to about 25 miles per hour. At the closest point it was only about 50 feet from my car. The object was sillouetting the lights of the valley and the distant hills and dark gray sky behind it, revealing a distinct long cylindrical shape. There were roughly six white lights on the visible side of the object, with no particular order to their distribution and they were all rather small. The lights were in two slightly differing sizes, with the upper and lowest lights being the larger. There weren&#39;t any strobes on this object, or any small colored marker lights which to my knowledge is not the case with conventional aircraft. There were no rotors, wings, cockpit or audible sound. A helicopter would definately have some audible noise at such a close distance, and the rotors would have been visible. There was one large red light on the side and just about dead center, which blinked with a slow on-and-off pattern at one second length intervals. This red light appeared at least a foot in diameter and didn&#39;t flash, but steadily faded off and on. This red light was a perfect circle which appeared raised like a dome similar to a lighting fixture one might have on the ceiling of their home. There was a very narrow and bright beam of light emanating from the center of the object and aimed directly in front of it. The beam of light was aimed just slightly lower than horizontally. The searchlight was steady and appeared fixed to the object because it never changed position in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued off toward my left rear and floated over the ground at the same altitude, it&#39;s searchlight still shining out and onto the ground below and continued at a south-easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this time I have observed multiple helicopters at night in order to make a comparison and there are no similarities between any helicopters and this UFO. Please see my emailed illustration and map for more details.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend in the passenger seat was looking out the window, and then I heard him say,&#34;Oh my God! What the hell is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately stopped my girlfriends car.(we were using hers because my truck was out of commission)  I looked so I could see what he was seeing, and to my astonishment, we saw a bright orange, glowing object to the south of us.  It appeared to be very close and very low to the ground, also, probably 300 yards out in the field and approximately 200-300 feet off of the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the car to watch this phenomenon happen before our eyes.  Then suddenly it zipped to the west at an amazing speed, then it would slowly come back to where it was when we first saw it.  It had done this 3 times.  Then it started moving to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car and I  turned south down a gravel road and we could see it through the trees that it was moving a little faster than us. The object was to our right hand side and in front of us on the other side of the trees.  Then it began to go to the south east.  Then I turned left down another gravel road so we could meet it on the next road over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to the next road over that went north and south.  We turned to the south and could still plainly see it over the road about 1/4 mile ahead of us.  Then it crossed the road still heading south east.  We got up to a bridge and then started to go up the hill that followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there were open potato fields on both sides of the road.  We could still see it, but now it was &#34;pulsing&#34; orange and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came to another highway that went east and west, but we stopped to watch it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then right before our eyes, the sphere object took off to the north, and in the blink of an eye it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are very glad to have witnessed a UFO, because we may not ever get to see one ever again.<n>

This put the object directly over Laughlin, Nevada.  She indicated that it was visible since at least 2120 hrs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching the object until aprox. 2134 hrs. when it moved north east from its origional position.  At the time the object faded out and disapeared.  This happened extremely quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back inside at that time.  About 2138 hrs., her mother contacted us on the phone yet again and indicated that the object was back and was now much closer and moving at a much higher rate of speed.  At this time, I took two pictures of the object which unfortunately came out extremely blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, the object appeared to be in a large spiral towards the ground.  The object disapeared behind some houses out of sight and was not seen again.  It is unknown if the object made contact with the ground or not.  We left and traveled to the river to get a clear view of the area it would have landed, but were unable to witness anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a reddish color.  The size was spherical, but appeared to be attached on a pendulum in the way its motion was preceived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no wind present, so the lateral movement would not be plausable to move a flare around to the extend that occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can provide the photos if needed, however the quality is extremely poor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another issue that may or may not be related to this case is the portable phone my wife was using was acting up.  Normally, the phone is good at the distance we were from the base station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Air traffic was present in the surrounding area, although they were up above 30,000 feet.<n>

I was skeptical, but after repeated urgings went out to look. There were two stationary objects that were extremely bright and were lit up red and green.  The lits blinked on and off slowly then faded, then reappeared. I initially thought it was an airplane, but the objects did not move. Nor did we hear any sounds indicating helicopters.  There are no large antennas or anything like that in the area.  I have never seen this before nor since that night.  This went on for at least an hour and may have gone on longer because I gave up and went back inside.  Mars was out very brightly, but was in a different area of the sky.  I&#39;d like to know what that was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched this formation for three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small red blinking ball of light was leading a cross shaped object, and the third object was shaped like the bracket key on a keypad, flying with the two small appendages towards the ground and at its sides.  The cross shape blinked alternately red and white.  The bracket shape blinked at the same time on its appendages.  One blue, the other white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The small red object in the lead, blinked red with some white to it.  This small object also seemed to shine a faint white beam in front of it and moved to the left and right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew in this arcing pattern, the last object flew above the second cross shape and maintained this position for fifteen seconds.  The bracket shape then slowed below the speed of the first two, and sank back to its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last two objects were the size of a quarter at arms length.  They must have been at high altitude because i did not lose sight of it behind any ground based structure.  It just flew far away and became faint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky around this event was clear.<n>

No sound,no windows,no wings ,no trail .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the back porch at around 4 pm on a beautiful clear day in October of 2005. My house faces north and I was facing south and as I looked over my left shoulder to the east I saw an egg or football shaped object.  It was a shinny metalic object and from where I sat I could see the reflection of the sun on the rear end.  It had no windows,wings,stabilizer or anything sticking out. It made no sound and left no trail behind it and my best estimation of it&#39;s speed was 200 to 250 mph and an altitude of around  1000 to 1500 ft. I called my wife out to see it so we both saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Oct. of 2006 I was sitting on the same porch with the same kind of weather and looked east and saw a contrail of a very high flying airplne. It was so high I could not see the craft it&#39;s self so I went into the house and got the bynocuylars.  As I was looking at the plane this very same egg shaped craft flew trough my field of vision and was traveling very fast(est.3 or 4000 mph) on incline upwards. I was employed by a major airline for 27 years so I do know the difference. I have never seen this type of craft before<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/15/05 14:00|Thrall|LA||20 mins|I shirt-boxed shaped object flew over my house slowly and silently on afternoon in Thrall, Texas.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70119.html|257|ndxe200510| I shirt-boxed shaped object flew over my house slowly and silently on afternoon in Thrall, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was renting a house in the town of Thrall, Texas with several friends in Oct. 2005. We were evacuees from Hurricane Rita. It was a  very rural area, our nearest neighbor was the Lutheran Church in Noack, which I do not believe is an official &#34;town,&#34; but more of the name of the area. All there is in Noack is a church and a bar, and nothing else. The nearest decent-sized town was Taylor, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One afternoon, shortly after taking up residence, I was taking clothes off the clothesline, as we had no appliances yet. I was facing south, and when I turned around, there was something hovering over the house. It looked like a shirt box, like the kind you use to wrap a present. It looked EXACTLY like a  plain-jane, no-name shirt box. Nothing else. Just a shirt box. It looked proportionate to a shirtbox, and seemed to be hovering about 40 feet over the roof. It could have been larger or higher, but it is hard to tell with no reference whatsoever. It just didn&#39;t seem to be very high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at it for a minute or two, not believing my own eyes. There was no sound. As I stared at it, I realized it was not hovering, but very slowly moving from a Northeasterly direction towards the Southwest. The day was clear and crisp, and the sky was cloudless and very blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hollered at the other 6 other evacuees, who all came outside and confirmed the sight I was seeing. We stared at it a while, and the others  got bored, it moved so slow, and they went back in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it glide at a snail&#39;s pace over the house, across the side yard, and off over the pastures to the West of the house. It took a long time. It was very boring, I admit, but it just made no sense whatsoever, and I was fascinated. It never sped up, turned, or moved up or down elevation. It just kept gliding silently over the house and yard, and over the pastures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened nearly 5 years ago, and I still remember it like it was yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The object appeared as being tapered to 2 sharply shaped points at the ends of the craft, with it being the widest at its center.  The object was observed for between 3-5 minutes before disappearing into the cloud cover.

I told several other people to look up in the sky and they all agreed that it was not a plane nor a mylar ballon (object was shaped like a mylar balloon). Object was going on a steady SE course and despite windy conditions did not change course the way a balloon would in such wind. The Object seemed to be several thousand feet above the ground. It was sliver and flashed in the sunlight (it was a clear day with very high pressure, no clouds). It seemed to be rocking back and fourth as it flew SE, making it flash in the sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are in our 50&#39;s and are both professionals and do not drink nor do any type of drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This past Saturday night in Houston I was awakened at exactly 4:32 AM (clock stopped) by a vibration that was making our house vibrate and a single laser beam type of light that was inadvertently flashing into the living room windows of our residence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The house next door to our residence is empty due to a fire in the house and the owners are renovating the house but do not live there now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up and stepped over to the sliding glass doors that open onto the second level balcony of our home and peered out the sliding glass doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was such a shock that when my Wife asked me what was going on, I could not really speak, I could only wave her over to the sliding glass doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An oval shaped object, approximately 50 to 60 feet long was hovering over our swimming pool and backyard.  It was approximately 25 to 30 feet high and was putting out a golden glow from the bottom of it.  The craft had a very low golden sheen about it and looked almost transparent, you couldnt see thru the object but unless you were really looking for it, you could easily miss it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a type of shuddering vibration eminating from it that came in waves.  We both were in shock and were afraid to make any sound or really move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have several outdoor cats that are our pets and a dog.  Our cats ran underneath the wooden deck that surrounds our swimming pool and our dog, ((dog&#39;s name deleted)), laid down with his head between his paws and would not move nor lookup.  ((dog&#39;&#39;s name deleted)) after approximately 1 or 2 minutes raised up and ran into his make shift den area under a picnic table that we have in the backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was within 50 to 75 feet of where my wife and I were standing inside our bedroom looking out the 2nd floor balcony of our bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my Wife that I was going to run downstairs and take a picture of the craft but she became very upset and almost broke my hand holding onto me, not really making any sounds but let me know she was afraid that whatever was in the craft might come out to recover any type of documentation and come into our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it hover for about 5 minutes, noticed there was a dull light on the swimming pool and then it slowly rose and moved away slowly and in a trajectory that was almost straight up, the rate of climb would be at an estimated angle of 60 degrees at about 20 to 25 feet per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were up all night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning we went outside and the water level of the swimming pool had dropped almost 6 inches from the time of the incident.  That is really the only significant and viable impact the craft left besides the clocks all losing about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat up all night last night to see if it would return.

The lights would pulse on and off at irregular intervals. The sound could best be described as distant rolling thunder but very constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for many seconds and wondered what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the four lights began to drift away to the north (toward Lake Havasu City, AZ) together leading me to believe it was one very large craft as opposed to four separate ones. The sound also diminished in proportion to the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I asked a local resident (I was new to the area then) days later, what that could have been.  He said the Marines were probably performing night manuevers in the desert with helicopters.

I&#39;m not familiar with the area&#39;s backroads so I couldn&#39;t tell you exactly what mountain range or roads you would have to take to reach that summit.  Now at home, I can look at the map and say that it was north of Nevada Lake, west of Great Divide Ski Area.  My depth perception probably wasn&#39;t that great, so the object was probably farther west than that - probably at a distance near I-90 - as I later figured once I headed further west (but I&#39;ll get to that in a minute).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just remember rounding the bend and immediately having a gut feeling, after looking at the extremely large light in the sky, that I needed to pull over to make sure I knew what I was looking at.  I wanted to make sure it wasn&#39;t a mountainside flashing beacon for planes or an airplane itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered above the ridgeline.  So I thought, perhaps, that it was a star.  However, the flashing red and yellow or white lights were really curious looking.  Aircraft have rhythms, straight flight pathes (pretty much, unless they bank and even then it&#39;s a wide turn) and consistent light patterns, but this one did not.  It was sporadic and the red was flashing in uneven, non-patterns.  It stayed in the same position and did not move for approx. 7 minutes.  Then it moved right and then straight down beyond the ridgeline out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled back onto the road and headed west again on Hwy 200 hoping to catch another glimpse of it just to be sure - I like to play devil&#39;s advocate, even to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see it again and took a left turn at the Avon/Helmville cut-off road.  I drove down about a mile and parked to see it better.  It eventually disappeared out of sight, down over what seemed to be a ridgeline of some sort way in the distance (looking towards the Garnet Range (now that I&#39;m looking at a map).  There must have been some kind of ridgeline in the distance maybe covered by fog because of the way it disappeared.  But you couldn&#39;t see it with the naked eye either.  Once I head back that way during the daylight hours (and no fog) I&#39;ll try and see if there is indeed a mountain range there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the right of me (during this occurance, as I was traveling to my second location to stop and look) there was one aircraft flying which eventually flew so far north I couldn&#39;t see it through the clouds anymore.  Then about the time that one was too distant for the naked eye, another one appeared and went parellel to Hwy 200, then out of sight.  I stopped even further down the road, approx right past the North Fork of the Blackfoot River, just before Ovando and looked back into the sky to make sure I didn&#39;t see anything else.  Once stopped, I saw another three jets total in the time that I sat there.  I marked the time that I started watching from my first stop, but then lost track of the clock at this point while looking.  One of the jets was traveling quite fast and you could see the mist tail emitting from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whether or not these jets were military or commercial aircraft, I cannot say.  I thought it extremely peculiar that so many aircraft would be in that vacinity at the same time buzzing around.  I kept looking at the sky all the way back to Missoula and never saw any more aircraft.  And why not?  I was nearing Missoula, which has an airport!  Am I just a dork?  Or did anyone else see this and think the light looked peculiar?  I&#39;ll be curious to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

After my shower I went back out to see and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object 2:  Also silver metallic but was more like a small rocket plane but the wings were not large as an aircraft would be.

There was no wind that I could tell (no treetops moving. clouds weren&#39;t moving)<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was solid black, very dark black and had sharp edges but kind of &#34;lumpy&#34;. (not as if square or rectangular. Irregular shape)  It wasn&#39;t large at all (not like a craft) but larger than a hawk (fairly common in NW San Antonio)- maybe 2 or 3 times that size.  It was pretty low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this is practically IN the &#34;medical center&#34;, we have alot of helicopters.  It was slightly lower than their usual altitude.  It wasn&#39;t moving fast, KIND of drifting but seemed more to just be moving steadily. It wasn&#39;t even similar to the way a bird would &#34;soar&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only a couple of minutes (if that long) before it passed beyond the top of my windshield &amp; I couldn&#39;t see it.  I must have slowed down because the car behind me went around me kind of as if they were irritated.  When I first noticed it, it might have been about where Fred Rd crosses over 410. Maybe a little further south, but not much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definitely wasn&#39;t a bird, a helicopter or a garbage bag.  It gave the impression of being solid and had no parts (?) moving.  There was no sound above the traffic (which wasn&#39;t all that noisy).  I was located after Magic or Chambers Streets (side streets to my left- a short distance apart.) but well before Loop 410.<n>

Since that night, the dog&#39;s behavior has changed when he is out in the backyard at night, on his tether.  He appears to not like being out at night, which is a change for him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks after this sighting of...whatever it was, we have begun to experience intermittent episodes of neighborhood dogs going crazy and barking at no visible stimuli, almost on cue, in the evening.

The previous night at 20:05 (Oct 12) we noticed 9 amber lights hovering in that vacinity (see my post titled &#34;Phoenix Lights are Back!&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening (Oct 13), 3 of the amber lights returned at 18:40. I just happened to walk out at the right time and looked out in the same direction they were seen the night before and to my surprise they were there. This time I had my camcorder fully charged. I recorded the lights for 90 seconds until they dimmed out one by one. The lights were in a trangular formation....they seemed further away than the previous night. They also appeared to be closer to the ground than the night before. In my video footage (which I&#39;m making available to the UFO Reporting Center for visitors to view) you&#39;ll notice a plane that appears to fly under the formation of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The lights have been seen, and video-taped, on several occasions, beginning on October 4th, and we suspect that they may be flares in the vicinity of Gila Bend Firing Range.

I was standing in the backyard and smoking a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the sky &#39;cause of the fantastic star panorama and I could see satellites passing the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching straight up as I suddenly noticed a dark object in the sky.  The object was definitely darker than the sky and had 3 lights -- short flashing.  I would say the light were red, orange.  Difficult to determine in that short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked like a boomerang. The light were on each side of the boomerang and one in the front.  However, this object moved into east south-east (ESE) direction which is also the direction of Boise Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed with my eyes this object and it looked like to me that this object reduced of a moment its speed and speeded up again.  There were no sound - and no visible engine activities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was:  way too fast for a plane...to slow for a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The complete scenario last for approx. 3 to 4 seconds.<n>

It looked to me like it possibly could have come from a Vandenberg missile launch (I&#39;ve seen several of them in my lifetime out here on the West Coast). I called Vandenberg today and was told there was no missile launch from them last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran across news reports online today of the launch of a two manned spacecraft in northwestern China yesterday morning, and the time of that launch seems to correspond with the time that I experienced the rumbling and observed the contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked and noted my local time before I went outside to look around, and it was 10:00 PM PST exactly.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Four objects with red/orange &amp; green flashing lights sighted near Florence/Killeen area in Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband observed two sets of red/orange &amp; green lights in the western sky.  He became very curious and watched them very closely, when suddenly they started zig-zagging each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He ran into the house and yelled for the rest of us to come out, and by the time we got outside the one object that had been zig-zagging around the object farthest west, had moved due north and was stationary there over the next hour and a half to two hours, while the object in the west stayed there during the same time period.  We live out in the country, and it is very dark.   The sky was very clear, and these objects in no way resembled stars or any other aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange and green lights moved constantly and in varying directions.  At times, it appeared that there were &#34;bolts of light&#34; being shot between the orange and green lights.   This was visible to the naked eye, but even more so through binoculars.   This object moved very little, but over the course of the two hours, it eventually became lower in the sky and appeared to be &#34;landing&#34; somehwere, for lack of a better word.  We jokingly mused amongst ourselves that they were landing at Fort Hood, which lies in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour into our observations, our daughter shreiked &#34;there&#39;s another one!&#34;   We turned around and saw an object identical to the others, but this one was in the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that, my son thought it might be a good idea to check the skies all around, and we heard him shout from the back of the property that he saw another one.   This one was in the southwestern sky, was much closer, and much brighter than the others.  Neither of these objects appeared to be moving at all, but they had the same orange and green lights that appeared to shoot bolts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back to focusing our attention on the first western object because it appeared to be the most &#34;active&#34; one.  It was then that we all noticed that it appeared to be &#34;shooting&#34; other smaller objects from it, all just appearing to us as bright lights.  These went straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an aside, I must mention that my husband is a very skeptical man, but he was made a believer last night.<n>

The balls were moving very slowly in an UPWARD direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother lives about a mile south of Cactus Rd so I phoned her and asked her to go outside. Within 20 seconds, the lights went out of sight and by the time she ran to the front yard, she saw two fighter jets and one of the balls bounced up and down, and shot straight upwards towards the sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove around for a few more minutes but could not find them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within three minutes I called 1411 (information) for channel 3 news (KTVK) and reported the incident. The investigator there at channel 3 told me that there have been numerous reports of these lights all over the Phoenix valley tonight.  The news reporter told me they were spotted near Scottsdale, Apache Junction, and Peoria. The news reporter also told me that they were catching footage of the lights and that the 10 o&#39;clock news would cover this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:20 PM I decided to call the news station because the lights were not being mentioned. I spoke with the same news reporter again, and this time he told me that they did not get footage and there would be no news story.  He added that some reports noted fighter jets dropping flares, and after dropping the flares, the lights would shoot off in various directions or straight up towards the sky.  The news reported added that they get many reports of these lights, as many as two each and every day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s just something strange about this! These were NOT flares, NOT helicopters, NOT jet airplanes, NOT lightening balls, or anything else that would be easy to explain.  The objects made no noise, were amber colored light a sulfur street light, bounced up and down, made formations, and accelerated at high speeds.<n>

The lights appeared to the south (Over the city of Mesa).  There were 9 amber colored large lights. They were in groups of three.  Each group formed a triangular shape. They did not move during the entire event.  When they finally disappeared they just dimmed out. Tomorrow night I will be waiting outside at the same time...this time I&#39;ll have my camcorder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and he seems quite rational and sincere to us.  Moreover, he has provided high-quality video footage of a similar event, photographed several days later.  We have encouraged him to investigate the incident, to try to explain what the cause of the lights may be.  Generally, the lights are to the south of his location, perhaps somewhere in the vicinity of Gilbert, AZ.  We have corrected the date to 2005.  PD))<n>

The lights were a yellow color when focusing the binoculars and seemed all to be about the same brightness at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or so the most eastern of these lights quickly disappeared then after another couple minutes another disappeared leaving only four left still shining, then a minute or so later there were only 2 lights remaining.  These seemed to slightly brighter and then seemed to be slightly dimmer, then quicly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the seven lights that I saw ever seemed to move.  We could see the radio/TV towers east of these lights that are on top of South Mountain and it appeared from the angle where these lights are and where we were located that these seven lights were to the western end of South Mountain, certainly west of Central Avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From seeing them in the binoculars it was easy to see that compared to the radio/ TV towers on the South Mountain that these seven lights were not connected to the ground by towers or rope or strings that could be seen.<n>

It was a very intense, bright orange-red color and about the size of a dime held at arms length...though more oval in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could hear the craft for about 30 seconds more or so, as it was leaving the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise was most unusual and disconcerting.

It was not very high in the sky infact it ws just over the top of these tall trees. I was scared and i kept watching it to see where it would go. The lioght ws so bright it almost hurt my eyes like a big spot light almost all of a sudden it started to move but downward like it would land. Just before it touched the top of the tree it stopped. I got the feeling something inside was looking around for something. It made not a sound the bright light was steady never changed. It then started to move towards the south of me very slowly. When it got a distance away it just dropped out of sight. I ran inside and I did not go out the rest of the night. It was very eerie and I almost felt like someone or something was watching me watch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were directly south and at my 3 o&#39;clock as I was travelling east.  The lights appeared to fade and intensify slowly.  The lights remained stationary in an inverted &#34;check mark&#34; position for about 5 minutes and then faded one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1910 hours the 4 lights re-appeared in a straight line, again about 10 degrees and at about 200 degrees from a location at 231st Ave and Watkins Street near Buckeye.  About 1 - 2 minutes later, 4 additional yellow-orange lights appeared at about 170 degrees (just east of south) and about 15 - 20 degrees above the horizon as viewed from the 231st Ave and Watkins location.  These lights were configured in a triangle (3 of them) and the fourth was directly above the peak of the triangle.  These appeared to be very much like the grouping west of there in that thy also were very bright, yellow-orange with very slight &#34;twinkling&#34; (probably due to atmospheric conditions that low in the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes after the sighting of the traingular-pattern lights, the lights to the west that were in a straight-line configuration began to fade one at a time.  At about 1915, the traingular-pattern lights faded, one-by-one.  Approximately 5 minutes later, the 3 lights appeared in the same location as the traingular pattern lights.  The 3 lights were in an inverted &#34;L&#34; configuration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute, the lower light slowly moved to the west until it was in an inverted triangle position. Then the right-most light moved left (east) and appeared to converge with the remaining light whose position remained unchanged.  This configuration remained about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another potential sighting was made about 5 minutes later, but after a minute or so did not seem to be the same as the previous sightings (i.e., not as bright, did not fade in and out, and was almost white)....also one of the suspected lights we believed to be an airplane.<n>

I arrived home and stepped off my bike to store it in the bike room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happen to look to my south and noticed a light in the sky.  It was moving in some zig-zag motion.  This caught my attention so I watched further.  The light seemed to move in a straight horizontal motion till it dropped almost completely straight down with a slight angle.  The light moved fast.  As the light dropped it disappeared.  It vanished basically out of thin air. That was the last of it I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted about 2 seconds.  It moved to fast for a helicopter or airplane of any I know of.  If you ask me what it is I couldn&#39;t tell you.  I have never seen anything like it before.  Maybe it is something you could explain.  I&#39;m no professional in that matter.  I&#39;ve seen Unsolved Mysteries. I&#39;ve watched the movie Fire In The Sky.

I watched and it made several quick changes in alittude and course corrections-way to maunverable for military or civilian aircraft that I am familar with.  It moved in a WSW direction and took off at a great speed and then noticed a second one..both very bright-white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one speed off toward the mountains just to the west and north of Grantsville, Ut.

It was at a|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46910.html|324|ndxe200510| Last night, October 10, at about 11:00PM for about ten minutes I observed a peculiar point source light in the Eastern sky.  It was at about 30 degrees above the horizon on an apparent bearing of east by north from reference point intersection of I-26 and US64 in Hendersonville, NC moving on an apparent north-south axis across a roughly 20 degree arc, back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Range undeterminable.<n> <n><n> Apparent speed varied from about that of a high altitude passenger jet to twice or more, usually with the lower speed for a distance followed by a high speed burst of from one to seven seconds. The short bursts were sometimes a few seconds apart; the longer isolated bursts were after a time at the lower speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A passenger jet was crossing at crusing speed north of the area of observation for a speed reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no audible indications of power plant noise, and no sonic booms, suggestingit wws out of sonic range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observed object was operating in a traffic free zone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Acceleration - deceleration was almost instantaneous. Change of course was almost instantaneous, including 180 degree course reversals. Apparent altitude was mainly constant, except for shallow apparent dives during highest speed bursts. In the high speed operations, a hint of a wake or propulsion-generated whitish exhaust could be inferred, but this could not be confirmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observatons were from 2,200 feet in a residential area. A yellow street light was behind me. The sky was partly cloudy, but the observed area stayed clear until the end of the observation when the light disappeared behind an apparently very much lower passing cloud. Visibility was very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an engineer (BSEE-51, Southern Methodist University) who worked in antisubmarine warfare weapons, systems and tactics for 20 years including R&amp;D operations at sea. I held secret clerance, top secret clearance during the latter part of that time. This was followed by analysis of various advanced electronically controlled capital goods systems. I was a Merchant Marine officer (radio communications) from 1945 through 1950.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not want publicity. This is in effect a confidential report of observed data for those who can make use of it in a &#34;scientific&#34; analysis. I would be pleased to cooperate in analyzing this incident, if desirable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My engineering background says &#34;extreme performance aircraft&#34; in which case I have no need-to-know. The only other things I can think of at the moment are: 1) High intensity light beam played on the bottom of clouds or a vapor layer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But no clouds or vapor layer were evident, nor any &#34;beam&#34; effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) A large insect close at hand (erratic flight pattern and high rate maneuvers), lighted from below. But, no beam effect, and it would require high intensity lighting from nearby source - none observed). And no luminous insect display, no blinking pattern.<n>

From this direction, I know it is possible to see aircraft that are departing LAX and making their way into the eastbound airways, but what I saw was nothing like any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I was driving south on the road mentioned before and I noticed a small, gray egg-shaped aircraft moving very slowly across the sky and to the east.  I paid no mind and dismissed it as a plane leaving LAX.  But the sun caught the side of it and it glimmered very brightly, and this restored my attention in the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know why I decided to keep watching, but as I started to examine the craft, I noticed it had no wings; just a very shiny egg-shaped craft. It then made a quick detour from its&#39; eastbound path and darted up (north?) for a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next is the most puzzling part of my sighting; the craft then stopped in mid-air, and it looked as if it moved toward my direction, then it suddenly departed south at a rate so fast that it looked like it just shrunk (though I&#39;m guessing it looked as if it shrunk because it moved AWAY from me so quickly).  That was the end of the sighting.  It lasted maybe 10-20 seconds from the time I noticed it.<n>

The bottom was flat but not sharply It was shiny and seemed to reflect the sunrise in its shadow it was very symetrical, It was white low flying It shined the way a white airplaine does when you see it on the ground. So it couldn&#39;t be a cloud I thought, It couldn&#39;t be a plane from any angle it was just to big particularly to tall. It was heading west when I saw it but dissapeared behind the buildings.I was on a bus looking out the back window, I got mad and cursed the thing in my mind wishing to get a better look, sure enough it came back twards me in the opposite direction it was flying. It was very solid no lights or features front or back that I could see. It reminded me most of an igloo. Ive seen ufo shaped clouds, this wasn&#39;t a cloud, it was candy coated  almost just like airplane paint.  Did any one else see any thing?<n>

I was on my porch having a cigarette, when I saw 3 dimly lit objects pass directly overhead.  They were quite dim.  I would not have seen them at all, were It not for the fact that I was looking straight up at the stars.  It&#39;s hard to tell how high tey were, but I&#39;m certain they were more than 5,000ft in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These things were moving FAST!  They traversed the entire sky(from horizon to horizon), heading north to south, in probably 6 or 7 seconds, and no sound at all.  They were in a triangle formation, one behind another, and the third slightly to one side.<n>

They were not quite directly overhead and appeared to be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a loose triangle arrangement with two of them fairly close to eachother and the other one to the upper right.  Their apparent location relative to the trees seemed to change over the course of a few minutes and I gathered they were slowly drifting in a south east direction.  There was one point where the two close ones started to move closer to eachother until they almost appeared to be one object, and then separated by a few &#34;inches&#34; again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes I lost sight of them as they moved further and &#34;sank into the great blue yonder&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose they could have been balloons in a calm spot but they struck me as moving in a somewhat peculiar manner for balloons so maybe someone else got a better look.<n>

It had no color, and appeared translucent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, no vapor trail, and there were no apparent lights on or near the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not estimate the altitude of the object, as there were no aircraft in the area as it traveled across the sky.  It did not appear to be traveling lower or higher in altitude than a typical trans-continental commercial flight, but depending on the actual size of the object, its true altitude could not be determined.<n>

I also want to mention that I live about 3 miles away from Sandia/Lawrence Livermore Lab.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only a white light moving across the night sky.  The thing that caught my eye, was the fact that it was moving very erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know how a plane moves. Very predictable. This was darting left, pause, and then right, Over and over again as it was going from west to east across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe this object and all the other&#39;s that I&#39;ve seen are in the stratosphere and or near space.  It&#39;s hard to tell the size.  It all depends how far out they are. If you&#39;ve ever seen a satillite, it&#39;s very close to looking like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The difference is, when I was younger in the 1980&#39;s, they used to arc very predictably across the sky. These do appear like a dot of light in the heavens, except that these things tac like a boat would if you wanted to turn on the open sea. Left-Right-Left-Right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw tonight though was moving so extreme I felt compelled to report it.  If you&#39;ve ever seen any video of how these things move, you know what I&#39;m talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I&#39;ve been a Machinist for over a decade.

It was wayyy too close to be a plane and plus planes have blue lights...and then I said Ma whats that?  And shes like where?  And I said those lights, over there… Somehow I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane and not a sign or anything, I just kinda knew it was a UFO.  Then the 2 outermost red lights disappeared and the middle one remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I tell my mom to park our car in the parking lot already so I can get out and look..I was about to get out and was looking at the reamining middle light thru the window when it kind of just disappeared suddenly. It was almst exactly 10:00 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd sighting, the next night: (also 10:00PM)  Same place and time.  They looked pretty much the same except I think a bit smaller and some of the lights looked like they were falling?  This time when they disappeared, I belive it was more random.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3rd sighting, the next night: Same place, different time. It was 10:30-ish.  We were pulling up and there they were.  You see them from a distance, but when you get closer, you cant see them anymore, but they dont vanish because we pulled around the highway and drove back down the road to look at them again and they were still visible from a distance.  This time there was about 4 lights I&#39;d say, and they were higher up (so their smaller) and still red.  When you get closer, the outermost lights disappear first and then the middle ones.  I&#39;m pretty sure its a UFO now because I saw it very clearly last night and I have no idea what it coulda been; def not a sign because its the same lights but like 10x higher up than the first time I saw them. I saw it veryyy clearly, and it looks just like the UFOs you imagine aliens come in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly not a serious report, but we cannot be certain.  PD))<n>

I was coming back from mountainburg and was already in chester. I was heading &#34;west&#34; on old crossroads when I noticed a flash in the sky. My first thought was &#34;wow, that plane is flying low&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then when I looked back up I seen it was making a sharp curve just above the trees. I realized then that no plane can fly that way. So I did a u-turn and went to a spot close by where I knew I could pull off the road. I got out of the car and stood in the road watching this object. It was flying and making curves that a plane could never make. It would then straighten up and fly normal. Then it would slow down and wiggle from side to side. It did both the curving maneuvers and wiggling a few times. It seemed to move more of my way so I was able to get a good look. There is really nothing to explain cause it was very plain looking. It was oval shaped. Toward the edges of this object it got thin. Meaning it was alot thicker in the middle then the edges. There was no markings or windows. It didnt make a sound. But what I consider the most fascinating was the color. It was the most shiny silver color I have ever seen. It was amazing how the sun reflected from this object. I want to say it looked like a piece of polished sterling silver, but it was more shiny then silver. I can honestly say I have never seen such a brilliant piece of metal before. I literally had to shield my eyes from the glare. After it did its funny flying and wiggling a few times it slowed down again. I figured it was going to wiggle like it already had several times. But instead it took off like a bullet. It was so fast I cant even explain how fast it was! It took off in a northwest direction over the top of a mountain. It was still just above the tree line when it took off. It wasnt a large object. As a matter of fact it was rather small. I&#39;m making a guess here, but would say it wasnt over 30 feet long.<n>

Then all of a sudden it stopped and started getting smaller then it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

My cousin came in town to look at the campus and stayed at the campus hotel.  It is physically ON the campus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, the room was on the fourth floor and an extension  to the hotel was being built on the third (i.e. You could walk out onto the roof.  It was a really nice night so I just decided to go lay outside on the roof while I was talking to my girlfriend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden, I&#39;m laying down looking at the sky and I see what I originally thought was a shooting star.  So, getting my attention, I followed it with my eyes.  I noticed that it was not illuminated and not traveling as fast as I have seen shooting stars travel in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What REALLY shocked me was when it seemed to slow down at about 120 degrees from my point of view (I was laying down flat and it came from the North West, moving in a south eastern).  It was low enough that I could see features and at this point knew it was not a shooting a star.  It was brown in shape, ovular/circular, seemed to have a &#34;flower-petal&#34; equal outer indentation taking up it&#39;s entire base.  It seemed like it was spinning but I’m not positive it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But at one point it seemed to come to a stop then all of the sudden it shot out in a more prominent south eastern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I hang up the phone with my friend and call my mom and grandma to see what I should do.  Ok, so I&#39;m on the phone with my mom and grandma absolutely panicked and all of the suddenly, at a much lower altitude, what seemed to be the EXACT same object jet from the East back to a little North of where it came from before (directly above me at approx. 90 degrees) and almost came to a stop AGAIN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it jetted directly West after about 30 seconds of slow movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that freaked me out the most was about a minute or two after that, I got a bloody nose.  I don&#39;t know if there has ever been any connection between nosebleeds and confirmed sightings, but it freaked me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Searcy Police Department to report it and I never heard anything back from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s pretty much the story.  I know it sounds crazy, but I&#39;m not a loon.  I am an honors student and pretty well grounded...<n>
10/7/05 23:35|Orland/Tinley Park|IL|Formation|45 Minutes|Odd lights performing maneuvers never seen before near Chicago.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46863.html|356|ndxe200510| Odd lights performing maneuvers never seen before near Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 11:30PM, and a friend and I were driving down orland square drive in Orland Park facing westbound when we first noticed the lights. They were at the same altitude as an aircraft on final approach into Chicago Midway.  The two lights/aircraft came from seperate parts of the sky (one from the west, and the other approached from the southwest).  They met in the air for a brief second before beginning to perform almost perfect barrel roll manuevers (picture the shape of a corkscrew noodle.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 full turns, one proceeded to fly away from the other very slowly to the northeast.  While one flew off to the northeast, the other remained in the same location, moving so slowly that you would have to concentrate on it to not mistake it as a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever these were, they appeared mainly white in color, with a faint reddish flicker.  These objects made no sound whatsoever.  Even though we were approximately 3 miles from the lights, and not hearing them would make sense, there was an odd silence in the sky, I mean come on, there is ALWAYS a jet flying over this area going to/from the airport producing a sound from the jet, but during this, there was nothing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the intensity level of their lights varied thoughout the sighting, going from extremely dim/nearly blacked out, back to the brightness of say, Saturn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given our towns proximity to Midway airport, and being under several flight paths, from 11:30PM to approx. 12:15AM, there were absolutely NO commercial planes in the sky.  We were on fairly high ground, with an excellent view of all horizons, and not a single strobe or red/green beacon in sight for MILES around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an extremely erie event, almost identical to the skies the morning of 9/11 when all commercial planes were grounded by the FAA.  Odd lights making corkscrew maneuvers, no commercial aircraft in the sky 15 miles from Midway?? Something very odd was happening in the skies over this area tonight.<n>

They were constant lights at first like stars. Then they moved at different rates. One moved up slowly and then moved quickly across the sky with lights flashing like aircraft. Another moved up and stayed stationary. Others moved in similar patterns but in differing parts of the sky.<n>

It moved in a irratic way when I seen it sorta of wobbly then shot forward across the sky for a short distance then stopped suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it moved downward rapidly and stopped suddenly again then abruptly shot upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> fter this it shot forward again not as far as the first time but stopped abruptly again.  After this it went forward slighting then  arcing down very steaply towards the ground and dissapeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know if it made it to the ground because where we were we had buildings and trees in our line of sight and could not see the ground where this thing was at into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a clear shot of it while it was in the sky though and  personaly I have never seen anything move like this thing did.<n>

I noticed a dim white light high in the sky and figured it was a helicopter or something.  As I drove closer, I began to realize that it wasn&#39;t a helicopter or plane, or anything I&#39;d seen before.  I kept driving in the direction of the light, and I noticed it descending and approaching the ground.  I turned off the main road and headed East, but that&#39;s when I noticed the light was following me and getting closer.  As it grew closer, I was able to see it more closely.  &#34;It&#34; was four diffused lights, swirling around as if chasing one another in circles.  They did not have definite shapes, like lightbulbs would, but the lights seemed to swirl and liquify and move in inconsistant, constantly changing blob-patterns.  I rolled down my window and waved, and the lights caught up to my car and &#34;we&#34; were traveling side-by-side (though the lights were in the sky, and I was on the road).   I took several more turns, now onto a backroad, but the lights followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere along the way, one of the lights must have taken off, because when I looked back, there were only three lights following me.  I finally made it to my house and ran inside to get my roommates (to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us (roommates) went outside.  Everyone claimed to see it at the time, though now one of my roommates denies that she saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One by one, my roommates went back inside the house while I stayed outside and watched it for probably 15 more minutes.  I noticed it getting further away now, heading West and rising higher in the sky.  As it got further, the lights stretched and combined, forming a thin, bright, horizontal light.  Then there was a bright green flash and afterwards, the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked at what I thought was an interesting looking group of stars when all of a sudden the group of &#34;stars&#34; moved and I realized it was some aricraft turning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was triangular, although not as wide as the one I observed in June.  It appeared to be coming from the same direction thought.  It made an unusual looking sharp turn and flew over my street and kind of straightened out towards a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the camera up and the screen was on.  I kept trying to depress the shutter, but it wouldn&#39;t work for anything.  This was a new camera and I was really upset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got over the street, I ran to the street still with the camera up and trying to snap the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened very quickly and I didn&#39;t yell for anyone while i was running behind it with the camera.  It went very quickly towards the south.  Like the first triangle I saw in June, there was no sound whatsoever.  This on seemed to have light all the way to the fron point of the triangle and across the back as well.  The lights were again cream or light yellow in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared, I ran in the house and told my husband about it.  I tried my camera on the same setting in the house and it worked fine.   I really don&#39;t know what went wrong with my camera, but it was new, so it could have been anything.<n>

It shot out lights in all directions from it&#39;s center. The lights would switch from green to red.  I thought it was an advertising gimmick of some sort.  I wanted to drive over to where the light was comming from to see what was causing it.  The others who saw it, (my wife &amp; 2 kids, and 2 of their cousins, decided to go inside instead.  I stood outside watching it and the lights were red and they slowly faded away twards the objects center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object slowly flew off to the South.  It blinked red and green as it flew.   At that time I noticed another object further East and North that seemed to be the same kind of craft.  It was blinking red and green also, but did not shoot lights out from it&#39;s  center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my wife to come out and see the 2nd similar object.  I wouldn&#39;t have thought anything of them had the first one not shot out those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s the strange part.  We were having a weenie roast outside, and to impress the kids I shot off 4 fireworks. We were heading inside right after the last firework when we first noticed the first object.  I called the Washington County Sheriffs office an hour later to see if anyone else had reprted seeing these objects and was told no.  When I described the shooting lights The lady on the phone asked me if I was sure they were not fireworks.  The sighting ended about 10 minutes after I first noticed them as they flew out of sight to the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling stars, we suspect.  Just a guess.

At around 8 PM 3 of us, myself included, decided to go out on the screen porch for a while and eat dinner there.  I noticed a large red sphere completely still in the sky,  I mentioned it to my cousins that it migth be the planet mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We agreed it seemed much brigther than usual.  A few minutes later we looked up and it seemed much closer to us.  I commented that No planet could moove like that in such a short time.  It began to move again, slowly at first like an airplane then much faster similiar to a shooting star w/o the tail,then it got brigther and completely vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked across the sky to see if it had moved somewhere else.  We couldn&#39;t find it anywhere.<n>

I looked up to see a craft that at first I felt was an airplane. It was quite shiny but I felt that to be reflection from the sun as it was a nice clear afternoon. After watching it for about 30 secs, I was distracted by my dog for a couple seconds and when I looked back, it was gone. It was flying a very straight and rather slow path going E, NE  out over Lake Michigan. First thing that struck me as odd was that it disapeared before it should have judging by the speed. I should have been able to see it still, I only turned away for a matter of a couple seconds. Then I realized that I heard absolutely no engine sound. As I was looking up yet hoping to spot it, a plane did come my way. I heard the engine sound before I ever saw it. And I felt the plane was way higher than the craft I just saw, judging by size anyway. We also have alot of seagulls in our area, but as I watched a few of them fly around, it was obvious there was no wing activity from the craft I saw. It happened very quickly, and I&#39;m not at all sure what I saw, but I figured if someone else saw this then maybe they would post it here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thinking it was a plane since the Greater Peoria Airport is a mile or so due west of it thought it was a plane.  Just jokeing around with myself I said &#34;O look a space-ship&#34; and started laughing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then I thought that every plane I had ever seen in that area (and having been on a plane in that area)  They dont fly out of the airport in that direction but fly into the airport in that direction.  As I was coming up to the bridge to cross the Illinois River IT was just there in the sky about a few hundered feet off the ground.  IT wasn&#39;t moving at all.  IT had 3 very bright lights on the front that looked straight accross when viewed from the front but at a side ways glance it was a triangle shape with very bright lights that covered the whole back underbelly.  IT also had a red blinking light not as bright as the white lights though under the left side of IT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing that was very strange was on the back left side there was a huge yellow bag hanging off if IT.   Almost like a hot air ballon but smaller.  U could see no flame in it and it was very defined.   Once I drove across the bridge I turn it the gas station and u can see across the river towards Bartonville IL, and nothing.  I then drove back over the bridge and if was a plane I would of still been able to see it going towards the airport and still nothing.  What was also out of place was that there was alot of traffic in the air from the west and I believe the southwest.  We don&#39;t get a whole lot of planes in the air at the same time from what I seen living here my whole life.  Well to let u know to I am a believer and I am not someone who looks for strange aircraft in the day or night time sky&#39;s ever, but I know what I saw and others had to of seen it too since the Highway was littered with cars, vans, semi&#39;s and what not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  Very freeked-out.<n>

It however, I was shocked to see it so suddenly that it was a fireball dropping right next to me, aprox. 10 ft. away from me.  It was about the size of a baseball (reddish-orange) fireball when I saw it perhaps 10 feet taller than my garage roof (ranch) and the fireball was dropping behind the garage (where I was on a deck) and it was dropping about 4 ft. from the back wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the fireball was dropping past me, the fireball made a phisst and it blew up about the size of a childs soccer ball about 5 ft. from the ground, and when it pssst about 8-10 inches above the ground it just disappeared.  I didn&#39;t see or hear it hit the ground, however, I did see some small wisps of black smoke, very small, and disappeared.  However, about a min. later, the smell was pretty bad, very acidric smelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple hours later I went outside on my deck to sit where I had seen that shooting star, and although I didn&#39;t smell it anymore, but, it was so quick, I got very hit hard with nausea, and I had to go in to throw up.  At the time though, it&#39;s odd that I didn&#39;t even think that my nausea could have been caused by that smell, but, possible.  I thought I should mention this especially since for some reason I just wasn&#39;t connecting those events together, perhaps nothing, but then perhaps they were connected.  I was hit so hard with the nausea just the moment I sat down, and I was fine afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still remember that smell, it was nothing I really recognized, however, maybe a slight plastic smell, but, not enough to call it burned plastic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I have had only 2 other sightings in my life.  None of which compared at all to what I have seen on the dates of 10-05-05 through 10-07-05.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first night, I was stuck outside of the house (keys were not made yet) waiting for my girlfriend and her family to come back home.  We live in a residential area nearby the airport, and Malstrom AFB is about 10 or so miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:30 pm, I saw 2 shapes outlines under the clouds.. pitch black.. large boomerang shape, no lights, not a sound.. at arms distance, they would be about the size of my hand.  One was slightly smaller, or further away.  I have no idea how high the clouds were that night, but I felt they were close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think much of the sighting at first.. there were lots of large birgs flying south, and I had seen them in the day time, flying in similar formation.  But I kept my eye in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later, a few more went nearly overhead, no sound, same shape.. but these were not birds, or crazy hang-gliders.  They seemed to be going to slow to stay in the sky, but really how  can you know how fast they are going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that.. I saw something that made me scream literally... And cuss... just a bit.  A triangle shape, with two rows of lights on all sides came just over a nieghbors house, about 200 ft. down the road.. silent. Then stopped completely, and stood up as to show off... and sat for maybe 3 or four seconds.. and faded into the stars...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am surprized I didn&#39;t get shot at for yelling like that.. my heart was pounding.. and no one else was seeing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some more sightings.. and around 10:00.. the family pulled up, and I told them what I had seen. After a few jokes...haha, and unloading the car at light speed, I was out in the driveway again.  My girlfriend stayed inside. I ended up seeing &#34;something&#34; 32 times that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night about 16, and the last night, I stayed up until past 4 in the am.. and saw roughly 44 of these... altogether, a a few triangles, and even a circle shaped craft.. my girlfriend and I together have seen well over a dozen... and even her mom saw one nearby.. and well, shes not one to give in easily...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the airbase is nearby, but the people here say that the runway at the base is shut down, and they are flying out of the airport... Unfortunatly, I haven&#39;t seen anything since...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe these are not experimental.. and why would they fly them right over the city all night... &#34;Electric City&#34; at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have internet access my self, but I had to get this report down.. so I am at the library.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any other questions, or any other reports of this, please contact me .. I know others have seen these craft... unless the people here didn&#39;t look up on those days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have a great day!  ((name deleted))<n>

High thin overcast obscurred much of sky.  Object appeared slightly brighter than stars in area.  Object was in position when observer 1 exited building at 21:00 on 05 Oct 2005, and remained in position after observer 1 ceased observation at 21:48.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would remain stationary for periods of up to 30 seconds, move at velocities greater than aircraft in the area, and executed rapid changes of direction.  Object remained in area (measured by extending right arm and thumb)as 4 thumbwidths North - South and 4 thumbwidths East - West.  This area was centered about 6 thumbwidths due west of overhead.  The object was partially obscurred by the high clouds but did not illuminate them leading me to believe that it was at a greater altitude than the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other aircraft including aircraft estimated to be at great altitude seemed to be under the clouds.  The object at times moved at a velocity greater than the aircraft observed.  The object remained still whenever aircraft were near its location.   No sound was noticed from the object, but all aircraft observed in proximity to the object&#39;s location was observed to be generating their proper sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Movement of the object was observed compared to stars visible in close proximity, and compared to a stationary vehicle.  Observer 2 observed the object for about 10 min and verified the above movements and activities.<n>

The conditions that day were clear/blue skied/sunny. The object hovered over the studios about 25,000-30,000 feet. A military-type aircraft also flying high-altitude, flew past this object. The object did not move for more than two (2) hours. Finally, all eyewitnesses were asked to proceed inside Studio 26 to perform with several Hollywood personalities. The object was silvery and shiny...as the sun reflected this object to be seen by many of the eyewitnesses. I did not initially spot this object. I was asked to go outside by another person to observe this object. I have no idea if this object was reported by another eyewitness and/or if a report was filed. Because we were on location at Sony Studios, there was NO record of any filming relating to or concerning aircraft or aerospace films--especially at the altitude of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was moving about as fast as a single engine plane away from me and seemed to be at a high altitude. There was no sound. ]<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it in clear view and it suddenly dissapeared.  There were no blinking tail or wing lights, and since it was moving away from I know the brightness of the light was not any kind of head wing lights.  I watched cover about 15% of the sky.  The sighting lasted about a total of 10 seconds.<n>

This evening I was again walking with my dog but this time my little sister was also with me.  Planet Mars was very visible well above the eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 21:25 me and my sister observed an extremely bright Iridium satellite flash above the constellation of Ursa Major.  Five minutes after that I noticed a bright satellite moving just outside the left side of what the astronomers of the Northern hemisphere would call the Pegasi Square and told also my sister to take a look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of noticing it was almost straight above my head and was heading SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made this satellite peculiar was that it was closely (&lt; 2 degrees) followed by a less visible satellite just as when I observed it about a week earlier (I have no doubt that the objects I saw tonight were the very same ones witnessed in earlier report).  The satellites continued into same direction maintaining their less-than-2-degree distance and slowly fainted away about 90 seconds later well below the Pegasi Square.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also my little sister saw 2 satellites.   We both paid attention to the slow visible speed od these satellites.  The facts that these satellites behaved normally, that I observed this phenomenon twice within a short time, almost exactly in the same direction and almost on the same hour both evenings made clear to me that this phenomenon has little to do with UFOs, Aliens or Extraterrestial life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I´ve most probably been witnessing on both evenings is a formation of NOSS satellites.

It stayed almost perfectly level and was glowing a bright orange.  The intensity of the glow vareied to almost white at times, then to a yellow again.  Thought it may have been a helicopter, but no sound.....Suddenly just blinked off/ dissappeared. Minutes later, in the exact same place, saw what appeared to be a comet/meteor shoot from the same spot in the sky down to the right(behind the tree-line). Kept watching and 2-3 min. later saw an extremely bright light rise up from where the &#34;meteor&#34; went to the ground. It rose straight up and then suddenly chaged direction to the left-immediately.  It traveled perfectly straight to the left(south) and kept going until out of sight,picking up speed until out of sight.  No clouds that night.  About 25 degrees and no wind(maybe 3-5 mph).  Very quiet outside....Within 5-10 min., two helicopters where combing the area(very discernable) for about 30-45 min.  Lots of stars(very clear) and great visability.

The first night we saw 3 bright lights above what would look like Interstate 10 in Arizona. The lights were huge and were spaced out as wide as 3 jumbo jet planes. We saw them come out of no where and left just as they showed up.  No trace, just gone, like a light switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second night, in the same place at the same time we saw 4 of the same lights in a perfect diamond shape.  After about 2 minutes the shape formed a perfect square.  As soon as I snapped a pic (if you need it contact me, it is small, and if you know what you are looking at, you can make out the square)  I looked at the phone (it was on a camera phone) it was gone again in a split second  T<n> <n><n> <n><n> he final night at the same time, same location I saw one small light for about 3 minutes and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first night the media played of as Military flares.  The second night I saw the after burner of the Military planes and that is NOT what we saw those nights.  What we saw all 3 nights sat there, made perfect shapes, not like flares or planes, and were huge.  Then left.<n>

And it was very low, at first I thought it was a satellite, some times they do that and then then get dim again. And you can see them fly off in a stright line, but after this one went dim not more then 5 seconds later just obove where the other one was a secound light and it lite up and just as bright as the first and and you could see the other one below the bright one, both after they became dim travled North West and out of sight. they stayed low intill I couldn&#39;t see them any more, It would be hard to believe that no one else saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After standing there for and hour we went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back outside about 10 minutes later and the &#34;star&#34; or &#34;ufo&#34; was gone.  I saw some kind of dark plane with only white light fly by very low and fast to where the ufo was.  It cirled the location for about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all the planes lights went off and within seconds I saw the plane again at the altitude of a commercial plane flying east towards Georgia.<n>

It had white lights all around the side facing me and made no noise at all.  It was very low in the sky.  Not much higher than the large tree tops it seemed. It was dark and I was outside walking my dog in the front yard, when it went from one end of the area across to the other heading towards Madison.  Which a friend of mine spotted one out that way a few days ago while driving in that area of which he also lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the 3rd one I have seen in a months time.  The other 2 which were round, I saw at different times, first in Tunica, Mississippi and then here in Huntsville, Al.  I saw both of them at more of a distance and they were much higher up and these would zig zag briefly, reappear, repeat that performance and then disappear all together in the day light.  The 2nd one was over the Arsenal area here in Huntsville which I saw from my back yard!  I believe some of these ufo&#39;s are responsible for the illnesses that are going around this area at the time, this past month!  The first was like a flu but with severe depression like nothing I have felt or seen in others before. 2 weeks later there is one like a flu or bronchitis hitting so many people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shown a picture in a stone about 3 years ago that there will be a massive UFO hovering over the Arsenal area in Huntsville with a smaller round one coming out of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems there are good ones and then there are others, maybe a war between them will occur? &#34;War of the Worlds&#34;<n>

I took a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I decided to lay down on the grass to enjoy the warm sun.  We were at the new Hudson River Park on Manhattan&#39;s west side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed six lights in the sky.  I noticed they were stationary and were at least 15,000 feet up.  Airliners were flying below them. I was looking north at about 2 o&#39;clock (angle).  Soon there were only four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next 15 minutes I observed them, always stationary.  Two were bright spots, and the other two changed shape periodically.  One took the shape of half an elipse...Like a hang glider shape....pure light though.  This part is strange,...when I walked about twenty feet west, to the boardwalk, I could no longer see them.  I thought they were gone, but I saw them again when I walked back.  It seemed the reflection of the evening sun on the horizon and my location on the ground determined visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I informed other people lying on the lawn of my observation.  I took a picture using a 2 megapixel FugiFilm camera.  We couldn&#39;t figure it out.  My wife and I left after 20 minutes...they were still there. It was very difficult to see the objects in the photo, but when I did an &#34;automatic level adjustment&#34; in photoshop...they are very obvious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the picture there is also a dark object which we didn&#39;t recall seeing.<n>

The manner of how this light was behaving and how it looked, said to me that this could not be an airplane.  I told my fiancé which was home at our house 2 minutes away to go outside and take a look, but the object was moving away too quickly for her to locate it on the sky, and also with our house being surrounded by huge trees making it difficult to spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dawn but still the sky was deep blue and stars could still be seen clearly for about 10 to 15 minutes after the object had moved out of my sight to the east.  It did not change shape or color, but simply moved very fast over the sky in a straight line till it was gone.  The whole thing took about 2 minutes from me noticing it, till it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t know what this was, but no plane I know of look or act in the way this &#34;star&#34; did.<n>

Ranch Subdivision in North Scottsdale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awakened by a loud &#34;hovering&#34; noise around 4:00 am and after listening awhile, I went out back and saw the lights of a strange vehicle....at first I thought it was a police helicopter. The light that ended up being the front was green with sometimes a red light joining it.  The lights at the other end were red and white. The red lights kept circling in a triangle pattern and occassionally a small white light went off like a flash bulb. Once while in back, it emitted a white searchlight type of signal aimed my direction, but no rays or beams from the light. It hovered in the canyon behind my house for about an hour, making that loud noise. Then it hovered off to the West, hovered for awhile longer, directed that while light my direction again, then went way up in the sky. The green light seemed to be the front end when it left. It really made a LOUD hovering noise, much louder than a helicopter noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:  I just reported a sighting, then called the Police Dept. who said that it WAS one of their helicopters.  So please disregard my report.<n>

Appeared to be flattened round shape.  White, red, and green colored lights flashed around the perimeter.  Hovered at high altitude.  Moved very little over the period that I observed it.  Observed again at 5:00 am a good distance to the east, but at the same altitude.  The sky was very clear and the stars were clearly visible horizon to horizon.  There was no distortion or halo effect.  There were aircraft lights visible at some distance, but none in the vicinity of this object.  This is the first unexplained sighting for both my wife and myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were literally under the stars (no tent).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all looking for meteors when we all saw six dimly lit orbs traveling at a high speed from the north east sky to the west.  It was practically impossible to see they were almost under camofluage or changind colors to reflect the night sky.

When forst observed, they were approximately 175-180&#39; away and approximately 75-100&#39; in the air and descending rapidly in what appeared to be an undulating movement.  While most of them appeared to be about 9-12&#34; wide and maybe 14-18&#34; long, there were 3-4 which were larger; possibly 14-18&#34; wide and maybe 24-36&#34; in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After descending, they appeared to go into/behind a large pine tree.  At that point, we were only able to observe a greenish glow which lasted for approximately 60-70 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, they began ascending at a high rate of speed (faster than they had descended) and when they reached a height of approximately 200&#39; above the tree (which is about 60-65&#39; high), they suddenly disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While my wife thought she heard a faint &#34;whooshing&#34; sound, I didn&#39;t.   It is also interesting to note that there&#39;s a large Doberman who resides at the residence next door to where the pine tree is.  Although we have both heard this animal barking numerous times, on this night, the barking was totally different in its tonal quality.  Rather than the usual barks of a large animal, at the time this was happening, it issued only 3-4 barks and they sounded fearful...almost as if the animal was shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although we usually go out for air several times/week at around the same time and have done so for almost 10 months, this was the first time we&#39;ve ever seen anything. The following evening, we looked all around the neighborhood for anyone who might be displaying green garden lights; however, there were none observed.  We were unable to locate anyone else who may have witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI:  I am a former police officer and have been a professional investigator &amp; trained observer for over 25 years.<n>

I was driving at the time, and eventually slowed down to make special note of this object. It hovered for over a minute, followed by the objects flying off into seperate directions. This quickly told me it was not a solid triangle with three lights. I could only track one of them flying to the west which shot off at high speed. The objects themselves were all circle/ball shaped with a large bright white center. They all had small blinking red lights around this central white area. They were as big as a dime held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This huge oval shaped space ship was in clear view with my binoculars for over twenty minutes.  It was oval with white lights under it.  It stayed in this spot doing nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly two rows of lights the colors were red, blue, green,yellow,white,orange,purple and a florescent pink, the two rows of lights were going oposite directions on the bottom of the ship at a rapid pace.  The ship stopped its lights moving and remained in the same spot for over 10 minutes.   The lights stayed off, but the ship appered to be lighting up the sky above it.  This went on for quite awhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the ship started doing tricks.  It turned side ways and spinned at a rapid pace, I could not see the colorful lights but noticed all white lights and then it stopped abruptly.  Then it shot out backwards and started spinning at an angel doing the same thing.  He shot forward and back several times while still turning.  It was shotting out very bright lights in front of it.  (like headlights or it appeared like it was taking photos or warding something off)?<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes I saw another ship that was very far away and harder to see. This ship was doing the same thing in the direction of the bigger ship.  They were both lighting up the sky when they shot this light at eachother.

I spotted a swift, silent, glider-ike object flowing through the air at a very low altitude (less than 2000 feet).  It had 5 &#39;lights&#39; on it, in a zig-zag shape arrangment.  The lights were not spotlights, typical airplane lights, nor were they flashing.  They had a muted glowing quality, almost like a white/yellow glow in the dark look.  The 5 lights, I assumed at first were all on the same craft, but the far two lights wavered and moved closer together and then assumed the original shape again as it glided out of our sight.  It was very low and very large, a fist across when held at arms length.  We walked on, in amazement talking to each other and a voice on the path said, &#34;Did you guys see that?&#34;--our neighbor Alec had seen it too and he had planted his self down in the middle of the bike path.  He had noticed it when he said the 5 or 6 lights were seperate and only after they had moved apart and then converged did they take on the glider like/chevron shape when we had spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am reporting this is not only my interest and excitment for UFO&#39;s but also that I saw the same thing less than a year ago, I was also in Boulder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Boulder Municipal Airport the following morning askng if their were gliders up in Boulder County that previous nights, the man informed me that all gliders are grounded prior to sunset.  I am very interested to see if anyone else saw what we did and what the theories are?  I have a science background and consider myself an observant, relatively sane thinker.  This object was not a typical aircraft.  Most notably the craft was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not a plane because we watched as the planes flew pass the unknown light object.

I have pictures<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday October 2, 2005, I was standing by the window of my 15th floor apartment in New York, when I saw a ver strange object coming from the east (Queens), flying at relatively low altitude.  I live in a high rise on the East side of Manhattan by the river, and I have unobstructed view of the city, including La Guardia airport nearby and JFK farther in the distance, so I normally see all kinds of aircraft flying around, but this object caught my attention because of its odd appearance.  It was a dark, almost black, very big object that flew very smoothly without making any noise.  Its shape was extremely unusual, very difficult to describe, but it was not aerodynamic at all.  The only thing I can compare it with is a modern sculpture.  It was definitely not an airplane, a helicopter or a blimp.  But it didn&#39;t even closely resembled either the image that, at least mentally, we all have of UFOs.  It was not a bright-silver flying saucer, did not emit any lights and did not fly at great speed.  It came very close to my building and then veered north and disappeared in the distance.  I had it in front of my eyes for at least 3 minutes.  It was such as strange sighting that I even thought it might be a hallucination.  Amid my disconcert, I was able to grab my camera and take two pictures which, to my surprise, came out as sharp and crisp as my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to point out that it was a beautiful early-fall day, there was still plenty of sunlight, the sky was clear and lots of New Yorkers were outside.  I could see many people walking the promenade along the East river so they all had to have seen this object.  It was impossible to miss it.  And, still, no newspaper or TV news made any mention of it.  I have shown the pictures to all my relatives, friends, co-workers, neighbors, acquaintances, etc. and they all look at them in disbelief.  So far, nobody seems to have a plausible explanation for this phenomenon and even the most skeptic ones (I consider myself one of them) admit it&#39;s very strange and suspicious.  I keep these pictures as a treasure but I am willing to share them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched them for ten to fifteen minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirty to sixty minutes later I saw another craft much closer, approximately two miles in front and staying seventy to one hundred feet off the ground based upon trees I&#39;m very familiar with, which the craft was very close to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved toward me and the red color deepened.

Blinking blue, white, and red light eminated from this object.  A plume of light came off the object at about the 8 o&#39;clock position.  The object would irregularly alternate movment in a small zig-zag pattern, and a circular pattern.  Over an hour the object moved from north to south very slowly.  After watching the object for about 45 minutes it&#39;s brightness would fluctuate and then a second object appeard directly under the first, brighter object.  The second light was about 20 degrees closer to the horizon.  After observing the two objects for a time greater than 15 minutes their blinking and brightness fluctuated and then a third object appeared about 5 degrees lower than light # 2 and slightly further south.  The three observed lights would blink irregularly, sometimes sychronized, and sometimes independant of eachother.   The first light was by far the brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Basically the whole drive is on back roads, with not too many houses around just a lot of wooded country. About fifteen minutes into my drive I started spotting a red light that looked far away from me. I figured the red light was a plane or a tower of some sort, but I kept seeing it for the next ten minutes. This red light was not blinking or flashing just a constant beam of red light. Then all of the sudden it disappeared from the spot I was seeing it from. After about a minute or two the light appeared right above my car and it was following me. The light was much brighter now it was hard to focus on the road. I was trying to drive and look up at the same time. The object was maybe 10 feet above my car and I was traveling at approximately 40 miles per hour. It was hovering above me following me for about five minutes. The object made no noise. I regret that I did not stop and get out to get a better look of the UFO. I was scared stiff not knowing what it was. All I could think about was trying to make it home. I called my parents and my friends and told them, right after it happen. I was breathing so hard that they could not understand me. I had my doubts on believing, but this experience changed my mine completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I noticed odd flashing lights moving very slowly north. I was able to pull over and get out and for roughly 5 mins. I observed absolutely no sound what so ever coming from the object. I was close enough to tell that it was not a balloon or anything like that. It was moving at about 20-30 mph. and about 500-600 ft. in the air. The lights were white and a reddish color that flashed intermittently almost in the shape of a delta or triangle. I couldn&#39;t tell the shape only that it was close and very creepy as it made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

10/1/05 20:30|Napa|CA|Unknown|20 minutes|Dim Flapping Object in Napa Sky October 1st|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46895.html|441|ndxe200510| Dim Flapping Object in Napa Sky October 1st<n> <n><n> <n><n> On october 1st at about 8:30 pm I went outside of my Mom&#39;s house in Napa, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first what caught my attention, was a sound that sounded like a kite or flag flapping quickly in the sky...I looked up towards sound, and saw a very dimish light.  I watched for a few minutes, expecting it to be a bird, or a kite...but it stayed in same relative spot in the sky.  It was to the East, about 50 feet above the tree line..so it might have been farily low to the earth.   I then went back inside to get my Mom (63) and daughter (9) to have then take a hear and look.  Both heard it, both saw the dim light moving around kind of &#34;intelligently&#34; but also kind of random.   It seemed to stay in the original spot for at least 10 minutes.  By this time, I secured my LED flashlight and started to try the old Close Encounters light flashing...Hoping of course that I didn&#39;t upset what ever it was...but mostly trying to see if it would respond to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t.  After a few more minutes it started to move off to the East and get higher..at least higher so that I could no longer hear it.  I watched it another 10 minutes as the light moved, again in seemingly random pattern, and behind some clounds until it was no longer visable.  Near the end of this sighting I did see an airplane flying west to east ( most likely towards Sacramento Airports)...and I could clearly see the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a computer IT manager.  My dad used to fly P-3&#39;s for the Navy looking for Soviet subs ( when that was the treat!)...so I am quite familiar with things in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen satellites at night, planes at night, helicopters at night, birds and kites at night.  This was NOT any of them.   It was weird, but I don&#39;t think it was from &#34;outer space&#34;.  I tend to think it was either some new UAV that is autonomously roaming, or maybe some really weird birds (owls ??)  but it just sounded too loud to be a bird, and stayed in the same spot too long.  I have seen birds feasting on gnats and they move about differently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my 38 years, it is by far the only time or object that I have seen that I have been compelled to write about.  Did anybody else see/hear this thing ?  I guess it was about small airplane, small Preadator sized vehicle if it was one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object was too high to have been an airplane, and was flying at a much higher altitude than planes do. I then called my sister to come and see this object. She could not find the object I was talking about. As we were talking about the object, a V shaped hang-glider looking object was slowly moving in the opposite direction of the bright star-like object but at a much lower altitude, and was almost &#34;blended in&#34; to the colour of the clouds. It moved back and forth, then continued to travel Southwest. My sister and I both determined that this V shaped object was not a bird, because it was much too large, flying higher than birds do, and was &#34;gliding&#34; the entire time we saw it. We also knew it was not an airplane, because there was no sound at all, and absolutely no lights. After the V shaped object had vanished into the clouds, the bright star-like object was mysteriously gone, and a helicopter flew by quickly, going in the same direction as the V shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ist time it was up 75 degrees, 2nd sighting it was 30 degrees from horizon.  1st sighting the object was triangular in shape, yellow orange in color.  Same for second sighting.  Object turned on for about 5 seconds and then disappeared, then about 10 seconds later it reappeared for another 5 seconds and then disappeared.  It was a cloudless evening, stars visible clearly.  It was not an aircraft as there were no strobes of any time.  It was not a hot air balloon as it did not light up the balloon and no object was visible against the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I too have witnessed the black teardrop or sphere shaped object. At first I too thought it was a black baloon and watched it for a few seconds but then it occured to me it was moving in a perfect straight line (PERFECT) no sound at all and very smooth, I was looking west and the sun was still up , the object was moving from the south heading north. I watched this thing until it got to far away and out of sight but I knew that it wasn&#39;t a baloon after I watched it longer, I am an ameture astronomer and am always looking up. I have never seen anything like it. Sure wish I had a pair of binoculars at the time I would like to know what it was or at least get a closer look because at first I dismissed as a baloon and that is when it was closest to me......<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Sunset Blvd., which is a major thoroughfare here, I happened to look skyward and my eyes got focused on  something unusual. I indicated the direction of what I am seeing to the man I was talking to to find out if he can also see it. He tried a couple but could not perhaps due to some eye problem, he did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I somewhat ran to a parked care quite nearby to assertain if they can see what I am seeing. Again I indicated the located and sure enough, they can see them. At first, I saw simultaneously a solitary whitish disk and a couple, and later a 4th one. They are at an altitude that makes them look like US quarter coins. They are in a formation like a big letter T on its sides. They are slightly changing formation with the middle craft slightly moving to the solitary craft and then forming a big arrow. As soon as the couple say them, they were trying to capture it with their camera phone. (I did not know if they were able to photo it). The couple were also commenting that the crafts seem to be moving when they are in formation--like they are rotating or vibrating. Laster on, the arrowhead formed into an equilateral triangle that slowly rotated and at one time stopped as an arrowhead. And then it formed a W on its side with the angles maintaning a 60 degree angle. Later on they disappeared and later on a couple reappeared at a higher altitude until I could not see them again anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Footnote: Am a middle-aged man who works as a Market&#39;g Ex for a small med. vocational school where I had the sighting. The couple in the car where from late twenties to early 30&#39;s. The woman was born in Mexico but grew up in So. Cal. and interestingly enough, she told me of a close encounter when she was 12 together with her Mom, sister and their neighbors. She described of quite huge crafts emitting different lights that hovered low above their houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The male of the couple, at the moment this was happening, phoned to inform his mother. Then he informed a couple youngsters who were crossing the street about the UFOs. So there were not much people really at the exact vicinity where we had the sighting though it could get busy at other times.<n>

Whatever this craft may be, or wherever it came from I strongly suspect that it isn&#39;t an airbreather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been skeptical of most UFO reports until now.

10/1/05 09:30|Albuquerque|NM|Disk|10 minutes|Two blue pinpoints of light merge onto one silver disk.|10/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46961.html|451|ndxe200510| Two blue pinpoints of light merge onto one silver disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday morning at 9:30 AM October 1, 2005, with unlimited visibility on the far east side of Albuquerque, I observed what appeared to be a weather balloon approximately seventy degrees in elevation (not quite overhead) traveling at a slow rate of speed from NW to SE.  In the past I have observed 10-15 weather balloons released from Ft. Sumner, NM or Pasadena, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately I noticed two things which drew my attention to this object. The rate of travel to the SE was slow but much faster than any any previously observed weather balloon.  And the color of the object was brilliant silver as if reflecting sunlight from polished chrome, whereas weather balloons appear to reflect a dull white, almost beige, color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I ran back in to the house to retrieve my 7x35 binoculars, I called out to tell my roommate to have a look.  As I was observing the spherical disk, now stationary, through my binoculars, I noticed what appeared to be a long, thin, silver antenna-like rod, three to four disk diameters in length extended from the top side of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total estimated NW to SE distance the object traversed from initial sighting to stationary point was approximately 25 degrees (one palm width at arm&#39;s length equal to 10 degrees).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time, my roommate asked if I could see the two blue objects approaching the disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I handed the binoculars to my roommate, I then saw two bright blue pinpoints (not disks) of light slowly approaching the disk, also traveling NW to SE.  Initially, the distance from the blue lights to the object was approximately 35 degrees, the spacing between the two blue lights varying from 10 degrees, then closing to 5 degrees, then opening again to 15 degrees of separation and finally converging on the silver object with very little spacing between the two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closest of the two blue lights moved to the left side of the silver object and became stationary approximately 2 to 3 degrees from the silver object.  The second blue light became stationary approximately 5 degrees to the right of the silver object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After one minute of observing these three objects, the two blue lights disappeared as they converged onto the silver disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately thereafter, the silver object, with no observable acceleration, silently moved off to the NE at the rate of speed equal to two or three times a jet airliner traverses the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, myself, have been &#34;watching the stars&#34; all of my life.  I have observed and photographed several solar eclipses, as well as many lunar eclipses and meteor showers.  A school I attended loaned me their 9 1/2 reflector telescope for the summer (not only is astronomy the oldest science...astronomy is considered &#39;the beautiful science&#39;).  It was an opportunity to teach the children of the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working night shift for four years at a small airport on top of a dark mesa ten miles west of the city, I observed several fireballs and the last successful re-entry of the Shuttle (to repair the Hubble telescope) before its final tragic flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommate works at Sandia Labs generating software language for satellites.<n>

I was told to look to the NE of my location and sure enough there were 3 red lights in a triangle formation hovering to the NNE of me. I watched them for a few seconds and ran back in the house to get my binoculars. By the time I came back out (@20 seconds) they were out of view. My family member said they moved out of her view too, heading E.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These appeared to be of the same intense red color and formation except maybe they were a little brighter and slightly larger this time as compared to the ones I witnessd last year on Oct. 31st.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am trying to convince this family member and members of her immediate family to send in a report. I was told that they saw these lights earlier in the evening, only briefly though, at @ 11:00 PM Friday night Sept. 30th. When they called me at 1:10 Saturday morning Oct. 1st, they were already viewing this second event for awhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.

I too saw a meteor in the NW sky @ 70 degree angle from the horizon while the lights were visible.  At that time, and even now, I think it was just coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was another report that really got my attention, it was from New Lenox IL.  The individual stated that he saw 3 star light or satellite colored objects in the sky during the evening of 9/30/05 and that he never saw anything like that.  As a point of interest, I referenced in a report that I posted after witnessing the 10/31/04 lights over Tinley, that I saw a triangle formation of satellite looking lights fly directly over my house during the 8/21/04 red light sighting over Tinley.  Interesting thing is I was unaware of the red lights at the time and didn&#39;t find out about 8/21/04 sighting of the red lights untill the 10/31/04 incident.  Food for thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will probably file a separate report about an interesting object/light I seen last evening on the way to work.

This seemed to be worth getting up for, especially since I was watching Casino on the Bravo network.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother is located in Oak Forest approximately 20 minuted from where I am in Evergreen Park.  Oak Forest, being farther from Chicago has alot less light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when I walked outside, the first thing I noticed was all of the celestial objects I could observe when I look up; 75-90  degrees in the sky.   However, I was not outside to stare at Ursa Minor and Venus; I was looking for red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my brother where the lights were, he did a bad job describing where they were so I just looked toward his apartment (South) and then turned my head away from the apartment (east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw what he was talking about, two red lights just sitting in the sky at a 45 degree angle from my vantage point, no movement at all.  It took me about 5 secs to come to the conclusion that I could not create a rational explanation for what the lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart fell into my stomach and my feet toward my house; I knew I had to get my digital camera.  I was back outside in about a minute.  I tried to take a picture but the battery in the camera was drained of power because it has to sit in the charger not the camera and has been in the camera for about two weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for maybe two more minutes before it just faded.  I have never seen anything like this, I could rule out the following as explanations: helicopter (never heard of a silent helicopter), satellite (satellites actually move).  It was not a plasma flare because these were lights on an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was it an airplane?  No, it was not because of the same reason it was not a satellite, they actually move.

They flickered much like a star or planet from atmospheric interference.  I didnt notice any constant pattern it was very infrequent and sometimes.. flickered like some one playing with a light switch rather than atmosphere interuption.they seem to be traveling east north east and there foward momentum seemed very un uniformed.  I woke my sixteen year old daughter up to witness this with me..  I even called my brother n law…  He didnt observe them however my daughter did..at about a twenty degrees past the north star the lights took a more North East  direction and when they did this the last trailing light seem to go out..  however this is probably due to the overpowering lights of chicago on the horizon..

We saw directly West of us, about 40 degrees above the horizon.  We do not know how long they had been in the sky before we saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving directly East (090 heading) slowly.  It was difficult to tell if they were moving at first.  The lights were the brightest objects in the sky, the moon was not visible.  They did not light up the sky, but they were much brighter than any stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to see stars between the lights, verifying that it was not one large craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw between 3-4 shooting stars in the general vicinity of the lights, which is odd for a suburb this close to Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One light disappeared at about  70 degrees above the West horizon.  They passed directly overhead, then a second disappeared at roughly 70 degrees above the East horizon.  The final one disappeared about about 45 degrees above the East horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights passed us over in complete silence.  The event lasted approximatley 15 minutes.

Not any civilian aircraft, which have red/green nav lights, and usually strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed was very difficult to judge, because altitude was difficult to judge.

The remaining two light moved closer to each other, and then farther away from each for a few minutes. AS they were altering their positions, they did not move in straight lines.  It looked as if the were hovering, as opposed to how an airplane moves(straight line).  The lights then appeared to signal each other by flickering.

I do not know how long previous to that they had been visible.  I was advised of the lights by a family member who had just arrived home by automobile.  The lights had been visible to the family member while driving east on 151st St. between Route 45 and 94th Ave. (approximately 5/8th mile north and ¼ mile west of and 5 minutes from home).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following are my observations:  The three lights were approximately 40 degrees above the eastern horizon.

With my left hand and arm fully outstretched, when the south (or right) light was lined up along the right edge of my pointer finger, the north (or left) light was lined up with the left edge of my middle finger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The southernmost of the three lights was due east.  The northernmost light was about the same distance north  of due east as Betelgeuse was south of due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were of a brightness similar to that of the anti-collision lights seen on commercial broadcast antennas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was similar to that of the red LED on the tape recorder I was later making notes into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The planet Mars was much higher in the sky, almost due south and almost overhead.  The lights were much brighter and much, much redder than Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights pulsated, meaning the brightness varied, but did not disappear.   Pulsation was independent of other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were equidistant from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From a drawing I made during the sighting, the lights were at an angle of about 45 degrees from the horizontal with the south light being the “high” light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first sighted the lights, the middle light was slightly out of line with the other two lights, being slightly above an imaginary line drawn between the two outer lights.

I am very familiar with the commercial air traffic in this area due to our being under one of the approach paths to Chicago Midway airport.  What was unusual was the altitude of the aircraft.   The aircraft was at the low altitude that I normally see inbound craft at while in the approach pattern to Midway.   The aircraft was heading south, away from Midway.   Southbound craft are normally much higher in the sky and under full power.   Perhaps he had been asked to tale a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was exceptionally clear.

10/1/05 00:55|Midlothian/Posen|IL|Light|10-15 minutes|3 pulsing red lights in triangular formation over Midlothian & Posen, IL...One by one they flicker out and dissappear.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46733.html|480|ndxe200510| 3 pulsing red lights in triangular formation over Midlothian &amp; Posen, IL...One by one they flicker out and dissappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the early morning hour of October 1, 2005, my friends and I were traveling from White Castle&#39;s in Midlothian, IL to our friend&#39;s house in Posen, IL.  My friend and I pulled up into her driveway and the rest of our friends parked on the street.  As we were walking up to enter her house, our one friends who had parked on the street called for us to come over by him.  The rest of our friends were looking up to the sky and when we finally made it over by them, we saw what they saw.  3 pulsing red lights that were in a triangular shape in the western sky.  They were not moving fast and almost seemed to be hovering, while staying in that exact formation.  It was something you would see out of a movie.  At first I thought they were lights on towers or something, but they obviously were not.  My friend instantly called our one friend who had gone home instead and he went out into his yard and saw the same thing as we did.  He also called his brother who went out right away and saw the triangular formation of red lights as well.  I watched them for a little bit and ran inside with my friend.  We looked out her back bedroom window and we could still see them in the sky.  I went to the bathroom and then called my parents while I was still inside the house.  I described to them what I saw and I told them to go outside.  They were looking in the west, but said that they found them to be in the east sky.  And that there were only two pulsing red lights now.  I thought that was odd, because I saw three, so I went outside and looked to the western sky where I originally had seen the triangular formation.  They were not there.  I looked over at my friends and they were all looking straight above into the sky.  In the time that I was in the house they had moved to directly above where we were standing.  I asked my friends what happened to the third light and they said that it had gone out!!  About this time one of our friends called the Midlothian Police non-emergency number.  He said he had to report something he saw, and before finishing the statement, the dispatcher asked if it was the three red lights in the sky.  They said that it has been reported already and that they were looking into it.  We also contacted the Posen Police non-emergency number who only offered to send out an officer.  So I stayed on the phone with my parents while we were watching the red lights.  They moved further east and the second light flickered slowly and then burnt out.  A little further east and the first light did the same, so there were no more lights in the sky.  It was like we knew when the lights were going to go out.  They went out in order from the far left light, then the far right light, and then finally the point on the triangle went out.  When they were directly above us the two lights seemed to have moved closer together, with the tip of the triangle only a little bit ahead of the other light. Another odd (maybe) thing was that there were many shooting stars in the sky (according to my friends who saw them when I was inside for the short time).   These pulsing red lights did not seem to be attached to any sort of aircraft that we could see.  They were extremely high in the sky compared to the plane that had passed below them when we first sighted it.  My father also looked at them with binoculars and said that it looked the same as with the naked eye, and he could not see an aircraft either.  The next day my brother&#39;s friend at work told him that he saw two red pulsing lights in the sky while he was at the K-Mart in Tinley Park, IL around 1 am.  Three member&#39;s of our friend&#39;s family also saw the three red lights.  Also, our neighbors in Midlothian, IL told us that they saw white lights flashing across the eastern sky around 10:45 pm of Sept. 30th, only hours before we saw the red lights.  They said that they would dash back and forth across the sky, sometimes one at a time or in clusters, and sometimes in a straight line or in triangular formations.  I never want to see anything like this again in my lifetime...that is all I can say!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would be most grateful if witnesses to this event would please submit a detailed report of their sighting, using the ONLINE REPORT FORM on our website, and we will pass those reports along to those two investigators above.

From our viewing position, no ground base light could ever be pin-pointed and we looked hard trying to locate a point of origin for the light waves. The waves of lights seemed to materialize high in the sky and move in an &#34;ocean tidal manner&#34;  that is one wave after another, each new wave washing over and dissipating the former one...... approximately every 8 counts. The pattern starts in the North-East quadrant and slowly moves to the South-West quadrant, but the whole light wave &#34;pattern&#34; (which takes up one forth of the sky) moves across the sky as a total unit  horizontal to us on the ground (like a flat ceiling above us)   until finally out of sight. There never was a time when we were watching that the light wave simply blinked out (as if a ground light had been turned off).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in an area where there are no businesses that would be advertising with a strobe light, it would have to be coming from Columbia which I doubt we would even be able to see from Harrisburg. And even if it was an advertising strobe, why just for 40 minutes?  I mean those big strobe lights are awkward and clumsy to move....if you&#39;re really serious about advertising something or &#34;drawing people in&#34;   why not leave them on long enough for people to find you.......like maybe 60 minutes, or better yet, 2 hours.<n>
