She suddenly realised there were two moons. The object was a large sphere glowing white pulsating slowly to the left of the moon. She went down stairs and returned with the video camera, she filmed it for five or ten minutes and it slowly faded away. Two or three weeks ago she video&#39;d two similar object&#39;s at either side of the moon and you can see the houses in the distance with the moon and the sphere&#39;s which put&#39;s this thing in perspective.<n>

We are driving on North St. approaching Red Mills Rd. in Pine Bush right before the curve heading towards the town park we see a light and we joke about a UFO. As we get closer the light is different, not like a plane at all which we are used to seeing because of a good deal of air traffic from time to time so we are used to seeing planes and the lights they have. I  tell my friend to go straight onto Dubois instead of staying on North which turns into Red Mills Rd. and from there we turn left onto Edwards Rd. where the object is getting closer. At where Red Mills Rd. and Edwards Rd. meet we stop the car and all get out as the object is low and is going overhead. It is your typical black triangle with red lights, dead silent, not more than a 1000 ft. it seemed above our heads and moving very slowly. It traveled slowly south east and slowly disappeared. It is something I will never forget just like the encounter I had in the late 80s in Ellenville, NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had other &#34;experiences&#34; so to speak as I lived in Walker Valley NY which is in between Ellenville and Pine Bush on Rte. 52, one experience was a feeling of paralysis when I was laying in bed one night and then as if I were laying in bed I was very high up in the sky floating above Rte. 52 looking down at homes at night heading in the direction of Pine Bush, possible dream or something else I just do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I had spotted what I consider a satellite right before this one and watched it until it faded away. As I spotted the second light moving across the sky, I grabbed my brother and turned him towards it. As I did this, the tiny star type light grew in intesity until it was brighter then any other star in the sky. By this time, my brother easily saw it. The light then grew dimmer until it vanished completely. The light traveled approximately the length of my finger at arms length in the sky while it changed intensity. I did not hear anything, and I watched for several minutes after for any other signs but did not see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Consistent with an Iridium &#34;flare.&#34;  See &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt; for schedule of flares caused by these satellites.

Somewhere out in the far country of MN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 11 or so of age I went camping with a friend of mine, along with her sisters and her father.  Her father lived out in the country part of MN in a mobile home on his farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night while my friend&#39;s sisters and her father were inside the mobil home, we stayed outside under that stars by the fire in two blankets.  We talked bout the milky way and what we made pictures out of by looking at the stars and i happend to look at this one pacific star in particular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly that star grew quite quick and covered the sky.  The mobil home was visible therefore i saw the light grow much larger than the mobile home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I begain screaming and i searched for her hand while my eyes focused on the bright light and we held each others hands tight untill it was over.  Once the light was gone our screams stoped.  We both were quiet and said nothing for about a minute.  We asked each other if what we saw was what the other person saw and were too scared to run inside the mobil home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to count to three and then we would both run inside together.  but after three was said neither of us moved.  So this time we both promised to run at the count of three which we did and then once inside we told everyone but no one believed either of us so we spent the rest of the night talking to eachother about what we saw and what we thought it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

6/30/01 21:33|Lone Butte (Gila River Indian Community)|AZ|Fireball|5 to 7 Seconds|We viewed a bright orange tailed fireball, moving south to northwest 20 degrees above the horizion.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18302.html|6|ndxe200106| We viewed a bright orange tailed fireball, moving south to northwest 20 degrees above the horizion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wife and I were returning from a cinema in Tempe.  We live near Mobile and drive this route to and from the valley daily.  We were westbound, approaching the Queen Creek Road overpass at I-10E at approximately 1/4 mile.  At that  point, the road curves to the southwest as it crosses the interstate. As we were comming out of the curve, and at the same moment, we both saw a bright orange fireball traversing the sky originating from the south and moving in a direction toward the northwest.  This object was situated approximately 20 degrees off of the horizion and moving apparently parallel with the horizion.  It did have a long tail, approximately 10 times its diameter which was also bright orange.  We live 20 miles southwest of the valley (by way of the crow flys) separated from the valley by South Mountain and the Sierra Estrella range.  Thus,we experience very little reflective light from the metro, so viewing the night sky is a nightly occurrance. We routinely observe shooting stars, civilian and military aircraft and even military arial flares lighting the Barry Goldwater Bombing Range 20 miles to the southwest of our home. This object was in the wrong part of the sky, and not moving like an arial flair.  For the past 10 days or so, Mars has been very bright in the southern sky.  By comparison, this orange fireball was at least 12 times the diameter of our view of Mars.  I phoned Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ within moments of the sighting from my celphone and later in the week.  They have no record of such a sighting.  If it was a meteor, it was a large one.  I thought it might have been a satelite comming out of orbit, but then again, it was so large.  Has the military reported anything missing that night?<n>
6/30/01 21:25|Crestline|CA|Light|5 to 7 min|Bright steady light was observed over Lake Gregory Forth of July celebrate.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18273.html|7|ndxe200106| Bright steady light was observed over Lake Gregory Forth of July celebrate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every year at Lake Gregory near Crest Line California they celebrate the Forth of July the weekend before the 4.  Thousands of people come to view the show.  I have friends that invited me up to view the annual event.  The streets of the high mountain community were crowded with thousands of people. The fire works started a little after 9:00.  At about 9:20 a bright steady light was observed moving at a rate that could not be explained.  There were no flashing lights that could be observed on the object.  It moved in form the west toward the east.  It then came back around to complete a circle around which the Fireworks where at the center.  As the fireworks were going off it made 3 or 4 more circles.  The first time it took about 1 min to complete the circle.  The circle it made was at least 10 mile across.  Which I figured it would have to be moving at about 1800 miles an hour to make the loop in 1 min.  It moved slower on the other times around taking about 1 ½ min to make the trip.  As it completed the last circle it split into 2 objects and it looked like it dropped straight down without slowing.  At the bottom of the drop it merged back into 1 object.  It then moved off back in the direction it came from over the mountains. With as many people at this event someone must have video taped it.<n>

Light then splits in two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange light circling during fireworks show over Lake Gregory area of Crestline, Ca. Show started a 21:00, I saw light at about 21:20 and thought it looked strange, no flashing lights, no sound heard, a white light moving fast. I was in a different location than my family, they said it circled about three times or so, and people were looking at it and saying &#34;it must be a stealth or an F-14&#34;. Some said it was a UFO and one nearby man timed it&#39;s wide circle at 3 min-40 sec. My wife said it headed about due West and split into two! Hundreds, maybe thousands of people must have seen this &#34;light&#34;. I think the fireworks show ended at 21:25. I may be off by 5 minutes or so. I was at 5100 ft. and it seemed to be low at about a 30 degree angle. Lake Gregory is at 4700&#39;. I am a licensed medical person.<n>

As the fireworks started, my brother pointed out a strange light that was circling around the lake very fast. Many must have seen this. It kept circling around the lake until the fireworks were over. It then suddenly split into 2 and went over the mountains at an incredible speed. I am just 13, so most people may not take me seriously. My brother is 21 and we know what we saw. The strangest part was when we were walking back to our cabin talking about the event. We overheard a man describing the exact same event that we were talking about....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It came in from the east and circled three times before it went west toward the Pacific Ocean where it split into two distinct lights. While circling Lake Gregory there was a jumbo jet in the back ground that appeared to be standing still in the air with its flashing tail light only because of the unidentified &#34;light&#34; those of us on the ground were observing. Because of my stunned state of being at the moment, I could not accurately gauge the time in seconds for which the object was moving but did use the distant airliner as a measure. Unlike the other eyewitnesses I will say that it took approximately 30 to 40 seconds for each pass that would have encompassed at least 4 miles in girth. In addition there was no sound barrier broke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Professionally I&#39;m a ((deleted--military)) Analyst and have been in the military for the last ((number deleted--decades of service)) years. I&#39;ve worked around aircraft during much of this time. I&#39;m not one for believing in concoctions or conspiracies but I know what I witnessed that evening. The speed at which this &#34;vehicle&#34; was moving at would have made it impossible for any human being to stand against the velocity of force required. I&#39;ve come to three conclusions as to what I personally witnessed: 1) It&#39;s origination is from this planet from technology that must provide an anti-gravitational device to allow it&#39;s human occupants to survive; after all, the SR-71 which comes from our 50&#39;s technology had the ability to have it&#39;s skin &#39;stretch&#39; during high velocity speeds. The Aurora project comes to mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) There truly are beings in which God has created that have the ability to extend past their worlds. After all, it would be rather arrogant for us to believe that God wouldn&#39;t create life other than our own here on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) There is the possibility that time is being manipulated here. We&#39;ve proven that time can be slowed as one approaches light speed so why could it not be stepped out of. Our mathematics shows us there are at least 42 dimensions in space yet we can only realize 4 here on this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s a site were one can view so much of the universe we&#39;ve yet to truly understand in our limited minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nasa.gov<n>

On this one night it was overcast with very low cloud. Above the paper road behind our property something was above the cloud and all we could see were alot of large round white lights moving rapidly (I would like to say rotating but the movement was not that simple) and shining down through the cloud. The object seemed to be round although all that was visible were the numerous lights. I looked to see if the lights could be coming from anywhere land based but this was not possible. This is a small city and not the type of city to have light shows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the main residential areas are a long way from the airport. It could not have been a plane or helicopter because there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pretty frightened and rushed back inside with pets, I said to my partner : &#34;what was that?&#34; I do not remember his answer and he never mentions it which I find very annoying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt shock at the time and did not consider going out again with a camera or video. I was glad to be back inside the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is unfortunate that I did not make a greater effort at the time to record the date/time of this event or even report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not had a similar experience prior to this or since. I would really like to know what it was that I saw, many reportings of ufos or lights are different in that objects are moving, lights are different colours, objects are not circular etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date of the incident are approximate.

I told my cousin after we seen a ufo.hes like 10 years older.so he didnt believed me and said yea yea.but me and my friend know what we saw.now that im getting older I havent seen my friend and wonder what was that that we seen????<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged sighting may be approximate.

I just didn’t want to believe what I saw.  However, the more I think about it, I felt that I should at least have this on record.  Perhaps others saw this as well in Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in western Delray Beach, Florida. One night, my youngest son (he was about 12-13 yrs old) and I were driving home.  Just before our turn into our development we both saw a row of lights (about 4 very large lights-as big as a car?) appear about 1 mile north of us right where the traffic light is for Atlantic  Ave. and State Rd 441.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The height seemed to have been right at the height of the traffic lights or just above them.  They  appeared and then left.  It seemed like slow motion and as if time had stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us looked at each other and then away silently, never asking the other anything.  It took us a couple of days to even broach the subject when we both joked about possibly seeing a UFO.  Over the years we have joked with each other, but also saying that we both believe what we saw is closer to that of a UFO than anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very dark out (the development that exists on the east side of the road across from my development did not exist at the time.)--we had very few street lights at that time in our area.  So, it was very dark, with just the street lights in front of us one mile ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was littraly trained to identify hundreds of aircraft, both Nato and non Nato aircraft; within five to seven secounds, my gunner within ten secounds.  To this day i&#39;m still pretty good at it.  I live next to the bigest army base in the United States so I still get plenty of practice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The inccident happened as I was leaving Los Vagas on my way back to Texas. I was driving through the dessert heading East, off to my right front on my passenger side, I noticed a silver oval object very bright and relecting the sun.  At first I thought it was a jet plain, but as it got closser it did not fit any profile I ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It actually seamed to me as if it was bird dogging me.  It made several mennuvers up and down as it decreased and icreased in spead. If it was a human pilot in that aircraft I would think the goverment may have come up with some sort of new G-suit, becouse it would have definetly turned him or her into putty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway it really started to give me the willies so I got on my C-B Radio and tried to reach somebody, anybody, I just wanted to see if any one else was seeing what I was seeing.  Well I never did get a responce back, the whole thing lasted for about 15-min.  The dammed thing seamed to littraly just blink out of exitstance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told any one about it, never really felt compailed to do so.  But reacently I have thought about that day qwiet a bit.  I even dreamed about it several times. it started to bug me more and more the more I think obout it the more it bugs me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well any way I really felt like I had tell somebody.  I still havent told anyone I know I don&#39;t think I can; becouse receantly I started to get treatment for depression and I don&#39;t want any one to think i&#39;m going nuts.  So I decided to do some reasearch and cme accros this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I got to sound like some nut job but it really feels good to tell my story, just to get it off my chest. I don;t know maybe there is something to this U-F-O- stuff after all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was ahead of me up and to the right at the 1:00 position.  For the next 5 minutes to my exit it stayed in the same position.  I took the exit to Enon and, since it was so early and there was no one behind me, I stopped the car and rolled the window down.  The light was approximately 500&#39; off the ground and made absolutely no noise but continued to hover overhead.  I waited for any change in this light but saw nothing other than the white light with no noise.  I finally left and continued to work as usual.  This route is one I took regularly.  Never before nor after have I seen this very bright stationary light.  This area is within 15 minutes of Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  I&#39;ve lived here all my life and I am not a user of drugs or alcohol.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.<n>

She was sitting outside smoking a cigarette when she looked up into the sky and noticed an unusual object.  Shortly afterwards she told me to come outside with her for a second opinion.  I went outside and also looked at the object.  Sure enough it was nothing I had seen since I have lived here.  I have however seen objects in the past.  I ran inside to grab the camera.  Once back outside I began recording the object.  I have about one hour of recorded tape of the object doing different things such as changing shape.  I have atleast four different shots of the object, one from my pool cage, another from outside, and two from inside the house.  The object did in fact move because it was first spotted in the East, then three hours later it is in the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the reports describes Mars.  PD))<n>

Thinking it was a plane I kept watching and the object didn&#39;t move so I called a friend over to look at it.  It appeared to be very small and possibly 2 miles away.  Then we spotted another one close by the first one.  As time went on I noticed a third object that slowly moved tword the other 2.  Beyond the three objects I noticed a cluster of very tiny objects (possibly much further away).  The objects were white and did not move erraticly but seemed to move slowly.  Eventually they moved north out of view.  I cannot identify what I saw and don&#39;t believe that they were balloons.  I had other people verify what I was looking at and they didn&#39;t know what they were.<n>

I was looking at the stars to the west, and realized that one was moving.  It was moving down really slowly, and then it would stoot back up from where it started so fast that it looked like it disappeared and then reapeared.  It did this for a long time.  Then I noticed another object, that looked like a star also, coming right for the first object that I saw.  As it drew closer, it became brighter and brighter.  It seemed to happed in slow motion.  When it got to the other object, the other object shot down to the point that it was originally was going down to almost instantaniously.  The object that was coming toward it got really bright and disappeared.  The object stayed here about 10 minutes, then started moving to the north at the same speed that the object that was coming toward it was going.  About 4 to 5 seconds later, it was gone.<n>

Near Polaris, a hazy but distinct yellow glow appeared.  The light was in a rectangular shape, and the triangular object appeared from the left of the auroa and moved to the center.  The Triangle shape had flat edges (as opposed to corners) with a circular space in the center.  The circular center was a darkish color (as were the &#39;flat edged corners&#39;) but the space between the center and the corners were brightly lit in a yellowish white light. The object darted to the right of the rectangular aura, and only after the ship completly passed through this aura, did the light disappear.<n>

At first I said it was a hot air balloon but it was not.  It was red and bowed out on the right side.  It was like looking at a sail from a sail boat side view as the wind was hitting it. It was moving fast and began to come closer to the ground and to our car.  When we stopped at the stop light it stopped also.  When we turned right it turned right and followed us at the same speed.  We would slow down and so did it and so on.  As we approached the nexted stop light it stopped again.  We turned left and then it turned left.  It followed us either in front of us or to the left of us.  As we reached our destination and pulled into the parking lot it continued to follow us.  We sat in the car looking at it once we turned off the car and got out it disappeared behind some trees.  We did not see it again. Both myself and the driver are educated individuals and have never seen anything like that before.  WE have told a couple of people but no one believes us. My father and another friend were following us in two different cars the girl that was following us did not see anything.  My father on the other hand says he did not see anything but I think that he did because as soon as we got out of the car and into our meeting place he asked us what we saw. I think he saw it and is just scared to admit it.<n>

My first impression was that I was seeing a cluster of balloons, but there was something strange about it.  Then I noticed two more clusters and stepped outside.  It was then that I noticed each cluster consisted of four thin disks connected to one another in a cloverleaf type pattern.  They were moving at a high rate of speed, faster than a jetliner would travel, from out of the thunderstorm to the northwest (the direction of Yakima)and into the blue sky to the southeast(toward Pendleton).  They were flying at the same level the clouds were sitting, I&#39;d say 20,000 ft and apeared to fly aerodynamically, banking side to side and turning (not rotating) but continuing on the same flight path.  The three were in a staggered trailing formation, maybe a couple miles of separation but not a uniformed distance from one to the other.  They were traveling the same speed however.  I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars, when I came back out the first three were out of visual range but there were two more just coming out of the storm.  I was able to focus in on one and got a good look.  It kept banking back and forth in a side to side motion, it almost appeared like it was having fun doing whatever it was doing.  Maybe it was fighting the wind from the storm.  I didn&#39;t notice any decernable surface feautures, it appreared to be a uniform grey color, no nozzles, intakes, exhaust, windows, control surfaces, or lights.  It was flat and smooth.  At the flight level it was flying it looked about the size of a large private plane or a small business class jet, but moving much faster.  I watched it thought the binoculars until it disappeared behind the hills in the distance.  It covered the distance, thunderstorm to horizon in about one minute.  I continued to look in the direction they had been coming but didn&#39;t see anything.  I called my husband outside just as another one appeared from out of the storm.  It flew in the same direction but the path was further south th! an the r est.  By the time he saw it, it was too far away to make out anything other than a dot.<n>

I noticed a usual commercial jetliner turning to make its approach to LAX, but I also saw an object that seemed to be high in the sky and nearly straight up.  I curiously kept looking at it to try to identify what kind of object it might be.  I got off my bike to look more intensely at it.  By that time it was directly overhead.  I could not tell if it was circular or slightly oblong at that time.  When I first saw it I thought it might be a blimp. But it seemed to be much to high to be a blimp, but it seemed to be elongated at first.  Then looking at it for about eight minutes straight up trying to shield my eyes by different means, I thought that if it does not move then I might as well be on my way.  I rode for about a half mile still being able to see it.  While riding it appeared as if it were a planet, as a pinpoint of light.  Then I lost sight of it.  I made my way to the bank to conduct a transaction.  Upon leaving the bank, I thought I would scan the sky for the object again. Nearing my destination, I spotted it again.  It was east of me, behind me as I traveled westerly.  I would glance back at it here and there to see if it was sill there.  Then at one point I clearly saw the white bright object as very distinctly cigar shaped and closer than ever (the length being about five times the height and horizontal).  I raced home which then was about a block away to view it through my binoculars. By the time I got to see it through my binoculars it was drifting northeasterly and still seemed to be quite high.  It was a bright white color with a red hue along the bottom (this hue could have been cause by refraction of the binoculars). It was fading in the distance and no longer horizontal.  It faded into the distance looking again as a star and then no longer visible. I called my three sons to view the object, but by that time it was to far for them to see. I do have very acute vision as compared to them. The whole experience could have lasted! 30 to 4 0 minutes, most of my time being spent in the bank.  There were no distinguishable features on the object--no windows, no wings, no projections. It did not move like a balloon.  There was wind, but the object did not drift with the wind.  The wind actually was blowing about 10 mph from north to south at the time it was directly overhead, but it did not move for that time it was directly overhead for about eight minutes.  It was a gorgeous day, no clouds at all and no overcast--great visability.<n>

The sun was shining and the sky was blue.   We were headed east.     My daughter says, &#34;Look at that hot air balloon without the balloon.&#34;    I looked and saw a translucent egg-shaped bubble with a smaller dark ball above it up in the sky about a mile or so to the northeast of us - about as high up as we usually see hot air balloons.    I pulled off the road to get a better look.     It was very strange.   I couldn&#39;t tell how it was staying up in the air - there were not propellors or any other apparent source keeping it up.    It looked like a silvery white balloon and it almost looked like two human shapes were moving around inside of it.    The shape was just about the size for the 2 shapes to be in.    It appeared to hang in one place and drifted side to side from the top just very slightly.     I did not have any binoculars unfortunately.    When we turned onto Wagner Road headed north, we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.   It was almost like the sun had been shining through it to make it visible to us.     We both thought it was very strange and probably a UFO.    The people we told thought we were nuts.<n>

We had been standing there talking in her driveway for about 2 minutes when something caught my eye.  I turned and looked at a LARGE reddish light, directly south of us, about 40-50 degrees above the horizon. The light appeared to be at least the size of my thumb nail when my arm was outstretched. I&#39;ve been observing Mars for quite a while now, and I read that it was supposed to be at it&#39;s nearest distance from earth last week. I said &#34;Wow!  Look at Mars.  It is HUGE tonight!&#34; As I said that, I made about a 45 degree turn to my left and looked at my friend,and there, way up in the S.E. sky at about 70-80- degrees, was the REAL Mars, looking sort of pink, and maybe less than half the size of my little thumb nail.  It was a clear night and the moon was out in the S. Western part of sky.  (The light was smaller than the moon.) I personally witnessed the yellow light formations that have been seen repeatedly over Rockford in the last 2 years, plus I&#39;ve got 2 videos of the same phenomena, taken by a friend who saw the lights at other times. (Peter,I sent you his 1st video, and if he ever copyrights the second one, as you suggested, we&#39;ll send it to you.)This new light was alone, at least we only saw one. The color was reddish brown, with maybe a yellow haze around it.  We both thought it looked more oval than round,and to me the light shone out from top, bottom and sides the way the &#34;Star of Bethlehem&#34; is depicted, but that could be my eyes.  I thought the yellow lights looked that way, too, but in the videos they are round.) We watched the light for about 10 more minutes, and I believe I saw it blink several times, and then it started to move slighty to the west. Within a minute or two, it went behind a large stand of trees. My friend lives 1.3 miles N. of East State street. (The lights are often seen by witnesses near State St.) Judging by the size of the light, it seemed relatively close, and we could still see the light glowing through the trees, so I got in my car and went to look for it, but by the time I got out to the main road it was gone.  I did see 2 airplanes flying in the direction of the light--one while we were still looking at the light, and the other when I reached the main road. The airport is in the same direction, though, so the planes may have been a coincidence.  I drove back to her house about the same time 2 nights later and stood in the same spot and looked for a long time to see if we could have seen a street light from E. State Street, or somewhere in between.  There was nothing. I saw a stand of trees about 4 blocks south. I think they were the same ones. My friend and I are both teachers with masters degrees, aged 45 and 53.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might be observing Mars, currently visible in the southeast sky.  We will attempt to look at the video.  PD))<n>

I wouldn&#39;t have even given this aircraft a second look had it not been for what I saw ABOVE it. I witnessed a definite orb/sphere shape above this aircraft.  The orb/sphere looked to be somewhere on the lines of about 500 or less feet above the conventional aircraft and was flying in PERFECT unison with the &#34;normal&#34; craft.  As both crafts moved overhead I was able to see the glint of the sun off of them at one point, and this is how I could best relate to the shape of the orb/sphere.  I am not a pilot or in-the-know about flight altitudes; however, I estimate that the conventional craft was at about an altitude of 20,000-25,000 feet and, as mentioned, the orb/sphere was about 500 or so feet above the conventional aircraft.  I have never seen two planes fly so closely above one another and in perfect unison unless, of course, I was watching an air show.  Also, as mentioned I could distinctly see that the uppermost craft was of an orb/sphere shape. This event occurred at 10:38 a.m. (Pacific) time.  Once that I observed the spherical nature of the uppermost craft, I immediately ran back inside to get my camera.  I did take a photo of the crafts as they travelled away from me, but by the time that I got back outside with my camera (about 20-25 seconds later), they were both a considerable distance away.  If the photo turns-out I will most assuredly send it to you. The day was clear with sparse clouds.  This was a daylight sighting. Note:  There is a military base (Vandenberg) about 20 miles from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are well acquainted with this witness, having spoken with her on several occasions.

My son and I were on our way home from work about 9:35pm, we both work in the &#34;rent to own&#34; industry. We were traveling south on Nova rd.,in Daytona Beach, Florida when all of a sudden my son, who was looking out the driver side window towards the east,said &#34;what the hell is THAT&#39;? I began to look out the windshield in the direction that he was and what I saw is VERY DIFFICULT to describe. I saw what appeared to be a single &#34;cloud&#34;, almost due east from our position. At what is best described as the top of the cloud was a single bright white light. My first thought was that it was an aircraft of some sort with it&#39;s landing light on, only the light was NOT moving, IT was stationary and there were NO other lights. As I watched, the cloud began to loose it&#39;s density, almost like it was fading away and it seemed to diviide down the middle, the light however, remained at the top of this divison and continued to stay stationary. I took my eyes off of it to check out the road ahead of us as my son was focused on on the phenomena and was not entirely focused on the road. I did NOT see this next part, as it happened when I took my eyes off IT to examine the traffic ahead of us. He (my son) claims that a part of IT OR a second light seperated from it and fell towards the earth. The location of the light was due east of Daytona and would have been over the ocean. MY second thought was that it was a rocket that had been fired from the &#34;Cape&#34;, but the light was WHITE and NO orange to be seen, besides it was too far north by position to have come from the Cape (due east, NOT south east). It was about this time that the &#34;cloud&#34; disappeared completely along with the light itself. The moon at this time was located to the west of us an played NO part of what we saw. As i reflected back, IT reminded me of how the moon sometimes &#34;peeks&#34; through clouds with just partial light being seen, but the moon as stated was no where near the phenomena. In MY 47 years, I have NEVER seen anything such as this. I only hope I get the opportunity AGAIN sometime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U.

I said what is that? My husband said maybe its a UFO. The light at the top was very bright and seemed to shine down and fan out but only a short distance under the bright light. Then, as we watched, the object made a cloud around itself. At first the cloud was light and then became darker and darker until everything vanished. I put 9:30pm but I am not sure about the exact time. We swim a lot after dark and our development is close to an airport. We see planes going and coming. This was not anything we are familiar with. What really got our attention was that this object never moved. The light came on but did not shine all the way to the ground like a helicopter.

The sky was really clear because the stars and mars was clearly visible, the moon as well(cresent shape).  I had noticed a blue and red light in the sky and looked at it. It caught my attention because of its brightness.  I had only been looking at it for a few seconds to try and figure out what it was when it started to grow dim.  Within about 2 seconds it had grown dim to the brightness of a star and not a second after that it was completely gone.  I looked at my brother and he confirmed what i saw.  About 10 minutes after the sighting was over I met up with my other younger brother and he told me he had seen the same light, he described to me the same light I had seen.  At first I thought it might of been a plane and the angle of the plane made the bright light, but in this case the light would have been a yellow or white color.  The light I saw was a distinct blue light on top and red light underneath the blue light.  It did not move to the left, right, up or down.  It keep the same position and only grew dim in a very short amount of time and then completely disappeared.  Also there were no other planes around the light and very few in the sky.

6/25/01 21:15|West Palm Beach|FL|Light|approx 5 min|Spotlight within its own generated haze searches around,locks onto us with the lightbeam, then blasts into deep space|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22232.html|54|ndxe200106| Spotlight within its own generated haze searches around,locks onto us with the lightbeam, then blasts into deep space<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have refrained from reporting my account of what we witnessed on 6-25-01 because I wanted to wait and see what others would say over a period of 6 months or so, but after almost 9 months now I won&#39;t wait any longer.We&#39;ve kept it to ourselves and swallowed alot of emotions and neither one of has been the same since.         Here is my account  :  My wife and I were sitting on our patio (wich was coastal waterfront facing due East with no obstructions).Our conversation was interupted when this bright light seemingly turned on like a spotlight at a very high altitude.Like others I aggree it looked exactly like a spotlight from a helicopter-- but it was too high in altitude and it made no sense for a chopper to be using a spotlight that high up.There was NO noise at all and it was a crystal clear night without a cloud in the sky,just black sky with many sparkling stars.This light was large enough to make us feel like it was within the atmosphere--- but other characteristics proved me wrong.I knew from experience that on such a quiet clear night a chopper would have to be at 10,000 ft or higher to have NO noise audible.And I believe 10K ft is pretty much the &#34;useful ceiling or limit&#34; for the average rotorcraft.And yet a &#34;chopper&#34; is the only craft that can &#34;hover&#34; in one spot as this one did.(A Harrier jet wouldn&#39;t be goofing around hovering at this altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;light&#34; was indeed engulfed in a haze as most others said------ this haze seemed to be pruduced by the light source.The light looked like a flashlight searching in the dark--- it was actually searching around WITHIN it&#39;s own sphere of haze/fog and the beam stayed within the haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we staired in amazement we said things like &#34;Oh my god !!&#34; But we were at ease and actually had feelings of elation.   At this time the &#34;beam&#34; of light found its way to us and &#34;locked-on&#34; to us as soon as it crossed our position, and at this time began to move slowly directly towards or &#34;at&#34; us.We both had the overwhelming sensation that we were going to quite possibly &#34;beamed-up&#34; any second because we had this beam pointed directly at us and the source began to slowly move at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I didn&#39;t want to miss one second of looking at this thing---- I had a realization that if I didn&#39;t make an attempt to &#34;record&#34; this event in some fashion it may very well be reduced to a fairy-tale story buried in skepticism by all we shared it with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew I had our camcorder literally within 2-3 feet just inside the sliding door and I made a frantic move turn around, throw the door open, reach and grab the camcorder swing back around simultaneously pounding my finger into the &#34;power&#34; button to fire it up and DIVE back out onto the patio all in 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well this &#34;light&#34; honest-to-god seemed to respond instantly as I pointed at it with the camera and just bursted into deep-space infinity all at once actually FORCING the haze that was surrounding it into a downward spiral/corkscrew fashion--- and as others have  said, this haze/fog lingered for awhile as it decended.The light was instantly gone leaving only the black night sky and stars to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In OUR case, the story DOES NOT END HERE !!!!! As we sat in SHOCK and AWE on our patio-- we refused to leave our positions for about an hour thinking it may come back-- but it didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we went inside to nervously play the tape and see what I got on tape-------- and I actually DID get the last few seconds before it took-off.And to me, the interesting thing on tape was the downward spiral it created in the haze when it accelerated out of there from a stationary position !!! This shows PROPULSION !!            Sorry guys, but NO missile can sit stationary at an outer-atmosphere altitude, then suddenly take off at an immeasurable speed into infinity with NO &#34;blast&#34; characteristics behind it, and what does a spotlight have to do with a missile anyway ???????? Something VERY strange happened with our vcr.We tried to turn it off because we were going to bed and it WOULD NOT turn off no matter what buttons we pushed ! I just left it like that and we went to bed.        The next morning we went to watch the tape again and the damn vcr began to chew up the tape !!! I tried to stop it but by the time it was through------ we had lost the EXACT length of tape to get rid of my proof of  what we saw.I thought I was going to drop dead I was so mad--- we have never had a tape get chewded in 20 years of watching videos and this ONLY chewed the &#34;sighting&#34; footage part and the rest was fine.The vcr has NEVER acted up again since this and we continue to use it today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take the tape to a specialist to try and correct the &#34;fold&#34; that resulted in he tape and he said it was not correctable.I still have the 9 foot section of tape sealed in a container and plan to hopefully find someone to restore the tape to &#34;watchable&#34; condition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I know this tape is so important is not only what it shows------- but what it DOESN&#39;T !!  Anyone seeing this tape will know it wasn&#39;t a damn missile launch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mean C&#39;mon guys, listen to the reports including accounts from 06/07/98----- they don&#39;t even &#34;sound&#34; like missile launches--- they lack the proper characteristics as even the people who have lived near the Cape for many years and KNOW what launches look like---- have said !! I am asking you guys now how I can ever get the chance to communicate with any of the other people who have sent in reports---- especially the pilots like the one that was flying South and caused you guys to change your explanation at the bottom of each report to state that it was an offshore submarine launch instead of the former KSC launch  ??  Can any of us &#34;sighters&#34; communicate with each other and share thoughts on this unique encounter ? Can/will you guys have something set up where someone like myself can talk-to and eventually meet others who saw this ?

June 25th 2001 my wife and I walked outside to see a friend off, and looked toward the east and at what I would estimate to be about 25,000 ft., there was an intense white light similar to an aircraft landing light, but more brilliant and appeared to me surrounded by a mist.  This object lit up the entire cloud of mist, and appeared to also be shining downward, lighting the entire area below it. We watched as the object appeared to be moving to the west, when it suddenly shot vertically at about 45 degrees to an almost indeterminate altitude and moved at great speed to the southeast and disappeared from sight. The cloud which extended vertically and appeared to be several thousand feet high continued to glow white for several minutes after the object departed and drifted directly overhead, having moved from east to west. From our home here we often watch the Space Shuttle launch, and this object was way too far south to have come from the Kennedy Space Center, and we saw no indication that this object came from ground level. I am a former Police officer and pilot, and can judge altitude and speed pretty well, but this object, accelerated from almost zero to what had to be 3 or 4 thousand MPH in a burstand was gone. My wife and I are ardent sky watchers and frequently spot sattelites and the ISS, and can tell you that this was neither, and the intensity of the very WHITE light is inconsistent with the orange-yellow glow of a rocket, and I am familiar with just about every OTHER kind of conventional aircraft there is.....I have been involved with Warbirds, and almost every thing that flies,  and this doesn&#39;t fit ANY type of aircraft I know of. The event was of too short a duration for me to get to a camera, so regrettably, I missed this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U.

I will number my descriptions 1 through 8; the intervals are approximately 30 seconds.  Conditions were very clear, without haze or a cloud layer.  Mars rising in East and stars emerging brightly at 9:15 pm. Viewing to the SE from 2nd floor balcony w/trees in foreground. My brother saw everythig after point #1, we called his girlfriend to witness from point #4. We discussed this description. 1) Orange light rising.  Steady, not blinking.  Oval shaped, long axis horizontal. 2) Size growing.  Light&#39;s source seems shrouded by an accompanying cloud.  Slow rate of ascension give impression of approaching aircraft. 3) 1/4 circular arc of light appears in wake of main light.  Arc spans from 4 o&#39;clock to 7 o&#39;clock.  Arc is dimmer than main sorce and diffused. (Refers to Helicopter&#39;s search light) 4) Main light is surrounded by glowing field, more orange, which is brightest in the 4 to 7 position. A black arc appears between the bright source and the glowing field 5) A big change in appearance: a bright  yellow-white light with a comet like tail extending toward 2 o&#39;clock. Tail extends width of fist at arm&#39;s length. By this point the object has risen from the horizon to about 30 degrees above, and and from SE to ESE. 6) The tail from the object widens to form a fan, it elongates, and dims.  The color of the tail or plume changed from dark yellow in #5 to a darker yellow orange now. 7) Changing again: now the object is a bright orange streak surrounded by a bright gray cloud. 8) At this point, after 4 to 5 minutes of observation, the image dims.  We see or hear no object leave the viewing area.  A very large, faint cloud lingers for 15 minutes in the in the deepening twilight.  A sketch sequence is available.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to this individual for submitting such a nice report.  Many other reports submitted for this apparent missile launch.

I am a corporate pilot, at that time we were flying between DIX (aviation aid)NC, to Mrlin intersection (aviation aid)in the Bahamas, atlantic route 1 (AR1), to Fort Lauderdale FL. at an altitude of 39000 Fts. About 160 NM east to the Jacksonville coast FL, in the Atlantic Ocean, heading SW (210ºstm), we saw, at the begining, like a cream color, small oval, moving east to west, heading (110ºstm) about 25º up of my left horizon, and making light curves and little circles in an up parabolic track. Then stop moving about 80º up. At that moment the cream color oval switched to a massive super bright white light (hallogen light) like the sheriff helicopter lite. And just the light started moving like searching. I could see the shadow of my left arm inside the cockpit (weird!!!). I saw a giant cloud forming around the lower and the upper side of the light (like a mushroon upside down). Suddenly the light turned off, but the big cloud remained there loosing the bright. We flow for an hour and ten minutes more at 300 Kts, (about 300 miles) and still we could see the cloud. We couldn´t see any kind of body object, or object aproximation because of the super bright of the light. I read the Nuforc note in all the sighting reports that mentioned the launched of an ICBM from the Kennedy Space Center, but when I saw the light I was over the Atlantic Ocean and I saw it starting from the deep east side(Atlantic Ocean). As a reference, my airway (AR1), was like if you draw a straight line between Beaufort Inlet NC. to Fort lauderdale Fl. From this perspective the KSC appears to the west side of my way.<n>

The aircraft  two commerical jets either 737&#39;s or 747&#39;s with no visible markings just a plain white body. The other aircraft wasn&#39;t quite white it was a greyish metallic color with a weird shape which i couldn&#39;t make out. The only way to describe the third aircraft was whale like, big up front like a whale with it&#39;s mouth wide open and the rest of the craft was normal in comparison with other big commerical aircraft. I was using binoculars 10 x 50 to observe the aircraft. The sky was clear except for the chemtrails the three planes where leaving. I put the craft around 20,000 feet moving west to east at a very slow speed for craft at that altitude. What really caught my eye was this strange orb looking object sitting stationary on the same path as the craft flew by. The orb which was reflecting sunlight was emitting a light. It was as if you where looking straight into a very powerful flashlight. And even though the sun was still out and hitting the object the light was very bright. After I observed the orb for a few minutes it just vanished. I waited until it got darker to see if maybe i was looking at a star but ther was no star bright enough in that part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The third aircraft the witness describes is not inconsistent with an EC-135, which has a bulbous forward section to its fuselage.  We do not know what the bright object was.  Given that the sighting occurred approximately 45 minutes before the unannounced launch of an ICBM, probably from a U. S. submarine, we wonder whether the presence of an EC-135 eastbound over Texas may have had something to do with that launch.  PD))<n>

They seem to be as high as the satellite but moving at a greater speed. So fast that even a low flying plane could not possible fly as fast given thier apparent distance from me. They were flying perpendicular to the first 2 stars of the Big Dipper. As a few seconds went by they seem to have turned 45 degrees to the left  and then split another 45 degrees going in the opposite direction, and then they were out of sight.The night is clear with no clouds in the sky and the moon was in a totally different part of the night sky. Don&#39;t know what it was, but I know they were not planes or satellites and they had no apperant sounds comimg from them,not even trailing them as planes do.<n>

While sunning myself on the sand on my back and having awakened from a short doze, I decided to do a little sky watching. I put on my sunglasses and billed cap and scanned the sky just East of the suns corona where the main part of the sun was above the bill on the cap. The area of the sky observed from this position was approximately the Zenith. This beach area is approximately 1 mile North of LAX. My head was toward the water so the runways and departing flights were to my right. After noticing several high altitude jets that had made their cruising altitudes after take off and were now proceeding East, an object suddenly appeared near the Zenith about 10 degrees East of the sun&#39;s corona. Focusing on the object which was moving at a moderate clip at about 40K feet in a  N-NW  direction, I noticed it was a configuration of three bright spots, maybe lights, two in front and one in back. There seemed to be a blurry darker area surrounding this config. The sky was powder blue with only a minimum of high altitude vapor making very faint almost transparent clouds. I continued to follow it in its path and noticed that it was now looking like a sharply defined very bright, white in appearnce, angular bomerang shape with an equally bright spot in the rear. After this point it disappeared into the distance. The altitude estimate here is based on the size of a standard 747. still on a straight route.<n>

6/24/01 10:31|Mesa|AZ|Unknown|3 mins|At approximately 10:31 am, Sunday morning, I was outside on our back porch smoking a cigarette when a flight of three Air Force trainer|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18154.html|83|ndxe200106| At approximately 10:31 am, Sunday morning, I was outside on our back porch smoking a cigarette when a flight of three Air Force trainer jets (T3&#39;s or T4&#39;s? The ones that look like F5&#39;s) flew nearly overhead  of my location in East Mesa. Unusual but I&#39;ve never seen trainers here before. They flew in a tight formation, north to south, at an estimated altitude of 5000 ft, disappearing from view in approx. 2 minutes. Although the speed must have been nearly supersonic, at the capacity of military power(without afterburner) the engine noise was really quiet...less than a Lear jet cruising. Falcon Field airport is a few miles away, I&#39;ve seen plenty company jets. Williams Gateway airport is a few miles south, and Chandler Municipal Airport a bit south of that...I believe all have radar. As the aircraft diminished to a dot on the southern horizon I noticed what at first I thought was a vulture riding the thermal air currents just to my south, between the jets and my location. We see that all the time out here. My assumption was short lived. What I witnessed behind the trio of trainers I thought to be a large bird in the distance playing in the thermals--a thick, short horizontal line moving back and forth, then in lazy circles, above the clouds then below, behind a tree then behind a house then vertical. The object moved like a balloon on the wind but had the flat appearance of the thicker edge of a matchbook held at about 15 feet. The object vanished into a cloud bank about 90 seconds after the jets faded from view, south of my location, slightly east of the trainer formation. From the time I lit a cigarette and the jets flew over to the end of the sighting was less than the time it took for me to finish my cigarette. There was no metalic reflection, just flat black. The distance was too great to discern shape, but it wasn&#39;t a bird, nor conventional aircraft. But it could have been military.<n>
6/24/01 10:00|Highland|MI|Triangle|15 Minutes|Me and a friend saw a ufo|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37044.html|84|ndxe200106| Me and a friend saw a ufo<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my Friend were walking down his dirt road to a contruction site we ride are bikes. We got tired from jumping are bikes and sat down and just talked about stuff and he got up and i got up and i looked at the west part of the sky and saw a light and me and my friend watched it and talked about other stuff thinking it was just a plane or helicopter. I remember it was just in the air a good distance and looked like it was headed towards us only very slow then what made me and him wonder what it was was when it took a sharp turn to the left as if it just stoped and then went in another direction not turning then it went over the same direction it did when it went to the left and it went forward towards us and we rode are bikes up a hill to see it go over us and i got and good look at it before it flew over us and it was triangular but you couldnt see the body only three lights and they where a white, and a bluish color, and it was soundless we couldnt hear it at all and it wasnt that high. It was probley as high as a hot air balloon usally is. Then it flew over us just about 10 feet in front of us and a tree got in the way of our view and i swear it was only 3 seconds after the tree was out of our view that it was not any where in the distance and it was a clear night about 10:00 when we went home after that. I am a big believer in ufos and have been for about ever since i was 6 and i am now 18 and i heard about the 11 ufo sighting over mexico in march and it was just incredible to know that it had the backing of a united states official and it was declared a historic event and there was a sighting over iran just before that one with 8 ufos over iran in april. I also heard that ufoligist believe something truly amazing might happen this year so just keep that in mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was white in color and became visible while it traversed horizontally, so as to become visible from behind a set of trees. While moving, it was at least three times brighter than the lights of a commercial jet coming straight at you. As it moved just beyond the tree line, it slowed and concurrently so did its lumination. Its light source appeared to close in around itself to a dot, then no luminousity could be seen. This sighting lasted about 10 seconds, with myself, my father and my girlfriend as witnesses. One important factor in this sighting may have been due to my use of flashes with a high power spotlight. I&#39;ve used this method before and the results of this have been positive. Unfortunately i couldn&#39;t ready the camcorder quick enough to catch the light on video.<n>

When I noticed that directly above us was the most amazing sight for me. the shape was that of a perfect triangular form, with each tip of the triangle light with a dim light and pointing the same direction, I beleive that between the three light triangle there was something in the middle, like if it were just one craft.  The craft was traveling east at an astounding speed.  From the time it was over the top of us to the time it disappeared into the horizon was just few seconds, but I felt as I has watched it for longer.  The object  blended with its stary background so well, I just could not beleive how it mixed in with its surroundings so well,  My estimates of the distance  off the ground would have been about 300 feet.  totally quiet, There was not a sound to be heard and the speed was like no other.  Out of the three of us, I was the only one who saw. the speed of the object was so great that by the time I told them to look it was gone by the time they looked.  I was just lucky to not have taken my eyes off of it.  amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

I said, it is a plane with its bright landing lights on, for we are very near Fernandina airport and private planes come and go all the time...But it kept on coming toward us and going lower...I would say descending from maybe 5000? to 2000? ft over a minute or two, but absolutely silent.  The trouble was, it was quite a big circle of light, bigger than any star, white w/bluish tinge soft but strong, like florescent light? When it seemed to be about maybe 2000 ft due east of us, over the sea, it just stopped and remained stationary from then on.  At that point its apparent area was about a fifth the size of a full moon in AREA.  Never any sound at all.  After it had hovered like that about a minute, a mist or cloud was emitted by it from what seemed like 3 sources below its midpoint like at 8 6 and 4 o clock, so that the light came to be &#34;sitting on&#34; a small mist or cloud in the completely clear sky.  This is in the dark of the moon, just a fingernail already setting opposite this in the west.  Then it began to emit the mist or cloud also from vents above it, say at ll and 1 oclock.  Thus it was completely enshrouded in the mist but still the light was there in it so the &#34;cloud&#34; stood out definitely in the sky for maybe 20 sec.  Then the light was switched off, and the little cloud stood alone in the dark sky.  The size of this cloud was about that of an ellipse with long axis up and down, about what would be covered by a 2 inch or slightly larger cookie held at arms length.  The cloud stood there about 60 sec fading but little, then whoosh, it disappeared in 5 or 10 sec leaving nothing.<n>

I glanced up to see a large bright white light moving very fast.  The brightness was much greater than an Iridium flare or the ISS at a very high intrinsic brightness.  The speed of this object was so much greater than any conventional aircraft or orbiting satellite.  I said, &#34;look up! look up!&#34;, and everyone did to see the object continue in a straight line completely over the horizon. The object travelled from NW to ESE, and was visible for about 10 seconds.  When the object was directly overhead near 90 degree azimuth, it changed into a phosphorus-like green color, and amber &#34;sparks&#34; appeared to emit from the object, along with a slight, short-lived vapor trail.  The object maintained its incredible speed and straight direction.  The object never broke apart, no sounds were heard, so subsequent sonic boom.  The object should have been visible over east-central Alabama and west-central Georgia as it continued its course. The eight adults who were present discussed the object for a while.  We decided that if the object were a meteor, then it would have disintegrated to some degree while visible to us.

A friend of mine looked up at the same time, and we both saw an object that had two brightly lit white-yellow diamonds which never once blinked.  The diamonds were surrounded by a much larger diamond shaped structure that was outlined faintly in orange.  The object was in full view for 1.5-2 seconds, before a tree hid it from view.  My friend and I ran into the street (to see around the tree) but the object was gone.  It was huge (maybe 3/4 the size of a full moon in the night sky), and was moving very fast (I would estimate far above Mach 1), but it didn&#39;t make any sound at all.  The diamond shaped lights were perfectly symetrical, as was the craft.  The sighting was in between 10th and 11th avenue on Cranford Street in Greeley, Colorado.<n>

Also, no recognition lights (red/green or red/blue) were present as on an airplane. All three lights were moving northwest  at the same speed (the distance between them remained constant). There were no aircraft inthe area at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the objects, in fact, were moving to the northwest, then they almost certainly were not satellites.  Satellites almost never have a westerly component to their groundtrack.  If they were going northeast, they may have been part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system.  PD))<n>

I could see a lot of stars, I could see Mars very brightly in the southern sky (Mars was not moving of course!) I looked directly above my head and saw a bright orangeish disc-shaped object floating along in the sky from east to west at a very steady speed, but not very fast.  We are close to O&#39;Hare International Airport so I can easily distinguish a plane or jet flying at night as opposed to, well something that&#39;s not a plane!  This object flew along for about twenty seconds then went behind a tree from my point of view....the object never reappeared!!! I know what satellites look like in the night sky, this was too big to be a satellite.  It was not a plane because planes have flashing lights and planes are not orange and circular!  Also, as I mentioned before I realize where Mars was that night.  I assure you I was not looking at Mars.  Mars was in the southern sky, this object was directly above me.  This object was surprisingly bright as well.  The orange color was not a dark orange but rather a lighter brighter orange. ???<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was about 2 foot across and had a small square glass area.  I could see lines arund the object.  It looked like something off of star wars.  It did not move very fast.  I would think that there were more witnesses.  There were several hours of delayed planes still on the ground at this time.  I am not sure of the exact time.  It was sometime between 15:00 and dark.

It appears both objects were independent of each other but traveling together, like two flies following each other. The objects radiated a bright white light like a shiny star but more intense and closer to the earth. The light intensity changed, possibly flickering but remained very bright. The lights would disappear and re-appear a split second later in a totally new location similar to fire flies but moved at high-rate of speed.  At times the light kind of just bounced.  Being late night, I was only able to see the bright light and nothing else. Please contact me via e-mail.<n>

I had heard on the news that mars would be clearly visiable because it was so close to earth. As I was begining to pull out my binoculars, I looked to the east and saw a bright white light moving to the south east. At first I thought it was an airplane, then I looked at it with the binoculars. I could barely make out the objects shape, it appeared to be triangular or diamond shaped. This thing moved quickly and made no noise what so ever. I only saw the one white light at the bottom. I&#39;ve seen enough aircraft, civilian and military, in my time to know this was not one of ours.<n>

In one of the frames, there was a little black dot.  We thought this was just a little glitch in the feed, but there was another one in the next picture in a different spot.  They continued to appear in many of the pictures.  We watched these for over two hours.  Sometimes, there were two or three of them in the same picture.  We left the computer and came back when it got dark.  We watched for about 30 minutes and we didn&#39;t see anything, but in one of the pictures we saw a bright light in the bottom left corner of the picture.  It was much bigger and brighter than the stars in the background.  This light appeared in most pictures for over an hour and a half.  It would be bright in one picture and very dim in the next.  In some of the pictures it seemed to be splitting up into two and one half was a different color that the other half.  In some of the pictures, the light was just one solid circle.  The next morning, we were watching the camera and in one of the frames there was a black cigar shaped object close to the ground.  In the next frame, it was still there but in a different place.  In the frame after that, it was gone.  It closely resembled a photo taken in 1999 of a confirmed UFO over the same volcano.  I saved over 60 pictures of these objects and I will send the best of these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many individuals have forwarded photos of alleged UFO&#39;s over Mt. Popocatapetl.  None of them has appeared to us to be very convincing.  Most of them appear to us to be contrails behind high-flying aircraft, as well as some low-flying birds, possibly.  We are not sure, but none of the images has been very large, very detailed, or very convincing.  PD))<n>

In the centre of the triangle there was a rectangular shaped object with rounded corners which shone a bright white.  The configuration of my skylight is rectangular (4&#39;X2&#39;) facing east/west.  The object flew in an east to west direction.  The object flew very slowly, approximately 5 seconds went by before it flew out of my sight.  There were no flashing lights (like an airplane). The size of the object was rather large and it flew not that far off the ground, lower than an jet airplane and a little higher than say a cessna.  With an outstretched arm,  thumb and index finger touching each other (size of Can $2.00 coin) it would have filled that space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this witness, and found her to be an exceptionally serious-minded witness.

My boyfriend and friend became excited after seeing a satellite sized object move across the sky and then stop and become intensely brighter, then appearing to &#34;pan&#34; with this same bright light across the area.  At this time the circular object was to north of us.  After panning across the sky it dimmed as if someone had switched off a light and then became very small again and headed to the west.  After 20 to 30 minutes, my friend began to flash his flashlight upward to the sky overhead, wher I noticed to the south the same object, but much lower, repeating the signal back.  I told the other two and they confirmed this.  The light was larger and fairly closer this time.  Afterwards, it returned to the sattelite size and shot again to the west.  After becoming upset, we loaded up the truck and went back to Lewistown.  My friend riding in the back of the truck noticed the object again as we were leaving. He said it repeated a similar action to those of before. Each time the light was very bright, and much brighter than any star or planet in the sky.  It even outshone Jupiter which was clearly visible in the sky.  There were no clouds that evening to block our view.  After the first sighting, we noticed that within five to ten minuts afterwards, two planes intersected over the spot, one from the east and one from the west, almost as if investigating the incident.  This is meerely speculation though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the &#34;flare&#34; that the witness describes might have been the phenomenon caused by Iridium satellites.

I wish I could remember the exact day and month, but I think is was in the middle or late part of June in 2001. My father brought it to my attention in our front yard. Facing north-north east and looking approximately 65 degrees up we were staring at a fairly large sphere that was orange/red in color. At first I thought it was a star in the early evening, but quickly brushed that aside when I saw other stars near it. They were basically dwarfed in size. I am familiar with the sky in that area as having lived there for many years and watched the stars and meteor showers with my father over the years. soon my mother joined us. I ran to get my fathers binoculars and when I came back, our neighbors had pulled up and jokingly asked if we were trying to find aliens. When we pointed to the sky, the neigbor ran inside to get HIS binoculars and him, his wife, and my family all wached it for almost an hour. It did not move, nor did it change color, yet at the end of the hour, it quickly faded away (while looking through the binoculars, it was an intense bright, hot orange/red and as it faded it shimmered a shade of sliver....maybe the sun relecting off a craft???). It was not a reflection of the sunset off a star, as I have often watched the sky over the years and previously noted that the stars in the rest of the sky were quite small in size in comparison (I have always been intrigued by astronomy and took several classes in college).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no clue what this was, but there were 5 adults watching this &#34;phenomenon&#34;.... one ex military, one working in media, one school teacher and 2 nurses. Any suggestions what it could have been??<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was leaning on the rail looking out at the horizon while my father was complaining about his girlfriend at the time. I noticed some strange movement on the horizon. I was hard to tell what it was until it stopped very abruptly and hovered. I&#39;d say it was approximately 1 mile away. It was white or possibly reflective in color. It was saucer shaped and made no discernable sound. It was moving in an erratic horizontal pattern from my vantage point. The object seemed to dissipate at certain points and then reappear in a different spot in the sky. As if moving so fast that it became invisible to the naked eye. It did this repeatedly for approximately five minutes. It would dart across and then hover, then dart back in the other direction. I personally watched it for about a minute or so and then pointed it out to my father who comfirmed that he was seeing the event as I was seeing it. We watched it for 3 or 4 more minutes and then the object dissipated one final time and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I felt like the alien had mad eye contact with me from this distance.  As soon i blicked the creature disipered out of the sky.  During this encounter there seemed to be no space shuttle.

I had just finished watering a stretch of the logging road and had returned to the Pit River Bridge near the intersection of County Road 175 and Centerville Road. I was looking in the northwest sky when I noticed a small bright light moving at a very rapid rate across the sky traveling east. As I watched the light it slowed to a stop several times, and then it would accelerate very rapidly. As it reached its fasted observed speed, it would suddenly change direction 180 degrees with out slowing down. I observed the light perform this maneuver three times before is sped away and disappeared in the eastern sky. The duration of the observation was approximately two minutes. The object consisted of only one white light. No other lights were observed on or about the object.<n>

I am not one to believe in this sort of thing, but the night of June 19 changed my life forever. I was driving down a road in the county coming home from a late night at work, when I thought I saw some lights over the trees in the distance.  I did not think too much about it, because I knew I was near the airport.  So I drove on for about 2 more miles, listening to my scanner.  Suddenly the channels started changing rapidly and the damn thing went nuts. Static, squeals, etc...  I was about to reach down and turn the thing off when the engine on my van quit.  The lights went out, and I rolled to a stop on the side of the road.  I tried and tried but the van would not start. I sat there for a moment, I got out my wireless phone, but it would not work, no signal nothing.  I was getting a bit pissed.  That is when I felt like I was being watched. Every hair left on my head stood straight up. Like when a baloon is rubbed on your head.  I heard a really loud noise, then nothing.  The van started, the scanner started too.  I had no idea what had happened, but I was tired and decided to go on home. When I got home, all the lights were out.  I went in and asked my wife why she went to bed so early. She said &#39;Early? It&#39;s 12:30!&#39;.  Well I nearly fell over. I checked my watch and it said 10:45! I got really concerned that I had blacked out or something, but I have no history of this. Then I started thinking maybe I was abducted by aliens! Then I thought I must be nuts!  I have struggled with this incident for a couple of weeks. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I have strange dreams. I feel like I am losing my mind, So at the sueggestion of a friend, I decided to write you guys instead of just putting a bullet in my head. I cannot figure out what happened to those two hours. They are just gone..... I am not nuts, or on medications, but I feel like I am getting worse everyday... Please help!

6/19/01 03:00|Daytona Beach (outside limits of)|FL|Rectangle|2 minutes|On June 19, 2001 at  3:00 a.m., I saw a bright orange rectangular object flying in a horizontal direction between 2 clouds.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18139.html|133|ndxe200106| On June 19, 2001 at  3:00 a.m., I saw a bright orange rectangular object flying in a horizontal direction between 2 clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a vacation trip, driving north to New York City from Florida to visit family friends.  I departed from Fort Lauderdale around 9:00pm in my car and with my cat on Interstate 95 North.  Around mile marker 167 on Interstate 95, south of Daytona Beach, I was listening to my Yanni cassette while driving 70 mph on a dark empty northbound freeway, looking around for any sign of town lights because it was very desolate in that particular area.  It was a scattered cloudy night with patches of clear Florida sky about 3:00 am on Tuesday morning, June 19, 2001.  I was looking around the road ahead when something caught my eye to the right.  At first, I thought it was going to be one of those bright beacon lights for aircraft on a hillside.  When I turned my head eastbound to look up to check what it was, I was captivated by the sight I saw through my windshield.  I immediately took my foot off the gas pedal and on my brakes to slow down as I watched this bright orange rectangular object, positioned in a vertical &#34;I&#34; angle in the night sky, gliding smoothly from behind one cloud in a horizontal direction and it disappeared behind another cloud.  I kept looking at that cloud for about five minutes to see if the object would appear on the cloud&#39;s opposite side, but nothing happened.  The bright orange rectangular object seemed to move quickly in a straight direction between those two clouds, therefore, I assumed it would fly out from the other side of the second cloud.  I had to take my gaze off this object every 30 seconds to watch the dark freeway ahead of me (which was a level straight stretch), so I was able to watch this strange object for approximately two minutes.  There were no rocket flares (I&#39;ve seen the Fort Lauderdale Air Show on May 5th where Navy jets flew at night through clouds so I recognize the rocket glare from behind the aircraft and how it made the clouds glow), no extra lights emitted from it, no trail or glow of this object as it flew behind the second cloud.  I checked my mirrors and ! around t he dark stretch of freeway for other vehicles or road lights, but I was the only one on that part of dark Interstate 95 at that moment as my car&#39;s speed was down to 40 mph.  I did not feel scared, but was excited to realize that I may have experienced a UFO sighting for the second time in my life.  I am a 45 year old single female native New Yorker and have been residing in Florida for three years.  My first sighting happened in New York when I was around 10 years old, during a city blackout (probably mid 1960s) when our entire neighborhood saw a bright multi-colored oval object hovering in the sky.  I personally believe that there is a possibility of other civilizations in the universe other than our human race, so I felt honored to have seen proof with my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this witness, and we found her to be quite eloquent, serious-minded, and seemingly quite organized.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness, and that she is reporting accurately.  PD))<n>

Tonight, I had gone over to a friends&#39; house with some other people intending to spend the night just laying around with sleeping bags in her backyard talking and just having a good time. It is an extremely clear night tonight. Very beautiful with all the stars showing. We checked out a couple falling stars until one thing seriously caught our attention. We just saw this dim light flare up suddenly in the sky. We all thought it was a meteorite that seemed to be heading for us and it gave us a quick scare. It dimmed again and we saw it fly slowly away and then suddenly jet off at an intense speed and then stop practically on a dime. It freaked me out the most because last year, on Victoria Day I believe, I had taken my girlfriend on a canoe ride late at night. It was an equally clear night and we sat in the canoe gazing at the stars. We had been drifting for some time when we&#39;d seen a craft in the air jet from one side of the sky to the other at a blinding speed and then stop immediately. We were spooked but ignored it for awhile.Then we realized it was doing it again and once stopped and sort of shimmered back and forth. It was weird. We started to panic a bit but tried not to look at it. Then when we thought it had left my girlfriend told me to look in between two bright stars in the sky. No more than a mile away there seemed to be a cylindar shaped object just stopped dead in the sky. It seemed to be watching us. We heard no noise. We just saw a grayish object dimly lit near the bottom sort of spinning in the sky. It looked like just what you&#39;d see on those UFO specials on TLC. We had not been drinking that night and I am a devout Christian who will swear by these words. It gives me the creeps to think about but it doesn&#39;t terrify me. I think it&#39;s probably just some top secret government experiment. Who knows. Oh, and if you&#39;d like to know my mental capacity. I&#39;m a second year college student. Thank you.<n>

(We had the feeling we could almost reach up and touch it) Activity of object: moved very slowly until near the end of observation (appx 5 minutes), at which time it accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed, needing no more than 2 seconds to be beyond visibility. The object maintained a constant altitude during the observed time. Background of observers: 2 retired Army, 1 Retired Air Force. All 3 are currently defense contractors employed in the Colorado Springs area. None of us have ever before observed any thing of this nature, nor do we know of any military or non-military technology that even comes close to what we observed. Note: no photos or video, but we are working with a local artist, so a sketch will be sent soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are somewhat confused by this report.

Object was &#34;V&#34; shaped, but obviously 3-dimensional.  It appeared to be lit from the inside with no lights on the outside of the &#39;craft&#39;, however it seemed to glow.  The color was a yellowish/light orange.  It was heading Southwest, crossing the sky very quickly, but making no sound.  The object didn&#39;t seem very high, maybe a few thousand feet, but it was difficult to determine since we had no idea what the actual size of the object was.  It definitely was not a plane (that we have ever seen), a hangglider (no one hangglides in Madison, WI at midnight), an ultralight (it was totally silent and way too fast) and it wasn&#39;t a balloon (again, way too fast)<n>

It happened some time between 11:45pm and 12:15am.  A beautiful starry night and myself and 3 others were star gazing with a telescope.  For some reason, the telescope would not focus too well, so mainly we were chatting and looking up at the beautiful stars.  We were all taking particular interest in an especially bright star that we were trying to decide whether or not was Venus. It was in the southern sky. So, just below and to the left of what we thought was Venus, a light appeared, much like that of a star.  Didn&#39;t think too much of it, the sky was full of them after all.  Then, quite suddenly this &#34;star&#34; burst a brilliant bright &#39;hot&#39; light. We all squinted, it was that powerfully bright of an explosion.  So, of course we were all shouting out, &#34;Look, look! What was that!!?&#34; We all stared intently. It remained in the same spot for a few seconds as it slowly faded back to it&#39;s original brightness. Then, it began to very purposefully move westward.  One witness said, &#34;Look, there&#39;s another one!&#34; This one was of the same brightness (not the explosive bright, but now the average star brightness) as the first one now. This second light was moving towards the first, they were meeting up.  They melded together, then shot upwards into the sky and vanished. I&#39;ll never forget seeing this.  Someone suggested that the explosion was perhaps a revving of an engine, like a turbo or something.  I have honestly tried to dissect this, and think what logically it might be, but it was not a falling star(s), nor was it an asteroid, meteor, plane, helicopter. It was amazingly fast.   That they completely changed course was amazing too.  A moment I will never forget!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description of the &#34;exploding&#34; object is not inconsistent with the dramatic reflection/flare that can be caused by an Iridium satellite.

One at each end, but they weren&#39;t on though, I thought after if they were on they might have blinded everybody on the road booth ways.

I live on a corner lot next to a large park. I was standing at the corner waiting for my dogs to catch up, when I saw what I thought was a lightning bug across the street at the park. I followed this green/ yellowish light as it went streight up slowly. When I first saw it, the light was already above the tree line, so I could&#39;nt tell how close it was. I thought it odd that it was&#39;nt flickering, just getting smaller. Then the light started moving south to north. I never heard a sound as it flew its course. I thought it must be a heliocopter and did&#39;nt take my eyes off of it because I thought it was interesting that I could&#39;nt hear it yet. As it got midway between the park and my house I could tell that it was not assending any longer and I could see some reflection from the city lights on the underside of the craft. It&#39;s then when I could&#39;nt belive what I was seeing. I saw a round saucer shape with only one green yellowish light at the rear of the object. As it went north iI was able to follow it north untill it slowly went out of sight. I thought to myself, Did I just see what I thought I saw! I could not tell how high the craft was, how fast it was moving, or hear any sound at all. I do know that the cloud deck that night was around 8000 ft ASL. and winds aloft were less than 5 knots. The craft never went behind the clouds the whole time that I saw it, so I know it was under 8000 ft. I,ve never seen anything like this before....Ever!<n>

Faster, It moved across the entire night sky from one horizon to the other in 90 seconds.  It moved very straight and smooth and was dead silent.  Strobe-like flickering lights unlike any airplane or satellite were very evident and easily seen with the naked eye.  Can&#39;t be certain of the shape, perhaps flat oval.  The pattern of the lights is the only shape-identifier we could see.  We were observing the sky in hopes of seeing the space station pass by, however, this was scheduled to pass by our area att 22:45 and emit a solid white light.  Our sighting was 30 minutes later and a definite strobe-like flashing of several different lights was observed.<n>

We suddenly saw a teardrop shape, lime green lighted orb zip down toward the water.  It began at about a 50 degree position in the sky, streaking north to south very quickly, and diappeared just before hitting the water.  We didn&#39;t see any splash at all, and its impossible for me to judge the distance.  It was about the size of a B-B, but light up the cloud cover behind it to about dime size.  It lasted about 1-2 seconds.  My wife saw the last part of it out of the corner of her eye, but I happened to be looking in that direction at the time it began.  This was very, very, odd.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  It did not change color, and did not change directions.  I do not mind being contacted, but I&#39;d like to remain anonymous.

In the foreground was a jet airliner making its way in the same direction (NE) of the 3 stars which were much higher and moving much slower than the aircraft. Venus remained stationary as a point of reference. I said to the boys: &#34;Look at those 3 stars moving up there.&#34; They looked and said they saw them, then they faded away. They formed a triangle pattern. It would be my guess that there was about 10 miles between the 3 points.

Then I noticed it had slowly changed its position from southeast to northwest.Looking up once more as it was getting darker, I noticed a small straight arm with a tiny light at its end appearing to be circling the center light. Often this arm would stop at an eleven oclock position and become shorter by at least half of its original length. By this time , the kids were cold and wanted to go home. As we were walking to the van, Ikept glancing at this light. Right before I reached the van I looked up, and the light grew slightly. At that moment ,it vanished.

An exact distance would be impossible to tell from the human eye but it could not have possibly been more than 1-2 miles from shore.  I pointed it out to my friends asking if it was a planet and as soon as we all caught sight of it it disappeared.  One of my friend claimed it was probably an airplane passing behind the clouds.  It quickly reappeared what looked like some hundred yards away and then disappeared once again.  About 2 minutes later we noticed a large orange glowing streak that looked like a falling star that was frozen in time, motionless.  Then this obeject slowly made a revolution clearly revealing a disk shape.  As this object slowly rotated a new light would appear which conclusively showed us the disk like shape.  Upon gazing at this slowly rotating object, my friend pointed out another craft displaying the same exact behavior.  An orange central light, with one orange light becoming visible with each rotation and orange lights displayed on the sides.  We then noticed the third identical object displaying the same behavior.  The three crafts seemed to reveal themselves in the order of left to right, slowly rotating and hovering above the Atlantic Ocean. These crafts made no identifiable sound though it was very windy.  Suddenly, all of the orange lights emitted from the three crafts went out.  They disappeared. About 3 minutes later we saw these disk shaped figures flying to our northwest, diagonally out of sight.  These crafts no longer emitted the glowing orange lights but now displayed what appeared to be multiple strobe lights around the edges.  Without these strobe lights around the perimeters of these crafts they would not have been visible to us.  We could only make out what appeared to be three ovular structures surrounded by strobe lights on the edges flying away from us in the northwest direction and out of our sight.  The first two were flying in a line in tandem with one another and the third following up in the rear.  This formed what appeared to be a triangular formation by which they exited from our view.<n>

It was bike week at Laconia N.H, so, there were alot of people around. Usually the main bar is buisier, but we had a band out in the back of the restaraunt so there was not one soul on the front deck. Anyways, while takeing the garbage out, I looked up in the sky, as I often do, and noticed a star that was unusually bright sitting next to venus, which sits in the same spot every night at that same time in the southern sky, or pretty close to it. The star seemed very bright and as I said to my self, &#34;boy, that&#39;s a weird star?!?&#34; the brightness came down to the normal stars surrounding it, ( which in New Hampshire in a dark part of town can be pretty spectacular for a boy growing up in the subburbs of chicago for most of his life!). At that moment the star, or what it at fist appeard to be, gradually sped strait up into the atmosphere. In other words, It ascended rapidly, but not to fast, into the sky as if saying, &#34; time to go!&#34; This is the second sighting I have wittnesed in this area. The first being a blue star sitting amongst the rest, and the speeding up into the atmosphere at an unimaginable rate of speed. I am convinced that these craft I have seen are not of this earth and are being shown to me for a reason. I hope this report helps to bring the realization that we are not alone in this universe to those who are blinded by the upbringing and political belives of society.<n>

Please see their website at http://www.mufonga.org/   PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Investigation of multiple unknown objects by MUFON of Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> This case was investigated by MUFON of Georgia beginning on 10Sept01, culminating with on-site interviews on 15Sept01, and with subsequent witness contacts thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The investigative team consisted of this writer, Tom Sheets, State Director for MUFON of Georgia and retired Chief of Police, and MUFONGA&#39;s George Lainhart, a Police SWAT Rifle Marksman, who served with this writer during past years in law enforcement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> INVESTIGATION  On 8Sept01, this writer received a call from a former witness and reliable source of information located in Murray County (north) Georgia.  The source indicated that a friend of his family living in central Georgia had phoned a mutual acquaintance and described an unusual event experienced by his family during mid-June. Apparently the witness wanted to vent the experience, but was unsure of what group might be available for such action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer obtained the ID information and established contact with the witness that evening, scheduling an interview and event site inspection for 15Sept01.  Two evenings later, and several days before the planned sit-down, the Primary Witness (PW), contacted this writer and stated that he thought that the unknown objects had returned, but were much further away, and that he was trying to watch them through binoculars. This writer proceeded to the PW&#39;s home, about a 1+ hour journey.  Upon arrival, the PW stated that the objects had departed before my arrival.  A surveillance of the area was conducted until 3AM with negative results.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Event Location------500+ acre tract of land consisting of woods and fields with the Chattahoochee River as the eastern boundry. Home of PW is a former antebellum plantation house in excellent condition, sitting up on a prominent rise overlooking the tract to the N, NE, and E. The PW is the resident care taker of this property for a well known Georgia political/business family.)  The interview(s) took place on 15Sept in the PW&#39;s home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PW indicated that on or about 15June01 at about 10:30PM, his 18YOA son came into the bedroom and stated that something was going on, that there was a strange craft over the property that had lit up the house and surrounding area. (Clear, mild weather).  The PW said he went outside into the front yard and observed what appeared to be a glowing oblong object off to the NE hovering just over the trees near the river at what he thought was about 500 yards distant.  (Due to what happened later, PW described this initial location as the 2 o&#39;clock position). He stated that he got his binoculars and looked and rather than seeing just a glowing object, he observed what appeared to be a ring of red and white lights around a center line, the white lights VERY BRIGHT, with the red lights blinking in sequence around the object. The PW stated that at this &#34;2 o&#39;clock&#34; position, the object seemed to be about 1/2 inch long at arms&#39;s length, and it appeared to illuminate the tree tops in that vicinity. At that point, the other family members came outside. PW then took his large high candlepower spotlight used for night fishing on the river and shined the beam toward the object, receiving a dramatic reaction.  PW said that the object immediately flew SW (more or less toward them at an angle) at an incredible speed and stopped to hover over a large lone tree in the front pasture or field. PW described this second location as the &#34;10 o&#39;clock&#34; position, indicating (when asked) that it appeared to be about 2 inches long at arm&#39;s length at that time. (Estimations were made using a ruler provided by this FI).  At this closer location, the PW stated he was able to determine that there was apparently some solid structure behind the lights, appearing to be a dull gray as near as he could make out, like one of the old DeLorean sports cars or a Greyhound bus.  Shortly thereafter, six additional similar craft appeared with the first and began flying and zipping around the LARGE tract of land, faster, then slower, but never again with ! the incredible speed first noticed. PW added that at one time, three objects were stacked up in a hover, one above the other.  This display continued with no sound and at relatively low altitude for about 30 minutes, then suddenly all of the craft simultaneously vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interviews were conducted with the 18YOA son, 14YOA son, and the wife of the PW.  The fifth witness, the daughter-in-law, was not available. Their statements were similar to the account of the PW, with only enough difference to indicate that the secondary witnesses were being spontaneous i.e. seemingly NOT having &#34;cooked up&#34; their accounts. Example;  18YOA witness noticing that four of the objects were side by side before vanishing; 14YOA witness disagreeing, stating that the red lights his father had observed on that night looked orange to him;  Wife of PW stated that she was more aware/fascinated of the mid-line lights, and that she became VERY upset about the episode, something totally outside of her experience......further indicating that she was very tired the next day, perhaps from being up late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Side bar.......Several weeks before the events described herein, the PW stated that one of his friends, an advertsing exec and private pilot, had come for a visit. He camped out down by the river to check out potential fishing and deer hunting. The next morning as he packed up to leave, he laughingly accused the PW of sneaking down during the night and shining the big spotlight onto his tent to scare him.  The PW was sort of perplexed at that time, as he had done no such thing.  After the events of mid-June, the PW was no longer perplexed about that statement).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of unknown objects;  Appearing oblong in more distant profile, but sort of lens shaped profile close up; dominating BRIGHT white lights, with less bright sequencing red lights, all along a mid-line; fuselage structure barely glimpsed behind the lights, dull gray;  apparent size appearing 1/2&#34; to 2&#34; at arms length due to changing distances from PW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MUFONGA&#39;s George Lainhart conducted an inspection of the land tract and noticed nothing out of the ordinary.  Lainhart also brought along his laser range finder used in his SWAT Marksman duties. George zeroed the trees near the river, the trees indicated by the PW as being 500 yards away (initial 2 o&#39;clock position of object), and found them to be 336 yards distant. He then zeroed the lone tree in the front pasture (the later 10 o&#39;clock position of object) and found it to be only 74 yards away from where the witnesses were standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using the mathematical process of computing the appx. length/width of an object AAL, measuring length of arm, hand from eye, distance to object and applying these measurements, the approximate size of the object at the 2 o&#39;clock position (336 yards) is estimated to be 18.66 feet long; from the 10 o&#39;clock position (74 yards) to be 16.44 feet.  A variance of 2.22 feet.  Of course, estimates by the PW were used to calculate this, and the body measurements could not be exact as if done in a lab, but we consider the resulting sizes to be in the right ball park.  During the interview, the PW had no time to calculate correct changing ratios of size from the object&#39;s two different positions/distances and the 2.22 foot difference is not out of line for estimations, and in this writer&#39;s opinion, indicates credibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During detailed conversation, the PW was found to have grown up in the South Fulton County/South Metro Atlanta area where this writer served as a homicide detective and later Chief of Police.  It was discovered that this writer, while not knowing the PW personally, was acquainted with his other immediate family.  This writer recalls nothing that would indicate the PW was of a negative character or anything other than a hard working citizen, husband and father.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These investigators later checked with the local &#34;beat cops&#34; and Sheriff&#39;s deputies in that area and found no citizen reports to law enforcement regarding similar recent events.  The FAA was not approached due to their 15 day recorded data process being exceeded.  There is a LARGE (!) power generating facility within one mile of this tract of land, and this type of facility MAY play an important part in some of the more dramatic UFO experiences reported by witnesses all around the country. Unfortunately, this plant was under HIGH LEVEL SECURITY LOCKDOWN due to the 11Sept01 terrorist attacks of four days previous.  This writer was not allowed access to the plant, being turned away.  Later calls to the facility security office were unsuccessful in developing further information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One further note regarding the PW.  His position as an employee of a Georgia political/business family of VIPs would be in extreme jeapardy if any unusual attention was drawn to that family holding.  This writer knows that family, and the matter was discussed with the PW, as he was concerned about the same thing.  I mention this as another reason I feel that he and his family were relating the truth in this matter.  The PW witness has not recontacted MUFONGA, and conversations in the weeks after the field investigation revealed no further activity in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This case report was originally posted to MUFON&#39;s World UFO Database (WUFOD).  MUFON of Georgia wishes to thank Peter Davenport, Director of the National UFO Reporting Center, for allowing us to share this investigation with the large number of researchers and citizens who depend on NUFORC for up to date information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards to all,  Tom Sheets, SD MUFONGA<n>

We initially thought it was a satellite, then a plane, then couldn&#39;t make an exact determination as it was traveling too fast to be either, but still slower than a falling star. It moved exactly like a slow moving satellite in that it didn&#39;t deviate course, but stayed in an exact line. Unlike a satellite or plane it disappeared when it was directly overhead instead of it remaining visible to the end of the eastern horizon. It appeared to change brightness just before it disappeared, somewhat of a corona around the object or the light simply became more diffuse. We enjoy sky watching and this objects behavior was a first for the both of us. We have seen numerous planes, metorites, and satellites.<n>

It was very slow and sometimes it would even speed up and then slow down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really suprised me was that it would start moving and changing colors red and then orange and tend to disappear at times. sometimes I would think that I saw white little lights coming out of it, super fast. It was probably my imagination but I know the ball of light or fire more like the color of saturn.Like a miniature saturn. We do live next to an airport; the Ontario airport where Bush came for the convention. but this incident occured before the president came, way before. I really do think that this ball of light was some extraterrestial from outer space because the color of it didnt even look like a fire color, but it would change into a fire color; it was like a dark bright red at first and then poof it seemed like it blew up or something, not litteraly but in explanation. The object was hovering and then it starred to disapear sometimes as if the light was burning out; because it would do it periodicly and then suddenly it disapeared and never turned back on as if it disapeared. Im not finished if your tracking me right now but another incident happend like this just a week ago about this year in august on wednesday the 7 at about 8:30 9:00 but this time it was only a bright red color and didnt change it was coasting torwards the airport&#39;s direction and didnt do anything highly unuasual like the one I JUST explained farther back. this went out of our reach and we couldnt see it so we just went inside. Oh yeah we live in a suburban area and the desert isnt to far away in the palmdale and those areas over the mountain but where we live theres tall trees like a common suburban area I guess no crops or open fields no lakes well where not to close to one but this object wasnt heading torwards the mountains because we could see the mt baldy mtns. from our house not close but from a distance and it wasnt heading that direction it was going East torwards the airport because we live west from it. theres pretty much clear skies where we live.I JUST WANTED TO SUBMIT THIS SIGHTING BECAUSE I SAW THE SHOW!

( like a veil was dropping over the globe slowly )the jet made a big U turn and headed back to the Air base west of Phoenix The Globe was about the size of my thumb nail at arm lenght and setting at 2 or 3 degrees off the top of the surrounding trees and bulidings so maybe 5 or 6 hundred feet off the ground and maybe 10 degrees off due south from my point of refference ( 16th STREET and Glendale )<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was listsneing to my radio, while i was watching this event, and it became fuzzy, then stopped working. I also noticed my brother&#39;s brand new Jetta not working. when the object dissapered evreything worked again. While i was watching, i also noticed it change color, from red to white, then white to red again. I noticed that a helicopter was following this object. It made no sound.

Strange object in sky, same day as Carteret NJ sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at the 8th Ward Park in Linden around 4:10pm about an hour before our scheduled softball game. I was the first one there and decided to warm up by going out to the outfield and throwing a ball in the air and catching it. My attention was suddenly drawn to an opaque white object driting across the sky. It was box shaped and at times came to a complete stop. Other times it moved slowly and changed directions several times. I had a good view as the sky was clear and there was really nothing else in the sky. I was hoping that one of my teamates would arrive soon so I could have another witness. Eventually it just moved off out of sight slowly before anyone else arrived. I thought that it could possibly be some type of weather balloon but I wasn&#39;t sure. About 20 minutes later my buddy Steve arrived and I hesitantly told him about it not wanting him to think that I was losing it. That&#39;s when he told me about the object(s) sighted over Carteret NJ ( not far from where we were ) earlier that morning. I had no prior knowledge of the Carteret incident earlier in the day, but I find this to be a very strange coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was at approx a 30 degree angle above, and it seemed to be quite aways away from me, until a Cessna 172 series aircraft flew past it on the opposite side of me. So, the object was smaller and closer than what I had first perceived it. I knew it had to be a UFO because it was motionless and the wind was 5-15 mph, shaking the trees pretty good!

Then all of the sudden we lost track of the objects. From the north we saw a black disc clear as day come over raccoon creek golf course- Jefferson apartment complex. It moved slowly across bowles maybe a 100 feet of the ground, it was almost like you could reach out and touck it. It looked like a lightning blot was shooting out the botom of the craft contained in a large vacuum tube. It moved southwest across the park over wadsworth.

I looked up and to my astonishment I saw 3 objects emitting or reflecting the light from the sun, they were moving together in a north north westerly direction. This automatically ruled out satelite expanations. I was captivated, I then noticed that they were changing their velocity, accelerating then decelerating. This ruled out the posibility of meteor fragments. If that were not enough the rear object stoped in it&#39;s flight, motionless if you will.

My home is in the mountains and I have a very good view of both the city of Santa Fe and the city of Los Alamos. I observed this light for a while and noticed it seemed to have different colored lights flashing or something.  I got out my binoculars, and observed that there were indeed different colored lights.  It was too far away to observe the actual shape.  The object at first appeared to be stationary over the city of Santa Fe.  It did not appear to be moving at all.  However over a course of approximately an hour and a half, it very slowly moved over the city of Los Alamos, then very slowly moved lower in the skies until it appeared to disappear behind a mountain in or behind Los Alamos.  It went down not far from a red flashing light in the mountains, so I thought it might have to do with some sort of test or research going on in Los Alamos.  During this same period of time, I also noticed two other very bright white objects which appeared to be either round or elipse shaped in two different locations in the skies over Santa Fe.  Neither object appeared to be moving.  Both were very far away.  I observed an airplane during this period and compared the plane to these objects through my binoculars.  The three unidentified objects bore NO resemblance to the plane.  Two of the objects were still in the sky when I finally went to sleep at approximately 4 AM.  All of these objects were lower in the skies than the stars.  It was a very clear night.  All of these objects were much brighter than the stars and were easy to distinguish from the stars due to their extremely bright lights and to the fact that they seemed at times to move, although VERY slowly. I have never made a UFO report before or seen a UFO.  I am 52 years old, female, and co-owner and co-founder of a company.  Prior to that, I was a top executive in a major ad agency for 20 years. I have never witnessed anything like this.<n>

Upon cresting the hill my attention was drawn to an abnormally bright white colored light in the sky north of my location.  At first I thought it was a commercial aircraft far off several thousand feet up in the air.  It should be noted that I-25 runs all the way to Wyoming and this section of highway goes threw both Larirmer and Weld County.  It is very unusual to see commercial aircraft flying in the air space of these Two County&#39;s, but I have seen commercial air traffic from time to time flying in these County&#39;s. I continued to watch the light and noticed that it never move to the left (west) or the right (east).  I figured that the light was either moving north (away from me) or that it was moving south (towards me).  As I proceeded down the hill I observed the light was now back dropped by the next hill.  I realized that the light was both closer and lower in the sky than I originally thought.  I continued now going up the next hill where this object appeared to be rather close to a bridge.  It should be noted that this bridge crosses over I-25 for east and westbound traffic.  The bridge is located south of mile marker 246 and part way up the hill.  The bridge also has no off or on ramps connecting to I-25. As I approached the Bridge the object appeared to be approximately 200- 300 feet directly above the bridge.  I also observed that there was a red colored light to the right of the white colored light approximately 30 feet apart.  In-between both lights I observed a very dark mass that appeared to connect the two lights.  At this time the object appeared to take on a shape that is similar to that of a cigar.  When I got closer to the object I noticed that the object had some depth to it.  My view changed to where I could see part of what I would assume to be the underside.  The black colored mass appeared to come from the red light heading in a north western direction (away form me) rounding off and headed towards the white colored light. With this new view it took on the shape of a rounded triangle. Just before I proceeded under the bridge I lost my view of the object due to the bridge and the height of my windshield.  I continued under the bridge and traveled approximately two tenths of a mile further and pulled over to the right side of the highway.  I exited out of the driver&amp;#8217;s side of my vehicle and looked where I had last seen the object and it was gone.  I did not see any sign of the object around the bridge.  I looked to the east and west along the road connected to the bridge and I did not see any traffic.  The traffic on I-25 both north and southbound was light/ few vehicles and there were other vehicles present at the time.  I looked up to the sky and I saw no signs of the object or any visible signs of any air traffic.  I got back into my vehicle and went home where I then wrote down what I had observed. During this time I did not observe any running lights that one would see on aircraft be it rotary or strobe type.<n>

MY MOTHER FIRST OBSERVED THE OBJECT AS WE WERE SITTIN ON THE FRONT DECK ON THE EAST SIDE OF HER HOUSE IN THE TOWN OF STAFFA ONTARIO. THE OBJECT FLEW DIRECTLY (IT SEEMED) OVER THE TOWN OF STAFFA WHICH IS ABOUT 100 METRES NORTH OF MY MOTHERS HOUSE. SHE OBSERVED THE OBJECT AND CALLED MY AND MY BROTHERS ATTENTION TO IT. THE OBJECT WAS QUITE EASY TO PICK OUT DUE TO ITS SIZE AND BRIGHTNESS (AT LEAST 3 TIMES AS BRIGHT AND TWICE AS LARGE AS ANY STAR IN THE SKY). THE OBJECT CONTINUED IN A STRAIGHT EASTERLY DIRECTION UNTIL IT WAS ABOUT 11 O CLOCK OF OUR POSITION FACING EAST. IT THEN SHOT UP AT A 60 DEGREE ANGLE CONTINUING EAST AND QUICKLY BEGAN TO SHRINK IN SIZE. IT SEEMED TO ACCELERATE EVEN MORE AT THIS POINT AND BEGAN TO DIM. IT ACTUALLY APPEARED TO LEAVE THE ATMOSPHERE. THE ACCELERATION WAS INCREDIBLE. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ENGINES (SOUND, AFTER BURNER FOR ACCELERATION, ETC).

We were driving north bound on the highway.  Heading towards Washington State.  When The driver and i noticed 2 Extremly bright lights from a distance.  I pointed it out to my friend in the back seat.  We started to discuss what it could be.  The driver suggested 2 cruise missles of some sort.  The lights appeared to be hovering up and down and a steady rate going the opposite way down on the north bound highway.  Almost as if observing us in vehicles, poosible taking scans of some sort. As we got closer we noticed the lights were comeing from 2 ufo&#39;s going south in the north bound lane.  There was other traffic on the highway at the time, so im sure there were other witnesses other then ourselves.  Even the car infront of us stop abruplty.  I also noticed a semi truck pulled over to the left side of the highway going northbound. The driver of our vehicle slowed down alot so i stuck my head out the window while the car was in motion so i got a good look at the crafts.  The vessicles were about 20 feet from the concrete of the highway.  There was an extremly bright light in the front of the vessicle, then what appeared to be contrete with 3 columns of hieroglyphical writing.  With another brighlight at the end of the vessicle.  We got off the highway about 2 exits up and went into a church parking lot that was write off the freeway to smoke a ciggerate and talk about what we seen before we left the area.  When we noticed a 3rd craft going east passing over the highway.  This vessicle was triangle shaped, dark green with red and yellow tubing that was intergrated into the bottom of the vesslicle.  Possibly some type of piping with fuel being fed to the engines. This triangle shaped ship was moving a bit faster and was noiser then the other 2 seen previously.  After the triangle shaped vessicle passed over us and was no longer in sight we got back in the car about 5 mintues later and left.  As we approached the onra! p to continue driving home to washington we noticed a army truck with 2 soldiers standing on the side of the onrap looking up at the sky ignoring any other distractions.  Diddnt even look at us as we drove by.  We were gonna stop and ask what they were looking at but then we changed our minds and got on the highway and went home.  Were these 3 vessicles some type of new secret military aircrafts or did the army respond to ufo&#39;s intrusion into our airspace. We might never know.  But i enjoyed the once in a life time experince if they were extraterrestrials from a advanced race outside of our solar system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked up and I saw them morph from a cigar shape to a firey sort of color with little electric glowing thing that looked to me like plasma surrounding it. I was about to get my camera, but they zipped away right before I could snap a picture.

Her 5 year old son was watching TV at the time with her. She walked out her front door and down a small flight of stairs and proceeded to walk about 30 feet out into her driveway. She looked to the East and there across Boswell Road floating above her neighbors field were three, or four, egg shaped burnt orange lights hovering above the ground. They were perfectly silent and motionless. They stood perfectly still. She watched for some time then ran inside to get a camera but found the batteries dead. She called the neighbor in whose field they were hovering and told her to hurry and look outside. The neighbor ran outside but forgot to take her glasses. My daughter ran back outside and spotted a flashlight at the objects. This action caused one of the lights to suddenly shine a strong powerful light directly down toward the ground. The light came over at my daughter who immediately ran inside. On going inside she also noticed one of the craft silently dart off toward her house and steak away. Whatever happened she doesn&#39;t know but the TV suddenly popped and shut off and a humidefier like divice also quit operating. My daughter called the local radio station AND REPORTED what she saw. There were other callers who also reported the sightings. I understand she now has seen the craft another time and has taken a photograph.<n>

It seemed to morph into varying shapes slowly and drifted as if it were a balloon. The object was approximately 700 ft in the air and nightfall was quickly approaching. I pulled my car off on the side of the road and watched it. It appeared as though it were simply floating but it did not look like a balloon or birds or a plane or anything like that. I am 34 years old and I have never seen anything like this floating through the sky. Most of the time it looked like a rounded black boomerang where each side would move forward and backward. There were no lights and it eventually faded into the clouds and into the night.<n>

There are several experimental aircraft flown in this area by hobbyists. Some of these craft are ultra lights with constant moving paraglider wings. This is not an explanation. But a possibility. The shapes are very different and can change in flight as fabric and composites bend. They do not need lights as they require no licensing. Some of the lights are unique. Not to confuse the public, but as a hobbyists design.<n>

It was a calm sunny day and we could hear this strange sound. We looked up to see if an airplane was comming, but all I could see was this very bright white object moving from east to west. The speed was unbelivable and all I could say to my friends, I think we just got spotted by an UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to know the duration of the sighting.

At around 1:00AM on the 10th or 11th of June 2001, while we were in his back yard we both witnessed a blinding reflection of bright white light.  Neither of us heard anything, nor did we see anything after that. And just now at 1:28AM on the 14th of June 2001, I witnessed a bright white reflection of light off of everything in my back yard as if a helicopter flew directly over my house with it&#39;s spotlight shining, but I heard no noise.  I immediately went outside to see what it might have been and stood out there for about a minute before I saw two consecutive flashes of an orangish light that reflected off of all of the clouds in the sky facing north of my home which was the direction I was facing at the time of the incident.  Again, no noise or any discernible origination of the light was to be recognized.  I don&#39;t know what to make of it, but I will be watching for any more unnusual activity.<n>

I am writing this for my husband and I saw it myself, it moves very quickly across the sky, it looks like an air plane at first but it moves at least ten times faster and it switched from N. to S. Then it stopped, two of the &#34;stars&#34; close together and the other one a little farther away not moving.  The two &#34;stars&#34; then just floated in the sky while 5 minutes later an even brighter red glowing object flew across the sky.<n>

The lights were in a triangle with two on the left and one forming the triangle shape on the right.  As it moved across the sky it blotted out the stars so it was easy to determine the shape of the craft.  There was a constant droning noise, not very loud as it moved. The craft probably stayed with that shape for about 3-4 minutes as it moved into the south, at which time the light on the right hand side started to move away to the right from the craft.  The two lefthand lights stayed together and followed their original path.  The light on the right disappeared, the other two lights stayed together until they were lost to sight.<n>

I continued to watch as it moved up and down and side to side. Very strange movement.I have been checking everynight. It&#39;s been a month. Then on the night of 07/12/2001 by brother and I were in my back yard tending to my pool pump. It was about 10:00 p.m and we both just happened to look up and saw the same thing at the same time. As my brother and I walked twords my pool the object moved with uo about six feet and stopped right in front of us as if we were being watched or followed. We had two torches lit and a candle which might have made us visible. I don&#39;t know anything for sure but I would really like to know what that is. It is always tword the west and has been there for over a month.<n>

It is now higher in the sky than it was so that if I put my index finger in front of it, it is hidden.  But was much larger about a half an hour ago.  It seemed to &#34;hover&#34; above the Pequop mountain range to the east of us.  Most people would say that it was a &#34;satallite&#34;  But those things are supposed to be much higher in &#34;space&#34; and maintain an orbit.

It was just off the right side of the plane as it was descending.  I work outside and live near the airport so I am familiar with their landing patterns.  Today, we had a Tropical Storm passing through so there was periods of sun and periods of rain. Durng a sunny period I was watching planes making Chemtrails all over the sky when I first noticed the shimmer of the sun on a plane overhead and as I watched, I noticed the shiny ball or sphere riding right along side of the plane.  As I watched the sphere it seeed to just disappear within a minute or so.  Also as I noted before, there was a fuzzy area around the sphere which made it hard to focus on.  I&#39;m not a expierenced judge of distance but it wasn&#39;t very high up at all,as the plane was on a landing pattern. Thanks<n>

We were both looking at the sky, cause Mars is easily observable these nights...Then, our look was captivated by a star-like light much brighter than the others, and it appeared quite nearer than the other stars... We starred at this light, it was standing still.  Then it started to move upwards, and at the same time, it started to faint, just like if it was moving away from us at a fast speed, until it became a very small spot and disapeared. We were both astonished and wondering if there were any reports made this night... Thanks for awering... ((name deleted))<n>

It was going down preety fast.it had a circle made of small white flashing lights around the black semi-sphere on top of it, I couldn&#39;t see under it because it was leaned towards me,(all this time my 2 friends ware just looking at that object and still couldn&#39;t belive it) I went inside the disco and told my other friends there but they wouldn&#39;t beleve me so I went back outside and wached the object falling for about 1-2 minutes,after that it went after a mountain and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore, I waited for about 10 seconds, looking at the trail of white and gray smoke the obejct left behind then I turned around and walked twoards the disco thinking about what could that be, and then, for about half of second all I saw was white,I quickly turned aroundand ascked my friends what happened and they sed they saw some kind of explosion. The thick trail of smoke lasted for another 10-15 minutes after that, unfortunatly I didn&#39;t have my camera at me. There ware also two other guis near the disco,smoking, but they didn&#39;t pay any atention to the object.(I think they ware drunk).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then, I looked straight up and observed a single dark yellow, amberish light directly overhead drifting slowly toward the north; I was facing south.  The light was no bigger than that on an airplane, and would have been at least that high up, however, as soon as I sighted it, it faded away.  The duration of the event could not have been more than two seconds between the time I spotted it and the time it vanished, but it _was_ moving visibly northward.<n>

He was watching something out the back window and I assumed it was a plane since he is taking flight lessons and likes to watch them.  We got out of the car when arriving home and he said Mom, that isnt a plane.  I looked up and said what is it?  He said I dont know...  I saw an Orange colored round object above us that was moving slowly Southwest.  It had some type of an extension that seemed to circle the whole object continuousley as it moved... then it stopped and as it started again it headed more in a western direction then a bright orange object shot off of it very fast and went south and was gone.. then as it moved another bright very small object shot off of it only it went in the same direction as the main object then this happened several more times and then it all dissapeared. My son and I were just awestruck since I always thought that people were nuts when they spoke of UFO&#39;S but we saw something strange with our own eyes... and now I believe it.<n>

Unfortunately, my boyfreind nor I had a watch to inquire about time. We noticed a bright yellowish ball of light in the northern part of the sky. It was much larger and brighter than the northern star.  A few seconds later it was alot closer and instead of appearing as a ball of yellow light, we saw a rainbow of colors (blue, green, red, yellow) that seemed to flash around an object that was hovering. From this object we then saw a smaller yellow ball of light descend horizontally toward the ground.  The object quickly came closer and flew above us.  I could barely make out a triangular shape with red lights below each corner.  We drove 60 mph to follow it but it disappeared within 5 seconds and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length over the telephone, and found her to be very credible.  Her description of the alleged event was quite factual and unambiguous.  We have requested a report from her friend, who was with her at the time of the sighting, as well as illustrations from both parties.  We will post the illustrations, once we begin that policy of supplementing the written reports.  PD))<n>

Me, my Dad and my brother were going to the dump to take out the garbage. We started driving down our rode and went around a curve. Once we reached the end of the curve we saw this metalic looking UFO hovering right over the trees. We kept driving and the UFO went behind the trees for probaly 3 to 5 seconds before we saw it again and it had moved way up into the sky. We were all shocked because it moved to fast. But it wasn&#39;t far away so we couldn&#39;t see it anymore it was still pretty close to us. Then we kept driving down the rode and came to an area by our house that is a open field with no trees were the UFO was. We could see it clear as day. Across from the field are trees and as we drove the UFO started to hover down right above the trees over by were I used to go go school. Then it disapeared behind the trees. Then the next right were we saw the UFO hovering right across from the school in an area that there are lots of little pine trees there was a big clearing back in the woods and there were army trucks and 18 wheelers out by the rode. They weren&#39;t there the day before we saw the UFO. So when we saw this we thought immediately that the UFO must have crashed back there in the trees. After this the next day there were still some trucks back there but they had cleared out pretty much out of the area. Now there is still an open area where we think the UFO crashed. Now there is just a no trespassing sign up where a path leeds to the open area. This is my incounter with a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

They have resorted to psychological devices. These devices use sound and cerebral techniques to alter my surroundings, which can be discomforting, but fuck them anyway.  Also, the hybrids on earth, which mask themselves in a matrix, are coordinating with the pure bloods in an all-out attempt to persuade me into an agreement of sorts.  The Matrix I believe is similar to the matrix in the movie LIVE, which stars Rowdy Rodney Piper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This agreement would be an acceptance of their right to dominate earth and its people.

I was sorta waiting for the light clouds to go away, really just relaxing then I got a big 8 foot table out my wife had out at a garage sale the day before, got my other two sets of binocs out, and decided to stay a while.  Anyway, this started at 11:30, I had been outside about 1 and a half hours.  A bright light, I will say white-I am red and green color-blind a little, flashed or pulsed or lit-up or whatever to my right, south mostly and a tiny bit west-- I am lying flat down feet pointed directly east.  Pretty damn bright, I think I saw it light up with my eyes closed or maybe partially open, dont really know.  I thought I had missed one of those bright meteorite deally-bobbers.  Approx 5-15 seconds later, now fully alert, a second flash, not really a flash more like a long flash lit up the same area , about like a street light at 2 or three blocks.  I could now see it was moving almost directly north, a tiny bit east.  I pointed my binocs at it and watched it pulse, light up, all the way across the sky, about 30 seconds, maybe 40 seconds, through the binocs until it went as far as I could see to the horizon.  There was no sound,  it looked at first like a aircraft landing light but I really think it was up a lot higher,  like maybe a satellite reflecting sunlight while spinning, but I have probably watched hundreds and hundreds of satellites or space junk or whatever, and they never pulse light like this.  The pulses were not evenly spaced, they were anywhere from 8 to 12 seconds apart, they were pretty bright, and this was a little hard to follow with 10x50 binocs because the light pulses were timed so far apart and not evenly spaced. It disappeared completly between light pulses.  It was about like tracking a satellite across the sky, had to have been visible to a huge area on the ground, About 2 to 6 minutes after this, a satellite went over from west to east, all the other satellites were going north to south or south to north-cant remember now. Never saw anything like this before, pretty wierd, you would agree if you had seen it. I remembered the west-east satellite for reference and checked all my times with the clock in the kitchen. I dont believe aliens were taking pictures but when I went back inside, I made sure all the doors were locked.... I will take my video camera out with me tonite in case it was a re-occuring type thing.<n>

We were facing North, looking almost exactly straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not very good at describing distances, but the activity occurred I would guess a few thousand feet over normal air traffic.  It was a small bright orange light that seemed to be dancing around.  My husband and I couldn&#39;t make out what could have been causing it.  We know two things for sure based on the abnormalities of the object&#39;s movement and the level it was at - it was not an airplane, and was not a light from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far us the observers go, my husband and I consider ourselves level-headed people, and really were amazed that the only conclusion we had was that it was a UFO, and we actually think it was either of military or alien origin.  Strange for us, but that&#39;s all we could come up with.  I am a software developer, and he is a financial analyst.  So...all in all...two normal people who know they saw something that wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in June 2001 is approximate.  PD))<n>

I only had to look for about min. when I noticed a moving light. It seemed to appear out of a heart shaped pattern in the sky which was roughly 90 deg straight up from my position in Greenwood.  Directly after this, I noticed that not only was I seeing and object, I was seening 3 points of light triangular in shape moving at the same speed and never getting any nearer or further from each other. This entire object or group of objects was moving to the south-east at a very steady pace only seeming to get slower as it neared the horizon.  All three lights seemed to be the same in intensity as well as size.  If these were seperate objects, they must have been at least 700 to 800 miles apart if not more.  It was about a 2 finger widths distance the hand measure.  I went inside and told my friend that he needed to come see this and He saw the same thing for about 20 more seconds before a gradual decrease in brightness caused the object/s to not be visable.  It would be important to note here that the decrease in brightness happened about 18-20 deg above the horizon.  I have heard of Geo Syncronized Satelites and geo-stationary as well. I am assuming that Geo Syncronized means several satelites are syncronized to do work like global mapping and such.  To do such work effectively would take at least 3 satelites to triangulate a position to be compared to the ground ;ie (temprate rainforest studies) and so on.  This might be the most logical explaination to my sighting and to a another reported sighting that was in May-Englewood California. Please let me know what you are thinking on this.  I have found the use of a stealh blimp to be an interesting yet unlikely scenerio.  What I saw and what the unamed lady described her report match perectly, and what I say would have been to large and to high if it were a blimp.  Keep in mind my veiw of the rest of the sky was unobstructed .  Thank You for your time.

We were watching the stars. When I noticed three stars that had been sitting in the same spot all night start to move across the sky at a constant pace, then stop for a few seconds, then they would move up the sky, stop, then move across the sky. This continued for one to two minutes before the objects were completely out of my view. I cannot really say if it was one big craft, or three smaller crafts, but they formed a perfect right triangle, and moved at the same speed, and stopped at the same time the entire length of the event. My parents tried to write them off as satelites moving across the sky, but we all know that satelites don&#39;t form perfect geometeric shapes, and stop in random spots across the sky, and more so with a satelites they need to be constantly moving to stay in orbit. Now the object or objects never really passed close to the ground, the entire time they maintained a pretty high altitude, and I did not have a pair of binoculars handy to closely examine it, so I could not tell if there were smaller lights around the three main lights.<n>

Let me explain further of my sighting. My friend and I were sitting and talking in front of his home on a warm June (Sunday) night. We both were talking on how are day went and mind you we were never under the influence of any kind of narcotic or alcohol for that mater. Both of us are in the status of the upper middle class society (at least I am uper middle class).Well, so we both sat talking when we heard an &#34;intense whistling and displacemnet of air&#34;. These sounds are not foreign to us, for we both heard them at least 10 other times the last year and a half. After hearing these &#34;intense whistling and displacements of air&#34; all was quiet again (except the loud planes from O&#39;Hare airport). Sitting proceeding with our conversations I saw an intense bright object in the shape of a circle floating in the western sky.At first I thought it was a visible star/planet but this was much more intense in lighting. It was flying northbound, but as it &#34;hovered&#34; north it gradually faded until nothing of it was visible. A few minutes later we heard the &#34;intense whistling displacement of air&#34; seemingly right above of where we sat. My friend has a street light/lamp in front of his home that has always shone (at night) as long as we both could remember, which suddenly turned off and we were imersed in darkness. At this point both of us were quite scared and I had to go. Wanting my friends company on the way home, we heard the same &#34;intense whistling and dispplacement of air&#34; above us. When we arrived at my house, which is only down the block, my friend needed me to drive him back home. Granted, he only had to walk about a block to go home but that is to show how sacred my friend was. Indeed, I too was quite affriad so after I dropped my friend off and parked my car I ran inside my home in utter terror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the witnesses apparently have experienced the same phenomenon on many occasions in the recent past, it makes us wonder whether they are hearing the vortex turbulence generated by the wings of aircraft passing low overhead.  If Harwood Heights is on the approach to a major airport, that might be the explanation.  PD))<n>

I was heading northbound on I-82, about 5 miles outside of Selah, WA in Yakima County.  The lights were too large to be from a plane, and they were not moving at all.  They appeared to be up too high to be attached to the ground.  These lights were pretty close together which also ruled out the possiblity of them being planes as well.  They were stationary the entire time that I saw them.  The color was a white-yellow color; very similar to normal car headlights.  I did not notice any particular shape that these lights formed. They were very brigt for about 2 minutes, and one by one they began to fade out without moving during this process.  After a few seconds from the time they began fading, they were completely gone.  I know that the other cars on I-82 at this location and time couldn&#39;t have missed noticing these lights.  They were much too bright, and were basically in the middle of nowhere.<n>

It made no noise and was hovering. It did not move for about 3 minutes. There were lights on the object.  It was about 10 stories up. It was about 30 feet across. After about three minutes, the lights on the craft went out, but it remained above us. Some smoke came out of it, but it was not exhaust. Then it moved away slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

There were three main groups, all moving together, but the outer groups contained more &#34;units&#34; than the center one.  They appeared to be orange-gold but that could have been the setting sun reflecting off them.  They moved extremely fast with no sound.  Each unit moved laterally and vertically within the formation while still heading east, so that the term &#34;dancing&#34; came to mind.  Then they disappeared below the horizon.<n>

My daughtersaid she saw something in the sky. We looked and all saw what seemed to be a bright high flying object in space. I thought it was a comet. However we kept watching the dark  sky with &#34;NO MOON OUT&#34; and we had seen 4 more of these things the were flying close to the Saturn star but in various directions. Some faded out and came back into focus. One got very bright for a few seconds. I have looked into the sky for many years and I have never seen anything like this in my life.. After almost one hour we had seen no more and went home. Some of the bright objects where larger that others. All 5  were white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

I turned to my brother to tell him to look at it.  He saw it by looking up through the sunroof so it must have moved up higher. I turned right off 4th st. and stopped to observe it for about 4 minutes which it was now stationary and about 45 degrees up with a white light omitting off it. We left for home leaving it behind and the next morning I went back to the same spot at the same time just to view the sky to see if there is anything that I could have mistaken it for. No stars, nothing.<n>

All i will say as yesterday in the Wilmington, DE area i was laying outside my pool. Staring into the sky for no apparent reason other then to look at the clouds that were passing by. The clouds had covered the sun.  I was staring into the sun area as i had sunglasses on. I stared for about 10 minutes up at the clouds not looking for UFOs blah blah. I live right near Philadelphia airport and have seen many airplanes etc and hear engines all the time. This, this was different, I couldnt believe my eyes.  There amongst the clouds was a circular shape. 5 inches in diameter at least 12000 feet in the air.  The clouds were high yesterday the ones that we had.  There was no airport takeoffs or landings at the time i saw this object. Is kind of wierd but for about 10 minutes there was no jet engines nothing. In the clouds i could see the circular shadow of an object curving toward the thicker clouds.  I started pointing up to the sky, my fiance was next to me as well as about 10-12 other people. I couldnt say anything i just pointed in awe.  The clouds were thicker toward the philly area and that was when it took off into the thicker clouds.  No engine noise no nothing.  I know what i saw. Be it a ufo or hi tech govt vehicle is was nothing of this planet in my honest opinion.  I dont know what it was but i do know it had perfect symetrical form from where i was laying it was about 5 inches in diameter it had to be at least 10000 feet in the air, as the clouds were super hi yesterday.  And that is my story.  Next thing i know i couldnt stop thinking of it all day.  I have no photographs i have no video only my words to describe it. Believe or dont i dont really care. Im writing this cause I saw something yesterday. Something that changed my views of the world and what is out there. Something is and its not human. I saw it with my own eyes.<n>

At 2345 I saw one sat.moving west to east,it was to the north of me.Then at 2350 I saw what I thought was 3 sat. moving in formation from the north west to the south east. I have seen sat. before but never in a group and never in that direction (I always thought sat. went straight east-west or north south Or vise versa)These objects were in a triangle with the leading edge having 2 and the 3rd behind the left side.(if you had a square and blacked out the bottom right corner thats what it looked like). They were moving steady like sat. but slower than any I&#39;ve seen in the past and on this night.I watched them for probably 60 sec. before I desided to go inside and wake my wife up and have her come out and see what she saw. This probably took another 60 sec. to get her shoes and coat and her outside(I was afraid they would be gone).But they were still there I pointed them out and asked my wife what she saw(I had just told her that I wanted to show her something)and she verified what I had seen. She was able to watch them for probably 30-45 sec. before we lost site of them behind the trees. While we were still out side at 2400we saw 2 sat. moving north to south and south to north they passed each other very close to each other and almost over head. I know that these were probably just sat. but like I said I&#39;ve never seen them like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness was observing satellites.  We believe, further, that the three satellites moving in formation may have been the ones that are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system.  They have been reported to us since July 1996.

Changed as it went to smaller and yellow, then smaller yet and white.  Did not observe any tail -- just the light. Interestingly, I heard a very loud sound, much like a jet aircraft reving up it&#39;s engines, about 5 seconds before this.  I did not see the jet, which is why I went outside to look in the first place.  No other jets were heard before or after.  Am located about 20 miles north, north-west of Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Conditions were apparently clear, but city lights prevented observing how clear it was -- stars not visible.  I suspect this was a meteor but figured I&#39;d report it anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see reports from other locations in the U. S. for this date.  PD))<n>

((brother)) was and still lives there in Sacramento, Ca. (Rancho Cordova is a suberb of Sac) he called to tell me he &amp; his wife &amp; two kids were watching a UFO as he spoke to me. I told him to go &amp; get his video camera and film it. He had his wife (Maria) go and get it and they began filming it. It was north of Sacramento area over the city of Auburn, Ca. It was simply hovering not moving and was a good mile or so above the Auburn foothills. During the time they watched it two smaller UFOs came &amp; docked with it and then left again. He was able to get the second smaller UFO on film as it left at a speed of hugh magnatute. It shot away so fast you almost miss it if you do not watch the film carefully. It turned colors at will but the camera did not capture the colors for some reason? After it had been there for approx 25 min or so it began shoting a beem of light or perhaps a lazer? down at my brothers home! the beam hit his neighbors roof then started torwards my brother and his two kids, when he told me that I told him to get them all inside and close the door and the curtains asap! Later that evening both my brother &amp; I began making calls to the TV stations etc. This was what was so amazing--- nobody had reported it or called anywhere to report it! It was as if it were able to match their demesions or brain waves in such a way so that only they four saw it! The city of Sacramento is hugh as well as dozens of surounding suberbs and smaller towns all around and yet no-one saw this ufo or reported it! My brother mailed me the VHS tape of it and after watching it three or four times I looked online for a ufo center to send it to. It was Peter Gershwens (sic--Gersten)) UFO site. He emailed me after receiving the tape and viewing it to say it was a lousy filming job that only showed two dots one leaving the other. No thanks for sending it in no other questions nothing! Just a complaint that my brother did a lousy job of filming t! he sight ing. I was so angry that I ignored Peters email and told my brother if he ever saw another to just ignor it and don&#39;t even bother filming it since nobody seems to care. I am only sending this email because of something that I noticed when listening to a couple of sightings you had on Art Bells program this evening. That is-- the fact that in some sightings only a handful of people can see the UFOs! The hugh sighting over Phonix AZ. only a few saw why? I belive they have a way of aligning the dimesionial area they are in with the areas or perhaps brain rythims of those who are allowed to watch? You may be able to contact the other Peters UFO sight and get a copy of this sighting as I sent the original to him. Also accourding to christains the UFOs are belived to be the vehicles used by the angeles. Also as I have studied escatology for approx 15 years now I have found information from the now unsealed book of Daniel that the fallen angels along with Satan are to be cast down by Michael and the Lords angeles in the late spring or early summer of 2006. Please-- Simply note my information rather then erasing it because if it does occur it will serve as a witness of the fact that the Lords word in the Holy Bible is real and accurite. There are two other prophecys to note between now &amp; 2006 first on July 5th of either 2004 or 2005 Terror such as the terror that occured on 911 will occur again, only it will be any type of terror attack on the US. And second the phophecy states &#34;missle 2004 N.Y.&#34; It does not say if the missle blows up or not only that New York state or City will have some sort of nuclear missle or perhaps dirty bomb missle attack attempted. (Please note also that 911 was prophecised along with dozens of others all being 100% correct---as well) I hope this helps in some way, please do not post my personal info or email address on your open web site. Only what was put for brothers my report<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we looked to the SW, I spotted what looked at first like a white balloon being carried upwards very rapidly. The cloud deck was at about 8,oooft and the object went above them to about 10,000ft and then hovered as if caught in an air pocket. Several other people thought it looked like a grocery type white bag, but there was a smaller piece of a white object that we saw traveling along with the larger &#34;bag&#34;. It looked unattached. After about 15 minutes of being &#34;motionless&#34; the objects started to climb higher until they were out of site to the SW. About 25 people around us saw and watched the objects climb. I&#39;ve been to many airshows over the years and never saw anything like this before - it definetly was not a balloon. I was monitoring the radio freqs of the airport, but nothing was mentioned about the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome additional reports from other witnesses to this incident.  It does seem odd to us that a simple bag, containing either hot air or helium, would continue to rise so far in such a short period of time, rise above the clouds, and then continue to rise out of sight.

We were walking toward our car which was in parking lot N4.  As we neared Balmer Hall I happened to look up to watch aircraft coming from the northeast on their approach toward Seatac. Planes have always fascinated me and was a Private Pilot for a number of years. When I looked up I noticed a stationary, apparantly rectangular, black object in the sky directly over the north east end of the UW campus which seemed to be at an altitude considerably above the approaching aircraft.  I called to my wife, who immediately looked up and observed the same object.  At first we thought it might possibly be a large bird.  We dismissed that idea since it wasn&#39;t moving, didn&#39;t have the shape of a bird and appeared to be way too large for its apparant distance from us. We also considered that perhaps something had fallen off an approaching aircraft. Once again we ruled that out since the object seemed to be above the approaching aircraft.  After 15 to 20 seconds the object began to move very smoothly at a very high rate of speed in a Northeast direction directly opposite the path of the approaching aircraft.  At approximately 30 seconds from the time we first observed the object we lost it from sight behind some trees. We discussed the sighting all the way home and have concluded it did not fall into any of the usual bird/aircraft sightings in our experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length over the telephone.  The husband is a former military officer, who considers himself to be quite capable of being able to identify aircraft.  He is insistent that the object they witnessed from the University of Washington campus on this graduation day was not any kind of aircraft that he is familiar with.  PD))<n>

Not caring, because of so many planes and helicopters I went in and used the restroom.  When I walked back outside I noticed that the object was moving at a very slow pace.  At first I said it was a helicopter and then it started to fly sideways giving my friend and myself it&#39;s first view.  It was really high in the sky but the object moved vertically and horizontally.  I went to my truck and pulled out my video camera and shot what we saw.  It was square and moved side to side and up and down while I was recording it.  There was no sounds of a propeller or jet noise.  Then we lost it because of the darkness that had occured.<n>

I live near a very wooded area, there are NO small airports around the area.   I was sitting on my back porch, along with my friend.  Previously that night I saw a flying object land far out in the woods (about a mile). I didn&#39;t think much of it, although I see the same occurance very often.  A few hours later, at 3:47 hours, I heard strange noises coming from the exact area where the flying object landed.  The only thing I can compare the noises to is steal beams being hit together very rapidly, no one lives in those wood so it&#39;s not likely it was coming from a house or factory.  About 1 minute into the beam noises, I heard sevral animals or something like that sqealing very loudly, from the same wooded area, I started to feel really nauseated so I went inside and looked from inside, I was also too scared to stay outside, i&#39;ve never heard anything like this before.  The noised went on for about 10 minutes (thats a rough estimate) until they stopped. About 5 minutes after they stopped the flying object lifted from the woods but when it was in the sky (red lights) It split into two objects (airplane like objects this time but no noises they were silent) each object went in opposite directions, I then stopped looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from this area.  We will contact the students who submitted the report and invite them to photograph the alleged landing site, and contact a local investigator.  PD))<n>

This particular night my girlfriend pointed to a small group of what looked to be satellites moving across the lower eastern sky. The night was extremely clear so what we were viewing was without question objects at satellite height moving south at a clear constant, no flashing lights, no noise. The formation was as three objects, one leading two more following. The two following were in a stack formation. Picture if you will four dots forming a box with the top right dot not visable (right angle formation). We observed this for just a couple of seconds when my girlfriend pointed to a fourth object trailing from the north moving on the same plane but at a very high rate of speed easily catching up to the formation. It closed the gap so fast that it made my girlfriend exclaim that it was going to collide with the lower rear object. But without any hesitation the object dipped below and overtook the bottom rear object turning upward toward the top rear object circling over the top as to make a half figure eight then heading downward and toward the leading object. These movements were flowing,no jerky movement,as if doodling on paper. Never slowing or moving out of formation the three objects remained on a steady course. The fourth object overtook the leading object and narrowly missing it passed below it excelerating twice to three times the speed of the formation. Now the fourth object was now heading in a southwestern direction. That fourth object was out of view in just a blink of an eye. The three in formation stayed on course as if programed to do so eventually disapearing to the southern night sky. I know that what I saw was extroidinary. Nothing made on planet earth moves at that speed with that kind of movement at that height with someone or something at the controls. But if we do have aircraft capable of such flight we are being kept in the dark ages by a organization much more powerful and secretative than anyone could possibly imagine. To this day my girlfriend is still quite scared and somewhat reluctant to talk about that night. Also, what we viewed that night we told to my parents and family that very morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have seen planes in this area before, but usually they are high and just passing over from St. Louis to Kansas City. This night, this plane looked &#34;odd&#34;. It had two bright lights on the front and no blinking lights.  I stopped the truck and turned the engine off but I was a little too far away to get a good look.  I figured it was a (regular) plane.  The next night, Friday, at just about the same time, it was the same route, only with a slight variation which put me closer to the path of this &#34;plane&#34;. Once again I stopped the truck and turned off the engine.  I watched as it flew almost overhead.  I thought, that&#39;s odd, it looked triangular, it had three whitish lights on each tip, but I was still thinking it was a plane, and then I saw the red light in the center of the triangle, it appeared larger than the white ones and I also noticed smaller lights which seemed to be closer to the body of the craft, so that the others seemed to protrude. Then it hit me that this might not be a conventional aircraft! It traveled a path, each night, from northwest, making an arc just about the 122 mile marker on highway 70 and then heading southwest. Northwest direction would be the direction that Whiteman AFB is and the home of the Stealth.  It wouldnt surprise me to find out that this was a Stealth aircraft. I did call Whiteman and spoke with the airflight control, who told me they didnt know what the underside of the Stealth looked like at night. So no info there.. Nor were they aware of any flights at those times, but...? I assured them I wasnt a spy, of course if I were I would all ready know all this! I am a UFO investigator though, MIG: Missouri Investigators<n> <n><n> <n><n> roup,(B.Becker@iname.com)and I have taken reports describing exactly this same type of craft.  I dont know what it is, or whose it is, but I know its here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Barbara Becker, of MIG in Missouri, for this report.

It was about 8:00pm, fairly clear skies.  My girlfriend noticed something in the sky and pointed it out to me.  It was black, as far as I could tell.. but it was so far away that I guess it could have been some other color.  Anyway, normally I would have thought it was a plane.. but it wasn&#39;t moving at all.  It was just sort of floating there.  My next thought was, &#34;must be a helicopter.&#34;  But it was much, much higher than I&#39;d ever seen a helicopter.  Then again, I&#39;m not an expect on helicopters, so maybe. We kept looking at it and it seemed to change shape a little.. or it was rotating so that I was seeing it from a different angle.  At one point, I _think_ I saw it split into two pieces.  The two pieces remained right next to each other, though, so it could have just been thin in the middle.  The distance may have made it seem like the parts were separate. After about 15 minutes or so, the object was so faint that we lost it. I realize my description has a lot of &#34;seemed like&#34;s and &#34;couldn&#39;t exactly tell because of the distance&#34;s, but that&#39;s the best I can do.  The object wasn&#39;t zipping all over the sky or shooting out laser beams or anything.  It was just behaving in a way that didn&#39;t match what I expect planes/helicopters to do.  Not strange enough for me to yell, &#34;whoa, aliens!&#34; but strange enough to make me look for UFO sighting pages on the web.  Take that however you like.<n>

Red Green White flashing not very fast but fast enough.

Its color was the same made by copper when exposed to a flame.  It was just north of northeast and was about the size of my little finger nail when held at arm&#39;s length. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon and travelled downward in a straight line at about a 45 degree angle.  It travelled rapikly and disappeared below the visible horizon.  I am 65 years old, hold two degrees and am a manager at a local utility.

I had parked my car at the side of the road and had walked down an embankment I had gone about 50 yards down the embankment when I heard what sounded like a rocked taking off and the sound was coming toward me..it sounded as if it was coming straight towards me and then the sound suddenly stopped. I had put the incident out of my mind and continued on with my photography. I began a northerly trek in the woods and what ever it was it was directly over the tree tops and it sounded as if it had taken back off in a very loud high pitched sounded that left my ear drums buzzing. By this time I was close to the roadway. I ran back to my car and drove approx. 100 yards to a opening in the canopy overlooking the valley..you could see at least 30 miles in every direction...there was no sign of any type of aircraft..civillian, military, or anything else even mechanized to make such a noise.

About 20 degrees up in the sky, over the horizon of the west side of Budd Inlet, a very bright white light held steady and very slowly moved up into the sky over a period of 45 minutes and then dissapeared behind the clouds. At first we thought it was a very bright star or a planet, but then it moved, and we realized it was at least 4 times as big and bright as the biggest star or satellite we had ever seen. When we viewed it in the binoculaurs, it appeared that there was a bright white &#34;electric&#34; ring buzzing around a greyish object. Interestingly, the object was just above the Fort Lewis base near Tacoma, where we can see bright flashes and feel the ground rumble whenever they test artillery - sometimes as late as 12 midnight. This may have been an experimental military aircraft, given it&#39;s location, but whatever it was, it was unlike anything we had seen before and certainly gave us all the chills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received no other reports of this incident that we are aware of.

It felt so close to the ground, that I felt the ground vibrating in my living room. I was kind of scared to look outside, but I did anyway, so I look out my living room window, and see just stars, but right as I was about to look away, I saw the stars moving!! I look back up, and I realize that there was a huge huge aircraft that seemed to be trying to cloak itself. at the beginning, it had a pointed shape, and the rest of it I really couldn&#39;t tell. It flew very very slowly over my house. It seemed to create a shadow over my neighborhood. So I went to the backyard to get a better look at it. If it weren&#39;t flying so slow, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to see the outline of the ship. all the stars that I saw, I think were the lights of the u.f.o.. Part of its cloaking device.

Admittedly, the light was obscured because of the trees so I don&#39;t know the true shape.  The light was fairly close to the left of the moon, as it faces the earth.  I do not know if what I saw was a planet or a star and I&#39;m hoping someone can let me know if that is the case.

They looked up and saw a craft that resembled a &#34;flying submarine&#34; with three lights on it (red in front, then green, then blue all in a line on the right side).  It appeared right over their heads just above the tree line by the house they were at, and it followed the driveway down to the next tree line whereupon it suddenly shot off upwards and to the right and quickly disappeared towards the moon (NE) which was close to being full.  The object was charcoal grey color in the dark night sky. THe three lights on the object were blinking rapidly like a stobe.  All of the witnesses were frightened by the experience.

There is a slight possibility of about 20 minutes of missing time but not all of them can agree on this.<n>

This thing had lights coming from it and a faint glow on the body of it, and as I said a dust/exhaust thing following it. I pulled out a pair of binoculars from my backpack and when I put them up to my eyes this thing darted across the sky toward the North.

6/6/01 00:15|Lake Mills|IA|Light|?|Confusing light in North Iowa|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17971.html|268|ndxe200106| Confusing light in North Iowa<n> <n><n> <n><n> I frequently sit and chat with a friend after work. Last night we were both admiring the clouds which were nicely highlighted by the moon. We eventually noticed an amber colored light just to the west of the moon. At first we thought it was a star, but instead of twinkeling it sort of pulsated, also it appeared to be infront of the main haze of the atmosphere but behind the lower clouds as there were absolutely no other stars viewable. It seemed to stay approxamately the same distance from the moon and gave the faint impression of rotation. Neither of us had any binoculars of course so we simply sat and watched it. With the moon highlighting the clouds it was apparent which ones were more dense and which clouds were very thin. This is important because the light would appear through some of the thicker clouds but would disappear behind a mere wisp of cloud. The light also caught our attention because it seemed to be about twice the size of a star, it didn&#39;t move as fast a a plane, and it gave the impression of being oblong ( wider to the front, or the western side; than at the back, the eastern side). We saw it again tonight, same place,same time, same location in the sky; but tonight (06/07/01) it doesn&#39;t seem to pulsate as much and also it gives a stronger impression of rotation.  I suppose there is probably a natural explanation for this but I simply can&#39;t think of one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing a celestial body, either Mars, or a bright star.

I said, &#34;NO RIGHT ABOVE YOU. &#34; He looked straight up and said &#34;What the H--- is that?&#34; We both saw an objejct kind of shaped like a peanut, is the best way to discribe it, Round on both ends and thin the middle, it almost looked like a Transport helicoptor.  But there was NO Sound what so ever, it was totaly silent. It looked like metal and just the city lights making the bottom of it glow like a very dull reflection, He said he can see 3 light on it, I coulndn&#39;t. The object was heading due North comming from the South, it was about 2500 feet off the ground and we are guessing it was traveling about 150 mph or faster, but there was NO SOUND WHAT SO EVER. I have no idea what it was I have never seen or ever heard of anything like it, to this day we still are talking about it.<n>

I took out the dog at 9 PM and noticed a cloud about 5 miles out in the ocean East north East of our East facing condo that was all lit up from the inside as if a continous bolt of lightning was inside the cloud.  Then I saw a very intense light like a fireball come out of the cloud horizantaly to the West  then go back into it.  I ran and grabed my video camera and began taping this when a second cloud lit up.  The lights faded after a couple more minutes.  As I waited for the lights to return, I could hear a small airplane near by but could not see it.  Then it appeared in the street lights as it flew low over some houses south of hear.  The plane had NO lights and was coming from the direction of the clouds out in the ocean.  I had just enough time to point and film the airplane with the camera on night shot and focus set to infinity.  I went to play back the footage and see what I had captured.  There was only a small segmant of the cloud on the tape becuase the screen went blue.  Im certain I was taping because the adio footage of me and the neigbor talking is on the tape.  The screen was blue for the plane footage as well.<n>

It got about as bright as a streetlight, and at first I though that was what it was.  It was to low and silent to be an aircraft. As I kept watching it it seemed to sort of slowly and almost imperceptibly bob, for a couple moments I was wondering if it was me rather than the light that was moving, then it moved to my left behind some trees and I lost sight of it. It was just the one light, like a streetlight no craft that I saw. I am a college student and fulltime cook and have never seen anything tnat I would call a UFO before.<n>

The porch light was on.  A car had passed by in the neighborhood and it sounded as if it had just blown a tire a block or so away before approaching our (my fiance and I) house.  This is unrelated, I&#39;m sure.  I am always aware of my surroundings and we do get many military craft flying in to the local military base.  I noticed a what appearded to be an aircraft flying in toward Tacoma from the West.  This is not a normal flight path but some planes do fly in this direction I suppose headed toward Sea Tac or Boeing Field in Seattle.  At first I noticed the color of the light wasn&#39;t &#39;normal&#39; - more of a reddish/orange light.  And I was wiating for familiar &#39;wing lights&#39; to be present.  This was a single light and it appeared to be moving in a very straight (due East) direction.  I watched it for a few seconds and maybe after 20 seconds or so I noticed the light dimming (this object appeared to be headed toward my direction) and slightly dip dramatically straight down and disappear.  This is hard to judge distance (of course) but if my field of view was shown in a photograph I suppose the &#39;dipping&#39; of the object would be measured as 1/4 inches on an 8X10 photo.  So, this didn&#39;t dip very far before disappearing.  There were clouds present and this object appeared behind the clouds but was very visible. I have never reported a sighting before.  I wanted to report this and am sure other&#39;s saw this.  I am not aware of any other places to make a report to - I suppose I could contact the newspaper, but don&#39;t know if it would be treated with any credibility.<n>

We have sporadic clouds right now and a very bright moon. As I looked up, I saw what appeared to be a star to the West of my location. As soon as I saw it, the object began to get a bright white color leading me to think that the object was an aircraft on approach to our local airport. Just then, the object moved very quickly to the right(or North)of its original position very quickly and disappeared behind cloud cover. I am going to take my nightshot videocam out and see if it appears again. There were two distinct &#34;orbs&#34; of light but whether or not it was one or two objects I cannot be certain.<n>

I was walking South and casually observing large geese(?) by a puddle. A flying object came into my peripheral vision on my right.  I presumed it was another goose and didn&#39;t look directly at it at first.  When I finally looked up, I saw a slightly elongated Stop-Sign shaped object (octagon?) with a hole in the middle.  I was a bit stunned and attempted to discern if it was cardboard or paper...perhaps a large kite.  It was definitely not either.  It was black and looked approximately 30 feet in diameter.  The hole in the center was 3-5 feet in diameter.  About 100 feet in the air, it traveled Eastward approxmately 25 mph on it&#39;s edge and then made an amazing 90 degree turn moving away from me.  It then appeared to be 2-3 feet thick.  It traveled about 2-3 seconds and then again made a 90 degree turn; resuming it&#39;s original course.  I looked around briefly to see if anyone else was around me and of course, no one was.  I looked at it again and it began to make a slight parabolic turn and disappeared behind some hills in the park. The object made no noise during the entire incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told no one of this incident.  About 60 days later, I was going to Seattle (from McChord AFB) with my boss who began to recant a story when she and her family went to Seattle Lake for the 4th of July.  She began to explain that she saw something in the air.  Before she could finish, I described the object to her.  We were both amazed that we saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that it was &#34;dusk&#34; at &#34;17:30 hrs..&#34;  However, it should still be light at that time of day, so we will attempt to clarify that apparent discrepancy with him.

After examining the object for a few moments it hadn&#39;t changed position at all and made me start to wonder. Out of curiosity I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars to see what is was expecting to have just been over reacting. What I saw through the binoculars appeared to be some sort off-white/tan colored object that was sphereical/disc in shape. After studying it for a few minutes it seemed to rotate around on its horizontal axis exposing its full shape. It was a round object that appeared to be composed of an outer ring surrounding a central sphere/disc type object. Unfortunatly my binoculars wern&#39;t powerfull enough to make out the patterns on the central part of the object clearly, but there was obviously some sort of design/patterns in the central portion. It only alluminated that one color but had a orange light/orb that would come from it, move around a bit, then go back. After looking at this go on for approx 10 minutes I went inside and grabbed my digital camera and took pictures of it. Unfortunatly my camera doesnt have a zoom feature but the light/object is clearly seen in the pictures and if magnified the shape is noticable. After 30 minutes of observing this object to the west I noticed a second object to the south, orange in color and further away. It seemed to bare a resemblence in shape as the one to the west but I couldn&#39;t see it as well. I studied the object to the west from dark till sun rise (Approx 2 hours.) even after all the stars in the sky had gone the object was still very visable. Finally the sun came up in the west blinding any attept to continue looking at the object. In one of my photos the object isn&#39;t where it was and a second grey disc type object is in veiw, much closer. Although I never saw it while I was outside. After some research and photo enhancment it bares some resemblense to a water spot that the camera had poss! ibly con trasted out. I still dont 100% agree with this possibility due to the fact most of the water spots that become visable through enhancment are oval in shape and barely visable. This object is a perfect circle. I wasn&#39;t expecting to see what I did but now I&#39;m changed from being open minded about ufo&#39;s to beleiving, as I&#39;ve seen one with my own eye&#39;s. Either alien or military testing, whatever it was, was much more then anything I&#39;ve even dreamed of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made an error in my report &#34;Occurred : 6/4/2001 04:00 (Entered as : 06/04/01 0400) Reported : 6/6/2001 01:30 Posted : 6/21/2001 Location : Fresno, CA&#34;. the object was in fact in the EAST, NORTH EAST, not west.<n>

It was going the same direction as I was.  My first thought was a shooting star, however I have never seen one this color before.   There was no streaking.  Height is hard to determine but it seemed to be no more than 100&#39; above the pavement.

We left the motel at 11:07 pm stoped and talked for about 10 min, as we were walking down Hillside Ave my girlfriend noticed a light in the sky. It wasn&#39;t bright or glowing as most UFO&#39;s are discribed at first glimpse I thought it was a plane, then she pointed out the the pattern of the lights which were really weird and we know it wasn&#39;t a plane because the height at which it was flying we would of definatly heard it and it was moving extreamly slow. We watched it for about 5-7 min then it started to move at average speed of plane in flight. I made a joke and said that the only way we would know it is a UFO was if we were to see a couple of jets go after it and like 2 min after making that statement we heard a loud noise and looked up and saw 4 jets going after the craft. When the jets got closer, the craft took at sucha tremdous speed it was unbeliveible.<n>

On a call, I watched a storm cloud moving South, low ceiling, coming directly over the city.  A glimmer caught my eye, underniether the storm cloud, of which I observed 5 pill/saucer aircrafts.  The crafts stayed in relatively close proximity of each other.  They would swing out, in a free flight circle pattern.  Each in a different direction.  This would be my best explaination of what thier movements were like:  They had no boundries as to which direction or speed.  The would scramble from a certain &#34;dot pattern&#34;.  As Braille is a series of &#34;dot patterns&#34; to reprent a certain letter/number, the crafts would swing out tens of yards, and return to the central point, and creat a new &#34;dot pattern&#34;.  It was a sort of a communication dance.  I ran to the other room and 5 co workers came over to the window to see.  I pointed the crafts out and we each stood in excited silence.  As they watched, I scanned the storm cloud.  At the very south tip of the could (front edge), I saw a 6th ship entirely motionless, as if supervising the Communication Dance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape and color of the ships were interesting as well.  They were a pill shaped, most likely the size of a minivan.  They were at to much of a distance to see any detailed caps, lids, handles, or symbols.  Their undersides were a dark shade, possibly to camoflauge when looking up at them, from underniether a storm cloud.  The tops were a very metallic silver, which would glimmer off the afternoon sun, at such an angle to beam under the approaching storm cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -6 total Ships -A Communicational Dance -Metallic roofs, and Dark underbellies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -2:00 in the afternoon, plarty cloud sky, storm cloud approaching -My high vantage point from downtown Denver -Ships mainly over Stapleton/Commerce City/Rocky Flats area -Low pressure level storm cloud, which the ships were under, so they weren&#39;t very high in the sky (maybe Traffic Helicoper heights) -No lights were seen on ship, fore the time of day -No exhast trails present -No haze, ships has a very clear appearance -All Ships were of the same &#34;make &amp; model&#39;, thus objects not emitted from each other -No beams, just a lot of motion and apparent intentional movement -No change in color, solid colors of the structure -No landings -No sound, due to our distance -No aircraft in the vicinty, but Stapleton is Denver&#39;s old airport, and there are Military bases in the area, as well as D.I.A.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -No physical distruptions in our vicinty due to activity I, and my co-workers, were Internet Service Technicians working on a sunday afternoon.

As the jet passed,  I caught sight of another object, oval-shaped, light-colored with a dark circular spot in the center.  I was looking up at a steep angle so could only see the bottom of the object.  The only reason I spotted it was because the sky was overcast with dark clouds that day.  With a normal clear sky I would have never seen this object. It was slowly moving from north to south with a slight oscillating wobble about the vertical central axis.  Althought the object had a definite shape, the edges were oddly indistinct as though viewed through diffuse glass.  When it reached a spot due east of me, it stopped and hovered for a minute before almost leisurely continuing on south until out of sight.<n>

As I walked past the window, I saw a very bright light in the sky. As singapore can hardly see very big stars, I am postive that it was not a star. The size of the bright light was a few hundred times bigger and brighter than the normal stars. Also, I am sure it was not a plane as it just stayed at the exact spot for more than 10 minutes. I cannot see any red or green lights as seen in normal aircrafts. I waited for some time and when back to sleep. The next night, the light was not there. Another observation was the light appeared lower and nearer than the normal stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may describe Mars.

We were in the middle of nowhere and decided we had to sleep in the van.  We were parked along the road beside the Black Mesa trailhead.  The almost full moon was very bright and was lighting up the unfamiliar landscape.  My husband and I got out and thought about putting up our tents but I heard a buzzing and decided to just sleep in the car,as the kids were already asleep and I didn&#39;t want to wake them and have them cry out in the night. My husband got a sleeping bag and put it down on the passenger side of the van.  Before I took my glasses off, I looked around and noticed there was no lights to be seen in any direction. I slept for a couple of hours and something woke me up at 1:43.  I raised my seat and put on my glasses and looked to my right to see black cows mooing and sniffing around my husband.  While I worried about him being trampled by cows, I looked around at  the desert landscape.  I looked out my driver&#39;s side window and saw a large blue disk shaped light.  It was below the horizon, so I got the feeling it was on the ground. It&#39;s color was pretty much the color of a blue street light, but it was much too big to be a street light. It was shimmering.  I thought that maybe there was a lake in that direction and the moon was reflecting off of it.  I went back to sleep, but would wake up every now and then to see if it was still there.  I am sure it was there for at least two hours, maybe more. As soon as it was light enough, I looked in that direction expecting to see a lake or a barn or house, but there was nothing there.  It couldn&#39;t have been more than a mile or so away due to the fact there were hills in the way. I estimate the object was about mini van size.  It never moved while I was looking at it and the light and color didn&#39;t change.<n>

Looking up at the sky, like I always do when I sit on my porch.   I noticed two pulsating blue lights that seemed to be as big a dimes when I scaled them with my fingers. These objects seemed to me to be observing the surrounding area.  They were top shaped but I really could not make out thier shape. I&#39;m a banker and strongly believe in the existence of UFO&#39;s.  I do know the difference of conventional aircraft and satalites.  I&#39;d say these objects were about a 1/2 mile up in the air.  They were motionless in the sky except for the one which was cruising around the stationary one.  I called out to my roomate and told her  to come see what I was looking at, but she wasn&#39;t available.  I kept watching them and they started blinking in and out, that&#39;s when they started flashing and blinking to different points in the sky further and further away from eachother.   Really amazing and kind of beautiful at the same time.  Finally they left the view of the horizon and left to go god knows where.

We were sitting on a bench, looked up (in the direction of the land, not the ocean) and saw a large, very circular and bright white/yellow light hovering in the sky that appeared out of nowhere.  It would move slightly, but was practically still.  We heard no sounds, although, if there were any, they likely would have been drowned out by the music.   We stared and did not speak, watching the object move forward slightly through the clouds.  Then the object disappeared, analogous to someone turning off a light.   After it disappeared, my friend and I looked at each other and confirmed what we had both seen.  Two other couples sitting on benches to our left had the same gaping mouth expression as we did, and asked if we had seen the light as well.  While we were recent high school graduates, the two other couples were in their mid- to late-60s. Others at the lighthouse may have seen it, but the 6 of us were away from the action, not facing the direction of the event.  We had no clear explanation for what it could have been.  There were no fireworks or searchlights at the event.  We were ridiculed by family members, who insisted that our sighting was related to nearby military facilities.  Although it was now 6 years ago, I still get chills thinking about the event, which I remember as clear as day.  I would love to know if others that were there saw the same light, but unfortunately, I do not remember the exact date (I would estimate it being early to mid June of 2001).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was sitting behind my dad, who was driving. It was late at night, probably around 11pm. I had the strangest feeling that I was being watched... I turned and looked to my left, towards the mountain-side, less than a second later, a large round globe lit up, red and orange. There were no lights on it, just a solid glow. Light did not reflect off of other objects around it like trees, rocks, or shrubs. It seemed to immediately shield or barrier itself with something that seemed &#34;electrical&#34;. No more that a second later, it &#34;catapulted&#34; off the ground incredibly fast, into the sky. It was going away from me, leaving a small white trail. It seemed like it stayed pretty close to the ground, like it wasn&#39;t going very far. The whole thing happened in less than 4 seconds while we were driving! by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the only one in my family who had witnessed this event. A few years later, I mentioned this experience with my dad. He told me that he has seen a couple of red/orange globes flying in the same area. He saw them on two separate occasions. Each time, the were floating within the valley at night, between the mountains. They were described to be about the same size as the one I saw, but they were going slower, maybe a couple hundred miles an hour. They float around then shoot off, out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These events happened on Hwy 49 in California, between the town of Coulterville and the Bagby Recreation Area.  These are my best estimates of my experience; the object was about 200ft round,  about 300 ft behind the edge of the mountain-side closest to the road.  If we stopped the car and climbed to where it was, it probably would have been less than half a mile away.  I couldn&#39;t say if the object made any sounds or not, but it was very graceful.  It looked like it took off quietly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Traveled with &#34;no sound at all&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed object traveling north to south from my front step. I was facing east when I saw the object. It caught my eye at about my 10 o&#39;clock position (east/west axis) 1 o&#39;clock (north/south axis). It continued South, to about my 2 o&#39;clock position, where it faded in the haze.  I observed the object for approximately 8 seconds. My view was blocked for about 1 second by a tree in my yard. The object traveled at a steady rate of speed and appeared not to veer from its southern course. I could not determine its altitude. There was no sound during or after the object passed over my location. The object was the shape of an equilateral triangle, dark in color (slightly darker than the night sky), with what appeared to be dim off-white lights under each corner facing downward. The &#34;lights&#34; on each corner reminded me of the new round LED brake lights used on trucks and buses. The lights were steady in brightness and did not flicker or pulse. After the oject had passed, I wondered why an aircraft would have such lights mounted on the underside. Maybe they weren&#39;t lights. Perhaps this was the visible effects of propulsion.....I don&#39;t know. As a size reference, after the sighting, I cut out a ½-triangle from a piece of paper. Holding the triangle at arm length gave a good size aspect of the object.<n>

Hwy 36, approx. 2 miles east of exit 201 on I-75, and my attention was drawn to thunderheads in front of me where frequent cloud-to-cloud lightning was occurring. After observing several lightning flashes, I saw a large rectangular object passing among the clouds. It did not appear to be moving very fast at all; rather, it seemed to be gliding. Based on the apparent altitude and distance, I could not estimate size; it had to have been enormous. At no time was the entire object visible; I could see (from my perspective) the rear and lower-right sides of the object. It was like a large silver ingot in that it was flattened, with an obvious thickness approximately 1/10 of its width. The most unusual aspect was that although it appeared to be dark in color, when lightning flashed near it, the object was opalescent; it had an oily, reflective shine that magnified the brightness of the lightning. It also remained lit for at least one second after each lightning flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for at least 45 seconds while traveling on Hwy 36; I turned south on High Falls Rd and traveled approximately 200 yards (the object was in view the entire time), and pulled off the road to continue viewing it. I sat on the hood of my car and watched until it was out of sight among the clouds, approximately 3-4 minutes; even after the object was behind/within the clouds I could see the glow from the reflected lightning for several seconds until I drove away and the object and clouds were hidden behind the treeline.	 	The area I observed this is relatively flat, open pasture with two roads (Hwy 36 and High Falls) intersecting at right angles; little or no artificial lighting; the above mentioned treeline is east of High Falls Rd and south of 36. The object and clouds appeared to be 10-15 miles distant, as the thunderheads were not reflecting any ambient light from Jackson, roughly 7 miles east of the observation site. The object was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, traveling east (away from me) very slowly. At no time did I hear any sounds from the object (the distance was too great anyway), nor did it appear to have any lights of its own. It was just a huge slab of metal with squared edges floating in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sorry I can not be more specific about the date; I do know that my oldest son, born in June of 2000, was almost 1 year old; the sighting would have occurred in late spring of 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Starting around 1998 we began to notice silver egg-shaped objects following aircraft around Charlotte International Airport.  I would estimate dozens of clear sightings from 1998 until 2001.  Most of the sightings were on clear, sunny days but some on cloudy, overcast days.  The craft were mostly viewed following south to north, which would be more with departing aircraft but on occasion they would follow aircraft on high-approach, north to south.  Sometimes above and behind and sometimes below and behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am ex-career Air Force so I have a pretty good knowledge of aircraft and flight behavior.  This was always a formation type pursuit as if they were pacing the aircraft.  If I were to judge distance I would estimate up to a quarter of a mile behind at times but on occasion we would see one directly above or below usually 300+ feet from the aircraft.   Objects would pace the aircraft from seconds to a few minutes and sometimes it was not uncommon to see the object switch and follow another aircraft.  This would go on from five to ten minutes and sometimes more.  Altitudes generally ranged from 3000 feet up to 5000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were always silver-metallic and egg shaped.  About a third of the size of the aircraft, generally a commercial airliner, 135 or DC-10.  There were no other markings on the object but you could clearly see it was sphere shaped and no flat surfaces visible.  A very polished and smooth looking object.  When the object left it was in an instant like a bolt of lightning.  Just a streak across the sky and then gone!  Can&#39;t imagine the G-Force it had to undergo when it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never did set a pattern to when they would appear but it was often enough that neighbors and people we knew from around the general area would see them and talk about it.  Occasionally would witness objects with pulsating, multi-colored lights pacing aircraft at night but not very often.   Spent most of my young adult life on or around Air Force bases but have never witnessed anything like that before, or since I left the Lake Norman area.<n>

I live in the country and there are no street lights, so, naturally, I went to check it out.  I remember that our two Labrador retrievers, who are trained as guard dogs, were quiet.  I went outside and was instantly overcome with an icy cold feeling of death.  I could smell the horror around me.  I looked up and saw two pulsating lights flying around about two miles out across the field.  They came closer and closer until I could see that one was a long cigar shape and the other was an upright cylinder, but as soon as I saw the shapes, they both changed to flate plate-like forms. Two other aircraft came into view, and they looked like F16 Fighter planes.  They flew around the objects for a few seconds and then flew off.  Some of my friends that I told said that they remember hearing jet engines on the night of the occurrence.I have studied planes extensively and hope to be a pilot some day, so I could easily recognize them.  I have no memory of what happened from that time until approximately 6:00 the next morning when I woke up lying on my face on our back steps.<n>
