I always see landing lights, but this was different.  It was round in appearance, and had what appeared to be running lights on the bottom that flashed in a circular flashing motion. I watched it, and it was moving very slowly, much slower than approaching aircraft, and this craft itself was about 2-3000 ft. higher than approaching aircraft.  It seemed to be further away than the approaching aircraft in distance and at about 40Â° from the horizon.  It moved very slowly for about five minutes, then turned and went the other way in the same speed.  I thought it was strange, and might have been a helicopter, but it was rather high for a helicopter, not to mention in &#34;restricted airspace&#34;.  Not sure if any pilots might have saw it, but I wouldn&#39;t know how to go about and request that info.  After it changed direction, it continued on at a slow pace towards the east to NJ.  Distance was a factor, so I knew my camcorder would just capture a shaking image of a light with no real help.  If there were any others that saw this object, it would be nice to know, to either confirm my site or disbunk it as a helicopter...<n>

I am on call through the night, keep the tow truck at home and go out when the dispatcher calls me. I got a call at 0415 on Friday, 3/31/00 to tow a truck with slashed tires from Westerly, RI to Perryville, RI. Perryville is off Rt 1 between Charlestown, RI and Matunuck Beach. I picked up the woman and her truck and we were driving down coastal Rt 1 when at the Westerly/Charlestown border I saw a softly glowing orange object (same color as one of those orange creamcicles)directly in front of us. We were traveling due east. It didn&#39;t register as odd because it appeared small and distant. I checked my watch and it was 0505. I kept glancing at it because it was directly in front of us and I asked my rider if she saw it too. She said she did and we discussed it&#39;s characteristics. We watched it steadily for the next ten minutes. When we first saw it it was the size of a baby aspirin at arm&#39;s length. The road was windy at times and the object would disappear behind pine trees. When the road would turn back due east it would appear again in the exact same spot. It was totally motionless and stationary in the sky. We watched it until the Perryville turnoff came up. By this time it was the size of a quarter at arm&#39;s length. Just before we turned off a vertical gray bar appeared at the front of the object and immeadiatly moved to the rear. When this happened the object faded, came back and then disappeared. My rider said &#34;did you see that!&#34; when the gray bar appeared and moved. We both agreed that we had seen the same things. The object tilted about a 10 degree angle to the horizon front to back and about 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon. The sky was clear with no other objects such as airplanes or balloons in view. There was a solid bank of low clouds on the horizon up to about 5 degrees. The object was well above the cloud bank. I consulted a road map that I carry and determined we covered about 10 miles from beginning to end of the sighting. I also figured that the object would be in the vicinity of East Matunuck and Point Judith Pond. This is very close to the ocean.<n>

It was located SE of me along and above the freeway. The light was noticeably brighter than the headlamps of oncomming automobiles. The light was not a point source: it had a visible diameter perhaps 1/10 of the diameter of a full moon. I observed this object for about two seconds. It was stationary above the freeway and I at first thought it to be a police helicopter monitoring traffic. There was enough ambient light (this was post sundown but before twilight) to readily see details on cars and scenery miles away. I had the impression that I could almost see some sort of vehicle behind the bright light in the sky. There were neither wings nor identifying aircraft lights visible on the object. I looked down to size up the traffic around me for no longer than one second and then looked back up to try to identify the airborn object. It was gone. I looked all over the southeastern sky and could see no trace of it. Had it been a helicopter or light aircraft which had simply turned off the light I would certainly have been able to see the craft in the ambient light.<n>

All of a sudden a huge BOOM occured: a very loud, tight-sounding explosion. We ran out of the building and saw nothing, but one of my friends had been sitting outside looking towards the East when the explosion happened. He said he was looking up at the sky behind the house and trees when all of a sudden a sudden super-bright flash occured and it seemed the whole sky turned bright white. All he could see was the brightness and the silouette of the house and trees; Even the house lights were not visible because of the brightness of the sky. And then a split second later a loud boom occured. That was it. We never heard anything else.<n>

At first I thought it was a fire at sone refinery but I&#39;ve been going on this route for 8 weeks and never saw it before. As I passed the area it seamed to stay alined with my truck as thogh it were moving.

The object was moving slow but it may have been moving fast but just so high about 2 feet at arms lenght for about 5 sec,  I have a very good pair of binoculars I had them in hand with in 15 sec after the light blinked out( thats just what it looked like blinkeding out) I scanned the sky for 5 min and never saw anything I was looking for navigation lights thinking that it could have been a very high flying aircraft, I saw nothing, I believe that this was strange, I do not have the math skills to figure out how high an object would have to be to reflect light two hr&#39;s after sunset, it was almost 80` in the sky almost over head. My impression was that this object was large and in space. I was not going to report this matter but after listening to you on Jeffs show I think on 4/16/00 I decided to, I had not thought that it was any big deal because of the lack of details but I had noted the date and the time in my head because of the strangness of and after listening to you the other night and you saying that it&#39;s just a story unless you report it and log it&lt; i have decided to do so.

I remember checking the NUFORC website reports after witnessing a similar object in the same area as described by the individual in the report dated 03/29/00. In my situation, I had just come off of the Mt.Rose Hwy and were headed south on 395. Looking south I was startled by the intensity of an object floating over the foothills (between Steamboat and Washoe). It produced a very bright, equally radiating white light and moved slowly over the hills until it seemed to simply fall from the sky, in the same manner in which an object might roll off a ledge then drop. That&#39;s it. Short lived yet spectacular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other incident was posted 08/18/00 from a gentleman in Gerlach in which he describes 3 seperated objects flying in a triangular pattern, north to south. I&#39;m not sure of the exact dates, but on a couple of occasions in July and August of 2000 I observed 2 individual objects from my home in Steamboat (just south of Gerlach) that paralleled each other and traveled north to south. In checking several websites I found that what I probably saw at the time were the Space Shuttle and the MIR Space Station. Whether or not there was a third object possibly rotated in a non-reflective position ... who knows?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dates indicated by this witness for his sightings may be approximate.

No sound apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:40 PM on March 22, ((NUFORC NOTE:  Should read March 28)) I observed two bright lights (estimated twice as bright as any of the visible stars.  The lights were travelling almost due west and directly overhead when first observed.  they were elongated in the direction of travel (estimated 3:1 ratio) and were situated one behind the other.  I estimate they were separated by about 4-5 degrees of arc.  They appeared to be flickering rapidly (several times per second).  There also appeared to be a very thin line of smaller or dimmer lights connecting the pair.  This, however, could have been an ionization trail or optical afterimage.  The lights maintained the same relative distance as they moved from overhead to about 45 degrees above the western horizon in approximately 10 or 12 seconds.  The lights then swung in a wide arc to the south and vanished behind a cluster of tall pine trees.  During this &#34;swing&#34;, they appeared to move into a side-by-side orientation, rather than the fore-and-aft arrangement when they were travelling west.  At the point where I lost sight of them, they appeared to be about 30 to 35 degrees above the southwestern horizon.  During the entire episode, there was no sound. Weather conditions in the area were thin scattered clouds (elevation unknown) and little wind.  I believe the objects were below the clouds, as they did not appear to dim when passing one or two of the clouds. My first impression was that these were a pair of Air Force fighters on a night training mission.  However, there was no sign of the normal red and green marker lights, and absolutely no sound.  My wife also observed this phenomenon.  After considerable discussion, I decided to report this to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((My apologies for the date error in the report I just submitted.  I grabbed the wrong date off the calendar.  The 03/22/00 date should be 03/28/00.))<n>

The first was two frames..like picture frames, no pictures, just the frames. They were about 2 feet x 1 1/2 feet in size. The frame part looked to be about 2 inches wide. The frame part glowed a fluorescence green.... The other object looked like neon tubing in the shape of a spiral funnel..like a tornado.. it was a white blue.. like lightning. The size of this funnel from my angle looked like it was about 2 feet in diameter and about 3 feet in height. The two frames went up at about a 45 degree angle to maybe 1000 feet. The frames came together, and formed one bar. Then the funnel thing appeared and the frames (bar) disappeared into the funnel, then the funnel was gone. The dark black cloud above was very low. I heard nothing..no sound of any kind. All of this took about 5 seconds. I shook my head.. thinking what the....I looked back to where I saw the first two frames and damm... two more frames..just like the first two..and they did the same thing as the first set of frames. I looked back... for more frames, I waited for maybe 5 minutes but that was it. This event occurred two times within 15 seconds. I was about 75 feet to 100 feet from where all of this happened. I did NOT see anything that resembled any kind of life as we know it. Nor, did I see any vehicle, spacecraft or otherwise. The warehouse lot has a lot of transformers, the kind you see on utility poles, spools of wire, conduit,and other things a company like this might have. I do not know if the equipment in this lot has anything to do with this event or not. I was at work then this happened AND of course no one else came out to take a break with me, so I was alone. Was this a probe of some kind, from some where??? Did the weather have anything to do with it? While the weather guys are watching the weather..maybe some of us should be watching for...ET??<n>

By the time I had reached the part of the interstate where they had crossed, they were over the trees heading southeast.  I stopped my car on the side of the road, got out, and continued to watch these two craft continue to travel very slowly.  I heard no noise at all from these two craft.  I got back in my car and continued to travel North.  About 5 minutes later I saw about 6 military helicopters cross the interstate in the opposite direction.  I knew they were helicopters by the very loud sound their blades made.  This all happened about 20 or 30 miles south of Montgomery, AL at 9:15 pm.<n>

The SEG cannot be detected by radar because it absorbs radiation and when inside the generator, the g force does not exist.  Searl also noticed that the SEG gave off some form of radiation that TOTALLY healed his burns from a spill a couple of weeks beforehand that docters said would never completely heal.  The lack of g&#39;s in the center can possibly explain the darty movement noticed in UFO&#39;s and the pink halo can possibly explain &#34;the light&#34; seen in many UFO sightings.  By the way, an SEG is made of magnets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We know nothing about SEG generators, but we leave this report for anyone who might know something about them.))<n>

Flashes of reddish orange light, similar to a flare, were seen in different parts of the sky at 10 to 8 minute intervals, over road less areas of the high desert. This was seen the previous night in much the same way. This night a very large aircraft was seen circling  the whole valley (25 mile diameter), also above cloud cover which was about 25 % of the sky. This aircraft passed directly over us twice. Several times bright pulsing red lights separated from this aircraft, dropping down and flying away at very high rate of speed, some to the south and to the east. The bright flares continued brighter than Venus, lighting clouds nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have seen these same events over a year ago with more witnesses and closer observation. The flares actually lit up the Mountain Diablo appearing above and below the clouds. During day light hours a black military type helicopter was seen flying a grid patternover Mt Diablo. There are no roads or homes in the area of the flares.<n>

This light would move irratically and quickly, sometimes in a small circular pattern and sometimes in giggly movements and at other times either upward or to the right or left in graceful sweeping motions. After about 20 minutes I woke up my wife to see if she could see what I saw.  By this time the light moved toward the north west.  As she looked at it she spotted three more of these light to the left of the one I first saw.  These other three formed a triangle.  Within the triangle we could see specks of intense red light moving about. As we continued to watch the first light, we saw off shoots of light that came from it, some shooting upward and others dropping to the surface of the ocean. These off shoots would eventually disappear.  One such off shoot appeared to hover above the surface of the ocean for a couple of seconds, then moved northerly. We watched this for about an hour and a half until our eyes got strained and tired.  We are both college educated professionals.  We discussed at length what these lights could have been, but we have come to the conclusion that they were unidentified flying objects.<n>

It flew right over me. I watched it from the south and looked real closely at it because it appeared to have no wing lights,just lights at each end of the cigar shape, with a big expanse of darkness in between. It was so cool. A friend saw it too. It was NOT an jet, it made no noise, it was very large like a football field or two. Wow. No wing lights, I could draw a picture of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights at each end, white lights and little red ones flashing on and off. Long cigar shape, flying very low! Did other folks see this thing? It looked like it was headed for San Jose like the other aircraft that fly over, but then I could not see any wings so I don&#39;t think it landed at San Jose airport! It was flying much lower than the other aircraft. A jet that low would make a deafening sound but this did not. I am so excited! I reported a silver cylinder once, this was dark, not like a silvery object.  I could not make out details of the under side, just that it was huge and dark greenish.<n>

When|4/15/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12591.html|32|ndxe200003| My first impression was that I was looking at 2 commercial jet airliners moving together, side by side with their spotlights on.  When the 2 lights were almost overhead, the light on the left turned off.  The bright light on the right continued on about 5 more seconds, and then it went out and the &#34;running lights&#34; came on.  There was enough daylight for me to see that where the light on the right had been was a plane.  But where the left light had been was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live about 12 miles west of the municipal airport, so we see a lot of air traffic.  A lot of the planes that I see flying over from east to west are displaying their bright white spotlights, and then it seems like once they reach altitude their spotlight goes out and then you see their blinking &#34;running lights&#34;; it&#39;s pretty obvious that it&#39;s a plane.  Something in the sky caught my attention in the early evening a few weeks ago, and I looked up and saw a pair of very bright white lights, coming from the east and moving together to the west.  There was a short distance between them and I felt sure that I was looking at two separate objects.  My first impression was that I was looking at 2 commercial jet airliners moving together, side by side with their spotlights on.  Their speed was not unlike other planes I see flying in the area; however, I don&#39;t often see 2 planes flying side by side like this.  So I continued to watch them.  When the 2 lights were almost overhead, the light on the left turned off ; like a big stadium light when it&#39;s turned off, it sort of faded out.  I expected then to see the blinking running lights turn on, but they didn&#39;t.  In fact, I didn&#39;t see any structure or lights in that space at all.  The bright light on the right continued on about 5 more seconds, and then it went out and the running lights came on.  There was enough daylight for me to see that where the light on the right had been was a plane.  But where the left light had been was nothing.  It was like this thing on the left was flying with the plane and then just disappeared.  There were no other planes nearby.  I was puzzled and wondered where the &#39;thing on the left&#39; went, but I figured there must have been something there that I missed.  Problem is, I haven&#39;t been able to forget about it.<n>

(the following night at the same time, we noted the sky was very active with various jets and planes overhead every 30-seconds).  because it was a black object against the black sky, the height is definitely a guestimate.  but the object was most definitely a large black triange.  two of us saw it.  after it passed, I asked my friend to give a specific description of what he had seen so I could validate what I had seen.  We both went inside and individually drew a picture of what we&#39;d seen.  We drew the exact same object.  My friend noticed a light on the bottom that I did not notice.  You ask for a brief description of us: we are college educated, in our 40s, neither had ever seen such a thing, I am in TV, he is a musician.<n>

Flashing lights and in|4/1/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12447.html|35|ndxe200003| we were observing the sky in one area. This bright flashing object appeared...not flying.In stationary position. Flashing lights and intenesity with flashes.  Blue, white, red, yellow..and green by a few of the observers.  Disappeared in a flash then reappeared in same spot more than once.  Went to new location out of town...and then spotted to more craft.  Using binoculars, you could see that when the first obj. flashed...the 2nd and 3rd seem to mimick the flashes.  We observed for over one hour...when the first once just seemed to head slowly over the hills and disappear.  the other two remained and we did not stay long to see when they were gone.  The objects did not appear as a star twinkling or as a planet. They flashed multiple colored lights...and in sychronicity.  They stayed in once place, and the first and brightest one appeared to spin as the lights had a neon...tracer effect when the light sourse is moving.  The second one actually had a second lite off to its side, but really couldn&#39;t see it without the binoculars.  it had a black space with no stars behind the two lights.  Interesting fact: there was a Delta II launch from VAFB that afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i entered most information in the above statement.  The observers were four adults and one 11 year old girl.  Two men and two women and one daughter.  The two women had had a few glasses of wine but the men were completely alcohol free.  The first man who saw the first object timed the event on his watch.  He alerted first his fiance to come see, then me, the wife and co-home owner of the yard where we were visiting and sky watching.  My husband also observed as did my daughter.  We used our own vision and 1 pair of binoculars.  This enabled to see the flashes as flashes of colored lights...and the slight movement of perhaps spinning...but not going anywhere.  3 of us...the other couple and myself are avid readers on the subject of UFOs and such topics.  I have never seen anything like this...or anything similar even though i wonder whats out there, and always look to the skys.  The first man, has said that he has had a few (2 or 3) unusual sightings...in his life.  His fiance is very intuitive and open to unusual possibities.  We all 3 are very intuitive, empathic, and open to the unknown...but this was for real for all of us...including to my husband and daughter who are born skeptics.<n>

It seemed like there were flashing lights out in the field, probably 2 different ones, next the to road.  They sort of flew around in the field and flashed so bright im sure you could see them very easily for a mile radius.  I slowed down the car to about 20 miles per hour, and watched as they moved around.  They never got close to the car at all, they stayed in the field about half a mile or less away from us I could only see the flashing, which was not at any specific, uniform rate, thats why I thought it was something strange.  The flashing was a bright white.  The person in the car with me and I, are both college students at the University of Kansas.  I am 18, the other person is 20.  Neither of us had anything to drink that night, and the other person is going to fill out one of these forms too.  We were driving up to Horton Kansas to visit some people we knew there.<n>

I looked up at the sky, which had a few clouds, but mainly blue sky, i saw two bright green lights following one another making no sound whatsoever. They were just like lasor pointers, but green. As they came from behind one cloud and disapeared behind another, there is no way that they were lasor pointers. All they were, were two dots, tavelling at an incredible speed. They definately were not fireworks. I have no rational explanation for what we&#39;d seen, does anybody out there know?

Subdued lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of my job. The night was clear and I had binoculars in my car, so I was observing the Sirius star, the Orion constellation and the Pleiades. While focused on the belt of Orion a sudden blur moved across my field of vision. I quickly turned with the object and was able to discern two objects. The object which would be closest to me was the larger of the two. On this I made out to be several light sources, reddish in appearance. Simultaneously I could see the other object was smaller with what appeared to be only two light sources. No other lights, or colors were visible that I could see. What was immediately apparent was that these were at a rather low flight level and they did not emit any distinguishable sound. They were traveling at what I would state to be a speed greater then that of a commercial aircraft. I state this because my locale is home to three(3)major airports, 2(two) of them are international. JFK and NEWARK. LAGUARDIA is nearby, as are several smaller commercially used airports. So aircraft are a very common sight. You get used to seeing so many overhead. These two were not at all common. They were traveling from a south east position to a north west position. The lights were quite subdued in intensity. I compare these lights to those of any commercial and/or private aircraft that I have observed. And the lights on these two objects were dim in comparison. And I must emphasize here, there was NO SOUND. Unfortunately I can not guess at the shape(s). As I followed them it became necessary to exit my car to continue viewing them. In the moments it took the leave my car I lost them. Let me state here, that from my position on the ground I had clear sky and a rather broad scope of sky to see. But I couldn&#39;t locate them at this point. I immediately marked the time. It was 8:27pm. Living on Long Island you get used to aircraft overhead. You even get familiar with being able to see aircraft at night from a great distance. You can distinguish a jet by its speed, its apparent altitude and from the lights blinking. And of course from the sound. On very clear nights I have seen satellites in orbit with no optical assistance. I have seen shooting stars. And I have seen the occasional flare from a meteorite.  These two objects were none of the above. They were to fast. To dimly lit. And low in the sky. I am a 43yr old man. Married for 13 yrs. Have 2 children and 3 step children. I have worked in the same building for 12 years doing computer processing for banks. My hobby is photography and my vegetable garden. Prior to tonight I cannot ever recall seeing anything which would compel me to make a report. I am very familiar with the UFO issues. They have been an interest of mine for over 20yrs. Yet I have not before seen anything to call a UFO. My only reason for doing so tonight is to assist in evaluation should other reports arise from the New York area which might be similiar. I wish I could offer more detail, however I at least can offer some tracing ability if you can use it. The only other detail I can offer is that there were other aircraft in the sky at the time.

My wife is on my left, as i look to my right southeast I have a brief glimpse, 1-2 seconds, of what looks like a rocket booster tail of very bright orange fire, somewhat white at the front. This fireball was headed from east to west into the setting sun, but no reflection was visible. I looked very hard at the leading edge and saw no type of craft and the fireball appeared to burn out or disappear into thin air. No sound at all. The amazing part was it traveled totally horizontal, was at approx. 45% in height, just above the tree line of neighbors house, and seemed very close, approximately 1-2 miles. Upon reflection, i wonder if this &#34;thing&#34; was taking off instead of burning out? The size and length of the &#34;firetail&#34; was the size of a cigarette, held at arms length. My neighbor has witnessed two sitings over the years, one very large and very close with lights, he&#39;s color blind, but this object was very near and just disappeared when he thought it saw him looking? The second siting flew very fast overhead, from direction of power plant and ammo dump.<n>

Looking straight ahead and to the left towards the Michigan Training Unit and Supermax prisons I saw an oval shaped disk hovering in the sky above the trees about 100-125 ft.  I could tell it was metallic because of the sun shining off it. It never moved and with all the traffic I couldn&#39;t tell if it made any noise.  I quickly turned onto M-66 going north and went around the corner taking Branch St. and King St. back to M-21.  In just that short of time, it was gone, disappeared.  I kept driving on M-21 past the prisons, past Bertha Brock park, trying to see where it went.  Finally, I gave up and went back home.  I was so shook up and excited it took me awhile to calm down enough to tell my family about it.  They didn&#39;t doubt me for a minute.  This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve seen a UFO.  Back in the &#39;80s when my husband and I were dating we saw one on Tuttle Road, looking towards Townsend Rd.  That one was a line of 6 lights hanging suspended in the sky.  Two of the middle lights gradually moved towards each other and then all 6 lights disappeared in a snap.  We weren&#39;t the only ones to see that one.  It was in the Ionia Sentinel Standard, a local newspaper the next day.  And when I went to get groceries the next day at Fred&#39;s Food Centre, everyone around me was talking about it.<n>

I noticed a bright white object approaching the rear of the jet from the west, at about 5 times the speed of the aircraft. At first I thought this to be a seagull at a much lower altitude and viewed from the side. Within seconds, I observed the object pass behind and above the jet, indicating that it was at a much greater altitude than I had first assumed it to be. As I watched it closely, it came to a sudden stop with no apparent deceleration, and hovered for less than a second. It then reversed its course and flew west at an outrageous speed. For a brief moment, I saw it dip slightly to one side, revealing it to be a circular shaped object. It accelerated out of sight in less than 1 second. The object may have had a reflective surface appearing to glow white because of the bright sunshine today.<n>

We saw a tour-bus size, triangle covered in blue lights, pass low over the X-way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend &amp; I were driving south-bound I-75 about 50 miles north of Lake City, TN, between midnight &amp; 1:00 AM on April 24, 2000. Traffic came to a halt. We assumed that it was due to an accident or possibly a construction bottle-neck. While waiting for traffic to move, we saw a tour-bus size triangle (or possibly cone-shaped...it was difficult to determine if it was a cone in profile or a flat triangle) object pass over the x-way, heading in a north west trajectory. The object was completely covered by several royal-blue lights, aligned in rows and all touching one another in a 4-3-2-1 formation, arranged with the row of four at the &#34;head&#34; (or flat side) of the triangle and the single light at the point. The lights came on and went off in sync, lighting the night sky around the object each time they came on. The effect was like a moving, triangle-shaped cluster of large connected strobe lights, as the object appeared and dissappeared rapidly along its trajectory. Several people in the other stopped vehicles rolled down their windows or opened their car doors to better see the object. We were very frightened. I am completing my Bachelor&#39;s degree in Elementary Education. My friend is completing her Nursing degree. Neither of us has seen anything like this before.<n>

Width of formation was aprox. 2/3 width of Orions Belt.  Red cresent glows arc length was about 2/5 of full circle.  Distance between such circles was aprox. 3 such circles.  Formation and cresents appeared to be flat as viewed from aprox. 45 degrees below as they passed from my right to my left.  Sky and mind was clear as wife and me did a evening walk down dark alley.  On several past walks I have been quick to point out a shooting star to my wife.  My first split second impression of this (my first ever and likely only ever) siteing was another shooting star.  I was caught completly off guard for what I saw.  As the formation passed mid flight below Orions Belt, I tried to draw my wifes attention to it.  By the time she looked in the right direction, the red cresent glows were fading or cooling away.<n>

The object ommited a blinding white light. After 13 minutes the object moved east and past over us.  Some stucture was seem in a rectangle form, continuing to move east changing into a red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were coming home from work, at 2:15am on March 23,2000 when we observed a blinding white light in the sky.  We turned on to Winding hill road the object was still there in the western sky. We then pulled over to get a better look at the object.  We killed the engine, then I got out of the car.  My wife stayed in the car she could see it from her window. There was a river to the right of us. To the left a corn field and a sand pit.  Above the sand pit the object was hovering about 700to1000 feet.  At arms legnth the object was approxamatly the size of a dime.  The light was as bright as a flood light, luminating rays of light, much like a planet. At times some rays seemed bluish.  To my left I heard machinery running (farm equipment)behind me I could hear the sound of tracktortrailer trucks on route 201A, no sound was coming from the object.  At about 2:27am the object rose very slow, then it started heading in our direction.  My wife started to become very nervous.  The white light then surrounded the object.  As it came closer my wife stepped out of the car.  On the bottom of the object there were three large orangish-yellow lights.  At this time the object was directly above us.  I could see a large rectangle structure with the orangish-yellow lights in the center, arround it a whitish light.  My wife saw the same form but was not sure how many lights there were.   There was a slight swooshing sound but it was unclear if it the object or the vehicles on the other roads.  The object headed east the lights got smaller and changed to a reddish dot, which dissapered into the horrizon.  My wife and I have never seen a plane or helicoptor like this, there were no blinking lights.  Hope you can help us figure out what this might be.<n>

3/22/00 20:30|St Clair Shores|MI|Triangle|1 minute|Bizarre magnet-like Triangular-shaped craft floating effortlessly in the evening sky of Southeast Michigan(maybe a blimp)!!!|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21968.html|54|ndxe200003| Bizarre magnet-like Triangular-shaped craft floating effortlessly in the evening sky of Southeast Michigan(maybe a blimp)!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have visited this web site (very cool site, I must add) a number of times since March 2000 wondering if anyone else saw the object I did 3/22/00.  It doesn&#39;t look as if readers can make contact with other visitors to the site, which is fine, but maybe someone else will chime in or offer an explanation.  Reading the many accounts on this site over time, I&#39;m shocked by how many people have witnessed the black triangular craft that I did, and so many stories match one another - obviously the government has a new technology that they somehow are keeping secret.  Where is it during all the recent crisis, I don&#39;t know, but it sure would be handy.   This is all very surreal to me.  It was around sundown (7pm) on Wednesday March 22 in St. Clair Shores, MI near Metropolitan Beach for anyone who is familiar with the area.   I was pulled up to a garbage can near the park entrance dumping some cups and junk from my backseat to neaten up my car.  While in my cars backseat, out of the corner of my eye I see what apears to be a blimp floating over a trees that surround the park.  I really thought it was a blimp of some kind - it was probably 300 yards away at this time, and looked about the size of a semi truck trailer.  I got out of my car to get a better look.  This thing was obviously metal.  No blimp.  It floated like a hockey puck on ice, gliding along the skyline.  Most eerily, IT WAS COMPLETELY SILENT!!!  It seemed to defy physics; it looked heavy (bowling ball like), but made no noise or showed no fire or jet propulsion.  I could only compare it to when you see a helium balloon that has been accidentally let go and it it seen floating thru the sky, but huge and and shaped sort of like the Pontiac car emblem.  It moved laterally toward where I was so it did get closer, but still far enough to where I wasn&#39;t too concerned.  I remember like it was just yesterday that you could clearly see a lone green light on the underside of this thing...green like a traffic stoplight, and this light had a cup like metal cag! ing arou nd it, very similar to that which you would see in a gymnasium basketball court around a bulb or on a factory to protect a bulb, but allow for light to shine.  The light slowly and evenly got brighter then dim over and over, pulsing, if not like breathing.   The thing also had white lights at each corner, but not at the tips. The lights were in about 2 feet from the corner, but they were dimly lit.  I wanted to shout to someone, anyone and say, &#34;look at this thing, what is that, what the heck.&#34;   I wanted someone else to see it too.  It was incredible!  I didnt have a cellphone back then so I couldn&#39;t call the police, but I wanted to.  I thought I could ask them what it was.  I could kill myself for not having a camera.  The craft, which was creeping slowly in an eastern direction toward the beach then suddenly stopped, then shot sideways out of site behind trees and the horizon.  It still gives me chills typing about it now.  Part of me knows I will probably know what I saw one day soon, via CNN or FOX talking about the latest spyplane, but there&#39;s still another part of me that&#39;s wondering if this was something other worldly.  I jumped in my car and shut the door - I was weirded out!  When I got home, I watched the news, expecting to hear something about it.  Nothing.  I told two friends and my mom about it and they laughed at me and said it was a blimp.  No blimp zips like that!!! Plus this thing looked like a gun.  It just looked like hard black metal - I would compare it to a big magnet.  I never thought of it that way before now, but that&#39;s it!   One friend mentioned that Selfridge Airforce Base is very close to the Metropolitan beach (and after looking at a map, I confirmed that it is) so maybe it was something from there.  I even placed a non-emergency call to the St Clair Shores Police Dept to ask if they had any calls or knew what it was...they said that air force cargo planes often make flight paths over th area, as do the Air Force Blue Angels which often are part of airshows in the area.  Fri! ends, th is was not a known air force jet.  I don&#39;t believe it was a UFO because of the lights - much like you&#39;re used to seeing on a terrestrial plane to have placed underneath, and why would a UFO need lights anyway!!??  I imagine that soon this craft will be made public and become as everyday and &#34;Hollywood&#34; as the Stealth bomber has become, but for now, I feel priveleged to have seen one.  This site is littered with stories of craft identical to what I saw, so something new is out there.  Print this if you like, I just want to get it off my chest...I have revisited the location twice, but nothing.  I will forevermore carry a camera in my car!!!!!!<n>

It was a little past 8 p.m. when I was driving south on El Toro road. I had to get gas first so I headed for the Arco gas station near the 5 freeway. One block before I pulled in I saw a bright orange ball/light slowly moving South East. I told my son to check out the light. I saw it because it was in front of me at about 200 feet up &amp; 1/4 mile away &amp; it was a clear night. I continued to glance at it until I got to the gas station. After I pulled in my son &amp; I got out of the van &amp; ran over to see it. My wife didn&#39;t care to see this. The orange light slowly drifted in the same direction over our heads &amp; then stopped. At this time I was facing south. It was silent. The light stayed there for 3 minutes &amp; started drifting to our right (south west) which placed it above the 5 freeway. At this time I was telling my wife to please see this &amp; she wouldn&#39;t budge. The light stopped again &amp; then it flickered &amp; two smaller orange lights came out of it about 2 seconds apart. After this happened the light started to move away &amp; then flickered out. It&#39;s as though it released some scout crafts &amp; took off. When it disappeared it was like turning off a light bulb. A few minutes later I saw two military aircraft flying at top speed in the direction of the UFO. I figured that the UFO saw the military jets, launched some scouts &amp; took off before they reached them. My son &amp; I were very excited. This was an amazing event that took place. I knew this wasn&#39;t any craft that we have because it didn&#39;t have any other lights that are required for aircraft &amp; it was silent. In 1987 while I was in Miami I remember seeing this same type of glowing orange light silently drifting south &amp; when it was overhead it became brighter &amp; then released four smaller orange lights which flew in a &#34;V&#34; formation with the brighter light in front. It continued flying until it was out of my sight. I use the words &#34;light&#34; or &#34;ball&#34; to describe! what wa s viewable. I would have loved to see the craft itself.<n>

Water-drop shaped bulbs that glowed- strange orbic light. Matched the color of sky, except for slight outline and parts mentioned. Craft flew to the the east for a few seconds, then seperated into 3 craft, all matching same discription, only about 15/18 size. Object made NO SOUND.

It occured about two years ago when i was on holiday with my partner and four children and our two friends and their daughter. we were sitting outside our caravan having a chat at about 2300 hours when i told my friend to make a wish as i had just seen what i thought was a shooting star, we watched it shot across the sky and then come to an immeadiate stop , change direction and then come back towards us . its appearence was of a bright light not white but slightly yellow and opaque, its speed was not constant at times extremley fast then hoovering or moving slowly.we witnessed a similar display about 5 times with more than one object at times above us they then dissapeared mometarily only to reappear all together about 8 of them in only what could be described as an arrow formation, i must add that they were completly silent. Soon after that a much larger object appeared with bright white lights all around it the lights seemed to be spinning around d disc shaped object that hoovered momentarily above us and then dissapeared. i have to say that whilst i was fascinated by the whole expierience it was also quite frightening. I really felt i should report it to somebody but who? I should also add the power supply to the site failed during this.<n>

Unusually, the sky was very clear above Ljubljana so I just gazed at the stars. I saw a rectangle shape flying thru the sky. It had no lights, nor did it make a sound. It seemed close (I tought it was around 200-300 metres, but no one can tell actually). It zoomed thru the sky faster than a plane but slow enough so that I could see it for 7-10sec. I started hicking up and got really scared cause I&#39;m a great beliver. I assure you that I did not make any of this up and that I am perfectly normal and do not have a mental condition.<n>

My friend and I had dismissed the whole event as some military test flight for some new plane but then i thought to myself...if they were testing a new plane than why were there so many of them?  Whatever you people think i definately feel those fireballs i saw that night were far from manmade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Then it shot towards Atlanta. This all happened in about 3 Minutes. If it took that long. This thing had no visable seams,or lights. It was just a silver dome flat on the bottom, Like an upsidedown bowl. I would like to find out what it was.

At first we passed them off as planes but then the objects started shifting from one point in the sky to another at an phenomenal pace. They were intercrossing between each other. They were moving like that for about 10 minutes. Then suddenly there was a flash of light and then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shapes of the objects was triangular. All they really did was move around the sky at phenomenal speeds. There were only two of them that were observed. We could not really see what colour they were because all we could see was lights on the objects, these lights helped us assume that they were triangular.<n>

The craft was flying low in front of me, only a couple of hundred feet up, and passed out of sight behind some low hills to the west.  Its flight path was a straight line with no sudden accelerations.  There were two oddities:  it was going very slowly for such a narrow, wingless hull, and it wobbled quite noticeably.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling north on I-5 on clear, moonless night, with desert mountains on the right, low hills on left, and no trees anywhere, my attention was drawn to my right, where, over the crest of the mountains, I saw what appeared to be a plane with multiple white lights, such as are turned on when a large plane is about to land.  The lights were numerous and extremely bright and the object was flying low over the mountain on a bearing from northeast to southwest, a diagonal to the oncoming north-south traffic.  I looked at it for awhile, remarking to myself how bright it was (&#34;never seen that many lights on a plane before,&#34; I thought), then I looked back to the road to keep my eye on oncoming traffic.  The object crossed the road and I realized it was traveling quite slowly, about on a par with the automobiles (45 to 65 mph).  As it passed from the right side of the road to the left at a distance of at most a half a mile, I could see that it was illuminated from stem to stern by brilliant white lights of varied shape.  The lights were confined to the perimeter of the craft, which became apparent because the &#34;plane&#34; (I was still under the impression that it was an ordinary jetliner about to land at an unknown airfield over the hills to my left), was wobbling about its central axis.  As it wobbled I could see that the lights clearly outlined an elongated triangle.  The triangle was shaped like a spearhead, much longer on its sides than its base was wide, with quite a sharp point.  There were no wings, and no stabilizer that I could make out, except perhaps a low fin-like ridge (also triangle shaped) toward the rear, but I wouldn&#39;t swear to it).  It occurred to me at this point that I might be seeing one of the famous flying triangles from the Netherlands flap, or such as had been reported in Lancester (which it so happens was east of my location, though I did not know it at the time), or in upstate New York.  I was incredulous at the triangular shape of the craft, so I did my best to confirm it by focusing my a! ttention between the lights on the shadowy contours.  I recall remarking to myself several times that, yes, it WAS a triangle, because the ENTIRE perimeter of bright white lights was filled in by the dark shadow of the hull, occluding stars or terrain that passed behind the craft.  More about the lights:  All were bright white, similar to the new halogen lamps on automobile headlights.  However, they were not of uniform shape.  Some were roundish, others were blobby, or egg shaped.  It was an impressive array in sheer number and in variety, but all were confined to the edges of the craft, except ONE.  On the underbelly of the craft, about where you would find the center of gravity, there was a slowly blinking RED light.  It was this red light that made me think it was definitely a terrestrial or military craft.  As the craft neared the hills to my left, now at about an 8 o&#39;clock position, taking I-5 North as my 12 o&#39;clock pointer, I saw the tail section of the craft outlined.  It was diamond-shaped, similar to the tail section of, for want of a better comparison, the Imperial Star Destroyer in the STAR WARS movies.  In other words, it was like two long isosceles triangles joined at the base.  The craft passed out of sight over the low hills to the left, much lower now than the mountains to the right where it had first appeared.  As I drove up I-5 about a mile farther, I looked to the left to see the &#34;airfield.&#34;  Instead I saw that there were city lights there in the distance, though I&#39;m not sure which city it was or how far away (see the map I will send in the mail for my best guess).  As the craft passed out of sight I was struck by how much the craft wobbled, but I remarked to myself, &#34;Well, that&#39;s what you&#39;d expect from a plane with a wing-shape like that.&#34;  But I was tired: it occurred to me later that this craft didn&#39;t have enough wing surface to keep it up AT ALL when flying at that slow speed, unless my sense of distance and time was badly off.  I would expect that only a supersonic jet flying at several hundred miles per hour would be able to stay aloft with a wing pattern such as I saw.  My final verdict is &#34;undecided, need more information.&#34;  Whatever I saw, it was quite unusual, and it kept me thinking for the rest of the night.<n>

There were three lights on the &#34;craft&#34; one red one green and one a purple-blue. All were blinking. Craft rose up from the woods in the east. IT headed towards the northwest. Then it increased speed as soon as it passed the witness about 200 feet in the air and 200 feet north of the witness. IT kept going northwest then a bright white flashed and it dissappeared.<n>

Object emitted a flashing white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was star gazing from my balcony in NW Tucson, looking westward toward the night sky at around 9 PM, when I saw an object moving at an extremely high rate of speed toward the western horizon. I am an aviation buff, and I have never seen any man-made aircraft move across the sky this fast. I would estimate it covered at least 30 or 40 miles in those few seconds. The duration of it&#39;s appearance was approx 4 or 5 seconds, and it appeared at though it was heading at a 30 degree angle toward the ground. It was impossible to tell how far away it was, but it moved NW toward the mountains and disappeared over the horizon. I watched for a flash from an explosion, but never saw one. I assume it was moving toward the NW and simply was following the earth&#39;s curvature. I&#39;d be curious if anyone in the Phoenix or Las Vegas areas witnessed it as well. It was impossible to see what shape it was; all you could see is a brightly blinking white light. I have watched many satellites and jet aircraft cross the skies at night here in the desert, but I have NEVER seen something moving this fast. There was no sonic boom, or noise of any kind from the object.  Also, at the same time, I saw the lights of an approaching jet airliner from roughly the same direction.  The jet was inbound from the NW, heading for Tucson Intl, and it took about 10-15 minutes for it to come close enough to my viewpoint to identify it as an aircraft. I wonder if the crew on that aircraft saw this object, which was heading roughly toward it&#39;s path? The weather was clear, with a bright, full moon. I was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.<n>

This aircraft I presume to be circular or egg shaped since it appeared ovallike at that angle of viewing. It appeared to be at a high altitude since it was small and so I don&#39;t really know how big it might really be. This object moved in a tight circular pattern, presumably observing something. It moved incredibly rapidly from my vantage point, over 600 miles per hour or so. It turned too tightly and too fast to be any known type of jet of aircraft and did not leave any trails, which a jet would have, at that height. The craft did not make any perceivable type of noise and did not emit any other things. There were no other aircraft in the area. It repeated the same manuever for about a minute before very rapidly zooming off towards the northwest at an even higher rate of speed. Again it made no visible or audible marks and this puzzled me as to how an aircraft could travel(presumably)several times the speed of sound and not produce a sonic boom After disappearing no other objects like it were visible and i could see no other evidence of its presence. The weather in the sky was cloudless and still nor were there any smoke trails left by airlines anywhere in the sky on that morning. I saw the object for only a sort time and I have no idea how long it was in the sky or if any others were present earlier or later.<n>

I got my digital camera out and took a picture of the night sky there was a full moon and was able to capture two images one shows up green and the other blue.  when I pointed my camera at the objects and zoomed in they each appeared to bob up and down on the camera screen.  I was not able to capture any stars on camera for comparison so these objects were much brigher and had colors.  planes were flying by so we knew they were not planes and when i came out 2 hours later from the initial sighting the lights over the mountains were gone but the other lights were still in the sky. the lights appeared to move in an oval direction around the center but the objects were very far away from us and couldn&#39;t tell except that they were changing colors.  my husband, myself and our daughter all saw the objects as well as my daughters boyfriend.  we are college educated and teach middle school. my daughter is graduating from college and her boyfriend is a manager.

Also saw faint red flashes interminent at different distances, still in close proximity, but didn&#39;t see them when not looking thru binnoculars. I know the stars can &#34;twinkle&#34; and play games with your head but this didn&#39;t seem to be a star/planet/nebula as the binnoculars are not that powerful(10X50). I live under a flight path for incoming traffic to Boston/Logan Airport and like to watch the different planes come and go but this was not anything like I have seen before. I focused on the object with the binnoculars and when I looked at the stars I had to refocus to see them clearly and vise versa. The weather was crystal clear/full moon. I really do not think this was a plane. I&#39;ve watched them for many years, I know when a plane at high altitude is coming straight towards you it seems not to be moving for a long time but this was definatly different.

The craft emitted a blue laser beam from the craft to the ground and a blue egg shaped object which looked like it was comprised of millions of tiny particles of energy,was &#34;beamed down&#34; to the earth from this craft as if from some star trek movie. The blue egg shaped object was carefully projected down the laser beam and once it was &#34;released&#34; at ground level the laserbeam retracted back into the spacecraft.  We had the local airport tower on the phone during the event and the airtraffic controller on duty assured us that there was nothing on the radar fitting this description and that the only thing they had on radar was a medivac unit coming into san antonio from boerne flying from west to east into the airport.The air seemed to buzz with an electric/static during the event, and as soon as the blue egg was released from the beam the spacecraft took off at an extremely high rate of speed then disappeared.Could anyone tell us what it was that we witnessed being beamed down ?

Or saw/experienced anything like this.  This has happend before many times. (Different situations). A strange high pitch noise came from our computer room. Computer was on but I was not in the room. I often stay up late on my computer and have never heard this from that room before! Within seconds after it started and then a loud low flying fast (aircraft) went over.  But the strange thing is, the  high pitch noise shut off one minute later.  Like a switch.  I was not tired before this but suddenly afterword overwhelmed with exhaustion to where I could hardly write this down on paper. I often stay up alot later then this! But the (airplane) engine or humming sound one makes never ceased completly! I can still hear it an hour later, its not as loud but its still out there!<n>

I observed a soild white light about as intense as a regular &#39;landing&#39; light. It moved at a very high speed from west to east, following a route that is commonly used by military aircraft when flying from the coastline to the Nevada Test site area. The craft moved at an incredible high rate of speed, making it from horizon to horizon in mere seconds. It did NOT exhibit the hallmarks of a &#34;Shooting Star&#34; or meteorite. There was no &#39;flaming&#39; or trail behind it.I saw it start to finish.<n>

Slowing our vehicle down, I realized the object was not stationary but rather traveling at a snail&#39;s pace in the sky west of 72nd at a consistent altitude and did not appear to have any wings, lights nor was any sign of propulsion (contrails) evident.  Although I can cannot accurately estimate the distance that the object was from me with nothing to use for a reference, it did not appear to be more than a couple thousand feet up in the sky as it traveled west/southwest.  The object appeared to be roughly about an inch long and a 1/8 of an inch thick if I could pinch it between my fingers at an arms length.  The sky was clear with very few cumulus clouds high above and nothing obstructed my veiw of the object.  As I turned west on State street and pulled over to get a better look, the slow moving object totally disappeared from view.  I have never seen anything remotely similiar to this object before in my life, especially the weird angle (nose-down if the front of the object was at the end which pointed in the direction that it was travelling) that it appeared to fly.<n>
3/16/00 09:00|Houston|TX|Sphere|3 SECONDS|While taking-off in a 737, I saw an object that looked like a large chrome ball-bearing sitting above a cloud bed.|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46211.html|86|ndxe200003| While taking-off in a 737, I saw an object that looked like a large chrome ball-bearing sitting above a cloud bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 03/16/2000, I was taking off from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in a commercial Boeing 737 bound for Cancun, Mexico.  As the plane climbed, I was engaged in my usual habit of looking downward, watching the ground as it gradually grew smaller and smaller.  We then began climbing through random layers of clouds. So my view of the outside would become white-washed with clouds for several seconds at a time, followed by periods of clear to semi-clear visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point in our ascent, while continuing to look downward, the visiblity became completely clear.  At this point, my eyes shifted and locked-on what appeared to be a metallic ball- shaped object, positioned at about 2:00 &amp; 100 ft below us.  It seemed to be stationary, sitting just above a lower cloud bed. The object looked like a large, (about 6 feet in diameter) glistening ball bearing with no seams or wings that I could see.  The object didn&#39;t appear to be moving, as I remember turning my head to track it as we passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tracked it to about 4:30, when we hit another cloud bank and my window went white.  I quickly looked at those around me, but could tell that they hadn&#39;t seen anything.  I don&#39;t really think they could have where they were seated and I wasn&#39;t about to get up and start asking everyone seated at a window, &#34;Excuse me sir/maam, Did you happen to see the large chrome ball floating outside the plane just a moment ago.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I&#39;m thinking that this might just have been some sort of weather related equipment that they use around airports.  Then I start thinking how dangerous this would be to planes landing and taking off, especially concealed in cloud cover as it was.  I thought about talking to the pilots, but just blew it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the years passed, I kept thinking back on what I had seen.  I&#39;ve called NASA several times over the last few years, just to see if they could maybe identify the object as man-made based on my description.  Every time, I would be prompted to leave a recorded message.  I was about to, but then started getting a little wary.  Wouldn&#39;t want any &#34;wacko files&#34; opened up on me or anything.  Maybe you can help identify what I saw, man-made or otherwise.  It would seem rather small to be occupied, but who knows. Thanks.<n>

I glanced up and saw a light move accross the sky in the N. East sky. At first I thought it was a satalite. As i watched, I saw it move at the same speed all the time. It would move up and down very quickly still going in the same direction. A very fluid motion. As it moved forward, from my perspective, It would drop 12 inches and rise again 12 inches aprox. The object was extremely far up in the sky, like a satalite. So i guess 12 inches for me would equal what, 1000 feet or so for it??<n>

The first time I saw it, it was only for a few seconds but it was very ominous, silent and appeared to be controlled remotely. Its colour was orange and red, it was perfectly round. Once I got to the end of the street I started walking west(right) then south(left) then east(left). I am now at my folks house and this trip only takes about 15-20 min. on foot. As I was cutting up through their backyard I happened to turn around and their it was for the second time and it looked like it was over the spot, above the street a 1000ft. or so where I saw it the first time this time I am faceing north and it is flying over houses to the east(my right) and as it flew to the edge of town, wich is about a k.m away from my position it took on a 45 degree angle of flight, to the east, started to accelerate, and it&#39;s colour switcher off all in just a few seconds.

Looking out north window below our jet, a light with no strobes was tracking our jet, after 10 minuted its light went out...no strobes..moon light reflected off object only. flew at same speed as jet, directly over I-10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a flight from LA to phoenix, at around 8:45pm after reaching 33,000 feet I noticed a light &#34;following&#34; our jet. I was seated at the rear of the plane wing. wondering if this was an optical illusion I moved forward, and the light was blocked out by the rear-edge of our jet&#39;s wing. Therfore I could safely know this object was beneath us flying. Not just a reflection off my window. We were flying almost directly over I-10, and near Palm-Springs. This object almosy matched our planes speed, but after watching for nearly 10 minutes, I noticed it was actually a little slower, it was further from the edge of the wing fro my perspective. Then our jet made a slight path change, and went turned a little south. When our plane turned, the light kept going straight, so this further confirmed it was not a reflection. Then after about 30 seconds it corrected its course floowing our plane exactly, then it started speeding up, and was actually going faster, at which point the light went out on it. It had NO strobes, no lights whatsoever. I thought it had just dissappeared, but as I looked I could actually see a very faint blue light where it had been, I could track this light over the surrounding lights from I-10/city, it was more like reflected moon-light possibly, it then sped up and I lost visual of the object when our planes wing was in the way. There were many other planes in the sky that night, I was in a Boeing 737, which means I was traveling around 500-600 MPH, this was NOT a small plane. All other planes in the sky that night both above, and below our altitude had strobes. Our plane had strobes. This object was bright, one light, travelling far beneath our altitude, and between 500-600 mph over I-10 eastbound. I would really like to know what in the world it was. Do military aircraft fly low, and &#34;black&#34;/no strobes? -((name deleted))<n>

I lived in Boulder at the time and knew (and still know) Boulder quite well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so for three days i&#39;m staring out the window. there is an airport north of the BCJ, but there were no aircraft for three days straight, becuase thats all i did was stare out of the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was a cloudy grey day. directly east of my window there was a dark green craft with a white glow around it, (very obvious against the grey clouds) that came directly out of the ground. it literally rose straight up from the ground and when it changed directions it changed dramatically, with no gravitational effect.  there is a small hill that drops down and i couldn&#39;t see where it came from but it definitly wrose from the ground, straight up.  it did some manuevers, going up and coming down, speeding and then bouncing back then it came back near where it popped up from and proceded to fly a straight pattern at the speed of an airplane. trust me, it was NO airplane,<n> <n><n> <n><n> it seems i was only 500-1,000 feet from it, and i could see the detail of the craft. it was diamond shaped, with strange small details. so it fly&#39;s this straight pattern north untill i can nolonger see it anymore.  i estimated the point where these craft came from and it was just north of the &#34;devils tower&#34; like structure by the train yards and baseball feilds on the east side of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as soon as i look back to where it popped up from, ANOTHER one popped up. only this time, it didn&#39;t fly around in a random pattern. looking like a UFO, it came straight up out of the ground and proceeded to fly the same pattern that the first did when it was done doing the weird manuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THERE WERE ABOUT 6 OF THESE. they all flew the same pattern, at about airplane speed from east of the jail all the way north. then came dinner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> when i got back from dinner it was getting dark. they had stopped. when it got completely dark, they started again, flying the same pattern, from the ground, then slow and low, along the horizon.  The freakiest part of this sighting is that when it was dark, they flashed like airplanes. the lights were very convincingly flashing as a normal small plane would...YET i saw them in the day, fairly closely. close enough to know they definitly were not airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i made sure i wasn&#39;t wrong about the location of the jail compared to the airport, the jail is directly north of the jail and my window was facing directly east.  i asked everyone that had a room facing east and no one was looking out of the window...i guess most people sleep or read. my celmate wouldn&#39;t look when i told him, he was scared i guess. anyway there were 2 or 3 more and then it stopped. i woke up right at sunrise the next morning and saw one more of them, fly the same pattern, in even more detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

According to them they were returning from home from a trip to Pueblo, CO in the afternoon and witnessed a craft that looked like two metalic boxes connected in the middle by a shorter cylinder. The craft was high in the sky and slow moving. It had no apparent wings and moved across the sky until out of view. They had enough time to stop the car and watch the object move out of view. The size of the craft was hard to determine because the skies were clear and blue, possibly the size of a large helicoptor or slightly larger. It was consistent in speed and did not appear to be moving with the wind.<n>

When I first saw it I was thinking someone&#39;s roof blew off their house but it wasn&#39;t windy and the object was perfectly still. I was coming to a stop sign so I was barely moving in the car. I stopped and just watched it for about 20 seconds.  The object looked like a rectangular box standing upright which was black. Out of each corner it looked like a giant post or antenna sticking out diagnally maybe about 10 feet long. Those were harder to make out.  So after being stopped in the car watching it, not even moving, it spun 90 degrees and got thin. The size would be about 30 foot tall, 20 foot wide and 8 foot thick. If you held a dice in your fingers at arm length then that would possibly be the size of it. A car was coming up behind me so I turned north and looked back and it was gone. No sound or lights coming from object.<n>

I was driving about 50 mph North bound between Grant Rd. and Hall Rd. (though closer to Grant Rd) when a brightly lit craft that seemed spherical hoovered closely parallel to my 1991 Mitzubishi Mighty Max Pickup.  The craft emitted a low hum which I could feel throughout my body.  Every hair on my body was raised, though I suspect from fear.  The light completely filled the cab of my truck but i was able to see out my windshield fine.  I was unable to get more than a fleeting glance because I was affraid and unable to look at it more than once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would slam on the brakes hoping the craft would pass but it would stay perfectly parallel to me.  I sped up to approx 90 mph which it also matched, perfectly.  I was driving in the left lane north bound on SR3 which is bordered by a grass island then the south bound lanes.  The craft was above the grass island.  It then went staight up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down and looked around for a helicoptor, police car, riding lawn mower anything that could make what I saw NOT a UFO.  I saw nothing.  I was a skeptic until that morning.  I cannot say whether it was man made or alien being that I live within 10 miles of our access to space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Once every few seconds, the lights would go off for a very small fraction of time, and in that instant we could see the silouet(shape)of the object, as a dark shape against a less dark sky, it lasted for about 4-5 minutes, after that the object became smaller and smaller until it dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They stayed their for about 10 minutes then one seemed to be lifted staright up and about 5 seconds later the second went the opposite direction,Though my husband has alot of skeptism, my teenagers and I know what we saw and it was not created from this planet.

It was 4:30 PM, early evening with plenty of sunlight, against a clear blue darkening sky. The Moon appeared in the background of the sighting. The object(s) moved slowly (25 MPH?) at a distance of 1500(?) feet from my vantage point. There was no associated sound, although the hiway drone was moderate. The formation stopped momentarily, made 2 full clockwise rotations (parrallel to the ground) and proceeded on its previous northwest heading, apparently following Hiway 17 toward the direction of Los Gatos. The first impression of the light was similar to a highlight following the contour of a chrome bar (of each independent Rod) as they reflected sunlight, while manuvuering the rotations. Then doubt followed, as the yellow and blue light was irratic and became very bright not characteristic of reflective light at all, but perhaps emitted. The object(s) continued in the direction noted, got very dim several times and abruptly dissappeared.<n>

A red and blue light was seen as it flew away. We could see it somewhere over NJ as we drove on the West Shore Expressway in Staten Island. We watched it as it appeared to hover or fly slowly over NJ. Its red and blue lights visible, it began to accelerate as its bright light re-appeared. We watched for a few minutes as it finally seemed to hover over Staten Island again. We slowed down to about 15 MPH as we watched its lights began to dim and the craft began to tilt upwards towards a 90 degree angle. Its shape appeared to be maybe triangular but once the lights dimmed we could not tell for sure. We estimated its distance from us at about 1000 yards and an altitude of 1000-2000 feet. We did not hear any sounds from this craft at all.We did not stick around to watch what happened next as traffic beared down on us from behind, we exited the expressway. When we reached the overpass after we exited there were no signs of planes, lights or other crafts in the sky.<n>

I was leaving for work and it was a clear night for a change.  I always look up to the night sky.  I saw a plane off to my right.  Before I continue I would just like to state for the record that I&#39;ve never had any mental problems nor do I have any now. As I was saying, I was walking to my car.  I live in an apartment complex and each building has four two bedroom apartments in it.  I live alone.  I was the only person outside at the time.  I looked up and I saw this &#34;star&#34;.  I kept thinking that it sure was pretty.  An off orange or red color.  Well it looked kind of strange, like it was moving which did not make sense.  I told myself I was just seeing things and continued walking.  Once more I thought I saw it move. So I stopped to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things.  Sure enough it was moving, straight towards my area.  I won&#39;t lie.  I got real scared. I wanted to run to my car, which is a Neon Sport-Black.  I knew it was not a plane because just off to the right was a plane and this light was too bright to be a plane.  But I did not run to the car.  I did however walk very fast because it was getting closer and since I was the only one outside I panicked.  My hands were shaking really bad as I tried to unlock my vehicle while I kept my eyes on the thing.  Finally I got the door open and I threw my purse and notebook inside then jumped in.  It took me a moment because I was really shaken up to get the doors all locked and my car started.  I then sat there while my vehicle was warming up and continued to watch the thing.  It changed course going left once I got inside the vehicle.  The light did not change at all in intensity as it went on the new course which further convinced me that this was not the &#34;headlights&#34; of a plane or helicopter.  It was going at average speed.  I looked away while I put in a CD to calm me down and when I looked back it was gone. I went to work and told my co-worker.  She said that I looked like I had seen a ghost.  And to be honest the experience still shakes me up because in all my life of watching the stars at night I&#39;ve never seen a thing like this.  And I grew up in Texas where the stars are very bright and un-polluted by light from the city. I&#39;m a 23 year old woman, single, no children with a good job and a nice place to live.  I hope you can make sense out of this because I can&#39;t. I was hesitant to tell a co-worker because people that tell stories like this get labelled &#34;crazy&#34; or &#34;insaign&#34; and to be honest in my line of work this could get me fired.  Please keep that in mind. Thank you.<n>

One evening, we decided to go down to a pier near the water which seemed to be a popular destination.  When we arrived, there were many other people around the aream probably 100 other people or so.  We walked down the pier to the water and, as we neared the end, we suddenly saw a VERY large object (much larger than a football field  it seemed to cover the sky) moving very slowly at a low altitude.  In fact, it was so low and so large, I can remember flinching and ducking because I was afraid that it was going to strike the large suspension bridge to our left.  The object was completely silent - almost like a vaccum of no noise - and I did not see any type of trail or emission coming from it.  We both quickly looked around wondering if anyone else was witnessing what we saw, but no one else seemed to see it.  Every other person present was carrying on as if nothing were happening.  I can distinctly remember being extremely confused and somewhat frustrated that no one else was seeing what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is where my memory ends.  The situation is the same for my friend.  This event transpired some eight years ago, and she and I have conversed about it several times since.  We cannot remember what happened to the object, where it went, how we got back to our car, or even how we got back to our hotel.  We woke up in our hotel the next morning and continued our trip Washington D.C..  We were both very confused and somewhat scared of the incident.  We laughed about it to a degree, as young people will do, but we have recently spoken of our concealed fear and confusion about the sudden loss of memory.  Neither my friend nor I had been drinking or taking illegal drugs on this trip or in any period of time immediately prior to or subsequent of it.  We are both college-educated, working professionals with families.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of our memories of the actual event are exactly alike.  We both saw an extremely large, black object with many small lights (or what appeared to be lights).  The object was so large that it covered most of the sky and it was flying at less than 300 feet (my best estimate).  It is difficult for me to state the exact shape of the object because it was so large.  However, it was rounded on the front end (the end that was moving toward the bridge), so I assumed it was either circular or oval in shape.  I was fearful of it for the brief period of time I saw it, but now, looking back, Iâm very curious to know what it was and what happened to us after we witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Odd color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> hello, i live in San Jose, Ca. back in march 2000, i saw something in the sky that was different from anything i&#39;ve ever seen. it was night time and i was on a regularly busy freeway, Highway 101. i didn&#39;t catch it at first because it looked like a glare on my windshield. but i started to notice that it didn&#39;t move. it looked like a light blue, squarish streak. like thrust or something but in the shape of a parallelogram.  it&#39;s like taking a light blue hi-liter and positioning the tip at 2 o&#39;clock, then draw a short straight line.  it wasn&#39;t thin like a shooting star, a bit more thicker.  it was stationary and solid in color. when it finally did move, it was slow, but then moved like a meteor/shooting star at a high speed horizontally accross the sky from left to right on my point of view. after it acclerated, it disappeared. it was very hard to tell if the distance was within our atmosphere, or something in space.  but it was definitely there.  i heard from friends that there is a missle test sight in the area.  but all my 20years of living here, i&#39;ve never heard of one.  i was suprised that it wasn&#39;t on the news or anything, because it was around 8pm or 8:30pm and there were plenty of people on the freeway.  and plus there were at least 4 aircraft/airliners in the area during the time.  i don&#39;t have any pictures because i was driving, but i remember it well.  i clearly saw it.  it might&#39;ve been a meteor, but what makes me question it is the shape of it.<n>

As I watched, I noticed that one of the stars was moving ever so slowly.  My dad used to work in telecommunications and built a few satellites, so I assumed it was a sattelite.  It was almost directly overhead, moving Northward.  The light crossed the constellation Orion, then stopped by the head, turned around and started heading back towards the belt.  I called out to my friends inside, but by the time they got outside, the light did this zig zag thing and then blinked out.  I watched the light for about 5 minutes, but for most of that time, I was under the impression that it was a sattalite.  I really don&#39;t think sattelites move that way, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two seemingly credible reports from same source.  PD))<n>

The object seemed to be a group of lights arranged in a cross pattern (exact number not known, but definately exceeded 8).  After going outside for a better look, the witness saw what appeared to be 2 more identical objects.  The first object remained stationary, while the 2 additional objects traveled slowly to the north.  No sound was heard that could be attributed to the objects.  At the time of the sighting the sky was partly cloudy with no precipitation.  The objects remained beneath the cloud cover for the duration of the observation.  The owner made observations for at least 10 minutes before becomming cold, and retiring for the night.<n>

While serving a first class passenger on the left side of the aircraft I noticed out the window that a ball of light was approaching from the rear of the aircraft at a speed faster than what we were going (I would guess about 700 mph).  The object appeared as a fuzzy ball of light pinkish in color which went out when it came parallel to our aircraft.  It then began producing reflective sparks over the top of the ball shaped object of what appeared to be of a metallic nature.  It then veered toward the aircraft and went under us and disappeared.  When I notified the flight crew, they said that they had no reports of anything in the area and refused to talk about it any further. I asked the passenger what she thought it was and she replied that she could not make out anything that would make sense or anything she had ever seen before.  I have never seen anything while flying in my 12 years with the airlines.  This was worth investigating.<n>

The two smaller lights seperated from the brightest light (to my wife they looked like they went in front of the brightest light and to me it looked like they were pieces that fell off the main light.) One of the dimmer lights stoped moving while the other two continued on moving. About 30 seconds apart the two dimmer lights slowly faded out and disappered.

3/12/00 15:00|Sedona|AZ|Other|unknown|After-the-fact sighting of a UFO|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51932.html|121|ndxe200003| After-the-fact sighting of a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I appologize in advance for my description of the event - it happened over 6 years ago and I don&#39;t remember as much as I&#39;d like.  I was a freshman at Arizona State University and my buddy and I decided to go hiking one weekend up in Sedona.  I&#39;m not positive as to the date, but I&#39;m pretty sure it was in the Spring and though I don&#39;t know the exact time, I&#39;m positive it happened in the afternoon.  When I say it &#39;happened&#39; I&#39;ll have to clarify.  We were hiking around one of the trails on the edge of town and neither of us remembered seeing or hearing anything at all.  However at one point on the trail, we had a passer-by take two pictures of us, one right after the other perhaps 10 seconds apart (just to make sure they turned out).  When I developed the film, the first of the photos had a very distinct image in the upper left hand corner whereas the the second had no such image at all.  The image was of a long, slim, black object in the sky, tapering to a point at one end and a hook at the other.  The image appeared in no other photo in that roll of film.  It&#39;s obvious from looking at it, that it wasn&#39;t just something on the lens - after all, it&#39;s in one photo but not the other and the woman never wiped the lens.  And I know it&#39;s not the photo paper used because it showed up on the negatives.  I&#39;ve also tried scanning the photo into my computer and zooming in to get a better look.  The edges are well defined; it&#39;s not as though it&#39;s a distortion, lens flare or blur.  It was jet black and it was out in broad daylight - I have no idea what to think.  I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t really know what else to say about it.  I can&#39;t remember the name of the trail, but I know it was near a pizza place right off Highway 89A.  I think the name of the pizza place is Moondog&#39;s Pizza?   It&#39;s just a tiny mom and pop joint.  The only other thing I can say is that I still have the photos, and most probably the negatives.  I&#39;ve never seen anything of this nature in a photo, which is the only reason it caught my attention.  I&#39;ll try uploading them later today to the email address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I noticed an object that I thought at first was a seagul. I watched it further and realized that it was probably at a very high altitude, but it was moving pretty fast for that height.  For instance an airliner moves fairly slowly across the arc of the sky, this was on the order of three to four times as fast.  I also thought it might have been a baloon, but the shape wasn&#39;t quite right.  It was traveling in a south to southwestern direction coming in from over Lake Superior. The object eventually passed behind a cloud, and I lost sight of it.  It did appear to change direction but not significantly. Pretty unclonclusive but still I thought I would send in data in case someone else got another look at it, and it turned out to be more significant.<n>

I had arrived in Seattle from Spokane to board a ship heading to Alaska.  I turned off of I-90 West headed south toward Rentin (?)  As You may or may not know, the sky over Seattle was overcast on this morning.  The craft poped through the overcast and remained motionless for several seconds. The ship was metalic with what appeared to be windows across the front. After a few seconds, it then rose back into the cloud overcast. Since I was driving at the time and I&#39;m sure you are aware of how fast people drive on the expressways around Seattle, I didn&#39;t stop.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw the object.

We saw an object in the sky that looked like a star.  Suddenly a long comet-like tail appeared behind it.  It was long, thin and very bright.  Instantly, it turned from a blue tail to a perfectly square and straight bar that was mostly orange.  At times, the point of light looked as if it had a very smooth metallic object below it.  The light and disc were almost surreal.  It faded in and out as if maybe it was bordering our visual spectrum or something.  As we were driving from Encino to Woodland Hills, it shifted position in relation to us.  It moved from in front of us to behind us in that 10-mile drive, meaning that it must have been very close to us.<n>

When we stopped the truck to look at it we saw that it was moving at the pace of a normal airplane. As we watched we saw a light come off of it, if the object was a millimeter in size the light that came off of it was about 4 to 5 millimeters. In the light that came off, there was a series of blinking lights inside the light. The light with the blinking lights in it lasted about 10 seconds both times it happened. The object made a strange sound. It kind of sounded like an electric engine. I know that it was the object making the sound because there were no other airplanes around. We wathched the light start to slow down almost to a stop then it disappered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were driving home around 1:30am when I saw a bright orange light in the the sky. From my town we can see airplanes that are approaching Burbank Airport, so we see a lot of airplane activity. The object caught my eye because it did&#39;nt look like any of the airplanes I&#39;ve seen fly by. It did&#39;nt have any of the blinking safty lights that the other planes have. I pulled my truck over to get a better look. When I got out I noticed the object flew about the same speed as the airplanes we see. As we watched the object a beam of light came off of it. Within the light, there were a row of blinking lights that we could not see before. If the object was a millimeter in size the light that came off was about 4-5 millimeters in length. This happened twice. Each time it lasted about 10 seconds. We jumped back into my truck to move becuase we were parked under a street light we wanted to go to a darker place to get a better look. We drove to my friends house which was about 100 yards away from the spot where we first saw it. When we got out of the truck we noticed the object made a strange electrical type sound. I know it was the object making the sound beacuse there were no other aircraft around. As we watched the object we noticed it started to slow down to a very slow speed. Right when it seemed like the object was going to come to a stop it disappered. I called the local police and the airport to see if any one else reported it. Each said no.<n>

Simi Valley, Ca. for a friend to show up, which she did at 1:19 pm. At that moment, we both seen a white/orange fire ball with a tail approx. 20 times longer the the Dim. of the object in the South-west sky heading toward us. To me, it looked like a meteor going through the lower atmosphere,or an airplane with it&#39;s wing on fire. This lasted approx. 2 minutes. then the odject turn into a white dot with a blue haze around it and slowed down very fast. That this point the odject was almost above us in the clear early morning sky. Then the odject stop above us at a high altitude for approx. 3 to 4 minutes it turn into a hazes red ball, and faded away into the morning sky. .<n>

Of course we were up late even though we had things to do the next morning. We decided that we should invite some more people over and go into the backyard for a little night swimming. After everyone got there awe headed into the pool and about ten minutes into it I saw something in the sky, it was a red light, not very big but it was fairly bright. It couldn&#39;t have been an airplane because it was eratacly moving around, like no airplane that i&#39;ve ever heard of can do without reaching the burbling point and stalling. I pointed up and told the few people that were surrounding me to look up, they were as shocked as I was. We sat there and watched it until it just dissapeared. It must have been an either really big object or very bright because our teacher doesn&#39;t even live int the same city as us and he saw it, and it was at about the same time we saw it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day in school we were still a little freaked out by what we had seen and decided not to tell anyone, but our teacher brought it up. He asked if anyone else had seen the UFO last night. Me and my friends raised our hands and we began to discuss this in class. It turns out that a few of my classmates had also apparently seen it as well. My teacher had called his friend who used to fly F-14&#39;s for the navy and he said that it would be impossible for it to have been a plane from it&#39;s movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Neither of the objects were moving, we neared the lights as we travelled eastbound.  We first saw them at apx. the 95 mile post marker.  As we approached these lights and were almost beneath them, the light on the north side turned off and strobe-like lights were seen being emitted from the bottom.  Within less than a minute that it took for us to exit the interstate and stop to observe, these lights disappeared in a flash in what appeared a southwest direction towards the Palo Verde Nuclear Plant.  We returned westbound to mile post 103, exited the freeway and attempted to locate these lights again, but to no avail.  My husband drives a truck professionally at night and has for almost 40 years.  He&#39;s never seen anything  like that before.  The sky was mostly clear with only vapor trails visible.  The stars were out and the moon visible to the west.  Reentering the freewasy after stopping we once again headed eastbound on the same path previously taken apx 20 minutes earlier.  Nothing.

When he mentioned that it didn&#39;t look terrestial and that he didn&#39;t think there were any roads in that direction, I finally turned to look.  I saw a light behind some trees about 100 yards away.  The light suddenly travelled up the hill at an incredibly fast speed and the light was blueish.  This was enough to convince me it wasn&#39;t the kind of light normally emitted by a flashlight.  I immediately started the truck and proceeded along the road to leave the area while we watched to see if it was going to follow us.  We both prayed for the next 10 minutes for fear of what the light emitting object might have been.<n>

She brought two pair of binoculars and we watched the object as it continued toward us in an east bound direction. The object was orbiting in a tight circle as it was moving east.  So it was actually going in circles, but still keeping a straight eastbound course. At one point, a Plane that hat taken off from McCarran airport crossed the objects path and the object appeared to have stopped completely.  When the plane was well away from the object after passing in front of it, the object again started moving east until it was lost from our sight due to entering the brightly lit sky of the las vegas strip area.<n>

They moving one behind the other approximately from the north to the south at about the same speed as a high altitude jet liner would be moving.  With my arm extended straight out, each object was two hand widths from the next in a single file.  When they reached the highest point above the horizon, about 75 degrees, the middle light went out.  As it went out, smaller bright yellow pieces fell off.  They looked to be burning.  These pieces went out after a few seconds.  As the remaining two objects approached about 45 degree off the southern horizon, each burned out within about 10 seconds of each other.  They also dropped pieces that were lit for about 2-3 seconds.  This is all I saw. My first guess was some kind of missle.  What is strange is that they were moving north to south.  I am not aware of any missle ranges north of Sacramento.  Also, if they were dropping debris, it is likely that some might fall onto a city.  Beale AFB is close by.  Perhaps they were testing something.  About 2 years ago, I saw something similar occur over my house, but the direction was south to north.  I did not file a report on this object, but could if you want.  There were some unique features of this other account that may interest you.  I left my phone number off below.

Lights were far too much apart to have been an airplane. Visible for about six minutes. The lights disappeared one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 3/11/00 at 7:04pm PST, our 16 year-old son invited my wife and I to step outside and view some lights in the sky. We all saw three redish-tinted lights moving across the sky at about 45 degrees elevation in the northeast. The lights were traveling from north to south at about the speed of an airliner at a long distance. The thing that really drew our attention was the way the lights moved in synch with each other--as if they were a single object. However, the lights were so far apart that to have been eminating from an airplane, the plane would have had to have been extrememly close and visible, which it was not. The lights had a slight flicker, but they definately did not blink or flash. At 7:06, the middle light disappeared completely and never reappeared. The other two lights continued to move across the sky at the same speed and at their original distance from each other. My wife and son say they saw the middle light fall downward very rapidly before disappearing. I was focusing on the left light and did not observe the fall. Though there were some areas of patchy clouds visable, there were none in that area of the sky. We then moved from the back yard to the front in order to continue watching the prossession. The two remaining lights moved across 80% of the sky over the next four minutes. At about 7:10pm the rightmost light disappeared. Initially, I thought it might have gone behind a bank of clouds to the south. A minute later the leftmost light also vanished suddenly. The lights had disappeared instantaneously--not gradually as they would have had they gone behind a cloud. When the clouds cleared a few minutes later, we confirmed the lights were totally gone. This phenomenon was clearly enough visible that it should have been witnessed from anywhere in the Sacramento area.<n>

There has been no investigation that we know of, except it was reported on the news.  Why don&#39;t we have answers?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, March 10th..my family and friends were downstairs at the Arlington of Rockford on East State St.  At about 9:10 pm, a security officer rushed through the door from outside to grab anyones attention to come out and see what was outside.  He seemed rather disturbed, so we all ran from our table to see what he was talking about.  There was about 12 of us witnesses to his discovery.  He pointed south and up in the overcast sky.  There was a formation of 5 orange/amber, bright lights.  He said, earlier they came right over the building in a single file, and at that time I thought I heard him say he saw 9 all together and 4 of them left. They made no sound and I don&#39;t remember even seeing any stars because it was so overcast...but these lights sure stood out though. When we got there, they were in sort of a circular formation.  One by one would either vanish or fade off with time.  One in particular sort of floated to the top of the rest and stayed there the longest as the others faded.  While we were out there, this process took at least 10 minutes itself with the one standing alone.  This particular one let off like a &#34;fire-spray&#34; underneath it or something.  It was still out there when I walked back in the building to tell the rest of our party.  Small world as it now seems, coincidently, my daughter saw what she discribed as the same thing on New Years Eve near her house.  I was on the phone with her as she saw an amber-like light glow and move unusually with no sound over her area. I knew by the sound of her voice that she was concerned enough to know it was not normal or like anything she&#39;s ever seen. This seems to happen quite often around here.  I think it&#39;s only fair we all know what these objects are.<n>

(She lives a few blocks south of BEST BUY on E. State st., where earlier sightings occurred.) She urged us to look! We saw 5 bright orange kite-shaped lights arranged in a &#34;question mark&#34; formation.  The sky was cloudy  but we could tell they were much larger and closer than stars.  They were up very high, like planes, but we knew they weren&#39;t moving like planes. We saw them in formation for about 15 minutes, and then they started fading in color. They looked almost like flames painted in the sky. Their shape, from where WE were watching, was a cross between  a kite or teardrop, and a flame, but they didn&#39;t &#34;flicker&#34; like flames. Their size seemed to remain the same as they paled to light cream, and then suddenly, one by one, they were only a white dot higher in the western sky. My husband(engineer) thinks they disappeared like an extinguished flame. He thinks it&#39;s all a hoax. To me, it looked like their speed changed rapidly when they changed from pale lights to white dots(WARP SPEED!) As the first 5 were fading one by one, 3 more started rising slowly from the north. They seemed to come over the horizon from approximately E. State St., possibly over St. Anthony&#39;s Hospital, which has a HUGE steel helicopter port with  lots of blinking  red and white lights on it.( BEST BUY is directly across the street.) As these final 3 lights moved towards us, 2 of them seemed to be directly side by side, and at one point it looked as though their side &#34;arms&#34; actually touched.  Then they separated and moved higher in the sky.  Those 3 did not make any particular formation, and 2 faded out fairly quickly, but the last one stayed alone in the same spot for close to 10 minutes, as though it was &#34;observing &#34; all the people watching it ! There were many people out observing, from our house all the mile and a half to E. State St. On our block alone we know of 10, plus 2 others on nearby streets. In addition , someone in the area of Alpine and Newberg Roads,(1 mi.west and north)got it on Video and reported this sighting to the local T.V.news.(The video wasn&#39;t shown on T.V.) Also, while WE saw lights that did not seem to be round, our neighbors further north saw what they called &#34;balls of light,&#34; but they saw the same formation and number of light, and at the same time, so it may have been the angle at which we were viewing this phenomena. I first heard about these mysterious light several weeks ago, when a fellow teacher confided inme that he had seen them on a Friday night at 9 PM, just as he was leaving the store next to BEST BUY. He lives close by, so he had time to get home and videotape the lights he saw.  I asked to see his tape and hee is making me a copy, so that the original does not get lost. If it looks useable, we will send you a copy.  Today one of my students told me her neighbor also made a video of one of the sightings, so I&#39;ll check into that as well.The one thing I want to stress is that some people here in Rockford have tried to dismiss these incidences as shooting stars or &#34;Northern Lights,&#34; meteor showers, flares, etc. Flares are the closest possible explanation to what WE saw, but I don&#39;t know if flares could remain stationary for 15 minutes. (My son wondered if they could have been flares on balloons?) The other suggestions all fall DOWNWARD, and these lights started low and moved upward. In addition, another reliable person said he saw the lights some weeks ago, and he saw them move into several different formations: Diamond, square, circle, etc. Finally, the girl that first called us to go out and look said she saw what looked like ashes falling from one of the several lights she saw.<n>

My wife thought there might have been two lights close together at the center of the object. We could not discern an outline. Our best guess as to size and distance is something about the size of a passenger jet at 500 to 1000 feet altitude, but traveling at least two or three times as fast as we would expect to see a plane move. We were driving north, and the object crossed our path moving from east-southeast to west-northwest. We saw it traverse about two-thirds of the sky, in a straight line. Then it suddenly disappeared well before it reached the western horizon. My wife saw it change color to bright red for an instant before it winked out. Since I was driving, I missed the color change. There were patches of light haze, but stars were clearly visible throughout the sky. I immediately stopped the car and scanned the sky to be sure there were no clouds it could have flown into. I also flagged down the next car that passed. Its two occupants had seen the same thing, including the disappearance and color change. All four of us agreed that we heard no sound from it whatsoever. In fact, these two witnesses had watched it for several seconds longer than we, and had shut off their car&#39;s engine and rolled down the windows to listen.<n>

So after about 10 min. a c-5 Cargo jet came in and landed , as it did i noticed a few army choppers landing as well. I thought to my self &#34;man&#34; there&#39;s alot of fuss over that c-5 i wonder whats up w/ that thing. so i walked across the street to get a better look and view so i waited 30min or so to let it get stopped in front of the hanger at the middle of the run way. As the c-5 stopped i noticed guys in what looked like a light grey army fatiges run around the plane and hanger. thats weird i thought. why would they be acting that way well while this unfolding the wind had blowing about some all night. and as they unloaded this large craft like cargo the tarp caught wind and lifted just enough for me to see a round shaped craft that seemed to glisten in the hanger lights almost like it had a slight glow or some thing and quickly the soldiers covered it up and a unloaded in to the hanger and thats it i feel crazy writeing this cause nobody believes me they say you saw a jet but i know what i saw and that was no jet no way.<n>

Southwest sky at 11:00 position. Several aircraft in northeast sky flying southwest at the time.  They, too should have see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I saw the fireballs March 9, 2000, at 10:09p.m. It lit up our forest brighter than daylight.  A bright, white light held us and all the wildlife in silence for about 45 seconds. I was looking up (at the 11:00 position in the sky, toward the southwest) when the bright ball hit a glass like dome above the planet.  The ball was about the size of a golf ball.  It hurt my right eye; it was so bright. We stood in the white-light waiting for it to stop.  When it did I quickly looked at my watch.  It was 10:09p.m. We next saw several airplanes in the sky flying toward the southwest from the northeast. At 10:10p.m. a second ball was above us in the exact same path that the first had taken.  It looked like a large meteor.  It had a golden-red color and trails of blue flying from its sides. The second ball was not round.  It had the long tail of a meteor;  unlike the large white ball I saw the first time. The other strange thing to this is that at 10:00p.m. (before this all happened) my husband said to me that he thought we should go outside for a walk down our driveway (we live deep in the woods).  I was already ready for bed but his tone of voice sounded strange - so I said OK.  We stepped outside our house knowing that something was going to happen.  We both joked that maybe he was being called by UFO&#39;s.  Well, when the white light hit us, we didn&#39;t laugh. One more note -  yesterday, March 22, 2000, when I mentioned this to someone, they said they had a friend who was out on the lake that night fishing, and he too, saw the fireballs.  He was so frightned by the first long, white-night light that he thoutht it was the rapture (second coming of Christ). I have to admit that during the light-night(45 seconds long) I, too, thought it was the rapture or something else on a cosmic level. For the next few days we were often confused about what night it actually all happened.  It was difficult for us to remember if it was Thursday or Wednesday.  We thought that was strange.  I had journaled it on Thursday. When the first fireball hit it revealed a glass like dome above the planet.  Its white-light spread above the dome which than revealed a clear distinction from above the dome to below the dome.  I was giving my husband a hug when it hit.  He is a tall man so my head was looking up at the night sky - in the exact spot that it appeared when it hit.  The flash hurt my right eye but not my left.  We felt suspended in a sort of time warp as the light-night surrounded us.  Everything was brighter than white, except the trees seemed to be shadows, yet they, too, were bright.  It was just that the bright light was so bright that the trees seemed shadowed. There was no sound of anykind except my husband and I. We held each other and asked each other - what do ya think it is? The second fireball was the lenghth about 4&#34;.  Typical teardrop shape.  It followed in the same ark of the first, and it hit the same spot on the glass dome - but it did not make the dome. The dome was no longer there. That only lasted a few seconds while the first light was at is greatest intensity. The second fireball looked like a meteor. I often stay up late to watch the meteor showers in the fall.  This one was not only 4&#34; long, it was 1/2&#34; wide in its front.  Trails of blue light curled from its sides. It was the largest meteor I have ever seen. I hope all this informathion helps some how.<n>

I have also included my first sighting in great detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a plane because of the two bright head lights as it moved Northwest; however, it made an slow, short turn north-bound.  It seemed to move slow north until it stoped.   There were three colors of lights on base of the object.  Two green lights, two red lights and one larger pulsating light at the center. The two green lights were perpendicular with the two red lights.  I was driving down Clemens center parkway when I noticed the craft turning north bound while slowing down.  It was on my left hand side about 40 feet in the air.  It seemed to descend sightly. Then it stopped in mid air!  It made no sound!  I expected to hear helocopter or hovercraft engines, but I heard nothing!  Even as I stopped at the light, still heard nothing. There were other small lights on the rim that gave it a disk-like shape.   The wind was blowing quite hard from the North and yet it remained so still.  You might have thought it was secured by a long tower base.  It  reminded me the of the CN Tower in Toronto, CANADA.  I was intrigued how it seemed to break the laws of physics.  After I had stopped the car at the light, the object began to move again northward.  I wanted to turn left down fifth Street to follow it but the traffic light caught me. A police car was in the lane perpendicular to my lane so it did not behoove me to make a U-turn on yellow.  Not realizing that there also was a police car behind me I backed my car up slightly since I just had missed the yellow light and tried to back my car up from the intersection.  The Officer honked to make his presence known.  As a result, I was unable to track down the object.  As I hopelessly tried to quickly get on to Clemens center pkwy North-bound, I realized that I lost track of this stange phemnomena. This was my second sighting. My first sighting was an Iron-shaped object with a small pulsating blue light at tail tip of this a the top rear of the object.  As I traveled down hoffman street in Elmira, October 1993 at 8:30 PM on a thursday, as my father and I were driving to Geroulds Pharmacy.  I noticed the two bright heads lights from the distance.  The object seemed to ascend from a distance as it appeared to come over a hill.  As we were driving south bound I marverled at how slow this object seemed as it moved towards our car.  Normally a plane would be faster.  After parking in back of the westside Geroulds pharmacy my father went into the store to pickup his perscriptions.  I got out of the Car to see this slow moving object pass by.  The base of the object was trianglar and so metalic and shining that it reflected the Orange lights at the southern tier pedictric heath center.  There was also a blue light at the two rear bottom corners of the object.  There were no indentations where wheels might be dislodged, it was a completely flat mirror-like base.  I&#39;d say the vehihcle was about 7-feet long with small dark window sand moved no more than 15 miles per hour.  This area was very well lite and I cound see every detail of this object.  Another stricking feature of this object was that it had no wings.  It was a dark gray color and gave off no emmissions.  It literally looked like a flying iron without a handle.  It flew just above the trees. It also made no sound.  I pinched myself, and moved to different areas of the street to hear an echo of sound that might be ricorchete from buildings, yet I heard no sound at all.  This craft was heading north-bound as I headed south. I have always been skeptical about UFO sightings.  However, I have come to appreciate organizations who are familiar with this phenomenna.  Now I do believe people who see these things are not inviting delusions.  When I see airplanes, there some instances where they appear like flying saucers from certain angles.  I was expecting a plane or helocopter, but saw objects that seemed to break the laws of aerodynamics.  Nor did these objects resemble anything that I have ever seen.  I am going to start keeping a camera or video camera in my car, once I can afford it.<n>

The fireball was observed while we were traveling east on I-40 at Sallisaw Oklahoma.  We observed a unusually bright and long duration shooting star.  This object appeared to travel from east to west, but could have been south to north.  The object appeared to impact the ground in the Sallisaw area, north of I-40.  My viewpoint was from the mile marker 311.  The size of the &#34;fireball&#34; appeared to be about the size of a BB held at arms lenght with the arm at about 25 degrees of elevation. I am a remote site electronic technician so I normally see a lot of shooting stars, this one appeared much larger than any I have seen previously.  We were able to follow the star below our visual horizon as it traveled through the sky.<n>

More from Little Rock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Thursday night march 9th around 10 pm two of my friends saw a huge portion of the sky north of little rock light up for 5 seconds. From their perspective this is the description I was given. Looking north from the most northeast side of one of the tallest hills in North Little Rock, In clear view of the city lights to the south over downtown and the dark sky to the north, as well as the entire eastern skyline (mostly the lights of NLR). It was a partly cloudy comfortable evening, the northern night sky lit up like a fireball. There was no streak from the sky, it looked more like a tremendous explosion which lasted for almost 5 seconds. They went on and on about how they were actually able to stand there watching the tremendous north lights and talk about it at the same time. Both kept asking the other &#34;do you see that, look at that!&#34; and was able to ask each other that question 3 times each while the light stayed illunminated. Niether of my friends, whom both are intelligent people, would make up such a story. I have sat with one of them in his backyard on the Arkansas River on meteor storm evenings and watched meteors with him. He would have identified the light as a meteor if he thought it was one. That night at 11:00pm i met up with them both and they shared the story with me. It dominated the conversation for the next 20 minutes. They left approx 11:30 and I remained on the back porch of my friends house looking from the same perspective. Around 11:50pm, right before the art bell show so the time is approx, I heard a boom noise, almost like an explosion sound, come from the southeast. Turning around I saw what appeared to be a mushroom cloud come from the south. To be honest I was scared to death and quite shaken, not quite sure what i saw. I ended up staying up to 2am listening to art bell wondering if the local radio would report anything. I went to sleep and learned about the fire the next day. All 3 of us have seen the local TV coverage of the fire south of little rock. The local talk radio shows on Art&#39;s affiliate here in Little Rock have mentioned the fire. Details however are very limited. I do know however that the area of the large fire had camera crews on the seen either 1 or 2 days later, because i saw it on TV.  The scanner reports apparently is what makes this case interesting. I have heard 2 local media personalities talk about what the people on the scene said. However niether of the media guys mentioned any specifics. Good luck with this, hope others can confirm what I saw. Please only contact me through email and do not release my information to anyone.

On March 9, around 9:00pm CST, in the western sky, I saw a large, spherical object slowly descend in a diagonal until it disappeared behind the tree line. It was BRIGHT--a fluorescent green so bright it almost appeared white. It was LARGE--much larger than anything I have ever seen traverse the sky.  Most unusual, though, it descended the sky relatively slowly--much slower than any shooting star that I have seen.  I saw the object for 3 or 4 seconds.  When it descended below the tree line, I expected to hear a &#34;boom&#34; or something--I thought that it might have been an burning airplane.  Local news gave no mention of the event.<n>

AS IT GOT TO THE NORTH OF MY VIEW, I SAW THE LIGHT DIM, NOT GO OUT. THE FIREBALL DID NOT DIM, JUST THE WHITE LIGHT. WHILE DIMMING DOWN, THE FIREBALL SLOWED DOWN FOR A SECOND OR TWO.

I saw it for about 3 secs, but can specify exactly where, and at what rate it was travelling. It is my beleif that it either burned up before it landed, (about 200ft. above ground) or I couldnt see it land due to a ridge nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish to be contacted about this information preceeding the report I will submit to the offices of emergency management. I wouldnt have sought to release this information, as I thought it was insignifigant, but I heard on the radio that there was an anomolous occurance that night with a fireball sighting. I was urged to divulge what I knew as I thought that I would possibly have been one of the few to see this land. I am knowledegable in the field of physics, and somewhat in astronomy. I can give a scientific account concerning where it was in the celestial sphere. I know it was very close.<n>

I was headed in a westbound direction. As I drove along, a bright flash to the south of me attracted my attention. I thought it must be a flash of lightning and turned my head to see if there storms in that direction. I turned my head just in time to see a fireball breaking up into red-orange colored embers. The fireball was moving from a westerly to easterly direction, and the angle of travel was slightly toward the southeast. The original bright flash which caught my attention was bright enough to light up the southern night sky. The night sky was fairly clear, except for some smoky haze due to numerous forest fires in the area at the time. The duration of the sighting was extremely short, a few seconds at most. The red-orange embers from the fragmenting fireball faded from view instantly as the object broke apart. I was not sure of the exact time of the sighting but I knew it to be between 2000 and 2030 hours local time. I was in Laclede county at the time of the sighting and still had a few miles to go before I crossed into Dallas county where I live.<n>

Their light was exactly a star light. Another one was moving , it was either moving or lowering, it can&#39;t be said. I have observed the moving light for 30 seconds until the view is cut by the trees. The motion was slow, i have though it&#39;s a meteorit, but it was too slow and the light remained, not dimmed.

The &#34;light&#34; seemed to move the same as the curvature of the moon around the bottom.  When the &#34;light&#34; curved in an up direction..from my perspective... it just disappeared.  There was no flashing, no colors, just a steady movement.  From the time I spotted the light until it was gone took five seconds..counting one thousand one, one thousand two etc.  I immediately went inside and wrote down what I had observed.<n>

I am a courier for a pharmacy. This night, I was on my way from Little Rock to Blythville.  I saw a fireball that looked to be around the size of a baseball or softball...and was moving the same direction as I was...southeast to northwest.  I saw it out of my driver&#39;s side window...probably for about 3 to 5 seconds.  I had already seen it when I called my daughter that night around 8:30pm.  This means I had to be close to West Memphis when I saw the thing...and the time must have been between 7 and 7:30pm.  The more I try to remember the exact time and place I was...the more I can not...strange, considering I checked the clock when I saw it so I would remember the time...but It was fully dark.  That would have had to put me within a few miles of the town.  It looked like someone had thrown a ball of lava through the sky...and was losing bits of itself...these bits of what looked like molten rock formed a tail on the thing. This is the first time i have seen something this unusual.  I have seen meteror showers and shooting stars...this did not look like anything I have seen before...but whatever it was, I am glad that I did see it!!<n>

It irradiated a green color and lasted about 5-8 seconds and just disappeared.  Mu husband was not looking that way and saw nothing.  It seemed about almost as high as our 2-story house so it was fairly low to the ground.  I ruled out a child&#39;s toy or anything else and for lack of a better word, call it a ufo.

As if I were seen,it took off in a straight line about 3in, toward the West, before I lost sight of it because of clouds or surroundings, I don&#39;t know which.  I estimate the size to be that of a large airliner at 25,000 ft.,or the size of a dime,from the distance of 8 ft.  The objects luminecents got darker in the center of the object. The sighting only lasted a half second. There was no sound at all during the sighting that I could remember.<n>

The object then shadowed a jetliner that was flying from the east to the southwest, at first keeping a parallel path and then slowly veering west until it disappeared entirely.<n>

This however was no aircraft I have ever seen before. The 3 lights were steady, not blinking in any way, and not red or green like typical aircraft lights. They were not traveling very fast, maybe between 300 and 600 km/h. At first it looked like one triangular object with 3 lights at each corner, but then one of the lights began to shift position rapidly, changing the appearance/angle of the triangular craft. This led me to believe that I was seeing three separate objects with one steady light each, flying in a very precise geometric formation, until they began to shift. The sighting lasted only 15-20 seconds because we lost sight of it as it moved further away. It was a clear night with considerable air traffic. There were several commercial airliners in the sky in various altitudes around the time of the sighting. This was definitely not one of them though. I would say that I know more about civilian and military aviation than the average person, having visited many airshow, having read dozens of books on these subjects, including aircraft recognition guides, and having actively searched the skies in Germany, Maryland, and even &#34;Area 51&#34; on countless occasions. I have no idea what I saw, so I think it qualifies as a UFO... (The second person, my mother, saw the exact same thing.)<n>

The visibility was great so I was looking at the stars more than usual.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw a large light in the sky approaching from the NE.  At first it reminded me of a spotlight.  I watched it briefly(3 or 4 seconds at most) before it seemed to disappear behind some very faint and thin clouds low in the southern sky, which was my first indication that it was not a light originating from the ground since it was visible in clear skies but not visible when it entered the lightly clouded area. The light was sort of a semi-circle, boomerang, like shape that kinda reminded me of a bird.  I concluded that it was not a bird, however, because birds are not luminescent and the sun was completely set.  Also the bird would have had to have been ENORMOUS to take up as much sky as it did at an altitude that was obviously higher than the thin clouds(which were very high).  The color was sort of pinkish-brown if that makes sense.  Not all that bright but clearly visible because it was first caught in my perifreals. No lights or blinkers. No sound. I&#39;m at a loss as to what it may have been and would appreciate any educated suggestions.<n>

It was just after sunrise and it apeared directly ahead of me at 45 degrees, roughly 10,000 feet altitude and stationary. I watched it for 10 seconds then it faded out. Within 1 second it or another object reapeared about 20 degrees to the right at the same altitude, but this time it was moving slowly to the left for about 30 seconds. Then, with an extremely bright flash it vanished. Seconds before the flash, the object looked like two ovals connected side to side.

At 2221 I was waiting to see a pass of an iriduim satellite that was due at 2236.  For this is my hobby, looking for Iridium satellites, and keeping track of Mir and the ISS.  While I waited, I turned to Orion and observed through the binoculars a flash of light just like an Iridium satellite makes when It&#39;s main array catches the sun.  The weird thing was that the flashing didn&#39;t move.  It stayed about 13 arc minutes to the east of M42.  Flashing about once every 8 seconds.  The intensity of flashes was not the same, and the interval was not the same between the flashes.  But the big flashes seemed to be around 6 - 10 seconds apart.  The biggest flashes were about the same magnitude as the Trapezium stars at about 5.  This went on for about 2 minutes, then the flashing seemed to move to the north west of M42 keeping within a 13 arc minute circle from the center of M42.  This went on for about a minute or two.  Then all was quiet.  This may sound funny, but it looked like I was witnessing a battle or explosions that were localized in that area. My quardinates are 49.2330 degrees N, 7.3170 degrees E.

I saw a bright light about the size of a dime at arms length, the light was a blueish white color, it was moving fairly quickly across the sky, but there was plenty of time for me to turn my head and see it for about 10 or 20 seconds, the light moved from the northeast to the southeast in an arcing path, which led me to believe it was far away. Before the object reached the horizon it disappeared. We heard no noise. I do not believe this was a shooting star because it was way to big, it was constant, and it lasted too long.<n>

When I thought the moon had traveled through my shot, I went to look in the viewfinder and it was completely black, but then I noticed a quick, little white &#34;spark or flash.&#34; I kept observing this flash and can be heard on the camera&#39;s mic saying something is wrong with my camera. Later I put the footage in my editor, slowed it down and realized this &#34;spark&#34; was dancing all over the screen and in a few places can see more than one flash and with some enhancements can even see a rotation around these objects. One freeze frame shows the perfect shape of a saucer with blue and green haze. I have never been &#34;into&#34; UFO&#39;s or such, but I still wonder now, like my two buddies also who were there, exactly what this could have been?<n>

I was amased and confused because I have never seen anything weird in the sky that I couldn&#39;t explain. They were round with no lights, grey in color. The sun was in a position where the top half of the body was lit and grey in color and the bottom half was darker as if in the shadow of the sun.

At 4:30am on Monday, March 6th, I was out on the deck looking at the stars, and trying to hear what the drunk neighbors were yelling about.. Anyway, I went back to looking up at the sky, and at approximately 2-o-clock my position (NorthWest), out over the Ocean I saw what appeared to be a slow moving star or satellite...Cool. No big deal I thought. You see satellites all the time in the night sky. But what made this sighting take on a whole new dimension was that there was another one slightly cocked at an angle trailing it, but at a &#34;fixed&#34; position. So I thought, &#34;2 satellites travelling together? Do they do that?&#34; Then, I noticed yet ANOTHER satellite, this one trailing both the first two, but at the SAME moving, fixed position. So all of a sudden I realized I was now looking at either: A) Three craft or satellite, moving together in perfect triangular formation -or- B) ONE very large craft, shaped like a backwards triangle... This is what I saw... W -----&gt; N First seen &#34;satellite&#34; +&lt; Third seen &#34;satellite&#34; +&lt; Second seen &#34;Satellite&#34; +&lt; The thing I need to find out now is if satellites do travel in fixed formation relative to one another.

I was ((deleted))  near the Lincoln Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial when the following events occurred.  I was standing in Constitution Gardens on the north side of the pond, looking approximately southwest towards Orion.  I saw what I at first took to be a shooting star because of its speed and the way it seemed to be falling or dropping, but it didn&#39;t fade away the way falling stars usually do.  Then I saw that there were actually two lights which were moving along parallel to each other.  The lights were small and white with a pale greenish tinge.  I thought it might be an airplane with a light on either wingtip, but the lights were not flashing, and they seemed to be moving too fast for an airplane.  As I watched, the two lights converged into one, and then changed again so that one appeared to be following or chasing the other.  The rear light seemed to be &#34;swinging&#34; back and forth behind the path of the front light.  It crossed my mind that they might be fighter planes, but they looked like they were much too close together, and there was no noise (I noticed this because a few seconds after they disappeared, a regular airplane went by in approximately the same location, and I could clearly hear it).  The lights were headed almost directly towards the North Star, but a little lower on the horizon.  They disappeared into the lights of the city.  I looked at my watch and it was 10:05 pm - the entire incident had taken about 10 seconds.  I immediately went back to the ((deleted)) and wrote everything down, because it seemed like such a peculiar event, and the lights did not strike me as being normal airplanes.<n>

At maybe 45 degrees up off of the eastern horizon I observed a light that had the appearance of an average size star, with an average star brightness.

Just looking at it, it appeared to possibly be thirty or forty miles away, it was far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object because it was traveling the same path as the recent orange colored lights (rockets) that I had seen.

The light circle started out at approximately twice the size of the starlight.  It immediately enlarged within less than a second to three or four times the size of the starlight.  At that instant the light circle collapsed back onto the starlight.  The starlight then appeared to head due east, away from Florida.

The size of these lights were double the diameter of the moon size.  These lights were light blue in colour.  Four of these lighted objects were moving in a particular rhythmn, whereas one was solitary.  These four lights would converge at one point and then they would move out and again come and converge.  This sequence was repeating itself many times.  Whereas the other solitary lighted object was just moving from left to right.

The size of these lights were double the diameter of the moon size.  These lights were light blue in colour.  Four of these lighted objects were moving in a particular rhythmn, whereas one was solitary.  These four lights would converge at one point and then they would move out and again come and converge.  This sequence was repeating itself many times.  Whereas the other solitary lighted object was just moving from left to right.  This happened for about 6-7 minutes and then they all started moving left to right.  The sky was cloudy.  This light was not very sharp but a kind of dispersed type. After ten min these lights disappeared.

The clips which we captured on the video are not clear, since it was very dark.  But only we can see some lights moving across the dark sky. The speed of these lights were medium. This event was witnessed by myself, my wife and our two years old son.<n>

The lights were about the same size as my thumbnail at arms length and their for- mation was as large as both hands at armslength.  As each revolution was completed, the lights converged, merged, then separated returning to position on the outer circumference of the circle.  These lights were fairly bright and their shape was crisp.  There was no telltale shaft of light indicating a groundbased source.  The episode lasted about 25 minutes and no sounds could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A person who read this report wrote to apprise us of its probable origin.

It broke into 3 objects smaller than the 1st, then formed a triangle. Triangle had another object in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the middle of the day I noticed an object which at 1st glance could&#39;ve been mistaken for a balloon in the sky. The difference being the object NEVER moved. It remained motionless while birds and planes went past it at a much lower altitude. After about 20 minutes the object still remained. I didn&#39;t mention anything to my friends because I knew they would think I was joking. After asking one of the other guys in my golf foursome to look he and I both observed the object spliting into 3 additional globes. They were white like the original one. They were smaller in size by comparison. I freaked. But what startled me the most is when they then formed a triangle. Tingles shot up my spine and my friend and I started to call the to others to look. It was witnessed by 5 more people including the next group of golfers behind us. The objects zoomed away and I continued to see the original shpere. It too eventually disappeared or I lost it in the bright sun. But about an hour and a half later before I finished my round of golf I saw it again. Only to lose it again in the sky. Now I believe.<n>

I was looking to the West-Southwest at about 110 degree angle in the sky.  There were 3 green lights far overhead in a straight line formation running North to South with a little bit of a Northwest to Southeast slant.  We have an airport further to the west, but my father&#39;s a pilot and my husband works for Northwest and I KNOW these were not planes.  They stayed there unmoving.  They looked similar to stars, but as I watch the stars in that exact location every night, I can tell you that they were never there before or since. I am a 37 year old married female, computer systems administrator.  This is my first report of a UFO.  The objects seemed to blink clear or yellow , exactly together in sync, every once in a while, on a non-regular basis. There were aircraft out that night, but none near the objects.<n>

The sky was clear and stars were visible. Looking NW, an area of the sky was blacked out, at an angle between 20 and 40 degrees from the horizontal. Looking closer, the blacked out area was the shape of a boomerang, oriented vertically, wider in the middle than at the ends, somewhat larger in the sky than a full moon. The concave side of the shape was in the direction of motion. I stood still, and the shape moved slowly westward, blocking out stars behind it. As I focused, I could see that the object had a surface comparable to dark, polished aluminum, as the stars&#39; images slightly wrapped around the edges of the object as it moved. I saw no lights on the object itself and heard no sound. Its distance from me must have been at least two miles, but probably not more than five. As it continued to move westward it passed behind some trees. I tried to get an unobstructed view again, but by then I could not see it any more.<n>

As soon I saw the street saw a disk like shape that look to have like a hill on top of it.  It was real big. It had green lights around it in the middle just turning on and off.  It just kept hovering on top of the trees that were there.  It just kept moving along that area.  Then what I believe why it left its that my cousin started flashing the cars light at it.  Then it started to move towards us then all of the sudden went higher and moved to another direction we followed it for a mile. It just flew over hwy 290 and we stopped.  It was already high and we could barely see it if it wasnât for the green lights that keep turning on and of. And all of the sudden it moved in a circle and in a blink of an eye it just disappeared.  I have never seen anything move that fast.  I could see lights flashing on and off coming from inside the woods, but I thought it was the owner outside checking on some cows. I have not seen the saucer since then.  I have gone in the middle of the night just stay there to see if I see something.  Now thereâs a company named LEWCO, were there we saw the saucer hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought it was an airplane at first then I noticed there were absolutely no lights to be seen on it though it was at an altitude that looked high enough for an approach to a landing much like an airplane.  I thought nothing of it and put my sights back to the road when my friend in the passenger seat exclaimed, &#34;Are you seeing this?&#34;.  Suprised that someone else saw the same thing and it was not a hallucination I looked back up into the sky.  The clouds where being dimly lit by the street and city lights in the distance however this object seemed to absorb the light.  You could tell that it was at least a shadow of an object grazing slightly inside the clouds and when I thought it would come out so I could get a better view it seemed to change its course back into the clouds to where it was obscured.  I remember the movement was very odd.  It would zig zag slightly and it had a bell curve kind of acceleration that wasn&#39;t too abrubt but not like any plane or helicopter that I have seen and I have seen frequent helicopter landings living next to a Care-flight center.  What I can&#39;t figure out is that if it was a shadow why there was no plane in sight to create it on the clouds above or where the light source could have been from inside or above the clouds.  There were none with that kind of intensity.  It made no sound.  It was very dark and had a shape akin to an inverted delta.  Much like this: <n> / \ We were not on drugs and the drinking didn&#39;t begin till we got to Mardi Gras.  It was one of the coolest things I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It did not change its path.

This is VERY close to John Wayne Airport, and anybody who lives in the area gets used to seeing planes all the time.  Nothing unusual. As I drove, I could still see the star in my perepheral vision easily, and I was startled when the start star started moving slowly. My first reaction was concern that the airplane was going in that same direction, so I looked back up and realized there is no way traffic control would allow two planes to fly so close together, heading toward eachother. At that point I had to concentrate on driving, because that road has a very sharp turn to the left--almost a 90 degree angle, which I had to make. After I turned, (going north)the only way to still see these was to take my eyes off of the road in front of me, and look left out of my window. Fortunately, I was the oonly car on the road at that time. After about the 2nd glance the bright star disappeared in front of my eyes. Unbelievable. I tried telling myself every logical explanation. I thought, well it wasnt a metallic disk, so it wasnt a spaceship. I am really curious if anyone else will or has reported this too. I still have chills. By the way,I am a college student and have a full time job, and am absolutely normal, and very sane.<n>
