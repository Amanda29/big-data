It just hovered over us for what seemed to be quite sometime. The outer edge of the disc has round windows all the way round, then suddenly, silently, shot straight up into the sky never to be seen again. It was almost like it had some sort of anti-gravity system. Sorry, that&#39;s all I can tell you with it being so long ago. Perhaps you may have other records around the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/15/54 21:00|Puyallup|WA|Oval|a few seconds|The object was hovering above the treetops over the road a short distance in front of my car...|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42503.html|3|ndxe195408| The object was hovering above the treetops over the road a short distance in front of my car...<n> <n><n> <n><n> In August or September of 1954, as  I was on my way home (in my car) from a friend&#39;s house about 9:15-9:30 in the evening, I turned west at the corner of the road on which we lived (which was in the country then) and started up a slight incline. I  suddenly saw a craft hovering over the tree tops right above the road just ahead of my car.  It was just getting dark and trees still lined both sides of the road in those days, so the outline of the craft was very prominent. I remember screeming out loud: &#34;Oh, my God.  It&#39;s a blimp...no it&#39;s not a blimp&#34; as I was trying to rationalize what the object might be.  At the same time these thoughts were racing through my mind, I was slamming on my brakes and backing out from under the craft as fast as I could.  I somehow found a driveway to turn around in as I was shaking and crying so hard I could barely drive.  When I got to my friend&#39;s house, I found she and her family were all in bed asleep and it seemed to be much later than it should have been (around 10:30-11 p.m.)  My friend&#39;s family wanted to report my sighting to McChord, but for some reason I felt like I needed to get home right away.  I drove back past the same spot (very cautiously) and made it home okay.  I was still so frightened that I jumped into bed with all my clothes on and went to sleep immediately.  When I awoke the next morning the sun was shining and birds were chirping and it was as if nothing had happened the night before.  I am now almost 72 years old and I have never forgotten this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

While gazing up at the stars I noticed a very small point of steady white light moving upward from just above the horizon.  Its appearance was like a very dim star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly traveled across the sky and after about 30 minutes it disappeared.  If it had been a few years later I would have assumed it was a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright flash in bellingham area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A flash of light lit my whole house.  My dog freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don&#39;t nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.  My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurence.

8/1/54 21:00|Canton|PA|Disk|30 seconds|Large, silver-blue disc shaped oject which gave off high pitched sound and was slowly turning on its axis and then suddenly sped away.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42408.html|5|ndxe195408| Large, silver-blue disc shaped oject which gave off high pitched sound and was slowly turning on its axis and then suddenly sped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of the mid 50&#39;s, going South, 5 miles north of Canton, Pa. on Rt 14, a friend and I saw &#34;something&#34; in the night sky- something phenominal enough to cause me to want to stop the car. It appeared to give off its own light, although there were no visible windows.  I recall having car radio on, but a high pitched noise coming from the sky made me turn the radio off.  The &#34;something&#34; was a silver-blue disk-like object which gave off this high pitched noise.  I estimate the distance to be approximately 1000 feet in altitude and in a southern angle.  Over the years, what has always stayed with me is that the object was turning on its axis in a semi-slow circle.  The bottom of the disk/saucer was not concave, but more or less flat.  After approximately 30 seconds, the object suddenly raced across the sky at an unbelivable speed in a north, north eastern direction.  The sky, in that part of the country, always displayed many stars on a clear night, and this was a clear night.  I don&#39;t recall a moon.  Furthermore, my friend and I raced to our hometown to tell people what we saw, and the movie theater was just letting out, and the first friend we saw we told of the incident, and he said, &#34;I know. We saw it too.&#34;  This was 5 miles south of where we saw it, so the object had to be at a fairly high elevation.  There are many mountains in that part of the country, but where we saw it, was at a place where there was an open area where one could see about 6 miles to the next mountain. We asked around, and there were no county fairs or other happenings that would have a spot light turned to the sky.  I have told this story many times over the past 50 years, and will never forget the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD)))<n>
8/1/54 17:00|Dyer|IN|Triangle|15 seconds+++|I saw a silent exhaustless golden glowing slow flying triangle on a late summer afternoon In 1954 or 1955.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37042.html|6|ndxe195408| I saw a silent exhaustless golden glowing slow flying triangle on a late summer afternoon In 1954 or 1955.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, this is the sighting that I spoke to you about last week on the Jef Rense show. On event duration I put in 15 seconds but I left and ran home (through trees) before the craft, which moving and turning slowly, left view. This triangle was not a sharp arrowhead type but just the opposite: a wing-like triangle much shorter than its width. Its appearence was wider than the moon, maybe two and a half moons. It was bright gold colored and there was no variation that would give a clue as to any curvature or depth to it. It could have been a flying flat two dimensional object for all I could tell. It was turning slowly without banking and there was no sound nor exhaust. The turning was gradual and I assumed it was a small directional correction rather than a complete change but I didn&#39;t observe the final direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was called from lunch outside where a round, bright silvery object was directly overhead. I moved so it could be seen lined up with the edge of the factory roof (I wanted to see if it moved like a balloon). It did not move for over 10 min. I had to check a problrm on an F84F located about 1/2 mile away, drove there, entered cockpit &amp; looked up. The object was still there. When I looked up a few Moments later the object was gone. One of my friends at the plant said it streaked NE over the horizon in a few seconds. He calculated various speeds at different altitudes - all fantastic. I was an AF B24 pilot a few years before &amp; never before or since have seen what I would call a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.
