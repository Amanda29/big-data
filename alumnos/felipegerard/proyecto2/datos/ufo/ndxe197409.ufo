9/30/74 17:00|Puerto Rico||Sphere|abt 1 min.|Gold sphere traveling at tremendous speed sighted over Puerto Rico in Fall of 1974|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64361.html|1|ndxe197409| Gold sphere traveling at tremendous speed sighted over Puerto Rico in Fall of 1974<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a hoax.  On or about 1700 to 1900 (I am guessing on time) on a clear day just before twilite some time in the fall of 1974 I observed a sphere moving at an incredible speed.  There were some clouds but mostly blue sky.  It had no tail, no smoke, and no fire so I knew it was not from earth.  I had no depth perseption so I could only guess on its size.  I could tell it was not a plane.  A plane would be like a snail compared to this object.  The object was like a gold/polished bronze color when it shines in the sun.  I heard the voive of Yahweh as I was watching the sphere and  He spoke to me and said in Spanish, &#34;Mira lo que yo hago&#34;. Translated: Look at what I do!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never believed in UFOs and frankly I thought they were diabolic in nature.  As time when on,  I wondered why this incident was never reported in the media.  I forgot the incident until I saw a program on TV called UFO Files: 1970s.  That reawoke in me the desire to investigate the matter.  The program described an incident were a UFO crashed with a plane in Mexico and I knew it was the same object I observed in Puerto Rico.  The object was caught on radar by the U.S. starting in the Gulf of Mexico so I figured it had just passed by Puerto Rico and Florida.  It had to be the same one. I hope I made some sense of this. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I`ve tried to tell my story and all i got was my let|10/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47051.html|2|ndxe197409| Hello sir I may be 30 years late but i have to tell someone that will believe me.  I`ve tried to tell my story and all i got was my letters returned to me or LAUGHS!  Here we go !<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was 1973 or 1974 in the fall.  I live in Cotton Country and was a (ginner) for about 10 years.  A co-worker asked me to pick him up because he had no way to work that morning (we worked from 7am to 7pm). So the time was between 6am and 6:30am, as close to dawn as you can get at that time of the year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i pulled up to his house, I killed my engine and got out.  That&#39;s when it appeared, just behind the fencerow, maybe 300 to 400 yards behind his house!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled for him to come outside and look---he , his mother and a brother came outside and we watched.  The craft was huge and had lights around the  outside edge of it that was different colors  and the colors rotated.  IT MADE NO SOUND as it lifted off but it did zig-zag as it ascended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so close to it that it didnt take long to be directly under it and  when we lost contact with the outside windows all we could see was the bottom of the craft, which changed colors with the altitude----it changed several times and the last was a (lime green) and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mother told me that she had a full camera in the house but could not think of it.  We went to work and when i got off my shift and started home.  I<n> <n><n> <n><n> saw the lime green light again just south of the gin.  Turned around and went back to show my dad.  By the time i got him to the south door, it was gone and never have seen it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to tell people of what i had seen and all it caused was trouble so i gave it up---BUT---i have 4 witnesses and WE all believe and always will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next cotton year , the man that farmed the land behind the house, said that there was a large place in the field that would not grow cotton (???????)<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS: MY grandmother, who is dead now, saw a strange silver cloud that zig-zaged straight up from the right direction and I had told her nothing___she said that it was there for several hours and has never seen nothing like it before!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thankyou for your time and if you dont believe me--thats ok---I DO--or should i say--WE DO !<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

9/29/74 04:00|Kalama|WA|Oval|4:00|Bright disk shaped light, it made no sound. The edges were sharp and clear.|4/8/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118220.html|3|ndxe197409| It was pitch dark when I pulled into the fishing spot next to the Kalama River in Washington State.  I had showed up to early for fishing, so I sat in the car drinking coffee waiting for daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light coming throughout the trees caught my attention toward the road.  It was a bright disk shaped light, it made no sound.  The edges were sharp and clear. It was moving slowly down the road about 60 feet above the road and stopped.  Then a car came and when the car was directly under the light the dish shape followed the car at the same speed but drop down as it moved at about 45 degree angle.  Then it would stop and moved back to its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the next car came it did the same thing.  It moved quickly and in sharp moves and did not hover.  After the last move it stop and started moving toward me slowly.  The size was twice  bigger then a car  at this point I had my window down and I almost started the car and leave but as it got closer it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it moved up and away at 60 degree movement and stop again. It moved in quick small circular movements and stop and moved higher again then would stop and do quick small circular movements at this time it was becoming smaller like a small dot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Till this day no one believes me.<n>
9/23/74 21:30|Spanaway|WA|Other|unk|On a Late september nite We were Abducted my Mom and I. in Spanaway ,WA. on 23 /09 1974|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65652.html|4|ndxe197409| On a Late september nite We were Abducted my Mom and I. in Spanaway ,WA. on 23 /09 1974<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will start by saying that i became enthused by watching Eric Van Dankien tv show about the triangle.  I then started going outside every nite, with my stepfathers binocoluars and a large lantern flashlite. I would lay down on thegrass my eyes strayning upwards for any sign of movement. when one night it finally paid offwhen 3 crafts that were shaped like the shape of wings of a c-141 sloped wings came together as one east the other south and the last one west they just stopped in mid air. I was so excited that i began to aim the lantern flashlite at them turning it on and off. trying to communicate to them.  But after a short 5 minuets thy began to depart the area. two of the crafts began moving south.  the other one became interested in me that I was trying to signal it.  it then hoverd above my house,while not making any engine noises. it just stayed there. the underneath side was very visible. it looked like a bicycle wheel however it had walk ways underneath the craft with a lower dome shape in the middle of the underside of the craft. I was waving to it when the dome shape opend up like a small window appeared, and a man was waving back to me. after seeing a very bright lite came on I then became very scared. I ran inside the house and I threw the door closed As I was doing this I was screaming Mom there here. Mom was at her sewing machine looked out our big bay window from where she was sitting and said. Hurry lock the door. I started to run back to the door and just before I could reach the door the handle turned, and the door began to open. Iwas crying Mom hide therfe coming inside. but as i turn to run past the living room. I saw my Mom and she was levatating toward the door that had just opend. so I ran faster to my room. thinking that this my safe place. I hurridly looked for a place to hide then I hid in my closet and closed the door.  I was sure that they wouldn&#39;t find me.  It seemed that i was there for hours. I threw alot of clothes on top of me to cover me up. so that! they wo uld not find me.  But just then I felt the door open up and then they found me.  there were two of them a small little guy like me. And a much scarrier guy all dressed in black robe.  I was very frightend just looking at him.  then the small one put his hand to my arm.  And i was walking with him out of my room past the front door to where a lite beamed down from the middle of the dome where earlier i had seen the man in the window of the dome.  we went to the lite and went up ofer my house to the ship.  The room was pitch black I was sitting with this little guy on sompthing like a bench against the wall, he was holding a cylindrical object in his hand and motioning me to use it I didnt understand what to do with it. But i refused. I then turned to the middle of the room and there was there a bed with some guys that looked like doctors, but they wernt doctors.  They had my lying on the bed naked. they were doing things to her and she was incoherent.  I then saw a being come from an opening in the black wall.  After he left through the same place I went over there and I could not find any door so I stepped through the same place.  only that when I looked down,to my left and to my right all I saw were stars in space.  I kept walking,and came through to a room. where it looked like the place that ran the ship. there were about four gray beings I think these were workers and a being dressed in black robe.  He realy frightend me to look at him.  I started to walk around when I noticed these writtings on a couple of places they looked like heiroglyphics of a kind that I have never seen.  Just then i saw my little friend come over to where I was standing he was holding my arm and we began a tour of the ship I told him then that I wasnt afraid of him and I felt at peace with him.  He took me to a room where there was three other beings around a circular table. Where there was a handle and a few other objects that looked like control knobs.  I asked him how does this craft fly?  he showed me and that it was cont! rolled b y electro Magnatism.  I didnt understand what that ment but o&#34;well I guess it was o.k.  Then we walked to three other rooms where there more of the beings.  And then we went to a room where there were three boys and two girls like me butg different. they showed no signs of feelings or talking.  I guess that these kids were about my age.  When another being came to me and said that they brought me there to teach the children how to play.  I said my toys are where we keep our garbage cans earloier in the day I had been playing with my army jeep and a tonka truck and horse trailer.  After a few minuets the being returned,with my toys.  And was angry and asked me if I,was a soldier.  I laughed and replied that I was only a child. then hew gave me my toys and i started to play with them on the floor of that room. Infront of the other children making noises like car motors reving up. then I gave these to othe other children and they smiled at me with pointed jagged teeth that scared me just to look at them.  Then it was my turn. we were in the black room again and it was my turn I was lying on the table naked. they the two doctors were grasping my stomach then the other one grabbed a long stem object and inserted it into my stomach.  I creid out it hurt so bad what they were doing to me. as i was screaming and crying one being came with another long stem object around to my head just abouve my neck and the back of my head he was inserting this object in to the back of my head.  It hurt so bad that I was yelling but like they dont understand what pain is. they just ignored my cries.  after such pain that i was experiencing i passed out.  I was weaking up when my small gray friend was there with me. we were in a room about 6x6 feet my Mom was there too sitting on a bench like I was I then asked my friend if I could go with them. He said that i could.  Then i asked my Mom if I could go and she said it was up to me and that I could go.  I then asked my friend how long it would be before we came back to my house. H! e said a bout 35 years.  And after that I said no. Iwant to go with my Mom.  I also asked him if I could have sompthing so I colud call him, when i wanted.  He gave me somepthing like a button.  And he said that the others would take it from me. if they found it on me when they let us go.  Well when I woke up I remberd everything that had happend to me and my Mom. I awoke underneath my bed in my room.  I then got up ran to my Moms room woke her up and she never to this day rememberd anything that had happend to us in our ordeal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

For this was my first time I have ever experienced such a thing! I will never, ever forget it till the day i die, and will always remind my cousins of it so they will never forget after I am gone. It was glowing bright orange, and moving in such a way no other aircraft could keep up, it was like, to travel from stop to stop or triangle to triangle , or tip to tip, it takes a hilocopter time to stop in mid air and this did too! and it would speed up far faster than any jet in this world!

Our hone faced south, and was on the north edge of town, with nothing but open fields to the east of us. I was in the family room, which was on the N.W. back side of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arose from the couch, and went to the patio doors, which looked out to the north. I opened the sliding door and looked up, and saw a hugh object, which seemed to be hundreds of feet across, east to west, and was over our house. I could not see the south end of it, as it was beyond my field of vision. It covered , what seemed to be a few hundred feet to the north of the house. I was startled, and was torn between going back inside, upstairs to get my binoculars, and/or camera, to try and get some record, or to try to see it better. It had structure and there were lights on the bottom. It seemed so large, and yet it was moving so little that it may have been motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was something that defied reason, nothing that large could be there, and be motionless, and make no noise. I watched it for , what seemed like minutes, and then made an attempt to go get something to make somekind of record with, a camera. I ran upstairs, searched for it, and the binoculars, scanning out the upstairs window, which faced north also, came back down, in a panic and saw it vanish. I searched the skies for over an hour, uping to get a glimpse of it again, but didn&#39;t. I was terribly dissappointed. I have never been able to forget this, I just had to tell someone. I&#39;m not sure of the year, but we lived in this house from the fall of 1972, till the summer of 1976.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I crossed the hall and looked out her window and saw three lights, triangular shape with one light at the top and two on the bottom, drifting slowly across the sky. I told her it was a jet, but she said &#34;no, they were doing something strange a moment ago&#34;.  A minute later, the lights stopped moving and then began to flash (white flash) one at a time with the brightness of a flashlight right in your face. The lights began to flash faster and then they suddenly moved at three different angles at an incredible rate for which I know of no craft that could do this. Then the lights suddenly moved straight up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

9/15/74 18:30|Detroit|MI|Disk|15-20 mins.|The“craft” slowed to a full stop and hovered just above a cemetery that was 3 streets north of ours|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56346.html|11|ndxe197409| This incident occurred over 30 years ago (1974?) so I will tell it to the best of my recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mid September early in the evening, just before the streetlights came on. 2 of my brothers, 2 friends and myself were hanging around out side in front of my parent&#39;s home. I noticed a distinct flickering light coming just east of our subdivision, in the sky. I lived right near the Detroit city airport and was used to seeing all kinds of different aircraft. Yet here was this strange flickering light coming out of the eastern sky, catching my attention!  Intrigued, the 5 of us decided to watch the path of this strange moving “craft” as it continued across the sky due west. I say “craft” now because at this point, about 5 minutes after we first noticed it one could plainly see what I can only describe as a flying saucer! There it was plane as day just moving across the sky for all to see, a classic type flying saucer. On the out side diameter were these different colored lights, red, yellow and blue. Just moving around clockwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here&#39;s where it gets really interesting, in our subdivision there was a side street that ran north and south, this is where we stood most of the time watching. The“craft” slowed to a full stop and hovered just above a cemetery that was 3 streets north of ours. It hovered  lower until it was about 60 feet above the ground. If you hold a silver dollar at arms length and held it up at about a 30 degree angle that&#39;s  the size it looked in the air. So it was abuot 40 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 5 of us thought it was just too cool! I was shaking like a leaf. We watched this thing as it hovered there,just “showing off” I thought, for about 4 minutes when suddenly it decides to hover on an angle exposing the bottom side of the “craft”.  It was the weirdest thing, the bottom was just solid black void! If the flickering lights were shut off and the “craft”  hovered above you ,you wouldn&#39;t even know it was there unless it made some kind of noise. I didn&#39;t here any distinct sound coming from it from where we stood watching. The “show-off” decided it was time to move on so the “craft” straightened  horizontally (like most flying saucers I guess). It began moving straight up in the air until it was about as high as a small Sezna plane would fly. It continued it&#39;s westerly path rather slowly, again like a small plane, then suddenly the “craft” just shot it&#39;s self like at warp speed westward and was gone out of sight. “Wow!!” I said to myself, “I always wanted to see a UFO!”  A few moments later there were 3 police choppers hovering above the cemetery were the “craft” was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never herd or read anything about the incident from the news, “Hush-Hush” I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else has seen this sighting, I shure would like to know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a dark non-shiny, metallic colored craft.It was hovering in the path used by small aircrafts to land and take off at the small airport about a mile away.Above and slightly to the East is the flight path of aircraft going between Ft. Vancouver and Ft. Lewis. As Kids we would stand in the yard and watch the planes streak by overhead and count the sonic booms. The lady that saw this was born in 1903 and is now deceased. She was not one to watch TV. She was not one to make up stories. She did however have insomnia. She related more details to me but since I have been ill I can&#39;t remember them. While I have mostly recovered my memories have not. She was tired for a day after that and not really willing to admit to what she had seen. It seems she said there were other lights on it like a big window.  She got the feeling that they were watching something and did not notice her watching them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/14/74 03:00|Piedmont|OK|Disk|30 seconds|Classic inverted bowl shape with a periscope that extended underneath for observation|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27644.html|15|ndxe197409| Classic inverted bowl shape with a periscope that extended underneath for observation<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 8 years old when this happened. I got up in the middle of the night (around 3 AM)to grab a snack. The east-facing window of our house had the curtains open. I looked out the window and saw an orange light. I at first thought this was an airplane, but the light grew in size. (after thinking about this over the years, I believe it was coming closer and gave the appearance of growth) After about 5 sec of growing it stopped growing and the light switched off and the saucer appeared about 150 feet from me at house top level. I believe this was a switching of light sources from the saucer&#39;s different travel modes from motion to hovering. It was a classic inverted saucer shape with a dome on top and it had a bluish glow around it. I believe this glow was the result of it&#39;s propulsion sytem causing ionization in the surrounding atmosphere. As it hovered, a periscope came out from underneath and it pointed at me or the house and I saw (I think) a yellowish eye in the viewfinder staring at me. Apparently it did not want to be seen because as soon as it saw me it vanished. After thinking about this later, I believe it could of just switched all it&#39;s light producing sources off or sped off faster than the eye could see. It&#39;s likely the thing just hovered around our rural neighborhood for a few hours at housetop level observing at will after I fled in terror back to my sisters bedroom and jumped in her bed.  I have read other accounts of saucers that looked like the one I saw and one account I read has the saucer using this device underneath it as a landing structure. It appears that this structure performs multiple functions for landing and periscope-like observations. It seems like a rather crude observation device as it seemed like a direct optical device like a telescope (I could see the being&#39;s eye through it)as opposed to a sophisticated electronic multi-spectral imaging system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

From 1973 to 1976 as an M.P. (Military Policeman) working undercover for the D.S.T. (Drug Suppression Team)  C.I.D. (Criminal Investigation Division) in Germany.  Basically, I traveled throughout Germany, wearing civilian clothes and pretending I was a former soldier that now resided in Germany dealing narcotics.  My codenames were Porkchops or Frisco, depending on what part of Germany I was at.  I went after what was known as the &#34;Khaki Mafia&#34; that originated in Vietnam.  The perpetrators recognized me, because I was known to wear a black trenchcoat, sunglasses, dark clothes and at the time I was sporting a beard and mustache.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, before this excitement took place, I was in Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, in 1974 on a training exercise.  One night, two other soldiers and I were in Columbia, South Carolina, checking out the sights and we looked in the sky and saw 6 glowing blue discs in formation.   As we watched the UFOs dispersed in erratically zig zagging movements and disappeared quickly.  The first thing that came out of one soldier’s mouth was ‘geese?’  We looked at him and said ‘no way!’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was my first time experiencing a UFO encounter and it stayed with me for a long, long time.<n>

We were looking at the sky and winding our evening down. Without a warning, no noise, no sightings. Intensly bright flashing white lights passed over us with incredable speed. We were both knocked backwards off our lawn chairs.  Ther were 5 flashes in total but to this day I&#39;m not to sure if it was the shock of seeing lights so amazingly bright or if it was as if we were the only things in the area that got caught up in its wake as it passed by us so fast. We did tell some friends but after the response we got we decided not to share this incident any longer with any one else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to start off in the distance with only one flash. We both started to ask if the other had seen it. Before we knew it or could even finnish asking the other if he had seen it ,the light was above us and flashing with such intense brightness. To this day I am amazed at what I saw and will never forget it<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
9/5/74 21:00|Saskatoon (Canada)|SK|Triangle|2 Minutes|Black triangle with a white light on each point, trails from back two points|4/22/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28338.html|19|ndxe197409| Black triangle with a white light on each point, trails from back two points<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above date is approximate, I cannot for the life of me remember the exact date but this incident happened during the first week of September give or take a day or two - it was a weeknight as we had school the next day. I was 15 years old at the time. Below are the details of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening in 1974, during the first week of September, myself and two friends were sitting up on the roof of my Mom and Dad&#39;s house (we would go up there for a cigarette every now and again - typical kids). It would have been about 8:30 to 9:00 PM at night - the sky was extremely clear that night. I had both my hands behind my head and was resting my head against the shingles on the roof (the roof is at angle of approx. 35 - 40 degrees). I saw a UFO - it was a perfect triangle with a white light on each point of the triangle. There were trails coming off the back two points of the triangle. The triangle was pitch black and blocked out the stars above it as it flew over top of me - it would have been about as high in the sky as a jetliner. I remember trying to convince myself at that time that maybe it was a meteor or a group of meteors of some sort (or even some sort of reflection) but I kept reminding myself that it actually blocked out the stars above me as it flew over top of me. It COULDN&#39;T have been a meteor or a reflection. It was definitely NOT a plane. I was a smart enough kid back then to know the difference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle flew in a southwesterly direction, from northeast to southwest very, very quickly - much faster than a jetliner but slow enough to see some details. Definitely slower than any meteorite I have ever seen. I can still picture it as clear as day when I think of the sighting some 30 years later. I jumped down off the roof and went flying into the house yelling to my Mom and Dad &#39;I just saw a UFO!&#39;. It was so significant to me at that time that I actually wrote down what I saw and even drew a picture of it in one of my notebooks. I remember my Mom and Dad and I calling the Saskatoon Airport that night but the airport indicated that they had received no other reports. This was something I had never seen before and have never seen since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having been interested in UFO&#39;s ever since that time, I recently obtained a copy of Timothy Good&#39;s book, Above Top Secret. Amazingly (which is why I am reporting this to you now, this many years later) - in Chapter 8 (Canada), I came across these two incidents in Good&#39;s book:  Page 200 &#34;...in July 1974 a Scandinavian airlines captain flying 35 to 40 miles southeast of Quebec City reported a triangular shaped object moving in a southwesterly direction...&#34;  Page 200 - 201 &#34;...on 10 October 1974, John Breen, a Canadian armed forces pilot, was paced by a UFO over Newfoundland, en route from Deer Lake to Gander. A passenger flying with him noticed a strange light following the plane when they were about 50 miles from Gander. Every time Breen looked at the light, it seemed to turn off but finally he got a better view of it. It seemed to be a sort of triangle - or delta shaped, luminescent greenish light following us...&#34;  Date-wise, my sighting falls in between the two above sightings. The triangle I saw was moving fast enough that it could very well have been in Quebec or in Newfoundland a few minutes beforehand (although the date of 10 October 1974 in Good&#39;s book is approx. 4 weeks after my sighting occurred). I drew a GIF animation of what I saw and will attach it to an e-mail using the address you&#39;ve given below.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was in a green cloud and pulsated like a heart beat.  My passenger and I both saw it.  There were 3 portholes in the upper portion of the craft.  It traveled along the path of my car and at a point of about 4 miles down the road, it rotated to the left side, and within an instant was gone.  Only a small portion of the cloud was all that was left.  I called a friend of mine to tell him of the siting, and he said he knew what I had seen because he saw it as well.  He was traveling south on a Highway as much as 10 miles away heading south.  The wildest thing I have ever seen...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Bremen is a town that is west south west of goshen, about 35-40 miles. I lived at the sothern edge in an old two story house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very young, 5th grade to be exact. I was in bed, my bed faced a large (door sized) window in the room. I dont know what made me sit up and look out the window (from the bed) I saw a very large object moving across the sky with a slight tilt to it nose up, it had a green light on the front, a white on the rear. (it was dark and I could only see in sillowette)Inbetween what I thought was two plates  was an area of red windows for lack of a better term. as it passed by my window its windows had a bright red light that had trailing lights,(they would progressivly get dimmer going around the ship (6 steps or so), the bright red light was moving around the disk shape.the whole event only lasted for a few seconds. I was so frightend by it that I tried to screem out to my mom and sister, but nothing came out. after a few minutes I went down to tell them. they thought I was dreaming or something, I know I wasn&#39;t  I have seen a lot of strange things, I never saw this again, or any aircraft like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was unlike a helocopter, moving to slow for an airplane that low, and it was big I would say it took up atleast two window widths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> years later (1980) myself and two friends where in the old church yard,( a place we played) I had saw some geese fly over, ( a fun trick to play on someone) the geese bellies reflect the town light faintly, so it looks like a UFO and they often fly in a V formation ...tee hee. well anyway we were out in the back of the church, very dark there. it wasn&#39;t long before we all three saw an aircraft moving at an unbelievable rate of speed, it passed over head in less than 6 seconds (missle fast). it left a very unusual con trail (billowing cotton that we could see at night) moving from east to west. it had no lights and made no sound, no boom (it was moving fast enough it should have), no engine noise, nothing. I assume it might have been a stelth test or something, it had that shape to it. triangular. for years (15) when ever we would run into each other (steve would alway mention that night). again never saw anything like it until the stelth fighter came out, but what we saw was bigger than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> heads up. eyes open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I remember the lights more than anything. The only thing you left out from my recollection was that you suddenly yelled that the craft had gone straight up almost instantly while it was still at a great distance, and when I looked up, it was much higher over the horizon. I&#39;ve always wondered to this day why I can&#39;t reconstruct an image in my mind of exactly what shape the object was, because it went almost directly over our heads at a low altitude. Oddly enough, I&#39;ve been thinking about this incident a lot lately, but I don&#39;t know why. The only shape I remember was triangular. I wish I could go back to that instant and see it again. I firmly believe that UFO&#39;s are a reality, although I wonder why so many reliable sightings describe so many different sizes and shapes of these craft. If you ever remember anything else about that night, let me know. It&#39;s always gnawed at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Love,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ----- Original Message -----<n> <n><n> <n><n> From: ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> To: ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> Cc: ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> Sent: Thursday, October 16, 2003 9:30 AM<n> <n><n> Subject: Emailing: ((deleted))<n> <n><n> Dear ((name deleted)),  I don&#39;t know why I feel so strongly about writing this down.  I guess I want to know more about what I don&#39;t know,  and I believe that desire is healthy.  The amount of time I spend thinking about the &#34;U.F.O. phenomena; however, well, it might be time spent better doing something else...but I digress.  I have read some references made to a U.F.O. &#34;flap&#34; which occurred in the southeastern United States circa 1974-1975 and in fact I remember reading in the Montgomery Advertiser at that time some articles mentioning some U.F.O. sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did we see that night...was it September of 1974...on our way to Auburn?   As I remember, we were going up there to a &#34;concert&#34;...a band that a friend of yours was in maybe?  What I remember is this...We were on I-85 heading to Auburn from Montgomery and it seemed as if it were around 8:00 P.M. when we left Mom and Dad&#39;s.  It seems as if we were about half way to Auburn when I first noticed a bright white &#34;star-like/planet Venus-like light appearing many miles ahead of us on the right side of the interstate.  I had been looking at it and initially thought it was Venus.  I remember asking you to look at it and I remember even joking about wouldn&#39;t it be cool if it were a UFO but I didn&#39;t believe it was anything other than a planet or a star when I first saw it.  That is until I / we noticed it moving...crossing over the interstate and coming toward us.  I remember seeing the object changing colors and intensity from bright white, to a dimmer white, to a medium intensity red and back to white again 2 or 3 times.  The colors seemed to alternate in time from 10 to 30 seconds.  I remember the object crossing back over the interstate to our side continuing straight toward us.  I remember one or both of us saying that the object wasn&#39;t any star or planet.  I remember the object seemed to cross back over to our left and us pulling off to the shoulder of the interstate.  I remember we got out of the car, was it Dad&#39;s old Galaxy 500?  It seemed as if we sort of just leaned against the car waiting for this thing approaching us.  I remember being very excited at seeing something neither of us had ever seen before but I don&#39;t remember being at all afraid.  I know I had no doubt that you wouldn&#39;t let anything happen to me...not without one hell of a fight anyway.  When it passed overhead it seemed to be over the middle of the interstate...maybe 500 feet up.  My recollection of what exactly this thing looked like seems hazy or maybe it&#39;s because I had never before or since seen anything that looked like &#34;it&#34; ! looked.  It seemed to me to be somewhat of an elongated &#34;sewing-thread spool&#34; with the flat ends oriented to the top and bottom of the &#34;craft&#34;.  I had the distinct impression there was an inside and an outside dimension to this &#34;thing&#34; because it looked as if there were a &#34;triangular-shaped &#39;window&#39; or translucent &#39;something&#39; giving me the distinct impression of looking into the &#34;craft&#34;.  I remember thinking the interior was illuminated by red light but that there was some white light or lights on the exterior of this &#34;thing&#34;.  It did not make a sound.  It seemed to be moving 30 to 40 m.p.h..  How big was it?  Maybe 10 times bigger than our car...I can&#39;t really get a good grasp of it&#39;s size.  I remember we watched it continue on it&#39;s way seemingly following the interstate.  I don&#39;t remember it disappearing.  I remember getting back in the car and continuing on our way and I remember wanting to turn around and try to catch back up to it.  It seems as if we did turn around at an exit but for some reason I&#39;m not sure if it was the first exit we passed or an exit further on.  I believe we did turn around and head back towards Montgomery.  I believe we drove most of the way back to Montgomery but when we didn&#39;t see &#34;it&#34; again, we turned back toward Auburn.  I don&#39;t remember anything more of that night clearly.  I seem to remember standing in your dorm and relating our experience of the evening to a friend of yours.  Nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, there, my recollection is put into writing.  I think it odd that I haven&#39;t written this down before now.  I absolutely don&#39;t care one wit of what anybody thinks of me recounting this event.  I  believe we saw a &#34;craft&#34; under intelligent control that night but I don&#39;t know that it was extraterrestrial.  I do know that it was something outside of any other experience I&#39;ve ever had.  I hope I have another experience like it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I love you ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m glad I was with you that night.  Love,<n>

I caught part of the program on the radio today on Coast to Coast.  So now I scambled onto my computer after work and searched for the program info.  But I actaully found Arts web page and the entire broadcast from this mornings show.  I am in Toronto Canada. Let me also include that I am an amature astronomer as well, so I can tell the difference from planets, stars, satalites, meteorites and so on. But this was a daytime sighting. Here is my sighting. It was a partly cloudy day, I believe it was August/September (chestnuts were ready to pick) 1974 I believe.  I was 13. My brother and I were out on a chestnut hunt looking for chestnuts.  We were on our way back from gathering chestnuts from a farm just outside the town of Elmira, Ontario, Canada.  It was about 4pm.  After we came out of the farm field we walked down a road (walking northeastwards)  I looked and saw this object above the trees directly ahead of us.  It was about 400 feet or so away from us, it was moving very slowly towards us and up but slightly moving to our right.  It was triangular shaped.  From my position it was about the size of a baseball diamond.  Silvery/ grey in colour, it was raised in the centre, it was very smooth looking.  It made no sound at all.    I don&#39;t recall seeing any kind of windows.   It slowly moved upwards and went through the clouds and that is were I lost sight of it.  I saw it for about 4 or 5 minutes. When we got home I told my mother what we I saw.  My mother put the radio on and there were other reports of this sighting on the radio. Thank you for your time.
