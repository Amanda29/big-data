Time was about 9 oclock . All of a sudden a bright green flash of light passed through the room. Entering from the front window of the house and exiting at the back of the room. The light was like a ball of green light passing through the room like a lazzer ..It was about the size of a football and left a trail which vanished quickly.. What was it??? We all saw it and were completely taken aback. Nothing else has happen since. I would like to know what we saw and if anyone else has had a similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We paused for a second and noticed 3 Lights, white, red and white flashing about every second. In a rotating pattern. It seemed to be in a circle but we coulden&#39;t see the outline of the craft. No sound at all. Moving about as fast as a small air plane. It moved In an irratic curved path across the sky.<n>

Soon the dogs all ran away.  We looked to see what was up, and saw a single blue white light, like a star.  After observing it for awhile, we realized it wasn&#39;t a star.  It sometimes had red, orange and green lights spinning around the top. A steady bright white light was at the base.  The light was dancing in the sky, making deep drops, and steep climbs, other times staying motionless.  When it appeared the light turned to the other side, we could see the outline shape of a saucer.  At times the object appeared to send rays of reddish light downward to earth.  The light at time seemed bright and focused in our direction, at other times dim and focused away. It was mostly in  the southwest sky, out toward Puntarenas and then south over Panama.  Once the light disappeared, the dogs all quieted down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the witness that the object was not a star, if in fact it was moving across the night sky as described.  However, if the witnesses were looking in the southwest sky at 1:00 a.m., then the star, Sirius, is a candidate for explaining what they were viewing.  We do not know what it was the witnesses may have been looking at.  PD))<n>

At first we thought it might of been a plane but, the object suddenly stopped motionless.  Then it reversed directions I ran to get the binoculars and saw what appeared to be multiple lights rotating.  After observing it for several more minutes we saw a small object separate and move away from the bigger object.  The object then faded in and out then just disappeared.<n>

It was dusk but getting dark quick.My daughter noticed it first. It was a big dark circle with a little dark circle behind it like a tail but not connected. It was flying thru the air at a good speed and steady. It flew right over us. It headed North east. I chased it in my car. I couldnt believe it. I tried to rationalize. It was not a big bird. It was not a mini jet. It was not a weather balloon. It was not an ultra light. There were no lights and absolutly no sound. As it got further away it changed into a fat triangle<n>

At first I thought it was a group of birds, but as I watched they mouved around much too fast to be birds and much to high. They were straight up in the sky and it was clear out. The sun was reflecting off of them some what as it was setting in the west. It was hard for me to judge how high up these objects were but a small aircraft passed under them as I watched which led me to believe they were very high up. One of the objects moved out of the cluster and moved towards the north. The rest of the objects started kind of lining up in a regimented order and started moving with the one that seperated from them. In a blink of an eye they were gone!<n>

Then a light in the sky caught our sight, a shooting star we both thought but to sudden and stopped for a second and travelled across the sky, ithought a bird but no wings i thought lots of things, but we both could not understnd it the zig zag movements and speed and the object glowed, like a cloud around it or mist, it was shaped like a cigar. I have been a fisherman  all my life and watched the sky all my life and i am 47 years old and i or my mate couldent work that one out and he is a engineer, think we saw a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/27/03 05:00|Nashua|NH|Oval|4 Minutes|What was the Airforce chasing?|3/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27922.html|8|ndxe200302| What was the Airforce chasing?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every moring,around five o&#39;clock, I take my two dogs for a walk before I go to work.  I am a believer, that we are being visited by something, not of this earth.  I watch the skies whenever I can for anything strange.  Usually I see a satellite or two, traveling a straight and steady path, at a constant speed, from one horizon to the other.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  On Thursday morning, February 27, 2003, I was amazed to see the following:  Two objects traveling one behind the other, a good distance apart, at a low altitude.(About the height a small, two-man airplane would fly.)  There was no sound that I could detect and the objects maintained a steady glow - no blinking lights.  Above the objects and around the objects, at a much higher altitude were approximately twelve other objects that I thought were Airforce jets.  They maneuvered like jets and had blinking lights that pulsated regularly.  The jets seemed to be circling the two other objects, but keeping a distance.  I watched this spectacle for about four minutes until they disappeared to the north.  I am curious to know if anyone else saw what I saw.  Before I saw this spectacle, the lights on the interior of my locked car were on when I was at the top of my stairway with my two dogs.  As I walked down the stairs, towards the car, the lights went out.  I believe that the two objects passing over my house may have been responsible for the lights malfunction.  Also, I live less than a mile from the Federal Aviation Administrations traffic control center in Nashua, NH.<n>

It traveled across the sky dropping first one flare like object and then another which split into two objects before it disappeared.  This all happened at 5am this morning and lasted for about 7 minutes.  My daughter was with me and witnessed the entire thing.  We also noticed no planes but it was rather cloudy.  The flare like objects that fell from the Fireball were the same color with sparkling Fire-cracker like tails.  They faded before falling completely to the ground.  About 10 minutes after the sighting a helicopter was circleing the vacinity were we saw the fireball craft.  And I remember helicopters after the other craft sightings.  I believe these might be pre-ordained drops. But what&#39;s being dropped and Who or What is dropping it I&#39;d sure like to know.<n>

( HBCC UFO Research) He asked what it was all about, in which I explained what it was I was up to. This man, a logging truck operator left the town of Houston driving up the Morice River Road heading approx: 100 kilometers out across the Reach to pick up a load of logs. He went on to say when he reached the 30 kilometers mark on the Morice River Road,  he witnessed  &#34;one&#34; bright white light high in the sky heading in his direction. As the light got closer to him, he watched the light split up into two parts, with both pieces flying in different directions. He said one part went west and the other east. What was so amazing was that the two lights shot back up into the sky and disappeared. The sighting lasted approx: 6 to 7 seconds at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was so surprised and excited at what he just saw, he got on the trucks radio and asked other drivers on the road if anyone had witnessed what he just did. Two other drivers who were in the same area reported back to him that they also witnessed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: I have the name of one of the other drivers and will be speaking to him tomorrow to take his report. I was told that a number of logging truck drivers on their early morning hauls have seen a number of strange things in the sky, so I am also looking into these as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

As he looked out at our view of the city, he noticed an aircraft hovering over the tops of the trees in the downtown area of Bremerton. The craft was triangular/chevron shaped and had 3 lights at each point of the ship. This craft was unusually low, too low to be an airplane, and it&#39;s movements did not fit with any existing technology known today. The ship was heading south-bound at a stop-and-go pace. It made no sound. This object was observed for at least five minutes before it descended verticly-upward into the clouds from a standstill/hovering position. This report coincides with a previous report sent in by us describing an incident that happened just the day before, Feb 25th 2003 over the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, in Bremerton, WA. We are curious to find out if there were any other people who had seen this craft, or reported any other strange happenings in the skies on either of those dates.<n>
2/26/03 21:30|Dunsborough (Western Australia)||Flash|1 hour|Several flashes from a stationary point source of light  in the night sky seen over a period of time.|3/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27996.html|13|ndxe200302| Several flashes from a stationary point source of light  in the night sky seen over a period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whilst on annual leave staying in a holiday chalet in a small town in the South West of Western Australia I went outside for a cigarette. As there was little light pollution and it was a perfectly clear sky I stayed outside for a while gazing at the stars when a flash caught my eye. This flash had the appearance of a torchlight being flicked on and then off as it was white and round and comparable in size and brightness to the largest star visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that it may have been the flash of a shooting star and so watched the same patch of sky (at approximately 60 degrees height from horizon with 90 degrees being overhead and looking in an Easterly direction) to see if there were any more. I saw the same flash again but in more detail and could make out that the light got brighter and then dimmed much the same as a lighthouse or revolving light seen from a stationary source with the duration of the light being approximately 1 second. There was no trail left as for a shooting star and no noise, nor any beam as from a searchlight, the light being in exactly the same portion of sky as first observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the same area and over the next 15 - 20 mins saw around 4 more identical &#34;flashes&#34;, unfortunately I didn&#39;t time the frequency but it did not appear to be regular. The light source appeared to be at high altitude similar to orbitting satellites I have seen before but stationary and not a constant light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Becoming bored standing outside I went back in to the chalet where several members of my family were watching television and when they asked me what I had been doing I replied that I was stargazing as it was such a beautiful night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 15 minutes later my wife asked if I wanted to go for a walk to the beach &#34;just to see what the stars looked light like at night&#34;. We walked around 80 metres and stood on the beach looking up at the stars when my wife asked me whether I had seen that. I said &#34;seen what&#34; and my wife replied &#34;that flashing light&#34; and pointed to the exact same area of sky. I still didn&#39;t mention I had seen anything earlier wishing not to biase my wifes thoughts and as we were looking we saw another two &#34;flashes&#34; over about two minutes. It was obvious that my wife was seeing the same thing as I was and that she had no explanation for a stationary flashing light source at that height with no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then mentioned that I had seen it earlier and had no idea what it was and we watched for around another 10 minutes seeing one more &#34;flash&#34; before my wife grew too cold and tired to continue watching. Once back at the chalet and now convinced I was seeing something out of the ordinary I stood outside for a further 30 minutes but gave up after only seeing one more &#34;flash&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both professionals in our mid thirties and whilst I am interested in the edge science and ufo / extra-terrestrial fields I believe I have rationally discounted all possible sources of this light known to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon viewing the same area of sky the next evening nothing unusual was seen.<n>

Not an airplane because it didn&#39;t move.  Not a star because it was twinkling white, green and red lights.  To the left was another star-like light that seemed to blink a few times then stop...blink again a few time then stop, etc.  After 5 mins. or so both lights grew dimmer and more distant until they were gone.<n>

Something expelled from the bottom of the light like a flare toward the earth and disappeared.  The object itself then began to flicker the orange light diappearing and reappearing until finally it was all togeather gone.  I&#39;ve sighted this twice now within the space of a week.<n>

I went outside onto my front lawn and when I looked up I saw a globe of light traveling at a moderate speed with no sound emiting from it and a helicopter with no lights(could see its sillouet) following it at the same speed approximatly 300 yards behind it. They were both heading south across the mountainside at approximatly 250 to 300 feet in elevation. I watched them both till they were out of eyes range.<n>

As he describes, this craft was a triangle/chevron shape. It had one light at each point of the ship, for a total of three lights, which did not blink, as most aircraft running lights do. The craft was at an altitude of approx. 800 to 1,000 feet, and it was moving slowly to the north. This craft made no sound, which my husband found to be quite odd, considering it was flying so low. Another observation he made was the fact that there is a strict no-fly zone in effect over the entire shipyard and naval base. Did anyone else see this?<n>

First we saw 1, then two, then 3, then 4, and then 5. They appeared to be like a running light in a straight line. This lasted for a very short time and was gone. Within another 20 seconds or so, it reappeared and did the same thing. Another couple that we met later were approximately 2 miles ahead of us and had seen the exact same thing.<n>

The whole yard was engulfed in shadow-it&#39;s 50 ft by 120 ft. The shy was completely black-I was right by a west facing window. There was no sound, my other half was in the living room-saw the shodow also-immediately went to the east facing window-we have a clear view of the mountains to the west-they&#39;re about 40-50 miles away-there was nothing to be seen in the sky-either to the west-south-north. There was absolutely no sound. We have heard planes-we are by the navy base and hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shadow moved from west to east and was incredibly fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with these two witnesses at length, and they sounded sincere to us.

The light didn&#39;t seem to stay in one place, (it kinda grew and then shrunk) and then it just disappeared. At first I thought perhaps I was seeing things, but my friend said that they had seen it too. I have never seen anything so beautiful that sends chills up my spine at the same time.<n>

Then it disapeared into the sky.<n>

I looked up to see what the noise was about.  I noticed an airliner going very slow, almost ready to stall, when I noticed a small silver line under the aircraft.  I told my wife, and kids to look at that in the sky.

They were both heading in a northerly direction at that point.  The hole event lasted about 10 seconds.<n>

I was looking at a star I think and it started moving up and down I thought it was a plane or helicopter then it stayed still for a few minutes then it started doing circular motions.  I watched it and yealled and my boyfriend to come and look and he said it was just because it was so cold outside the air was reflecting the light different and making the objects move.  I went in the house got ready for bed and was looking out the window to see if I could still see it and it had moved in a differant area but was still very active then I thought it moved again but it was a differant one doing the same thing it also would flash a redish color once in a while.  Then I thought maybe it was a satelite but I don&#39;t think they could do the circular motions almost playful like.  I watched them for about a hour with my boyfriend then I went to bed and another apeared in view and did the same thing except it would go really fast up in the air and then  drop back down and do circles to and s shapes.  I finally fell asleep.  They were far away enough that when they stood still you would think they were stars.  Its going to be clear tonight so I&#39;m going to see if they are still there or see if the stars are there?  I have never seen anything like it and I&#39;ve seen shooting star but not ones that go down and come back.  Also I&#39;ve seen satilites but they usually keep moving slowly across the sky.

It went from sea green to aqua to red.  Then stayed white.  Sometimes it would move across the sky fast them abruptly stop and other times it would just move slowly.  Please try to tell me what this was.  I have about 30 min of video.<n>

They were gliding silently in the shape of a V, the way birds do. The little lights then moved around to form a circle, still gliding across the sky, then back into a giant V. It must have been the area of a football field or two. Started at SW and headed NW. The lights began to dim out and it eventually just dissapered into the clear night sky. Never saw anything like it. EVER! It almost looked like it had a dark shadow around it, like perhaps it was just a giant ship with lights on it that moved around, or maybe it was just a bunch of them separate. The lights were literally dancing in the sky. There were two planes in the sky that were flying in the opposite direction, but were going very slow comparred to the unidentified flying object(s).<n>

The size of one circle - I would say little bigger than the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were really far up in the sky. At the same time I saw a normal commercial airliner and a jet ( I am not sure about the jet. It looked like a jet. It had a short tail. The kind of jets I have seen usually leave a very long trail. It looked more like a meteor to me, but that too was moving very slowly, so it can not be a meteor.. I guess) I am a skeptic and I do not believe in UFO&#39;s. But the more I think about what it was, the more peculiar it gets.<n>

This one appeared to have been spinning with colors that I could make out to be red, yellow, blue and white. I called my husband and he came and thought it was a star. We both went out side with a video camera and taped it. It appeared to be the only object in the sky at the time meaning no planes or helicopters with flashing light. It just hovered in sky for about 15 minutes. All of the dogs that live around here were barking. It was really cold so we went inside. I got on the internet to see if there had been others who had seen it. It had been about five minutes since we had come inside and my husband told me it was gone. we went back outside and it was gone but a similar object was now in the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.

Witnessed by 2 police officers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife thought she saw a strange star that had &#34;rotating lights&#34; and called me to the kitchen window that faces south west. I looked out in time to see this star go from a stationary position to moving at a very odd angle and increasing speed. From its distance and location in the sky, the speed appeared to be very great as it moved closer to our home, but still well off in the distance. It then stopped and hovered, then dropped what my wife thought was about 500 feet. It continued to hover and then move. The speed at which it moved was too fast for a helicopter. It eventually got close enough to our house that I thought I could hear it. I stepped outside and watched it for a while and it made no noise. The lights were red, blue, green, and white and the white light got very intense at times. It continued to hover and move and move up and down and side to side. It then stayed stationary for over ten minutes. I am a ((public employee)) and called a friend of mine who was on duty to witness this thing. He is very skeptical and he is also an experimental pilot and flight enthusiast. He admitted that the movements and lights were very odd. It is now twenty minutes since he left to try to get a better view in a different part of our city. It is still hovering and has not moved for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the witness to explore whether the object might have been a celestial body, perhaps the star, &#34;Sirius.&#34;  At the time indicated by the witness, Sirius, a bright, &#34;twinkling,&#34; star would be visible in the southwestern sky.  We have invited them to look tonight, or on the next clear night, in the same area of the sky at the same time.  Sirius, and any other celestial body, always appears to hop around the sky.

She at first thought it was an emergency medical helicopter because she said it was coming closer. When I looked at it I told her it was just a bright star because it was not moving. All of a sudden it moved to the left and stopped. It then started to move to the left or right, and at one point dropped straight down about 500 feet in a matter of a second. There were multiple lights on the object that increased in intensity. The object then moved closer to the house so I went outside and I could not hear an engine or anything. The object conitnued to move in strange directions and would go from hovering to moving very fast across the sky and stopping again. I called a friend over who was working the midnight shift that night. This friend is very skeptical about these things but he also is a flight enthusiast and an experimental aircraft pilot. He agreed that no plane could move light that and no helicopter was that fast. He left and drove several miles towards the object out into the country and later reported that it hovered for about an hour then drove off. The sky was clear and we saw no other objects like such in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

This report looks as if it goes hand in hand with the two reported sightings at Kitimat and the sighting between Terrace and Prince Rupert, British Columbia on the same evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple driving home from Prince Rupert to Terrace, B.C. and approx: 85  kilometers west out of Terrace when they witnessed a huge object travelling north across the Skeena River. (HBCC UFO Note: The Skeena River widens out a lot at this point and can be up to two miles or more across the valley as it heads to the ocean). The object itself was dark in color, or black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again what caught the attention of the motorists was the bright lights which were seen on the bottom of the object. Two large, almost rectangular lights could be seen glowing from the bottom of the object. Also they said it moved so very slowly which they found really strange. When I talked with the husband, he said he wanted to pull over to get a better look as he was driving, but his wife was frightened, crying and &#34;insisted&#34; that he keep going and quickly. No noise again was reported coming from the object, but the couple were in their car travelling around Highway #16. It was certainly a disk shaped craft. He also mentioned that there were other vehicles on the road at the time, (not many) and someone else must have seen it. The sighting lasted for approx: a minute and a half at the most from what he told me. I asked the husband roughly how high the object was off the ground as it travelled. He said it was high enough to clear all the mountains in the area. (HBCC UFO Note: On this route from Prince Rupert to Terrace you travel straight through the West Coast Mountain range which is very rugged. I am not sure as to the elevation where this event took place, but it would have to be around 2500 to 3000 feet. I will be checking this out as well. I plan to meet with all of the witnesses just as soon as the weather cooperates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, this gives everyone an idea of what just took place, three reports, one coming from Vancouver Island, Kitimat and in between Terrace &amp; Prince Rupert all on the same night. Plus there is not a lot of time difference between each of the sightings. When I meet with these folks I will see if they can draw a rough sketch of what they saw, and of course try to get a lot more detail on these sightings. From Houston, B.C. where I am it is another 3 hour drive to Terrace, B.C, then you head east for approx&#34; another half hour to get to Kitimat, B.C. So a long drive there and back again<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

The object was reported being very low off the Channel and rose up to clear the mountains to the north. One of the witnesses I have talked with said the both of them stood completely still with their mouths wide open watching this thing ! &#34;They said if there had of been any change in direction, meaning towards them. They don&#39;t think either of them would have been able to move&#34;. Large, very bright white lights were noticed shinning on the water, and this is what caught their attention to the craft. Since the object was so low, and casting a bright light onto the water, it lit up a good sized area which made a portion of the object visible to them. No other lights were reported being seen, other than what they saw hitting the water&#39;s surface. It made no sudden moments until it gradually gained altitude to climb up over the mountain. The men witnessed this event for approx: 2 minutes. I witness said they both knew for certain that what they were looking at was no normal aircraft that they new of, mainly due to it&#39;s size and speed. Plus they never have seen anything shaped like that before.

When looked at it closer, I realized it wasn&#39;t an airplane--it was far too big and low to be a plane. It was a lit up flying disk with symetrical light formations on the bottom of it; the lights seemed to blink upwards as bubbles do in a fish tank or something. The was a bit of farm land to my right as I driving, and the ocean was visible and not far from the highway i was on. The night was incredibly clear, I could see almost every star perfectly. I became so shocked while I was driving that I had to pull over to make sure my eyes weren&#39;t playing tricks on me. I noticed about 2 other cars pull over behind me and we all got out and just stared at this huge disk hovering over the bay. i was in complete shock and all the hair on my arm went straight up. The disk made an eerie whirring noise that was almost ghostly. The exact location was just after the McDonalds and Tim Hortons Drive through in Mill Bay (just after the malahat drive). I also noticed it was quite windy out. Once I pulled over I realized that it was indeed some sort of UFO. I am quite a skeptical person; therefore, I am still having problems rationalizing this in my head. Thus, I am writing down what happened here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Case referred to UFO*BC and Brian Vike of Houston, BC, UFO Group for investigation.  PD))<n>

As we got closer it was almost overhead, but still couldn&#39;t see anything. We reached our fenceline and relized it was about 20ft ahead and about 50ft up. We walked about 50+/-ft to both sides and could tell the noise was coming from the same locale. So we stood at the closest viewing location inside our fence. Our necks were getting sore from looking up, so my wife decided to go to the house to get a flashlight to shine at this invisible object. I tried SOS in morse code a few times, but nothing. My wife grabbed the flashlight and started flashing in a very erratic way. After about 30 seconds the noise changed to a loud jet engine noise and I saw an orange glowball (softball size), it zipped to the east about 100yrds and quickly returned to its original location all in about 3 seconds, almost making a tracer effect. My wife didn&#39;t see this, but had the sensation that something had quickly came to her face and then went back all in a few seconds. I am a local government employee and have never seriously thought ETs exist. Not untill this experience. Since this experience, my wife has had cronic acne, at 26 yrs old she had only one pimple at each esteres cycle her entire life, and she commonly sees greys in her dreams now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My story in detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the truth though scary.  I was in my room grading my students papers when all of sudden I noticed a bright light outside my apartment.  I stepped outside to see what all what the comotion was when I felt a warm sensation come over my body.  The next thing I can remember is being alone on a cold hard table with people in Docter like masks above me. I can swear they were at least 8 feet tall.  They were slimy.  I knew this because they touched me in places I&#39;d rather not share.  They stuck a needle in me but for some reason I felt no pain.  In the backround there were more people that appeared to be the female versions of the people.  The people talked in a foreign language that could not be understood.  It was a series of clicks and mumbled speech.  The room grew cold and I felt something being pulled out of me.  My apendix I believe.  Then I was knocked out once again.  I woke up right where this adventure had started.  I thought it to be a dream but then I felt the scar on my side. It looked as if someone had split me open with a machete. It was stitched closed as if a surgeon had performed the strange operation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have inquired whether the witness would be willing to have the scar examined, and perhaps photographed, by a physician, and whether she would like to meet with an investigator.

We left the casino at Grande Ronde, Oregon at 10:30 PM exactly. (We both noted the time, as we departed the parking lot.) We have no memory of how we arrived at the intersection of 99W and Hwy 22 twelve minutes later, a distance of maybe 25 miles. The time on our watches, as well as the car&#39;s clock are all the same. The only strange occurence we noted was the sound of what can best be described as hundreds of frogs croaking as we left the casino&#39;s parking lot. In the previous month, we have both been missing 32 minutes of time, on two separate days, as evidenced by each of our watches showing 32 minutes difference from standard time. With the time corrected on each watch, (On two separate days), both watches work perfect.

I looked up into the sky as it was a clear night and my vision was drawn instantly to a star in the sky.  I cannot say why I was drawn to it initially but as a looked I became aware of the sensation it was moving vertically up and down.  I thought it was because I was tired,  but then around 4 or 5 little lights appeared like fireflys buzzing around the bottom half of the object for around 20 seconds and then disappeared.  The &#39;star&#39; was unlike any other in the sky,  it did not have a constant light and the only way I can describe it was as if it was revolving.  There then appeared a horizontal light at the bottom of the &#39;star&#39; very vividly. This lasted about 10 - 15 seconds.  It did this on 2 occasions.  The firefly objects appeared around 4 times.   By this stage I could not believe what I was seeing and I fled to get the camcorder.  Unfortunately,  by the time I got ready the sky had clouded and there was nothing more to see.<n>

We were unsure so I ran into the house and grabbed the camcorder so we could zoom in on it.  It would go large with viberant colors (blue,red,white,and kind of a purple)then it would go into a small white dot. We do have this on tape and also another sighting that was on the show Extra, back in 1999.  There was an expert that check the tape out to find that, we did not make it up or do any creations from computer or the image inhancers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the large image was due to the fact that the &#34;AutoFocus&#34; function may have been left in the &#34;on&#34; position.

It is bright white, then changes orange - Yellow. It never has a sound and is around 100 feet in the air. It never takes off from land. You just watch in the sky at 10:00pm and it just appears out of no where! Then it is just in the sky not moving for 15-20 minutes and starts to go about 1 kilometer east, and then turns around and goes 1 Kilometer west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this night Febuary 20 2003 really took are attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 10:00pm. Me and my friend were at the beach. I told my friend about this light me and my father watch every night from 10 to 11. So we decided to go at the beach and wait for this light to appear. Around 10:15pm the light appeared once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed my friend so we watched it for 2 or 3 minutes then went home. I told my father the light was out again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we watched it from 10:15pm to 10:35pm. It did not move. Then around 10:36pm it started to move quickly toward east, then turned and went west the stoped. It then became very bright. And then out of no were a second same bright light appeared. Now there was two bright lights in the sky. Then we saw a plane going towards these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not moving at this time. The air jet passed bettwen these two bright lights and went toward Moncton. After a few minutes the two lights were moving around east to west.  Then out of no where, a third REALLY brighter light appeared. Now we were watching three really bright lights flying in the sky with no sound. We had never ever saw three  bright lights flying around the sky before like this night. We were really freaked out. We watched them till around 11:15pm. Then they just dissapeared in the air with no trace. We talked to other people in our area, and they recall seeing that bright light before, but never took much attention to it. But me and my father took alot of attention into it and are very puzzled, on what this could be. It can&#39;t be a plane. Planes just don&#39;t sit 100 feet in the air not moving for 15 minutes then start to move back and forward on top of the water for and hour, almost every nigh of the week. Especially not three of them!!!  Plus,  we would be able to hear the engines if it was a plane. It can&#39;t be a hellicopter because, what would a hellicopter be doing out on top of the water (Northumberland Strait) every night flying around back and foward for 1 hour with no hellicopter noise. And it is for SURE not a weather ballon!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the location of the alleged incidents is Canada, although the witness does not indicate that fact directly.

It looked like a giant fireball (25% to 50% the size of a full moon) burning green, such as a computer monitor LED green. It came in at a very low angle to the ground maybe 20 degrees, at the most, and traveled an arc of at least 45 degrees (I had mentioned 30 to 35 degrees in my phone call, but using the reference points of the windshield it was at least 45 degrees) in a second or two, with what appeared to be a long fire trail. The object then disappeared. It did not seem to burn out, but just extinguished. It appeared so close I rolled my window down to listen to the impact, but I never heard one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with both the husband and wife, and they sounded exceptionally credible and sincere to us.

I had a rendevouz to meet my girl friend after night school in the parking lot of a local bank.  As we were chatting in the car and making jokes. I was sitting in the drivers seat and she was lying her head on my lap, looking up towards me and also the window was in her frame of vision.  She suddenly ask me &#34; What&#39;s that!, I replied.  &#34;WHAAAT&#34;.  Then she started pointing directly overhead at the sky from my window and told me to look at something in the sky.  She said the stars are moving in the sky.  That&#39;s when I try to look at what she was refering to.  But from the way I was seating, I couldn&#39;t see anthing. So I got out of the car and started looking up to see if I can see anything stars moving.  She also got out of the car and came on my side of the car and started pointing at the sky about an angle of 87 degree directly over head.  That&#39;s when I notice Three star like object moving in the sky.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  So started staring at it for like 30 seconds the see what it was.  The three objects were just as bright as the other stars in the sky, if not fainter then some.  They were traveling in a triangular pattern.  One in the front and two in the back, but in a triangular shape pattern.  The were moving fairly slow, enough to see the sighting for about over a minute.  As the lights continue to move in the same direction.  The one on the left side, moved diagonal towards the first light, which was leading the way.  as it moved towards the first light, it came very close to it, nearly touching it and went back to it&#39;s original position on the left side.  Then about 20 seconds past and the objects were at about a 60 degree angle, thats when I started noticing two other fainter lights appearing along side the two brighter lights on the sides.  One fainter light appeared on the left near the original light that was on the left side and same thing happened on the other side on the right light. Now the objects were at about a 45 degree angle in the! sky hea ding due north, cause the highway which was near me runs east to west and the objects werent heading in that direction and I knew for sure that they werent heading south.  They must have been traveling somewhat due north-north east.  Suddenly after the other lights appeared, they were a total of 5-6 lights visible, but strangly what happened after was that the original three lights started to dim away as the other lights started to appear, as that was happening, I started to notice they all were fading away one by one and out of sight.  At that time I looked at the time in the car and it was 9:32PM.  My girl friend and I were amazed to see that, but she mention to me that when she first notice them right overhead they were more of them, maybe around eight lights were visible she mentioned.  I wanted to share this with everyone and let them come with they own conclusions.  As for me I witness these lights as they were traveling in the sky.  They didn&#39;t look like planes nor shooting stars and I&#39;m positive that they weren&#39;t some meteors in the night sky that was burning in the atmosphere.  Please let me know if there is any explaination for this.  I&#39;ll be happy to get any feeding and also answer in question that anyone may have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The three lights that dimmed may be U. S. Navy NOSS satellites.  PD))<n>

I was out walking in my neighborhood and I saw a bright star-like light in the east just blink out. It was white, no red or green blinking lights.  It was as if someone just turned it off. Then a couple of seconds after that, a white flash went across the sky from east to southwest.  It appeared as a streak of white light and moved incredibly fast.  There was no sound at all.  I could not tell how near or far, or how large the object was because it looked about the size of a normal star.<n>

I looked out my livingroom window (facing north) and saw nothing until I looked up. I saw 3 bright steady (not flashing) white lights very low in the sky close to my house. It was dark and overcast but I got the impression I was looking at an airplane with a light at the direct underside tip of each wing and one light in the center of the craft. There were no other lights, flashing or colored which are on all the aircraft I have seen previous to this incident. The aircraft then rose quickly (and almost vertically) into the dark cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am located close to DuPage Airport, O&#39;Hare Airport, Midway Airport, Meigs Field, Argonne National Lab, and Fermilab.

I found this site after putting &#34;three+white+lights&#34;+&#34;airplane&#34; into a Google search. I&#39;m not sure if what I saw was an UFO but whatever it was it wasn&#39;t the norm.<n>
2/20/03 02:40|Smithers (Canada)|BC|Circle|5 minutes|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  White/Orangy fast moving bright light comes to complete stop.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27793.html|66|ndxe200302| White/Orangy fast moving bright light comes to complete stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a witness call from Smithers, B.C. this morning. She mentioned to me that her husband thought she was seeing things, but it sounds like she was certainly witnessing something rather strange. The woman was up with her baby at 2:40 a.m. and has a great view of Hudson Bay Mountainand the ski runs, (which is located in Smithers). Actually the witness sits at the base of the mountain. Her blinds were semi open and allowed her to see a very bright light crossing the mountain, and then coming to a complete stop over one of the largest runs, which is called &#34;Cold Smoke&#34;. She went on to say the light was dead center of the run, and wondered if it was just hovering, or &#34;maybe&#39; it had landed. She also reported hearing a clicking sound from the direction of the object. (HBCC UFO Note: My son lived a while back in the very same area as the witness lives now, and I know many sounds bounce off the mountain which allows everyone to hear different noises much clearer). The object moved from east to west before coming to a complete stop over the run. Approx: 5 minutes went by and a train could be heard coming in the distance and the object disappeared. &#34;Her words, turned off&#34;. After the train had come and passed, and approx: one hour later , the object once again showed up. She knew the times for certain as she was up with their baby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second time the light showed up, she said I got  frightened and closed the blinds. I asked if she could describe the color of the light to me, she went on to say it was a extremely bright white, with an orangy light coming from the center. The light moved quicker than a helicopter, or any small plane that she knew of. (keep in mind that this light was spotted travelling some distance just below the peaks of the mountain and came to a sudden stop above the ski runs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the witness observed the light the second time, or after the train had long passed. She did not notice the light moving, but just showed up in exactly the same position it was observed before. The second sighting only lasted a couple of minutes. She reported her cat, which was also sitting on her bed, perked it&#39;s ears up looking in the direction of the window. I asked her an appro: size to the light. She said it may have been half of her thumb nail and round in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: After I received the telephone call I called the Smithers Ski Hill in Smithers to ask if any equipment was working on the runs around the time of the witnessed sighting. I was told work was being done on four runs throughout the early morning, and would be continuing throughout this week and over the weekend in the wee hours. This sighting may be the result of grooming equipment working on the ski hill, &#34;but&#34;, what puzzles me is that the object was spotted travelling an appro: 3 kilometers along the mountain before it came to a stop. I also just called the witness back to clear up one point about this sighting, and that was, did she see the object before it got close to the ski runs?? She said yes, I observed the light as it traveled over rough terrain, then got to the runs and stopped. So still puzzled at what was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Brian Vike, independent UFO investigator in northern British Columbia, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

A few seconds after the dog stopped barking a loud hum started to be heard. The whole time I was laying in bed listening to the hum there was no other sounds (cars, dogs, people). I kind of thought it could be a generator or something but there was absolutely no other sound. It seemed to be radiating from above my, or my neighbors house. once the hum stopped all the usual noises started back up (cars, dogs, people). I had a very odd feeling the whole time also. (like a electric feel)<n>

Then a second later saw another one then again, and again two more times then they disappeared. There were no clouds out that night and the moon was not out. I have never seen anything like it. Then at about 10:00pm I with my three children were sitting in the t.v. room. When all of a sudden my daughter started yelling staring out the window. I got up and looked out the window to see this time a big yellow light in the sky facing the window. It then started to back up and then disappeared. The tv is right next to the window and there is nothing covering the top of the window. I called my two other children to come. I turned the lights out to see if i could see them again. About 5 minutes later  in the back field I saw 2 more big yellow lights.They stayed there for about 1 minute then disappeared. They didn&#39;t move and they stayed in one place. Also around the  objects we saw ALOT of airplanes around it. Behind my house there is a big field and in the 11 years I lived here I have seen several UFO objects. But. never like this and they were so close to the house. I want to see it again. But, this time I want to get a picture of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I screamed for my husband to look, and pointed at the sky. We watched these three crafts, silently fly from south to north over our house and then head east. They were very low; I could see them against the orange glow from the city lights. There were no lights of any kind on the crafts.<n>

As I approached the Highway 54 exit, I spotted a bright light in the distance, above the left edge of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light hovered in place, appearing to be a few miles distant. I thought it was simply a TV helicopter, out filming beauty shots of the traffic for the 6 o&#39;clock news. My clock read 5:49 PM, a bit early for news footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then the light did something alarming. It began to drop quickly out of the sky. I blinked to make sure it wasn&#39;t moving towards me and I was just seeing it wrong. But in spite of my doubt, it was doing just what I saw - dropping like a rock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Damn, that pilot is screwed,&#34; I thought. I believed I was witnessing a helicopter crash, possibly one that was being transmitted live to the area&#39;s televisions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I blinked again. The helicopter couldn&#39;t have lost power, since it wasn&#39;t &#34;autorotating&#34; to the ground. If so, the light would surely be spinning around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light plummeted as I continued to drive. Then, just as suddenly as it appeared, it vanished, blinking out a few degrees above the horizon. I squinted in that direction but could not find any trace of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took me a while to decide that what I saw wasn&#39;t the usual helicopter sighting. No sane pilot would drop a helicopter that fast. And there was no trace of it afterward. Very weird. I actually spent the rest of the trip scanning the horizon for signs of smoke plumes, on the chance I really did see a helicopter crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking about it again later that night, I decided it could have been a flare. Why someone would shoot a flare into the evening sky is beyond me, as is how it could hover in one place as long as it did before dropping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -- I put the above description in my journal for that date, but didn&#39;t consider reporting this event until today, 26 June.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical experience.

It was about three in the morning, the sky was clear and the apartment was Three Stories, we were on the top floor. Anyway My couch was next to the window that I had opened. I just happened to look out at the sky and I saw a glowing sphere that was floating in the sky about maybe Six stories high above the trees that were behind the building. I jumped off the couch and leaned out the window and it was silent. It didn&#39;t make a sound and it was moving very slowly. All I can say is that It was a throbbing, glowing ball that was red and orange-ish. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. I was moving so slow  that I had time to jump into some pants and shoes and run outside but when I got outside it moved over the tree line heading  in a North East direction. Well anyways the next day when I was telling my story, some said that I was full of it and others say that I was a witness to a very rare event of  &#34;Ball Lighting&#34; there was one person that caught footage of it years ago.

This object was obviously much higher the the jet and moved across the sky in a matter of 3-5 seconds.  From the ground it appeared to be about three times the size of the airline.  It had a large green glow with a yellow center.<n>

I noticed an airliner approaching far to the west.  Then I saw what appeared to be two black fluttering objects moving towards the east. They sort of dipped and weaved across the sky.  I noticed what appeared to be a small orange light coming from the rear of the objects.  I thought that they were stealth fighter aircraft, however, there were no lights and no sound.  They soon disappeared in the east. An commericial airplane took off from Logan Internation above the rims about this time.  This was the second time in two weeks that I have seen a strange object(objects) at the same location, at the same time (1820), moving in the same direction.<n>

From the road, I could see the tops of the city&#39;s skyscrapers. From the distance, I assumed the &#34;craft&#34; to be an airplane landing at the local airport. Two things bothered me about the thing. One, it seemed larger than most aircraft I have ever seen land there. Two, it glided in towards the city and did not seem to be any color of any airplane I have ever seen, either. Also, it glowed with a strange orange lumininous crackle, and when I looked at it for very long, it hurt my eyes to do so. Black dots seemed to float around this thing, but I thought it might have been a trick of my eye. The thing seeming larger might have made its location closer rather than further. Again, it was very unusual. I am sure that it was not the sun, or a falling star. I am convinced that it was a vehicle meant for airflight, but not of any human construction that I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed an airliner landing, with the rising sun reflecting off of its surface.

As I approached the beginning of the hill which peaks at a traffic light just ahead of 109th ave NE, I saw a<n> <n><n> GIGANTIC jet black triangle, with lights, come very slowly twords me (it was heading west) over the trees just to the north of Jaunita High School.  Traffic was non-existent and it was about 11 PM on a Sunday night.  Upon seeing this thing, I pulled my truck over to the side of the road approximately 1/4 mile west of the entrance to the high school.  It appeared to be no higher than perhaps 75 to 100 feet, and it was IMMENSE.<n> <n><n> I watched it slowly move from the tree tops I mentioned, twords me for what I&#39;m guessing was a good 30 seconds.  The distance it would have covered in that time was less than 1000 feet.  I rolled down my right passenger window.  There was no sound at all.  Then, it STOPPED and just &#34;hung&#34; there.  There was a slightly yellowish white &#34;spot-light&#34; at the very tip, and this was moving around, up and down and side to side.  Then ALL the lights on the crafted shut off for perhaps 4 seconds.  When<n> <n><n> the lights came back on, it was moving again and it moved past me, then behind me, and out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife about it.  I don&#39;t think she really believed me.    I brought it up again with her several times over the next week.  I went to my computer 4 days after seeing it, and did the attached rendering in<n> <n><n> photoshop to show her exactly what I saw as best I could remember.  My wife did a search on the internet several days later and said that someone else from here had also seen it and described exactly what I had described.  I wasn&#39;t around when she did this, so I have not read the account, she didn&#39;t bookmark it (she said it was on a message board) and I have been searching for it online.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not used my real name or address on this email account, I really don&#39;t want to be ridiculed about this or have any publicity.

He just layed down when the dogs start to act funny. It was just then he heard a cross between a humming and a buzzing sound in his ears. He looked out the window and looked up to the sky to see a diamond shaped object go across over the top of our home. It was very high up and going faster than an airplane. He noticed that it had neon lights all around it and it was dimond shaped. Our male dog went right to his side and our female was pacing in her little kennel.  After it went over the house it shot down to the south end of Camano Island.<n>

We find this report of interest, principally because the event appears to have occurred as the dramatic event reported from California and Oregon, but the flightpath of the object appears to be incompatible with the object seen in other states to the south.  The witnesses in Arco, ID, were adamant that the object they had witnessed was traveling across the sky almost perfectly vertically down.  This fact strongly suggests to us that it could not have been the same object seen elsewhere.  PD))<n>

All of a sudden, we both happened to glance up at the window behind the TV and we saw this glowing, circular object shoot down from the sky at about a 45 degree angle. We thought it might have been a shooting star but we don&#39;t believe there were supposed to be any meteor showers. Also, shooting stars are usually not as big as the object we saw and they usually die out after a few minutes (like a streak across the sky). This object was different. It was big, bright, and round, and as it shot down from above, it didn&#39;t fade in the least. It also looked like it was going to land, but we couldn&#39;t confirm that it had.<n>

It faces a field and trees beyond, down to the Tantramar Marsh.  I saw a single, white light, like a headlight from a plane above the trees.  It brightened and then dove straight down behind the trees, like a flare, but faster.  It had no tail.  There is nothing beyond the trees except a Ducks Unlimited pond.  I checked the clock immediately, turned out the living room lights and watched to see if I could see it again.  The night was clear and cold and the full moon was at the other side of the house.  A few days later, my daughter told me she heard the radio announcer say that night he saw something, and the Moncton paper apparently reported that lights had been seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for me, I&#39;m ((age deleted)), a married mother of ((more than one child)), living in a new house.

I observed a blue green fireball moving roughly from the NW toward the SE and possibly desending.  It was quite bright and had a firey tail.  It dimmed momentarily and then was bright again.  I lost sight of it behind a hill.  The reason I thought it may be desending is I never saw it reappear from behind the hill. After the sighting I took a better look at the sky.  The sky had a thin layer of clouds with some stars showing. In my opinion the object was below the cloud layer.  My two daughters were in the car with me.  They saw a bright flash which got their attention but did not have a clear view of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking toward the south.

It is a road that we travel frequently, if not daily, morning and night. We were traveling approximately 20-25 mph in a Toyota Rav4. While looking ahead (East) down the road and into the sky visible through the trees along the roadway, I saw a large ball of light appear in the upper left of my field of vision.  The ball was larger than I have ever seen in the sky.  I would estimate it to be approximately 1/2 - 2/3 the size of the full moon. My husband and I had just 5 minutes earlier been admiring the full moon and the moisture ring around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the ball with a tail travel from the left of my field of vision to the right it appeared to fall or descend to the right lower corner of the field (approx. a 60 degree angle).

In a very surprising instant we both observed what appeared to be an astrological event in the eastern sky. A large, bright object that seemed to to me to be a fireball was descending rapidly from left to right starting at about &#34;12 o&#39;clock&#34; and disappearing at about &#34;5 o&#39;clock&#34; in our field of vision. The object basically followed a very slightly curved path approximately 30-40 degrees from a perpendicular line drawn from the horizon directly in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object appeared 1/2-2/3 the size of the full moon overhead. It changed color while in view, from bright white to firey yellow to a brilliant iridescent blue/green. My first thought was that it was a large shooting star or meteor, but then I was shocked to see it change it&#39;s size (it become larger) and color. About half way through its descent it begin projecting a tapering trail as its color changed to bright yellow, almost as if there had been an explosion and acceleration in speed. The trail remained yellow as the object then took on a beautiful greenish-blue color just before it disappeared from view. It was not clear whether the object disappeared over the horizon or simply self-extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the entire elapsed time of viewing was less than five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Other reports from multiple points in the western U.

There were 3 perfectly shaped triangles flying in formation, in an irregular way (not like normal aircraft). They were flying low, below the upper level clouds. In fact, that was the only way to see them in that they blotted out the stars and the clouds above then. There were no lights at all. There was no sound at all. I have seen stealth aircraft several times (even at night) and they do not look perfectly triangular. These were, equal sides with no &#34;Flaps&#34; or appendages. They flew quickly accross the sky, zig-zagging and speeding up/slowing down in an unusual way. Then they sped off at a great rate of speed and were gone from sight. This was right over the intersection of I-4 and International Drive, in the toutist district. We thought that it was pretty bold of &#34;whosever&#34; they were to fly over the city. But, in truth, unless you were looking right at them you would not see them. Later, it appeared to us that some jets flew accross the sky in the same direction, perhaps in pursuit? We have shared this story with many people, but never knew there was a place like this to report it. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I wanted to look up at the stars so i just stared off and when I rellized there was a weird flashing light up in the sky. So I had thought that well it was problably a plane but it wasn&#39;t moving! I had gotten a little freaked out but i just kept looking up! I stared closer, closer and then a new set of lights appered through the clouds. then another after another came down through the clouds. Each one had eight diffrent sets of flashing lights. Then my dog started to bark and the lights had all light up as if they heard her. The lights got brighter and brighter and I heard a loud shreeking noise and yet dipite the pain I keept looking up. My dog got scared and ran with her tail tuked. Then out of no where a beam of light flashed on my face and then my body and I fell as if someone oushed me! Then with a flash of light they dissiperd. all except for one wich lingerd there for a moment flashing its lights as if it was trying to communicate with me. when it was doing this i didn&#39;t feel scared but rather safe in an un-homely way.

It appeared to be only hundreds of feet above the ground, and my first impression was that it looked like someone hangliding but what was hanging beneath appeared too big to be a person.  As i am approaching I am looking up and traffic is building and slowing in front of me, not sure if they are looking or something else causing slowdown because rte. 22 has many businesses on both sides.  Any way it passed practically directly over me appeared to float on the wind and was a dull orange 2-tone.  I pulled in to a business parking lot to continue watching.  Yhe top shaped like kite or hanglider estimated 15 feet across or more and 10 feet or more from front to rear hanging from it but connected was a cylindrical shaped part that i estimate was at least 30 feet long and the last 7feet or so was curled up in the rear like a seahorse&#39;s tail.  In spite of the unusual nature and size of this object it was just about to snow storm and the sky was grey and it looked like it could very windy up there. Asa I watched I thought maybe windborn debris of some sort but the size made me question further.  As I watched the object continue on it&#39;s southwestrly course it seemed to be slowly gaining altitude and the I saw a smaller object which appeared the same color and texture about two thirds the size of the top part of the first object and roughly the same shape as the top of the first object, it appeared behind the first object closed distance on it but also appeared aloft on the air. I became excited that maybe it would join the first but it was above then directly behind then passed on the side and continued on the direct southwest course but interestingly at that precise moment the first object gegan floating on a more northwest pattern and when it dissappeared from view it again appeared to be over rte.22 and the second object dissapp! eared fr omview first on it&#39;s direct southwest course well south of rte.22  The whole event only lasted 7 minutes.  I am a clinical social worker and have been fascinated by ufo literature and t.v. shows for years I used to belong to mufon and recently found out about your sight.  I have never seen what I thought was a ufo and have a strong feelig that what I saw this time has a earthly mundane explanation but I can&#39;t come up with one.  I hate to ask but a WEATHERBALLOON PERHAPS?  I&#39;m also curious if anyone else saw it.<n>

It seemed that three remainined mostly on, forming the three points of a triangle, and several more lights within the triangle pattern blinked on and off in a strobe like fashion. The lights within the triangular area flashed sporatically and no apparent pattern could be established. It was a moonlit night and although many commercial aircraft had passed over us earlier in the evening, none were noticed at this time. The object(s), to my best estimate was 10-20 miles away and travelling in a northeasterly direction. It seemed that the further it went, the fewer lights were visible. The flashing lights were fairly intense and if they were from a &#34;normal&#34; aircraft, I would expect the aircraft to be much closer to us. There was no noise from the craft. I called the local state police barracks the following morning, but there had been no reports. The officer said that a helicopter had come in to an accident scene, but he didn&#39;t give me specifics as to when or where. I feel confident that this was not any sort of conventional aircraft, a formation of military aircraft, nor any celestial objects. Both my friend and myself are believers in extraterrestrial life, and are also well eductated professionals. This is the first time that we&#39;ve witnessed anything like this.

The tower was closed so we were communicating with flight servisis on the tower frequency 118.9.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were cleared for a landing to full stop on runway 9left. on final approach we noticed a number of lights approching the airport heading 270. they were spread out across the width of the airport and seemed to be manuvering strangely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at least two of lights were slowly circling  others verticaly. all of the lights were moving in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We informed flight services of incoming traffic in the opposite direction after a few seconds they cam back a told us that earlier in the day there had been a helicopter fly by at a funeral. I didn&#39;t think so because of the manuevers and the fact that it was at night. But they advised me not to be conserned that they would probably use the helecopter approach before getting to the airport. We continued on and landed keeping an eye on the opposite approching traffic. All so obsered that the color of the lights were not standard in that some of them were blue and orange as well as yellow white and red. After landing we pulled off the runway and stopped to watch the lights. they seemed to be all separated none of them were attached to another. about a quarter of a mile out they all turned north heading 360 degrees and few off that way. we watch untill they were out of sight. Spoke again with miami radio on 118.9 they told us they had no contact with the lights either on radar or by radio. They appeared to be at 1000 feet or patter altitude and we saw them fly into miami class B airspace. no mention of the incident appeared in any paper or other media. There were two green, two white, two red, two blue, and one orage lights. They turned north with out any visable bank or change in formation they just all made a right turn and marched off. Niether I nor the other pilot in the plane have ever seen anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Anyway, I was sitting in my back yard smoking a cigarette about 9 pm sometime during the early part of the year (I think it was in February) when I suddenly noticed a bright glowing object off to my right perhaps 1000-1500 ft. away and perhaps 50 degree angle from my position on the ground.  The object really caught my attention because it made several rapid &#34;jerking&#34; maneuvers and then went through a rainbow of colors in a few seconds and then started flashing a white light.  I quickly ran to the back door to call my roommate.  He came out and observed the original object which had now begun to move to the northwest at a rather slow &#34;helicopter-like&#34; speed.  By this time, two additional objects (flashing the same white light) appeared and were moving into formation with the first object.  What was striking about their movement was its &#34;unnaturalness&#34; if you will.  They both moved very quickly and literally stopped in an exact triangular formation with the first object.  Then all three began flashing the same white light in unison.  Suddenly, we noticed two additional objects literally appear out of no where and move into formation with the first three in the same odd manner.  We watched the 5 objects move out of sight to the northwest.  The entire sighting lasted perhaps 5 minutes.  It should be noted that traditional aircraft were clearly visible at the time of the sighting as we live in the flight path of Bush International Airport and a local airport.  We have never seen a UFO but we are confident we have now!<n>

At about 8pm I was approximately 15 miles north of Buffalo, TX. Ahead, at what I would guess to be 2-3 miles south of me, I saw a bright green light appear out of nowhere, at what appeared to be a few hundred feet above the treeline. Immediately it dropped down at a moderate pace behind the trees. Slow enough that I saw it drop for 2-3 seconds before disappearing. Size is difficult to estimate, but it appeared to be about 3x the size of the headlights of the northbound vehicles directly across the median from me. What was most unusual is that the green color was lime green and very florescent. Additionally, when I got to the area where I could see where I believed the light to have disappeared, there was only open field, no houses or roads or signs of people in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were camping at a hot spring just on the outskirt of Safford, AZ. I think it was on BLM land, slightly north of town. In the evening, the sun had just set, as I recall, we were starting to drink our first beers and talk too much. One person said, “Look at that!” We all looked to the west, which was toward Phoenix. In that area, there is a military base on the east side of the Superstition Mountains, which are to the northeast of Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The alleged UFO hovered, maybe five-hundred feet above the valley floor. The thing was a bright, luminous, pulsating blob of gold, orange and white light that could have been ten times as big as a normal sized jet, but it didn’t move. It seemed to shimmer and glow, but it didn’t look entirely physical. All four of us looked at it for a while and then got distracted with inane jabbering. Then came four sonic booms right above our heads.  Two were almost simultaneous, then the other two came at about ½ second intervals.  The four F18s (or F16s ?) were low and out of sight in a blink. There was no UFO to be seen. I wish I had the presence of mind to watch the UFO for the whole time. I might have seen it blink out as the jets went overhead. On the other hand, the sonic booms would have caused me to blink and I would have missed the disappearance of the UFO anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I had an exact date and time, but I don’t.<n>

I saw a sinlge object with one light in the distance travleing unuaually  slow from the west.It was traveling very smoothly, as if gliding through the air. I then saw an airplane traveling at normal speeds comming from the east. They were very close in paths and it looked like they could possibly collide. I could see the airplane ascend as if to get more air space. The UFO went straight, it did not ascend or descend. The plane went over the object. The object then stopped and hovered for about 5 to 7 seconds. It then seemed to trail the plane but could not keep up. The plane was no longer in my sight. The UFO then flew off to the west(in the direction it had originally came from)in a faster speed than it was going before. While it flew off turbulently,as if was unsteady. When it flew off, I saw a single red blinking light in addition to the bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Sometimes I think maybe it must have been something else, but then I know what I saw wasn&#39;t normal.  I&#39;ve told very few people about this.  But, tonight as I was flipping channels, the SciFi Channel was airing a show &#34;Proof Positive&#34; and a familiy was mentioning a UFO sighting in Fort Stockton.  So, I feel I should report it somewhere.  Maybe I&#39;m one of many people to have seen something around Fort Stockton.  Oh, I was on Interstate 10.  Well, I guess this isn&#39;t much, but that&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Maybe I just imagined it. Anyways I just want to know if anyone else saw this. I was out back on a cigarette break at work and talking to two colleagues. While chatting I happened to look up and saw what seemed to be the front side of a blimp that seemed to fade out about a third of the length back. It was a pale yellow color and was immobile. I looked down at my colleagues to see if they saw it too but they werent looking. I told them to look and when I looked back it was gone. The time and date are both approximate. I only found this site tonight and thought that maybe someone else had seen it. It seemed to be just north of Elmwood and Amherst (the street) maybe a few thousand feet up. Whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I mentioned it to my husband and continued to watch it for for about 30 seconds when suddenly it accelerated and took off in a westernly direction at an extremely high speed; I followed it for about another 30 seconds before it dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was extremely high in the sky, alot higher than airplanes that I have seen and it also went from just being stationary to moving quite fast. There were regular commercial airplanes in the sky at the time coming into ft. lauderdale airport and not many clouds in the sky at the time. I do not know if it qualifies as an ufo but it did not seem like any other plane I have ever witnessed.<n>

It was moving slowly(extremely)and being in the passing lane,I crossed over to pull off on the burm to watch it. It was just there moving ever so slightly and it just dissapeared. It was very large,silver and although The  LORD has blessed me to see many UFO&#39;s I&#39;ve never seen any that looked like this. Several days later, my daughter and I were at a food drive-thru in putnam,co and we were waiting for our order when she said,mom is that a star? I said,no, that&#39;s a ufo.It wasn&#39;t until many days later when I was telling a friend about the experience we realized the ufo we were looking at during the drive-thru, were two different ufo&#39;s because the one I saw was red and the one she saw was white(these looked like little circles and did not last long-maybe a minute).

It was a clear morning and when I sat down to take a load off my feet I looked up to stretch my neck. I stayed like that for a bit until I realized that I was seeing something really strange. I would say that at over 60,000 feet or higher there were three spheres separating and then criss-crossing each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called to my wife and Mom to see if they could see the same thing, and they did. I wasn&#39;t imagining it, it was so spectacular that I phoned the university of British Columbia and reported it but I never heard back from them so you are the second person that knows about it now. Thanks for listening to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Information:  I telephoned the witness back as I wanted to gather more information on the sighting these folks had back in July of 2003. What I was told was certainly interesting. In the original report which is above, the date was left out at the time the sighting report was filed, mainly because the witness was not sure when the event took place. The fellow did ask his mother as she kept a diary of some of the interesting things which take place in her life and the sighting they all had was one of these important dates to write down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video footage was taken of the objects. He said that there were three spheres, silver, red and green all traveling together. As the colored spheres passed by the silver object it was reflected, or the silver colored sphere changed color briefly to the color of the passing sphere. The witness said it was like a mirror image to whatever was happening around it. He said after a while the objects separated, heading off in different directions. One headed in a north-easterly direction, the other towards the west and the final sphere heading south-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then talked with the gentleman&#39;s wife who gave me a good description of what she saw. The lady said she was taking her mother out when her husband called to her to come and look at the strange objects he was observing. Her first thoughts when she noticed them, was of a jet aircraft, but after watching them, she soon decided it couldn&#39;t be aircraft she was seeing. The woman said they watched the spheres for approximately 30 minutes before they finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said the first sphere was silver. It looked like a shiny surface with the sun reflecting off it. Also it was noted that the silver sphere was the largest of the three. The second sphere had a reddish hue to it and the third was greenish in colour. They were unable to look at the objects for any length of time due to the brightness of the day. The lady told me she could clearly see the red sphere move towards the silver one and went behind it and disappeared. The green one also did the same thing. Eventually both of the colored spheres came out from behind the larger silver sphere and moved around the sky. The silver sphere did at times sit stationary in the sky and the colored object did the moving around. This witness said the colored spheres would at times travel down on an angle both apart from one another and that move back up towards the silver sphere. The colored spheres traveled back and forth many times to the silver object and from different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What puzzled the witness, was when the objects moved off in different directions as they left their sight. They figured the wind would have carried them all in the same direction. When the objects finally were leaving the area they did so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

It started to dim as it flew away from me. It seemed to be disappearing, shrinking and dimming. This was not because it was too far away to see, since it seemed to be standing still above a neighboring house 4 houses up the hill. I watched it for about 5 minutes and then it just faded away.

I was alone in the darkness when I suddenly saw a huge craft which seemed to be a diamond. It was over my car and it was making a lot of noise. I didn&#39;t know what to do. After 30 seconds another craft, much bigger, appeared and made some strange signals to the other craft, maybe alerting it that there was somebody in the road: me. I closed my eyes and when I opened them again I was again alone, without any crafts over my car. But I realized that I wasn&#39;t in the same place.

This time it appeared on 2/14/04 at 8:48 at night when I looked outside my window it appeared very high and flickering like it was going to disappear. I could not tell if it was throwing anything down this time but it appeared to disappear for 2 seconds and come back very bright. and then it disappeared all togther and did not appear again. I did not tape it because it was right outside my room looking out my window and I thought it was about to disappear. Then at about 9:27 at night same day 2/14/03 I saw it again, but this sighting was not like the rest of the sightings I saw it very far away, I saw it up stairs in my room again. It was very far away from my area and it appeared to be coming down slowly. It came down slowly then hovered very low to the ground then it came low enough to where my vision was blocked by trees and buildings. This I would have to say was my strangest sighting of it, I was having doubts on my self whether it was the same orange object i see or something else, because it was so far away i could not tell. But from where i was it appeared to vbe the same orange object very bright, and it appeared to land very far away from me. I am sure that since it was that low that others had to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received a number of reports of these lights seen in the vicinity of Burbank, and surrounding areas.  We understand that the Burbank Police Department believes that the multiple appearances of these lights are the result of young people releasing hot-air balloons, powered by some type of pyrotechnic device.

The night is so clear, and the moon lights up the whole snow covered scene.  While looking at the stars, I see a Bright Light hovering in the sky.  I don&#39;t think much about it, until I come back to it a moment later.  It is now in a different part of the sky... It&#39;s still hovering.  I decide to lighn it up with a steady object.  I pick a telephone pole, and stand so that the light is centered and just above the top of the pole from where I&#39;m standing.  Now I can clearly see that the light is hovering, and moving, or rather swaing, from point to point. It is there as I left to go back inside.

Then i said see i told you there were ufos in the winter cause we were argueing earleier that we see a lot more in the summer then in the winter.Thene the bright light on it went out and it went away very fast towards Hebron all you could see whene it left was a small red light like it was trying to look like a plain but no plains have bright lights like that bright white light that it had.so my uncle went inside as fast as he could cause it was about 15.below zero out there.Then ten minutes later i was looking out the window and there it was taking the same f! light pa th like it was doing big circles over Hebron like looking for somthing maybe in the woods cause Hebron mostley woods anyway it made the same flight path four more times ass long ass i looked out  i could probley have seen it all night if i wanted but it did not impress me our my uncle anough to stay out in the cold to look at it.Not like alot of the ones we saw in the summer that were pretty close so many sightings last summer that i could not put in a report every time i just know thers alot of activity in the summer in and around South paris Maine.Thankes for listienig<n>

From the east and also the direction of Ft Jackson I observed 3 groupings of lights in perfect formation, flying very slow at an altitude of approx 1500 ft with only the faintest stir of jet engines.All 3 had several bright landing type lights on and were super quiet for the slow speed and altitude. Just before approaching my location all three begain a perfect 90 degree right turn. As they rolled I noticed the plane closest to me banking and its wings had the normal light formation of green-right red-left as did the plane on the far side but the craft in the middle was different. It had green lights in the front and the back with what looked like a line of white lights from nose to tail similar to an airliner with cabin lights on. I could not make out any shape but also could not percieve any roll or change of the lights as would have occured in banking and leveling from a greater than standard rate 90 degree turn.  Also, I work at an airport so I know approach speeds and all three of these were traveling amazingly slow and quiet and also away from Metro. You will probably note that this was the same time as the code orange situation.<n>

We are familiar with these roads and drive along there occasionally just to enjoy the ride.  While riding down a straight part of this section of dirt roads we observed an orange glow behind us following at a distance and the car headlights were dimming by themselves.  I was driving and it felt like the car was held to the grounds by a magnet and didn&#39;t want to move.  We thought we imagined it so we drove back up the road and affirmed that there is no light source that could be seen from behind on that road.  We turned back around and after a few seconds the orange glow could again be seen following us.  In the meantime, there appeared a circle from the ground which encircled our view of the moon.  There were thick whispy clouds blowing in quickly, in a matter of seconds.  We went around a curve in the road and up to a clearing.  For some reason I backed the car up and my friend said, &#34;Oh my God, look at this!  You are missing it! I jumped out of the car and flying 50 yards away from us and desceding to the height of the treetops was a bell shaped object completely covered in round white lights, separate but close together.  The light was a pure white with the effect of silver mixed in. The object floated slowing just beneath the treetop and then started ascending back toward the way it came from and then off to the right at and flew across the trees toward Highway 20.  The object seemed to float in a wobbling fashion for just a moment when changing from the descent to when it ascended.  In other words it hovered in a wobbly way.  The object was completely silent.  I am in the habit of taking my binoculars with me.  When I looked through them the object seemed to be alive, a living flying object self illuminated.  I am pondering, angel or ufo?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as working in a position of responsibility.  PD))<n>

The town we worked in was only 800 people, Yakutat, Alaska, so I went out there with the Chief of Police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a white diamond object seemlessly traverse a bright blue sky without a single cloud.  We got a video camera, and as I tried to focus in closer, it would dart away out of lense view, as if it knew i was attempting to take video!  I still have 20 minute or so of video of this thing that would move in curvy directions, nonlinear, and vibrate into different shapes which appeared to be circular, then back to diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> High-tech secret, or otherworldly, who knows.  I can&#39;t deny what i saw and have on tape.  Neighbors came out and saw this thing with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally it passed out of view; we thought maybe it can read out minds?  Who knows?  I asked it to come to me, and even today, 4 years later, i still think when i am alone, that i wish it would be brave enough to contact me at some point in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To date, nothing.  Perhaps I should not even attribute an animated intelligent to what i saw; perhaps it was just some high-tech secret project remote/drone; again, who knows.  The only thing I do know--it moved like nothing i have ever witnessed before either on the earth or in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was beginning to rain, and my car started making these weird noises the radio turned on automatically and started tuning to numerous stations a second, the lights inside and outside the car were flashing. And then I looked up and saw this huge triangle shaped thing above the car, in a few second this blue, blinding lights distracted me. It all stopped and my car was parked on the side of the road everything switched off, and I looked at my watch and it read 03:03 am. I then realised I lost 33 minutes.

It was silent and barely discernable like picking satellites out except that it was a perfect @120 degree V shape moving fluidly NW from directly overhead. The leading edge lights were star colored (same intensity but moving in unison), not red, green or blue and they were not navigation or formation lights. The light that was seeminly following the triangle was much brighter and seemed like a distraction that drew your eyes away from the perfect geometric constallation of smaller lights ahead of it. My wife saw it as well and was positive that it was one large solid object that had to be hundreds of yards across and emmitted no noise.

As we watched the craft, the lower right light moved in between the upper and lower left crafts. It then circled down underneath of the lower left craft and the bottom craft took the center position. I noted that the end result resembled that of the Constellation, Orion’s belt.  The crafts did not seem to be very far out over the field nor very high up in the sky. No shape could be seen other than round lights. No noise could be heard, and the crafts simply seemed to dim quickly and were gone!

This experience changed all that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in downtown vancouver in a highrise on the 16th floor. I was just about to tune on to the simpsons(that&#39;s how I know the exact time) when i saw this flying object over the the buildings in front of us. At first I thought that it was just the light of one of the cranes on the construction areas. I knew it could&#39;nt be a plane because first of all planes arent supposed to be that close to the city and after watching the planes that go around here everyday I ve almost memorized their paths. second of all the lights in this craft werent flickering or blinking or anything they were just constantly beaming a hazy sort of wierd whitish/yellowish light. I kept looking at it for a while and thought what the hell could that be could it be a blimp? At first I didn&#39;t see the 3 lights on the corners of this triangular craft until it very very slowly and I stress SILENTLY without the smallest sound just hovered towards my building. I mean anything made by man that flys only 500 meters away has to make a sound. by now I had called my brother cause I thought my eyes were fooling me. As the craft got closer we realized that it was no plane but some sort of triangular craft because it passed exactly a couple stories over my building and we were looking at the bottom of the craft and saw it&#39;s structure and there was a red light in the middle of it (the sterotypical red light, I know) I was just astonished and ran for my camera I kep searching for the damn thing in my messy house and eventually found it and took one lousy picture which I have no idea on how it will turn out. My brother is my witness and all those who know me know how much of a skeptic  and disbeliever I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran downstairs yelling that there&#39;s a UFO outside and nobody believed me i ran and saw the craft. suddenly instead  of going on it&#39;s horizontal path it went vertically straght to the skies and turned into a star and stayed their for a while and then left. Some other people saw this downstairs and they didn&#39;t care they said it&#39;s no big deal probably some governmental plane. But what would a governmental plane be doing in downtown vancouver?<n>

My 11 year old son came with us.What I saw was a moving glowing orange, or could have been burning round object moving at a steady rate of speed and altitude at above tree level. I wear glasses and thought I just could not make out what I was seeing. I ran back into my apartment and grabbed my glasses, my son grabbed his binoculars. Wearing my glases did not help me recognize what I was looking at. Actually it only filled me with more disbelief and questions. My son looked through his binoculars and said that it looked like a spinning top with an antenna on the top of it. I know that sounds so cliche but I honestly have never seen any thing like this before. I did not have time to look through them because it was already out of my line of sight . This object made no sound had no tail. It stayed on what looked like a path to me.If my kids had not seen it as well I would have thought I had lost my mind. I did call 911 jut because of the way things are going with terrorist threats and that. They refered me to th FAA she treated me like I was a nut and sent me to the ufo center.That is what we saw and now I am on more of an alert when I look up into the sky. I guess what I want most is to hear a logical explanation as to what we saw.<n>

At the time, the sky was clear with only a few clouds. There was little or no wind. She was laying down, making a snow angel, when she suddenly yelled excitedly for me to come over. I ran over as she pointed to the sky. I looked up, as she craned he necked backward to look behind her. I saw nothing. She described seeing something shaped like a &#34;slice of watermelon&#34; move in a straight line from west to east (I determined this from her position in relation to the front of the house). She said it was &#34;wobbling funny.&#34; When pressed, I asked what color it was, and she said it wasn&#39;t green and red like watermelon, but gray with black holes along the bottom edge. I later had her draw a picture and she depicted a crescent-shaped object with porthole-like objects along the bottom. She also remembers a reddish glow around the object that then changed to either green or blue. This was a daylight sighting with little or no wind, and my daughter said it was &#34;not as high as a jet but way higher than a bird up in the sky.&#34; She also admitted that she watched it for quite a few seconds in stunned silence before she was able to open her mouth and call for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the witness&#39;s illustration, and we may post it at a future date.

The light was approximately 1500 feet from the ground.  I observed the light through my 3-9X40 rifle scope.  The orb did not seem particularly defined but it did emmit a very clean,bright white light that I would describe as dazzling.  The orb was not moving very fast and I was able to watch it for several minutes as it passed over the field i was in. The Orb headed over a wooded area to the south west of me and then stopped dead, then a small pinpoint of light broke away from it and proceded to dance erratically around the orb performing manouvers that I would imagine any conventional aircraft would find impossible. This carried on for several minutes until the pinpoint dissappeared.  The larger orb remained stationary as I began to walk home with my back to it. I then lost sight of it through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness works as a countryside ((deleted--public servant, with access to a firearm.  PD))<n>

I was watching T.V with my wife girlfriend on a saturday night. It was 11:40pm and it was stormy outside so i decided to go outside and get her cats in. Anyway,after getting a drink i went outside and boy was it getting windy, not to mention the thunder. I looked into the sky and was fascinated by the shape of the clouds which were illuminated by lightning strikes. There was a enough of a break in the clouds to see a large portion of the sky and the stars were clearly visible. Then something strange happened, from the left side of the sky i noticed a bright white circular shaped object moving at a steady speed, i immediately thought it was a satellite, then i noticed a second bright white circular object moving in the same direction, the object caught with the first object and they were now one on top of the other however they were still flying individually. I have never seen two satellites flying together like that and they weren&#39;t planes, they were silent and they had no flashing lights. At this point i called to my girlfriend to have a look, i then saw a third bright white circular object move out from behing the same clouds as the other 2 objects and then the object trailled the front 2 at the same speed thus creating a triangle shaped formation. Once again this object imitted no sound and no flashing lights, the objects then slowly disappeared over the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Both lights were travelling side by side moving SW from my position at a slow rate of speed (Much slower than a airplane). At approx 19:59 both lights moved in opposite directions (on a parallel plane), one to the South the other to the North, at a high rate of speed. The items moved approx .5 Km appart, stopped for about 15-20 seconds, then returned to thier side by side position, slower than the seperation, about 1/4 the speed. I then ran inside to get my wife. Upon returning 15-20 seconds later we observed them continue moving slowly in a SW direction for 2 min when they vanished, almost like some one turn off a switch.<n>

But at that night we saw up to 3 ufo (fire ball) for about more than 3 hours. I call one of my office friend that live about 10 miles from my home. She could saw that object too. at the South of Medan same like me. We (my family,  our neighboor) saw that objects use my Nikon binoculliar. First just one object seen, stop and moving change their position and formation. Then the second and third fire ball join the one. They move to other position so quickly (i estimated about 50 miles for just 2-4 seconds) and stop for about 20 minutes in their new formation. My self waiting for this seeing for just more than 20 years. Before seen this fireball, about ufo my opinion is just like believe it or not. But now. i&#39;m so wonderful and make me remember the independence day film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

He reported his dog was going completely nuts has this event was going on. I asked the witness approx: how far away was the object to his location, he said maybe 4 to 6 blocks away up in the sky. He also said the ring which surrounded the object would twirl around the main body of the it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fellow also mentioned there were a number of colors coming from it, such as blue, green, etc..<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also told me it would move up and down, when it got close to the cloud cover it would change to all the different colors, but when it dropped back down at a lower level the color changed to a orange. The chap also said the object seemed to take it&#39;s time moving up and down, watching the ring still circling the main body of whatever this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses dog at this time actually took a bite at his owners foot, as it was frightened of what was going on. The witness was phoning from a friends home and the dog was still acting up. There was no sound heard from the object. I also asked if he could give me a rough idea of how big this thing was, he replied that it was approx: the size of a dinner plate from the distance of 4 to 6 blocks from his location. The sighting lasted for about 5 minutes, before it disappeared. But while I was still chatting to the fellow on the phone he gave out a loud cry and said there was a bright white streak of light from where the object has been observed. He also said a short trail of some of the colors I mentioned above was coming off it as it disappeared. (If this had anything to do with the object or not, hard to say).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Brian Vike, independent UFO investigator in northern British Columbia, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

The lights continued pulsating over different places in the sky and not always in the same way.  I have never seen anything like it.

I then glanced out again and noticed three lights in a triangle fashion.  I could clearly see the outline of the dark craft from the night sky behind it.  The craft moved behind some trees about 40-50 yards from the window, and the craft appeared about the size of larger than a semitruck.  The lights stayed a steady dull light of the three lights.  kind of like street lights about 2-3 blocks away.  after a few seconds I got up and went to the front bathroom that is in the bedroom, and open the front window and actualy from the waist up was out the window, a few planes in the distant and a small jetlike plane following in the pathe of the craft. there was clouds in the sky to the south east so I couls no longer see the craft.  I am not sure what it was but it was large and ominous.  ((name deleted))<n>

This object was traveling very slow &amp; left no contrail. I compared this object to surrounding air traffic which all were leaving contrails at 35k feet. I watched as the object moved in a NE direction but not in a linear direction. I watched as it appeared to stop &amp; ascend upward until it vanished out of sight. This entire event lasted about ten minutes. I don’t know of any aircraft that moves like this. I was able to capture some photos &amp; upon zooming in on them w/ my computer, it certainly was not an airplane.

The weather was clear skys, very very cold wind chill around -20. I was driving north on Rt:93 in between exit #2 and # 3, there was light traffic in front of me, about 3 or 4 cars, distanced greatly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a police cut out road to the left of me that I pass, and I big cell tower I can just about see with it&#39;s blinking red light- just coming into view. Out of no where this light comes streeking thru the sky from east to west. The color was an intence white, ( like the color of a laser as it starts to bore though metal ) Flashy bright.  This thing  moved so fast it was gone behind the tree line in a blink of an eye. I know the other drivers saw it, due to them hitting there breaks, and there lights going on as it passed.  The object if sizing from where I was, was about an- inch above the blinking tower, and was about the size of the tip of a match, *if you hold your hand extened outward. It seemed to leave a very light tail behind it. I have seen shooting stars, but this thing was bigger than anything I have ever seen, and due to it&#39;s direction, it did not appear to be decending, but moving from right to left. But it had the speed of a shooting star.  Right after it passed, there was a jet with red blinking lights, that came over passed the cell tower on the same course that the streek moved on,  but it was moving much much much slower.<n>
2/9/03 02:15|Trondheim (Norway)||Light|5 minutes|Blueish-white light during the night over the city of Trondheim, Norway.|3/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27864.html|184|ndxe200302| Blueish-white light during the night over the city of Trondheim, Norway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking home from the student community house I had a break at a busstop to smoke a cigarette and reply to a SMS message on my cell-phone. After I had sent the message a looked up at the sky to see if there was possibillity for snow, I then noticed a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was blueish white, sort of like xenon car-headlights.  It moved rather slowly from southeast to northwest, approx. 3-4 km. to the south of me.  (A guess based on the angel to the light and the apparent cailing of the clouds.) There was no sound, and the route is not an approach channel to the Vaernes-airport, which anyway have no night flights. (The airport are about 40 km north of the city, and aircraft come from the west or directly form the south.)  The light was neither on an apparent course towards the Oerlandet air force base about 60 km north-north east of the city.  The light did not have the characteristics of posistioning lights on any form of aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  The hospital often get ambulance helicopters landing, but these make a lot of noice and extremely rare this late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light kept a steady pace, and I remember being puzzled that the light did not seem to be reflected from the few clouds,as it seemed to be bright enough to illuminate them.  The properties of the light was &#34;cold&#34;  like a neon-lamp as opposed to the &#34;warm&#34; light of an ordinary lightbulb. It did not seem to have any special shape, more like a radiant pinprik or singularity, if you understand me.  When it seemed to reach the &#34;Graakallen&#34; hills (where there&#39;s a military radar station) I looked down as my cell-phone suddenly beeped, when I looked up again a half-second later the light was gone. This seemed to have neccesitated an significant acceleration. The time of the observation, 5 minutes, is based on the fact that my cigarette was just a stubb at this time and I usually use about 5-7 minutes on a smoke.  I waited for about 5 minutes, but when the light failed to appear again I went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think to much about it when there was no other reports in newspapers etc.  I had only had 1 beer that evening as I had been lending a hand during a tv-recording at the student community, and had to get up early the next morning. Had it not been for the fact that the light was clearly visible below clouds I&#39;d probably guessed it to be a satelite or high flying plane reflecting the sun or something like that, but it was undoubtably not that high.  (The cloud probably being at about 3000 feet.. (measured in regards to the Graakallen.)  The weather at the time was quite crisp, about 5 degrees centigrade below freezing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trondheim being a quite large city, with the accompanying light pollution the light was obviously quite bright, since it was brighter that for instance the road illumination on the opposite side of the river valley.  (Trondheim being situated along the Nidelven river, where this exits a glacial valley into the sea)  I was located at the lower part of the eastern side of the valley.  Hope the sighting might be of interest to you. I&#39;ve seen lights i couldn&#39;t identify before, but this somehow seemed different. And I must beg your apology, feeling that the report might have been more precise had I made a written record of it the same evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  We will invite him to attempt to confirm the date, since it was so recent a sighting.  PD))<n>

I hadn&#39;t been in bed long when my mother called me to look at something out the window with my friend, who was also witness. I looked out of my bedroom window and seen a hazy orange glow - it was obscured by the screen, so I went for a closer look out of the living room window, from which it could be seen in perfect clearness. The sky was clear with a few clouds, none of which were near what we seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a round orange ball in the sky across the road and field to the west in front of our house, above and diagonal with the treeline. Not at all like a meteor, which most people would think of when I describe it, as it wasn&#39;t a &#34;ball of fire&#34;; It was bright and light orange; the edges were even brighter, a red-orange. My mother, who had been watching it for longer and when it was higher in the sky, said there was a half-ring of darker flickering &#39;fire&#39; on the left side (I couldn&#39;t see this, because it was hidden very partially by the trees). It was very smooth, lacking any pock-marks or lights, metal sheen or anything at all but smooth orange, unlike most &#34;UFO&#34; sightings I&#39;ve read about...it was nothing I&#39;ve heard of before. It was perfectly solid looking, emitting no glow. It was large, or seemed pretty big, although to give a description of the size is difficult. Looking through binoculars, it was a definite sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it might be the moon -- but then I realized... the moon isn&#39;t full. In fact, it&#39;s only in first quarter. The majority of what we seen would have been the side that is DARK. Later on that night (morning), my mom seen the moon nowhere near where the orange circle was, high in the air, and white, to boot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving... very slowly, diagonally downwards and to the right, further into the trees - it didn&#39;t look like it was moving unless you watched closely. When it was in the trees, it noticeably paused. Although it was difficult to tell, it looked as if along with the trees in front of it, the circle also obscured the trees behind it, but it&#39;s hard to say for sure. It stayed there for a moment...an orange glow in the forest (though it didn&#39;t actually glow)...and then went *staight down*, quickly -- not light-speed, but about five or six times faster than the sun sets and disappeared out of sight. As I was thinking of running for the camera, that&#39;s when it went down. In retrospect, it was rather pretty, but at the time, it gave off no such vibes... there was an eerie quiet and still. None of the traffic that had been going by drove down the road the entire duration of the sighting, but started up again only minutes after it disappeared... probably a coincidence, but it added to the feel of there being something wrong here. We contacted the coast guard and they reported no other sightings.<n>

2/8/03 05:30|Beloit/Milwaukee (between)|WI|Disk|1 hour|The object seen was saucer shaped with a dome, emitting dotted or tracer type lights from the top and bottom.|3/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27706.html|191|ndxe200302| The object seen was saucer shaped with a dome, emitting dotted or tracer type lights from the top and bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The encounter took place as we were traveling eastbound on Interstate 43 between Beloit and Milwaukee, Wisconsin on February 8, 2003   At approximately 5:20 to 5:30 a.m., I noticed a round shaped light in the southern sky that seemed unusual, as it did not resemble a star.  Just east of Beloit, the light became larger and seemed to be moving from the distant south toward us. The light gradually became larger and started paralleling us as we traveled eastbound.  As the light approached, I saw a saucer shaped object with what appeared to be &#34;light showers&#34; coming from the object.  I then pointed out the object to my husband (who was driving)and my daughter and we all observed the same scene.  The object was still very distant, but had gradually become more visible.  As we continued to travel, the object continued to parallel us, while gradually becoming larger in size.  As it became larger, we could see more and more light showers coming from the top and bottom.  The light showers coming from the top of the object were white light colored and projected from the top in a spraying pattern similar to dotted lines or machine gun tracers.  However, the lights were abbreviated in length and did not project a great distance. From the bottom of the object, similar lights projected at 45 to 75 degree angles, but were red, green, and purple  or &#34;tracer&#34; lights.  As we watched the object, we could gradually begin to see a shape.  It looked like an oblong saucer shape with a lighted dome above it.  For a while it traveled horizontally in the same direction we were traveling and we could see what appeared to be flashing light patterns criss-crossing the body of the object similar to static electricity experiments.  The lights were flashing in diagonals criss-crossing from both directions.  The object appeared to stop and hover (paralleling us, but still far south of us) and drop behind our position as we continued traveling eastbound.  However, on several occasions, the object appeared to suddenly move eastbound to a! positio n ahead of our direction, and then hover for awhile.  On a couple of occasions, the object seemed to turn.  On one of these occasions, it appeared to look like a full saucer-shape, and we saw it out-lined completely as red and green lights lit up across the saucer-shape, blinking on and off as they came across the saucer.  We watched this phenonenon for over a hour.  As we came into Milwaukee, the object was still paralleling us.  We saw a plane circling from the northeast, taking off from the airport and believe that someone from that plane surely had to see this object also.  At this time, it became dawn, approximately 6:30a.m., and the object suddenly began to climb rapidly southeastward at a 70 degree angle until it was once again just a small dot in the sky and disappeared into a bank of dark clouds.  My husband, daughter, and I all watched the object and concluded it was definitely neither a plane nor a helicopter.<n>

The lights were dim but bright enough to watch as they disapeared over the horizon. I&#39;ve seen satelites and this object wasn&#39;t one, it moved from just above the south western horizon to disapear over the north eastern horizon within 30sec. They were white in colour but quite dull. Just before it disapeared over the horizon the object came to a complete halt, remaining perfectly still for about 10-15 sec. My two dogs were locked up at the time, but when I let them out into the back yard they whimpered and barked at the sky. They have never done this previously.<n>

I was looking off towards the West when I heard a sound like something hit the ground to my right. The sound was that of when you drop a baseball on the ground. I turned to the North and thought that since nobody was around that maybe something fell from the sky. I then looked up and I saw a very large stationary ,round and bright light in the sky. It was a clean white light, like that of the moon. It seemed as though the light was focused on me but I didn&#39;t see a light beam like you would expect to see from such a bright light. Then after approximately 3 seconds of looking at it, it looked like it flipped upside down and shot straight up in the sky at the fastest rate I have ever seen anything move before, and disappeared from view.<n>

(a suburb of Seattle), and on the early evening (dusk) of Feb. 07th, 2003, I was wating for the sky to get dark enough so I could do some star gazing with my binocs and telescope.  At about 18:20 I went out side to check the sky&#39;s darkness.  We had clear weather that day, so the sky was cloudless. I could see several major planets like Jupiter and Saturn shinning through the darkening blue skys, but no stars were visible yet.  From the back yard I looked over the top of my house and a bright object was flying at a high declination in the sky over my house.  It looked like the ISS (International Space Station) flying by Seattle, which it was scheduled to due on Feb. 7th.  So I got my binocs and followed it across the sky until it set in the east.  It approached from the west.  But when I checked the NASA ISS sightings web site, it said that the ISS Seattle flyover was scheduled for 19:24 that night, an hour and 15 mnutes later.  The only other thing I can think that it was, was the Russian Supply Ship Progress, which had been docked with the ISS since the Tuesday before, or it was something unexplained.  I sent an e-mail inquiry to NASA about went the supply ship was due to return to earth, but have not yet received a response.   Another possibilty is that the posted times on the ISS Sightings web site was in error, but I never found that to be the case in terms of the times ISS flies over Seattle..  Just was wondering if any one had any infomation on this in terms of whether this was the Russian Supply Ship Progress or the ISS, and whether anyone may have seen what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness witnessed, but the Heavens-above.com website states that it does not indicate those events which occur during daylight hours, or close to daylight hours.  Hence, the object may have been the ISS, and the flyover was not shown as being &#34;visible&#34; during the earlier pass.  We saw the ISS on the same night.  PD))<n>

The sky was unusually blue and clear with occasional white clouds. The sighting occured in the Mission Dam park itself. We were standing at the side of the paved road facing northwest, about 1/2 mile north of the visitor center, looking up towards south Fortuna Mountain. We were feeling kind of lazy and were just gazing at crows as they flew from the top of Fortuna Mountain down near the bottom of the canyon and back up again. After a while we were just looking around and noticed that the crows seemed to have left. I looked around for them and noticed that they were circling at the top of south fortuna and pointed it out to my friend. We were both looking at them and then I said &#34;look seagulls are circling above them&#34; realizing that they were not seagulls! My friend then said &#34;those aren&#39;t seagulls&#34; We were looking at about 8 brilliant white spheres doing circles and right angle turns at various hights up to about a mile high or so. They were obviously not birds, but the crows were circling under them which was really strange. We watched them in awe for about 45 seconds and then they were just gone in an instant! The crows were still there though. We stood there for a while hoping they would come back but they didn&#39;t after an hour had passed, while we talked about them. I didn&#39;t take any pictures because I didn&#39;t have a camera with me.<n>

(who is a retired naval officer) and his two brothers, my brother in law and i went out to the cumberland river to fish all night. about 3:00 am i looked to the left (up river) and saw a bright light in the sky, i said hey! whats that! everyone looked and said WOW or AHH. we watched it hover over the river tnan raise up and GROW BIGGER it got really bright and REALLY BIG! and lit up the whole area we were at, which was pitch dark except for a coleman lantern we had behind us on the bank. it was bright yellow to redish yellow and very very bright than it jus! t went o ut like you turned off a light. it made no sound. we all were amazed at what we saw.i have never been afraid to tell people of what i have seen growing up, and now i have 4 people who seen the same thing in the air over the river that i had seen as a child in the neighbors field this is the first time i have ever posted it on any web site, i just never thought about doing it. i glad im not the only burna ky native who has seen this thing<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain of the date here.

Between Jeffersonville and Washington Court House a large, orange light appeared in front of us. I asked if that was a plane and the light disappeared. We laughed it off as strange and continued. On the other side of Court House on East 35 the same light appeared at the 41 exit. This time it lit up for about 3-4 seconds,faded, then another to the right quickly blinked then went out and the light on the left lit up again. This got our attention and I rolled down the window to see if I could see anything. The sky was clear and cloudless. Nothing could be seen flying or moving. We discussed what these lights couldve been for the next 3-4 miles when we saw another of these lights again. This time we pulled over to the side of the highway. My husband pointed out 4 flying blinking lights on what we thought were planes. We continued driving to Chillicothe as I watched these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the speed I first thought they were jets. I rolled my window down and could not make any shape out or hear any sound. The lights were a single, strobe-like light on each one. The lights didnt blink in a pattern but would blink quickly, then would go off, then blink slow. This happened with all of them. My husband noticed one going left, then stall, and change direction quickly going back to the right. They moved into pairs moving around in the sky going different speeds. The lights were small and if it wasnt for the large, glowing orange light I wouldve never have noticed these lights. Im not sure of the distance. They seemed very far away which would make the speed they were going even stranger. Ive never seen any plane or jet move like these moved, or change direction, or speed like these did. At the Frankfort exit we got off rte 35 to get a better look. Two of the lights lined up, one on the left and one on the right. The other two came in and joined the line in the middle of these. Their lights then rarely blinked and the two on the outside began a patterned blink. As they flew away at one point all the lights in this row blinked and it looked like 8-10 separate lights in this row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they went back towards the west the two lights continued to blink on the outside and every now and then two lights between them would blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to make a rough guess I would say the distance between the craft on the left and the one one the right would be around 1-2 miles. This was the strangest thing Ive seen in the sky. I dont know if anyone else noticed these smaller lights but Im sure many people had to see these large round orange lights.<n>

It appeared on 2/6/03 at about 8:09. I saw it while going home it appeared to be over the Burbank airport, but this is very hard to tell because it is so high up you cant tell where it is located. when I got home I still saw it, I decided having over 30 video taped sightings of the craft I dont need to take more so I observed the object. It was so high that it appeared over my area now .I watched the craft as it moved from right to left then right again very slowly, and it stayed hovering for a while then throw down a fireball from the bottom of it. It was the same color as the object it was orange. then it changed its color to white, it may not have changed its color but maybe it went so high up I could not tell. but it began to move backboard and then so high up it vanished from my sight.By the way I dident send this message on my other email address, but another one.<n>

At first, I thought it was a star, but then i realized that it is too bright and too close to the earth. It looks like a really bright star, but if u pay close attention to it, u can see it hover from side to side like it is looking around for something, it also moves forward a little and then back into the same spot, up and down(back into the same spot) and it can suddenly stop. It kind of seems like it wants to move closer toward the earth, but something pulls it back into where it first was.. it moves really slow and steady and when i look really hard it looks as if there are like 5 greenish spikes coming out the top of it with a little reddish yellow light in the middle.. I&#39;ve seen it for the past few weeks maybe even a month only when it gets dark outside, and it goes away when the sun comes up.. I was wondering if it might be a satellite or something of that sort, but it just seems really peculiar. I told my friend about it and she stands outside with me sometimes to view it.. sometimes i think i see like little lights or something fall from it but i only see it out of the corner of my eyes, so im not really quite sure but there is a slight purplish cloudy haze around it... Again it is a bright light almost like a very bright star, with 4-5 greenish spikes on top with a little reddish yellow in the middle... When i watch it sometimes it feels like it knows that i can see it.. its a very awkward feeling... I wish i had a telescope so i could get a very good look at it, but i can see it pretty good if i stare really hard at it.. there is no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may be looking at either Sirius or Jupiter.

We watch it for an hour. We called the news station and they said they could see it to. They were going to go out and see if they could find out what it was, but we have not been told anything yet. I know it was not something that is there all the time. We have not seen it before and so far it has not back. The colors were blue and then green and then a pink color. The shapes were all kind. It split into two and then went back to one. The video is so great.

My cousin pointed out a flashing or beeping light close to the star Polaris. After about 10 seconds i too saw the the light. My reaction to this was that it was just an airplane, but the &#34;craft&#34; moved far to slow and didn&#39;t flash like an airplane. It was a white light, and it looked just like any other star. The size of it was about as large as a pin-head. The light would beep or flash very breifly every 6 seconds. It also moved in a downward diagonal motion about as far as half a thumb. Then it bagan to move left when suddenly 2 blinking lights came out of one for only one breif flash. Then the light moved about 2 and a half thumb lengths to the left, blinking in between each movement until the blinking just stopped and we never saw it after that, not a faint light, nothing, it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

As I came down the mountain pass on the other side, I could view the stars as its a great spot to see the sky and hills coming down. I looked and saw what appeared to be two shooting stars come down on an area of the sky ahead of me toward livermore area. The stars split directions and the light was gone.. Further down the hill going approx 65 mph.. I looked out my right hand window of my blazer and saw a circlur dark disk &#34;float&#34; past as if I was looking at the bottom of it.. It all happened so fast it was hard to believe the light in the distance that I saw was the same disk that had &#34;floated&#34; by.. The look was as if I could see the blackness of space and stars and then an &#34;eclipse&#34; of the bottom of this &#39;disk&#39; metal looking area that was grey looking float by.. I had no time to stop or didint think about doing it.. To verify what I had seen was not a reflection from something inside my car.. I&#39;m highly positive what I saw was a craft of some sort, as I KNOW I saw the shooting stars before the (UFO?), so my consequential sighting MUST relate to the shooting stars.. the craft must have been one and the same thing. and it has the ability to go extremely fast and levitate without any engine.. There were no lights as it floated by.. just the grayness of the bottom of the disk…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Object looked like a ballon caught in the tree.  It glowed and seemed to be aluminated by the light of the moon(clear night but only a crescent moon).  Object moved across to the other side of the tree.  Really looked like a glowing baloon.  Object then moved away and actually was not near the tree.  Object then appeared to be a more oval shape with a reddish/white light appearance.  Object which originally appeared to be just above the ground then moved upward to the east and seemed to reach an altitude of several thousand feet, like an airliner.  The object then moved fast towards the east at what appeared to be the same altitude of a commercial jet, however, there was no sound at all.  The object dissappeared to the SE.<n>

I met the neighbour and she said she saw some objects in the sky moving very fast and then stand still and then moving again. I looked up the sky and saw nothing. She said that they went behind a cloud. I thought she was crazy because the clouds I saw were like a thin veil.... I joked that we were probably infaded by aliens. She repeated that they were moving very fast. I walked back into the appartment building and went out the other side to walk to the grocery store with my fiancee. I talked about it with her and on Fort street we looked up the sky and there was one of them... a shiny, smoothly moving object, no wings, no bird.... it was really strange. My fiancee saw it as well and couldn&#39;t really figure out what the shape was (we saw it for approx 15 secs). I didn&#39;t meet my neighbour again today, but I will definitely ask her some questions because she must have seen it for a longer period of time. I also called the police short of the spotting, but they didn&#39;t have other callers yet that spotted this event. On the radio there were no reports. On our way back from the grocery store we saw some people (3) with a video camera taping the sky, but if they were taping a telephone pole or the sky wasn&#39;t clear to us and we didn&#39;t ask because they were on the other side of the busy street. In the direction they were pointing their camera was nothing to see. My fiancee was joking that the Americans were keeping an eye on us. I kept looking on our way back, but didn&#39;t see it again, nor did I see my neigbour. (As soon as I have more info I will add that here).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a report from the fiancee, as well.

A Canfor employee who run a track mobile at the saw mill was moving around chip cars on company property. He said he climbed down off the machine he was operating to switch over to another track, when an extremely fast object, or for a better word, three bright, hazy blue/white lights came out of the north and disappeared to the south. The witness said everything happened to fast that he could not make out any type of outline to what he was viewing. The forestry worker said the three lights were in a triangular shape, and held the same shape until he lost sight of it. I asked the witness if he might be able to give me a rough idea of the altitude the lights were at. (I gave him a few examples). In the end he mentioned the lights were not that high above him. But had to be high enough to clear the mountains to the south.

HBCC UFO Note: The couple of days ago I reported that three blue/white lights in a triangular shape were witnessed by a Canfor sawmill employee flying very low over top of him. The object moved very quickly and disappeared over one of Houston, B.C. local mountains. This sighting took place on February 3, 2003 at approx: 8:10.p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, February 9, 2003 I went to visit a close friend. While sitting around talking he told me that his brother has witnessed something very strange on February 3, 2003, in the morning between 8:00 &amp; 8:10 a.m. Of course my ears perked up when I heard the date of the sighting, and I asked my friend if he would call his brother and ask if it would be ok to come over to take his report on what he saw. He agreed and I soon left my buddies home and headed over to look into this new report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, I would like to point out that the fellow who gave me his account of events, does not really believe in UFOs, or visitors from else where. I also know this fellow very well, and both himself and his wife are well respected in the community of Houston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness to the early morning sighting works for Houston Forest Products which is one of two large and very modern sawmills. At the time of his sighting he was operating a heavy machine in the log yard when a &#34;extremely&#34; bright yellow/orange light caught his attention. The source of the light was coming from the northern side of Pea Cock Mountain, which is at the south end of the forest companies property. There was a low lying fog in the valley that morning but from his position he could see the fog had only gone part ways of the mountains, so it was laying very low. After he saw the intense light, he saw what he first thought was a helicopter, but wondered why it had such a bright light on it, then after a couple of seconds went by he thought it couldn&#39;t be a helicopter due to the size of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The description he gave me of this object was as follows, the object at a distance of approx: 2 kilometers ( or less) away up on the side of Pea Cock Mountain on a logged off area, sat either hovering, or &#34;sat on the ground&#34; for approx: 40 seconds. The witness said the color of the object was a light gray/white. And the color was changing, as if it was translucent (almost as if it was flickering in and out). The craft was oval is shape with this bright yellow/orange light dead center at the bottom of the object. As the witness sat watching it, it rose up only a little, and flew to the south heading to the top of Pea Cock Mountain. But before it even came close to the top of the mountain, and with no obstructions in between the witness and the craft it completely disappeared. Or as they say, blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I find this interesting because of two reports on the very same day, one in the morning and evening in pretty much the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: Monday morning I will be stopping into the local helicopter business, in which there is two of. I want to see if they were flying that morning, or around the time of the sighting. I also will stop in and see if the forestry knows of any logging operations going on at the sighting location. Plus I may have to dig out the snowshoes and take a short hike to look around the area for any possible signs that something may have been there. It has not snowed in a while here, so if anything had got close to the ground, or even landed, there should be signs of this taking place.  I will keep everyone posted on this case. Also I am just going to post a computer graphic on my site to give you an example of what this thing looked like. My wife recreated it from the drawing the witnesses supplied.

Just then three similar lights travelling at great speed came to an halt almost at the exact spot with a distance between them.About 2 minutes later they came close together in a triangular shape and for about 4 minutes before geting dimmer and dimmer until the disappeared. It so happens that my cousin is an aircraft engineer and I work for an airline but we have never seen anything like that before. We first thought it was  aircrafts but there was no any other light such as an anti collision light and also the speed the second batch of lights travelled was nothing like i&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed and then coming to static stop in the sky.<n>

Lauderdale and was traveling on Route 60 which connects the Florida turnpike to route 95. The connecting road is about 25 miles and was about 9 miles on route 60 towards route 95 when I noticed blinking lights up the road. Just thought they were lights on a pole but as I got closer, the lights were hovering over the other side of the road. The object was hovering about two or three times the height of a light pole and was about 3 or 4 times the size of my car. The object was oval, almost rectagular with curved corners. I only viewed it from the underside but it had an oval underbelly that glowed a dull teal blue and had two horizontal bands that also appeared blue but a bit darker. The bands on the underbelly appeared to structures within the oval underbelly. There were 8 bright lights that surrounded the blue convex underbelly. The 8 white lights were very bright and went on and off with a regular cycle and alternated with the blue underbelly light that went on and off alternately with the white lights. The white lights would be on then total blackness, then the blue underbelly oval light ( very dull ) then total darkeness then the white lights. It did move a bit to my left and at an angle as I approached. Unfortunately, I had just passed a slow moving vehicle and there was no breakdown lane and also a ditch on each side of the road, so I could not pull over to get a better look, without causing an accident with the car that I just passed, although, that car must have seen the object. There was just nowhere to pull over at that time. One last thing, I noticed a punjent slightly burning oder in my car after I passed it, very subtle.<n>

I was looking at the NE sky in relation to my home.  An object appeared suddenly in the sky as if a huge but self-contained light had been switched on. It was totally illuminated like the moon without lighting the sky around it.  No halo or beams, just white moon-like light.   The object was roughly the length of 3 moons, but stretched  into a long sideways oval or egg shape.  I observed it,trying to figure out what it was, for about 3-5 seconds.  It traveled in a south to north direction rapidly but seamlessly in a smooth glide and then completely disappeared as if a light had been extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is nothing in my experience to compare this with visually.  The only other event I have witnessed was a bright illumination late at night which went from one end of the yard on with a ruler-sharp edge. The lighted section was like daylight -the dark was like night.  This event was also capured by a bank camera operating at night and was on the news the next day (which validated what I saw).  I only hope someone out there witnessed the whatever-it-was tonight and will let me know.<n>

It was very clear this evening and not to cold so my wife and I went out to look at the stars.  We do this quite regularily and are getting to know the constellations fairly well.  I saw a blinking light through my binoculars and followed it for a few seconds before pointing it out. We often track satelites but this was diferent.  It had a blinking light, and was moving very quick.  I first spotted it between the constelation Orion and Pleiades and it travelled straight as an arrow towards the big dipper then continued out of site.  I frequently watch passenger jets as they fly across the sky but this was moving much faster.  I do not think you would expect to see a stobe light on a jet at 30,000 feet, definately not as bright as this one.<n>

I told my sister that it was an UFO behind her, and we rapidly ran to open the balcony in order to see it closely. But it was not necessary, because it was very clear to see. It was a really big one. Like a half moon but bigger in diameter. It stopped for a while, maybe 2 or 3 minutes in front of us, until it started to move from west to east and dissapeared. While it was happened, I called my brother, who lives in other place but in the same area (South Miami). He went outside, and he could see the same fenomena. Ten or 15 minutes later, we were still in shock, chatting with him by internet, when the same object came back from the east where it dissapeared, to return to the west, but moving faster. I was trying to take a picture, but I was on the other room of my apartment where some trees did not allowed me to get a good one, but I&#39;m very possitive about it was the same object we saw minutes before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite sincere and credible.

It then quickly shot downward, I immediately thought it was a shooting star.  But it did not fade or fizzle out; it stopped and then shot abruptly to the right.  I woke up my husband to witness this amazing craft.  He got his binoculars which allowed us to see that the craft had green and red lights on it. I then woke up our two teenage children to witness this. We are still unable to determine an exact shape, as it is off in the distance.  The craft continued to dart around and continue in a decent downward.  It also has flashes of light that occur the exact same distance around the craft intermittently.  It appears as though it may also be sending off beams of light. I have watched this craft appear in the same area for three nights now.  It appears as though there are other such craft hovering in the sky and not moving, but they have the green and red lets on them as well.  My husband contacted all law enforcement agencies to see if they had heliocopters in the air, and they did not.  He contacted Sacramento International Airport Control Tower, and they said they did not have any planes in the air, but there was something showing up on their radar intermittently.  The object is too far away and it is too dark to video tape it.  I am wondering if anyone else in the area has seen it.  If so, please let me know @ ((e-address deleted))<n>

Lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an exceptionally clear night, and I was out doing time-exposure photography of star trails and the northern lights, which were unusually visible due to the clarity of the sky.  As I was looking through the viewfinder of my Canon EOS-3, I noticed something strange in the upper right corner of the view finder...I removed my eye from the viewfinder and tried to get a better view as to what I was seeing.  It was a VERY large (2-3 times the size of a 747) disk, that was black, or at least looked black due to the absence of light.  It was honest-to-God saucer shaped.  I would have NEVER believed it was anything out of the ordinary..until I saw it move eastward in the sky.  There was absolutely no noise at all...not even crickets.  It was moving very slowly...in my very rough estimation, maybe 20 knots at the most.  It stopped periodically and hovered in its location before continuing on the way.  I attempted to take pictures, but it remains to be seen if anything will appear on film, due to the fact that I was shaking very much, and there was little light.  Exposure times were in the 20-30 second range that I had set to record the northern lights.  This is not any sort of a joke that I am playing.  To be honest, I am still shaking here at home, as I write this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP #1 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> For confirmation....it is Saturday evening that I made the sighting.

At first we thought they were maybe northern lights but they didn&#39;t move or change colors like northern lights do. So being curious we drove towards the lights in the foothills of Mt. Spokane. We took Biglow Gulch Rd. and drove a bit to get to a area to pull over in the flats that are farming lands to get a clear view. We pulled down a dirt service road next to the power lines and watched the beams lights in back of the foothills of the mountain. There was 5 beams pointing to the night skys and they seems to be pointing to different stars some beams were straight up and down and others where angled. The light beams changed intensity fading from bright to dim and did this slowly. We got back into the van to leave to drive closer to the lights when we both noticed a huge outline of a saucer shape hovering over one of the foothills. The angles on the shape where too sharp on every side to be a cloud and it would have been too low to be a cloud. The saucer shape that was hovering over the foothill was wider then the foothill. This thing was huge. And were miles from the foothill at that moment.  We turned the van around and got on the main road again to head towards the foothills. Then we took a another dirt road next to a church and drove down it a bit and passed a small white toyoto truck with a canopy on the bed of the truck with it&#39;s running lights on. We didn&#39;t think to much about it because it being the weekend and teenagers out parking. So we pulled up about a block in front of them and got out of the van to watch the lights more and to see the craft. But the craft was no longer visable just the strange light were still moving around the foothills of the mountain. Then I got a strange feeling and told me husband we better get out of there. We turned around and were heading to get back in the van when I noticed that the small pickup&#39;s parking lights were off now. So we turned th! e van ar ound and headed for the pickup and our headlight hit their licence plate and it said U.S. Government on the plate. Needless to say we got the heck out of their as fast we could and back on the main road again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from the Spokane, WA, area for the same date.

From where I was no stars were visible, the view from the drivers seat doesn&#39;t allow you to see overhead, without leaning forward as far as possible, and I was sitting back in my seat. When I got home I immeditly looked in to the sky to check what the stars were like, it&#39;s a clear night and several stars a visible, but none including the north star were nearly as bright white as this. The object I saw in the sky fell in an arch from east to west, I couldn&#39;t tell you what kind of a degree the was arch was.  The sky was black ahead of me, there were other cars around, in front, behind and going in the oppisite direction. There were also a few street lamps, I had just past an on ramp and feet away from an off ramp and on the south bound side of the highway there was an on ramp near by. There was considerable light around other than the few street lights, both sides of the highway have near by gas stations, the north bound side also has a small well lite hotel, and Burger King. The object didn&#39;t have a trail of anything behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve witnessed shooting stars and meteriors before and this was nothing like it. it moved faster than a shooting star.

The video had no station ID on the screen. The camera was facing north, and the shuttle was approaching what looked like a jet trail, orange because of the hour.  As the shuttle dissapeared from view, I saw what looked like a &#34;rod&#34; move from the bottom right of the screen to the top and out of sight in about 3 or 4 frames. (slo-mo)  I thought it was a bird, until I saw a crow fly past the camera 4 or 5 seconds later in slo-mo, from right to left.  The bird took 10 to 15 frames to traverse the bottom of the screen.  It was no bird.  I&#39;ve seen photo&#39;s of this object before, it was definately one of those rod&#39;s.  No one else was looking at the screen at the time.

We spoke with the photographer from the Albuquerque TV station, and he reports that when the video is slowed down, one can see a crow flying throught the field of view of the television camera.  We tend to agree with this assessment, although the witnesses disagree fervently with this analysis.  We do not know for certain what the object was.  PD))<n>

This was real sad news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 9:00A.M.- 10:00A.M. CNN showed earlier footage from Albuquerque,NM. This footage was played for only close to perhaps 30 seconds. This is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was still dark. There was a long thin cloud near the top left of the T.V. screen that angled slightly upward and 2/3rds across to near the top of the screen.  As the shuttle crossed over this cloud from the top 1/3rd of the screen,at a slight downward and right angle to about the center of the screen,a dark rod shaped object shot across the screen from the bottom center,to the top right corner in a fraction of a second. Then a crow flew across the bottom of the screen from the right side to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This footage aired only 3 more times that Saturday.

In the video the shuttle is coming from the left top hand of the screen downwards towards the right. There was a cloud in front of it with the sun reflecting on it making it glow, all of a sudden from the bottom left hand corner of the screen a dark shaped objects zipped across the sky upwards towards the right hand corner. It was moving quite fast and dissapeared in seconds. My 14 year old son and I looked at each other and both said at the same time &#34;What the heck was that?&#34; We watched all day long for them to show the particular clip again but the never did. It was very clear to us and are wondering why it was never shown again. Please check into this with CNN and see what you can find out.

FOX News did not show the clip.  I waited to see it again so that I could run it through the VCR and try to slow the sequence, unfortunate there was no follow-up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw (brief seconds) was the shuttle with a bright object (whether cloud reflection or otherwise) close by.  Although I did not witness the &#34;dark&#34; objects streaking by (and cannot confirm source direction) - within a split second I saw what appeared to be a small &#34;burst&#34; coming from the vapor trail of the shuttle.  The bright object (nearby) seemed to &#34;disappear&#34;.  There were no further frames after that event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was: &#34;there is something wrong with this picture&#34;.  I knew there was (has to be) more to this when I didn&#39;t see that sequence again later.  The DETAILS of this sequence would have been valuable in actual/post investigative analysis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be important to find out if there were more witnesses (actual visual) - find out what happened to the actual video (if it was &#34;confiscated&#34; - and why) - and in other videos (FOX included) I also saw what looked like a commercial airliner nearby.  More investigation from witnesses, pilots, or any other source may help recover some important information as to the ACTUAL cause of that tragic event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please investigate this further I think  it is important in finding the &#34;missing&#34; pieces.  The seriousness of this requires it.  Objectivity a must.<n>

He estimated that the witnesses first noticed the object an estimated two seconds after they had first witnessed the Shuttle in the sky to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The grandfather reported that, at first, he did not trust his eyes, and said nothing.  However, a second or two later, his grandson asked what the &#34;green thing&#34; in the sky was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC hasn&#39;t received their written report, yet, but we include below the grandfather&#39;s e-mail, which we received February 4th, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP E-MAIL #1 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with you just minutes after the shuttle disaster on Saturday. You were kind enough to listen  ((to me)) regarding the bright green light I saw running parallel with the shuttle prior to the shuttle&#39;s explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was there with my grandchildren watching for Columbia&#39;s re-entry....we watched it from horizon to horizon and I can&#39;t imagine having a better overall vantage point than the spot where we stood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told you that I would send a detailed description of what I saw...green light, explosion, sonic boom, etc.  But before I do that I ask that you &#34;hear me out&#34; so to speak. It&#39;ll take about a paragraph and then, if you still want me to, I&#39;ll send the detailed story. Actually I suppose that I&#39;m asking what you would do if you were in my position:<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 23rd, 1959, I had a very &#34;up close and personal&#34; encounter with two UFOs.  Since that time I&#39;ve had sort of a &#34;been there, done that&#34; attitude regarding UFO&#39;s.  I don&#39;t try to convince anyone one way or the other, but I&#39;m always very irritated when, through someone&#39;s stupidity, the idea that we are being visited by extarestrals is &#34;debunked.&#34;   Which brings me to the green light and the shuttle. We now know that pieces of tile were being ripped off Columbia over the west coast, and of course that would be most people&#39;s explanation for the green light.  I wish I could rationalize the light away with the tile theory.  I&#39;ve tried. But I can&#39;t get my mind around this thing for several reasons. Why was it at such a great distance from Columbia?   Why was it closing the gap between itself and the shuttle?   What could have come off Columbia at that point that would burn such a bright, unremitting green?   And most importantly, why wasn&#39;t the green object leaving a smoke trail?   My eight year old grandson said it all when he asked, &#34;Grandpa what&#39;s that green light following the shuttle?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> In any case, you probably see where I&#39;m going with this.  This is a terrible tragedy for a lot of people and the world as a whole.  People are not in the mood for, what they would no doubt consider a quack, coming out of the woodwork.  So my question to you, Peter, is...do we say a whole lot about this now?  Or anything at all for that matter?  It could cause emotional pain to many people and badly damage ufology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It occurs to me at this exact moment that you yourself might think I&#39;m a nut case. So for the &#34;unofficial&#34; record I&#39;ll tell you this:  Although I don&#39;t have a clue what the green object was, I don&#39;t believe for a second that it was anything from the shuttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that little bit of bravado I&#39;ll close. Let me know what you want me to do now. Let me know too if anyone else has reported anything similar to what I&#39;ve told you. Misery likes company you know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> God bless you and yours.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP #2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter...<n> <n><n> If I&#39;m not mistaken I told you in our phone conversation on the 1&#39;st that the green light approached Columbia from the south. That was an oversight on my part...it came in from the north as stated in the following report.<n> <n><n> I hope the report will be of use to you. Feel free to edit it for brevity if you like. Let me take a moment now to thank you for the wonderful work you do. I often wonder where individuals like yourself get the time and energy to work their miracles. I am in awe of you.<n> <n><n> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n> <n><n> In making this report on what I saw Saturday, February 1, 2003 I&#39;m well aware that it will be offensive to a great many people. The loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven has left, to countless millions, deep sorrow, great pain, and confusion. The wounds will be slow in healing. It is not my intention to cause additional pain or hinder the healing process for any human being on this planet. What I saw may have had nothing to do with Columbia&#39;s demise...yet it may have had everything to do with it. I&#39;m able to rationalize away much of what I saw, but in the end I&#39;m stuck with questions that I simply can&#39;t get my mind around:<n> <n><n> On the morning of the shuttle disaster I walked with three of my grandchildren to the front yard of my home for the purpose of watching the shuttle&#39;s re-entry. It was 7:45 a.m. central time, the sky was perfectly clear, and we were 35 miles north of what would turn out to be Columbia&#39;s ill-fated path. We stood looking to our west, the sun to our backs. When the shuttle first appeared it was quite visible in the clear, blue sky and was, of course, a great distance away. For the first few seconds I saw nothing that looked out of the ordinary. If the shuttle&#39;s tiles were indeed breaking away as we are now told I saw no sign of it. I expect we were too far away at the time and the tiles were in too close proximity with Columbia.<n> <n><n> However, as the craft came closer to us I saw, far to the north of Columbia, what can best be described as a bright, invariant, green light. It appeared to be moving at a greater speed than was the shuttle, and was clearly closing the gap between itself and Columbia from the prospective of latitude. It did not vary in intensity, traveled a straight line, and more importantly, did not leave a trail of smoke. All of which prompted my eight year old grandson to ask, &#34;Grandpa what&#39;s that green light following the shuttle?&#34;<n> <n><n> At a point still to out west, though much closer, the green light passed behind the shuttle and did not reappear.  The shuttle was, of course, giving off quite a lot of smoke at the time although the craft was still, to my untrained eye, doing quite well. But a few short seconds later I saw what appeared to be small pieces of material breaking away from Columbia, giving off a lot of smoke as they slowly dropped behind. In a very short time Columbia was directly to our south. At that point it appeared to explode&#34;...there was a flash of light and large pieces broke away, leaving the trails of smoke filmed by so many people.  I felt sick to my stomach as we stood for several more minutes watching everything disappear to the east. Then came the sonic booms.<n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what else to say. Many people besides us had to have seen the green light, although in the beginning it was too far away from Columbia, I think, to appear on the videotapes. The primary questions I am left with are as follows: If the green object was something from the shuttle why was it initially so far away from Columbia?  Why was the light traveling on a path that intersected that of Columbia? And why, when everything else was leaving a smoke trail...why wasn&#39;t the green object<n> <n><n> smoking?<n> <n><n> This is what I saw. I have made my report and now I can start trying to forget the horrible sight of seven good people dying. Through the whole ordeal a lot of stuff was flying through the skies that Saturday morning. Feel free to rationalize away everything I&#39;ve said. I only wish that I could. God bless those who lost family and friends and<n> <n><n> God bless America.<n> <n><n> ((initials deleted))<n> <n><n> East Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FOLLOW-UP #2))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Cosmic bolt probed in shuttle disaster  Scientists poring over &#39;infrasonic&#39; sound waves  Sabin Russell, Chronicle Staff Writer  Friday, February 7, 2003Federal scientists are looking for evidence that a bolt of electricity in the upper atmosphere might have doomed the space shuttle Columbia as it streaked over California, The Chronicle has learned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Investigators are combing records from a network of ultra-sensitive instruments that might have detected a faint thunderclap in the upper atmosphere at the same time a photograph taken by a San Francisco astronomer appears to show a purplish bolt of lightning striking the shuttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Should the photo turn out to be an authentic image of an electrical event on Columbia, it would not only change the focus of the crash investigation, but it could open a door on a new realm of science.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We&#39;re working hard on the data set. We have an obligation,&#34; said Alfred Bedard, a scientist at the federal Environmental Technology Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. He said the lab was providing the data to NASA but that it was too early to draw any conclusions from the sounds of the shuttle re-entry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lab has been listening to the sounds of ghostly electromagnetic phenomena in the upper atmosphere, dubbed sprites, blue jets and elves. For some time, scientists have speculated on whether these events could endanger airliners or returning spacecraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A study conducted 10 years ago for NASA found that there is a 1-in-100 chance that a space shuttle could fly through a sprite, although it concluded that the consequences of such an event were unclear. And in 1989, an upper- atmospheric electrical strike &#34;shot down&#34; a high-altitude NASA balloon 129,000 feet over Dallas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NASA officials have said they are looking for a &#34;missing link&#34; to explain the shuttle&#39;s breakup that killed seven astronauts Saturday, and they are downplaying the theory that foam insulation falling from the shuttle&#39;s extra tank may have contributed to the shuttle&#39;s demise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The little-known infrasound project at the Environmental Technology Laboratory operates a network of sophisticated electronic ears that can pick up subaudible thuds of waves crashing on either coast of the United States and the hiss of meteors and spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere thousands of miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sound waves of this nature are called &#34;infrasonic&#34; and are below the range of human hearing but travel unimpeded for extraordinary distances. Arrays of infrasonic sensors in the high Colorado plains east of Boulder recently have been looking for the crackle of the ghostly electromagnetic events in the Earth&#39;s upper atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We basically detect events at very long ranges,&#34; Bedard said. But he stressed that it was too early to draw any conclusions from sounds of the shuttle re-entry. Bedard said the acoustic sensors had previously detected the re-entry of a space shuttle from Northwest Canada to the Kennedy Space Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CELESTIAL THUNDERCLAP Originally, it was thought that the electrical charges in the thin atmosphere 50 miles above Earth were too dispersed to create infrasound. But Los Alamos National Laboratories physicist Mark Stanley said that, on closer inspection, &#34;we&#39;ve seen very strong ionization in sprites&#34; indicating that there were enough air molecules ionized to cause heating and an accompanying pulse -- a celestial thunderclap, as it were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NASA administrators confirmed Thursday that the photograph, taken from Bernal Heights in San Francisco by an amateur astronomer, is being evaluated by Columbia crash investigators. However, Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore told reporters at a Houston news briefing that right now NASA is trying only to verify &#34;the validity&#34; of the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The astronomer, who has asked that his name not be used, has declined to release the digital image to the media. But earlier in the week, he permitted Chronicle reporters to view the image and invited one to his home Tuesday evening, when the camera, and a disk of the image, were turned over to former shuttle astronaut Tammy Jernigan for transit to Houston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The image was also e-mailed Tuesday evening to Ralph Roe Jr., chief engineer for the shuttle program at Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dittemore would not say during the news conference whether NASA has ruled in or ruled out one possible explanation for the photo: that the image could have been caused by jiggling of the camera. It was a Nikon M-880 mounted on a tripod. The automatically timed exposure of four to six seconds was triggered by finger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We have to validate whether it is real,&#34; Dittemore said. &#34;This particular one is no different from the others. . . . It has yet to be determined whether this is important to us or not.&#34; SEEKING EVIDENCE NASA officials have stressed the importance of photographic, video or debris evidence from the earliest moments of the shuttle&#39;s distress, which sensors indicate began at about 5:53 a.m. above California. That&#39;s when sensors in a wheel well blinked out, in the words of NASA investigators, &#34;as if someone cut a wire.&#34; That is also roughly the time during which the amateur photographer snapped his image of Columbia as it streaked across the sky north of San Francisco. A precise time may be mapped by matching the photo and the strange electrical signature to the crisp background field of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Physicists have long jokingly referred to the lower reaches of the ionosphere -- which fluctuates in height around 40 miles -- as the &#34;ignorosphere,&#34; due to the lack of understanding of this mysterious realm of rarefied air and charged electric particles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The family of &#34;transient&#34; electrical effects occupy this part of the sky, including sprites, which leap from the ionosphere to the tops of thunderheads, and blue jets, which leap from thunderhead anvils to the ionosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Streamers of static electricity can travel these realms at speeds 100 times that of ground lightning, or 20 million miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten years ago, Walter Lyons, a consultant with FMA Research Inc. in Fort Collins, Colo., conducted a study of sprite danger for NASA. &#34;We concluded that there is about 1 chance in 100 that a shuttle could fly through a sprite. What impact, we didn&#39;t know for certain. It didn&#39;t appear at this time that the energy would be enough to cause problems.&#34; But Lyons conceded that the &#34;ignorosphere&#34; is a mysterious place that has yielded startling surprises. &#34;Since then, with research on electrical streamers, the discovery of blue jets, the doubt has gone up,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;There are other things up there that we probably don&#39;t know about,&#34; Lyons said. &#34;Every time we look in that part of the atmosphere, we find something totally new.&#34; LACK OF RESEARCH FUNDING But the field is dominated by a small club of electrophysicists who have seen their money for research dry up. Ironically, an experiment of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, aboard the doomed Columbia, was among the last fully funded work conducted on sprites. Lyons, considered to be one of the leading authorities, said he played a role in the design of the experiment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To date, sprites have required the presence of a significant electrical storm on the ground. As the shuttle passed over Northern California, there were some heavy rain showers in the far north of the state, but none of the wild weather normally associated with sprites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hearing a description of the purplish, luminous corkscrew in the San Francisco photograph, Lyons said, &#34;This was not a sprite event . . . but maybe it is another electrical phenomenon we don&#39;t know about.&#34; Whether or not an electrical discharge might be involved in the demise of Columbia, there is precedent for an event like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Scientists have observed interaction between a blue jet and a meteor. And in December 1999, Los Alamos National Laboratories researcher David Suszcynsky and colleagues, including Lyons, published an account of a meteor that apparently triggered a sprite. Their account is published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;It was a singular observation that had us all scratching our heads,&#34; said Lyons. In the strange world of sprite and elf research, scientists have documented one event in which some sort of high atmospheric event &#34;shot down&#34; a high-altitude balloon over Dallas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 5, 1989, before the first sprite was ever photographed, a NASA balloon carrying a heavy pack of instruments suffered &#34;an uncommanded payload release&#34; at 129,000 feet, according to Lyons. It landed in an angry Dallas resident&#39;s front yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Investigators found scorch marks on the debris and considered it one of the first bits of solid evidence that sprites exist. As a result of the accident, NASA no longer flies balloons over thunderstorms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ironically, the balloon was launched from a NASA facility in Palestine, Texas, one of the towns where debris from the space shuttle Columbia fell Saturday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> E-mail Sabin Russell at srussell@sfchronicle.com<n>
2/1/03 05:45|Eldridge|CA|Fireball|1-2 minutes|Large slow moving ball of fire.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90822.html|261|ndxe200302| large slow moving ball of fire<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of feb 1st 2003 at approximately 05:45hrs, i stepped outside of the building i was working in, to smoke a cigarette. It was still dark outside. I saw a large tumbling ball of fire slowly pass overhead, travelling a northeasterly direction. Though I could not determine its trajectory, I had the feeling that it was falling and would probably hit the earth no more than 20 to 40 miles from where i was standing. I measured the fireball by holding my arms straight out as if i were cradling the object in my open hands. My hands were approximatly 18 inches apart.  As it passed overhead it never made a sound. I ran into the building to alert a co-worker who took a few minutes gathering her things. By the time we exited the building, day had broke, the fireball was gone and there was no trace of it, no trail of smoke, nothing. I know of two other people who witnessed this same event. What I remember most about the event was 1). The fireball appeared to b! e very large, 2). The fireball drifted across the sky very slowly, 3). The fireball was completely silent and 4). The fireball fell from the sky at the same time that the space shuttle columbia was reentering earths atmosphere. Freinds of mine suggested that perhaps i had seen peices of the space shuttle however the fireball I saw was bigger than a space shuttle. It wasnt until Columbia was somewhere over Nevada that it began to disintegrate and moments before it exploded into unrecognizable debris, columbia still maintained the outlineof a &amp;quot;plane&amp;quot; with a nose and fuseladge etc. what I saw was competely engulfed in flames and did not resemble a &amp;quot;plane&amp;quot; at all. Whatever it was was tumbling out of control with no appreciable form that i could discern<n>

I looked at this one in particular, then it started to move.  It moved like a fruit fly.  Hoovering around.  I knew it couldn&#39;t be a plane because it would also stay in one spot then sway around.  The Physical desciption liked like light but it was oddd.  it looked like a crystal that someone was holding a flashlight behind, it shined in that way.  the body of the (craft)?  looked to be as big as a star but the crystal like shining surrounding it extended maybe six star lengths around it in all directions.  I just saw it right before i am writing this.  It freaked me out.<n>

It was changing colors red, green, orange colors.  It was about maybe 1000 ft in the sky.  I was directly under it when it was flying, it was a sloppy figure pattern.  I was the only one on the road driving a 18 wheeler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving eastbound on US 90 ,could see something that looked like a star didn&#39;t pay to much attention to it.   When I got closer could see it was moving in a figure 8 pattern changing different colors.   Then I was directly under it no was on the road used the restroom on the side of the road looked at for about 5 minutes while it did the figure 8 pattern.   Didn&#39;t want it to come down jumped in my truck and drove away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
2/1/03 00:45|Penang (Malaysia)||Light|0.5 hours|12 Objects With Yellow Light At 12:45 a.m.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27423.html|264|ndxe200302| 12 Objects With Yellow Light At 12:45 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I live in an apartment building. It was around 12:45 am on Saturday morning (1st February 03). I was surfing the net when suddenly it was blackout (Note: I don&#39;t think the blackout had anything to do with the sighting though). To enjoy a little fresh air, I went to the balcony. I gazed towards the dark sky. The night was without stars. Then I noticed a few objects with yellow-redish color lights in the sky. There were 5 or 6 of them moving very slowly and almost static. I woke my wife up to also see the event. When we were back to the balcony, more of the same objects appeared. The final count were 12 in numbers. The objects moved slowly from right to the left and they stop around an area for a while (about 10-15 minutes) before slowly disappearing. At the time of the night, I don&#39;t think the objects are commercial flights or air-force flights. It was very late at night. Maybe they are UFO&#39;s? I&#39;m attaching the sketch of what I observed in the e-mail titled &#34;UFO sighting from Malaysia&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see illustration that accompanies this report.

They moved slowly across the sky 1 minute apart of each other. Two of them were flying closer to each other while the rest were further away. One by one they disappeared into the western sky.<n>
2/1/03 00:35|Burbank|CA|Fireball|10 secs|3rd sighting of fireballs over So Cal skies|3/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27498.html|266|ndxe200302| 3rd sighting of fireballs over So Cal skies<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was now the 3rd sighting we had seen in the month of january. We also saw one on January 25th @ approximately 12:35 am moving from Northeast to Southwest. It was also shooting off flares as it moved very quickly before it disappeared. I haven&#39;t heard any sound from any of the crafts. At first I thought it was possibly military, but after reviewing many of the recent reports, I&#39;m no longer convinced that is the case. My first sighting, the objects were in a fixed part of the sky, not traveling anywhere. The subsequent sightings were in an entirely different part of the sky and clearly traveling. I recorded about a minute of video my first sighting but have not been able to recorded the others. The latest sighting it appeared to be moving away from us to the north, and also shot flares downward before disappearing. I would really appreciate a response if you could.<n>
2/1/03||||Space Shuttle re-entry|UFO(s) in proximity to space shuttle Columbia|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27791.html|267|ndxe200302| UFO(s) in proximity to space shuttle Columbia<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above is NONE APPLICABLE as I experienced this sighting on TV coverage of the Columbia disaster. The disaster happened over Texas, I live in Massachusetts where I watched repeated video footage filmed about an hour earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This coverage was repeated several times while some spokesperson got their act together enough to say something. So I had ample time to study the video footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went channel surfing and got a channel that was showing the same footage as I was previously watching; BUT, this footage showed about five seconds more coverage at the beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With this earlier coverage I saw the smoking space craft travel past a disc shaped object whose diameter was about 3/4 the width of the contrail the shuttle was leaving in it&#39;s wake. The lighting of this object wasn&#39;t quite as bright as the shuttle and contrail. This appeared to the far right of my TV screen and the shuttle at this time wasn&#39;t appearing to be breaking apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared below the contrail and would have been obscured if the network logo was being displayed at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The camera operator was apparently focused on the shuttle tracking it&#39;s flight trying to keep the subject centered in midscreen. Therefore the UFO disappeared off to the right of the screen as though it had no motion at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later I saw another UFO in close proximity to Columbia. This footage was reputed to have been videotaped in Nevada by an Air Force camera and the pre-dawn sky was darker in comparison to the footage shot over Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Air Force release I saw two brilliant spots of diffused light seperated from one-another. The light on the right traveling left toward the second light was leaving a contrail. The light on the left stayed stationary and the light on the right appeared to be on a collision. The camera operator went to wide lens and continued the coverage then when collision seemed imminent; coverage ceased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No mention was made of this bizarre display and neither scene has been shown since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That makes two UFO&#39;s I&#39;ve seen in proximity to the shuttle Columbia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through my connections I&#39;ve heard that six others have experienced similiar sightings.<n>
