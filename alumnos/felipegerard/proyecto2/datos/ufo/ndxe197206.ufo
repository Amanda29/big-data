One of them had a Radio,and Reports started coming,and the Announcer was laughing it off.My Sister and Brother in Law would know the Year,both are close to my Age,and they remember well.It was the eeriest Feeling all of us had ever experienced,as we stood there and watched the huge,silent Object slowly descent unto Farmland.It was a dark silver,metallic looking Disk,with rotating Lights of different Colors,red and Orange,when it got close to the Ground,there was like a humming Noise coming from the Craft.It could not possibly be a Plane,as Conway had no Airport,it&#39;s just a small Country Town,on the Eastern Seaboard.All man made Possibilities were out,that much we knew.I never saw anything like this before, or ever again.We all agreed to keep silent about what we saw,for Fear of Ridicule.I need to add,that a Farmer reported an Area in his Field burned,and nothing would grow on it again.My Sister and I recently talked about it,and we know that what we saw was not of this Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that it is way to late to investigate,but I want someone to know it happened,and I wish there was a way to find out just how many others saw what we did,and that Field were it landed had to be radioactive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I remember begin confused then dumbfounded by three seemingly connected but not, florescent orange boomerang shape lights that would flash (seemingly) randomly in the south western sky.  This continued until we were too far and or the tree line blocked my view.   Maybe about 3 mins. or so.   It didn&#39;t stop or disappear, so it probably lasted longer.   Wish I had said something now, wish I had gotten Mom to stop the car.   We were in SE Guilford county just off of I-85/I-40 near what is now Lucent Technologies, but at the time was AT&amp;T.  I know I was a kid (around 11 or 12), but I will never forget it and I also have always had a very vivid knowledge of the geography of the Greensboro area so I am 100% on where it was.  I didn&#39;t mention it to my Mom at the time because well, like I said, I didn&#39;t! want to be there with her anyways so I kept this wild thing to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Location was near the Hutsonville Power Plant. I was out in a car with my boyfriend on a dark country road. I hate to admit it but yes,parking. We heard a low pitch humming noise and looked out the back window of the car to locate the noise and saw a series of very bright lights. I believe they were just white but that detail is not clear to me now. The craft which was disk shaped was either on the ground or hovering very close to it. We both watched the craft rise up off the ground 20 feet or so and lower. It then rose up vertically above the trees and then took off in a diagonal path across the sky with spectacular speed. Needless to say we were scared to death and as he drove to get out of there I followed the bright light in the sky scared to death it would follow us....it did not. When we made it back in town we met up with a group of friends and told of our sighting. We were  believed and told that others had seen bright lights around the power plant before. Scary experience and I totally believe!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was at a tilted angle, not horizontal or vertical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been stopped at a rest area when first seen.   When we left the rest area the object paralleled our car all the way into Ft. Stockton, TX.  We were traveling at 55 mph.  This was in bright daylight in perfectly clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we came into Ft. Stockton we noticed two fighter jets approaching.  The object went into the only cloud in the sky. The jets also entered the cloud and appeared to search the area for about 10 minutes.  I watched the search and cloud while my father entered a store to do his sales call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the jets left the area the barrel shaped object came out of the cloud.   As we continued out of town on I-10 the object started to veer off to our left.

The objects came toward me and took me into the spaceship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I don’t remember what happened.

Later I found out it was transmission problem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A spaceship one occupant looking forward pulled next to me and thought to me did not speak, did I need help.  He faced forward and did not look directly at me but I understood him perfectly.  I am thinking yes but so scared I think no.  I was petrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He did not look directly at me, but head big and I felt he would help me anyway.  He went very fast  away after hovering next to me for what seemed like long time but I would guess a minute.  I have forever been changed by this event.  In so many ways. I should not have made it to Kentucky, but somehow I was assisted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ship was small, oval , egg shaped on top.  The top was clear and I could see occupant, head.

The first time I was nine years old. I had the habit of getting up very early in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One morning I got up around 5 a.m., I believe, looked out our picture window and saw it. It was a large round silver craft flying very low and slow. It had no windows or lights.  Needless to say, I went back to bed very quickly!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time I was thirty years old and had my young daughter with me. She did not see the craft for some unknown reason.  I had just gotten off work and was sitting in my car in the turnoff lane to go to McDonalds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This day it was nearly 12 noon.  On the right side of the highway there is a bank with a ridge of trees.  The same type craft, large, round and silver suddenly appeared over those trees.  Once again, it had no lights or windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped right nearly directly over my car and hovered sort of like a helicopter and then it took off very fast!  I thought that I would see it as I headed home.  You know how fast a jet moves, even when it is flying very low?   This thing had to have been AT LEAST 1000 times faster!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t see it on the way home, nor did I ever hear anyone else say they had seen anything strange in town that day around noon.<n>

I was about 24 years old then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my two babies sleeping in the back seat as I was driving home from Sacramento very late. At that time I was the only one on the road. This road was Hwy 780. It cuts off from 80 to 680.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no lights along that road. To my right there was a cut away in the hill so that I couldn&#39;t see to my right. On the left was a very large marshy meadow. In the distance were many homes. It is impossible to see the homes in the dark from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving along suddenly the sky from above me lite up like it was flood lights right on me (almost like daylight). It really startled me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to see where it was coming from and finally saw this huge ball of fire about 50&#39; above moving horizonally over my head from my right to my left and out across the meadow lighting up everything in its wake.

6/30/72|Loomis & Folsom Lake|CA|Unknown|Summer of 1972|In the summer of 1972 my family and I witnessed many UFO sightings above and around Folsom Lake, California.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59743.html|20|ndxe197206| In the summer of 1972 my family and I witnessed many UFO sightings above and around Folsom Lake, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 59 years of age now and my two brothers and three sisters still talk about the spring and summer of 1972.  I was 23 years old then and my older sister lived on three acres, less than two miles from Folsom Lake.  The area she lived in at that time was very wooded and remote.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many evenings and well into the early morning hours she would phone either me or one of my brothers, excited or even frightened over what she was seeing in her pasture or in the nearby fields.  Her horses became restless, dogs barking, and upon looking out from her large living-room window she would see one or more orange objects often glowing bright and then dimming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon her phone calls, my two brothers and I would drive out to her house, often during the middle of the night.  Many times we would see the objects before arriving at her house.  There is simply too much to relate in this posting, but I will say that what we witnessed during those spring and summer nights of 1972 were without question neither airplanes nor helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove our parents out there on a few occasions and they too were completely baffled as to what these objects were.  There were never any sounds coming from the objects.  Among a host of reports I could now relate, I will focus upon my two most memorable sightings:  1) Standing outside of our car at the edge of Folsom Lake and observing one or more bright orange objects moving erratically then pausing and hovering motionlessly without a sound.  One such object actually shot a high beam or light directly onto the water.  It was a very dark moonless night and I remember that we spoke of how easily we could see the ripples of the lake water once the beam of light penetrated the lake.  It was so strange since there was absolutely no sound coming from the object.  These objects maneuvered, as I say, erratically, often pausing, disappearing, and reappearing almost instantly in another location.  At times they would seem to fall and rock from side to side reminding me of a lightweight falling feather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) On another memorable occasion we (my brothers and I) drove back out to the Folsom area after receiving a phone call from my sister.  This time we were parked atop a bluff on Sierra College Blvd.  We witnessed several bright orange objects in the distance.  I cannot make any estimates as to how far they were or how high they were; all I can say is that they appeared to be about the size of goftballs from where we were.  I recall how truly amazed we were as we witnessed six or seven smaller objects slowly moving toward a large orange object.  It appeared to us that as each smaller object neared the larger one they actually disappeared, as if they entered the large object.  Not saying that they actually entered the large object, but this is the appearance they gave.  As the last smaller object entered or disappeared, suddenly all six or seven smaller objects would reappear and begin the entire process over again.  We watched this phenomena repeat itself for nearly an hour as I recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could write several pages on all of the UFO activity that we witnessed in and around Loomis and Folsom Lake during that particular summer long ago.  To my knowledge nothing of that magnitude has ever occurred there since that time.  No members of my family have ever reported it until now, 35 years later.  During that summer we read absolutely nothing in the newspapers of these mysterious orange glowing lights over Folsom Lake.  What we saw was certainly not ball lightning, aircraft, swamp gas, meteors, or anything that is easily explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The UFO was sighted whilst hovering at tree top level in a dense forest.  According to witnesses the UFO kept on changing colours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The police officers who visited the scene, saw the UFO.  One officer fired several shots at the object. The farm owner also fired shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whilst being shot at the UFO stopped changing colours and remained a darkish gun-metal colour.  It kept on disappearing behind the tree tops and reappeared.  The colour changed to greyish white before it dissappeared.  All together fifteen shots were fired at the object.  To my knowledge this is the only incident where members of a police force fired shots at a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was reported in several newspapers and books.  Investigaters from the space agency in USA visited the town several months later and interviewed all those who witnessed the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The farm owner is still residing in Fort Beaufort where he owns a hotel.  The two police officers are both now retired.  These gentlemen are getting on in their years and if anyone wants to follow up on this incident they should do so now while the witnesses are still alive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working in Fort Beaufort at the time of the sighting and did not personally witness the incident.  I did however saw all the journalists and investigaters who arrived in the town the following day.<n>

After her initial shock and upon regaining her composure she attempted to further describe what she saw and what course of action the object she viewed had done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the best of my recollection and again the following is admittedly classified third-hand information, she advised my father that what she saw was rather long 2 - 300 feet in length.  She also stated that it travelled from the South to the North and from her perspective, likely directly over the Hudson River which is approximately one half a mile East of her home, in North Albany about 3/4 of a mile from Albany&#39;s boundry line with Menands, New York to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately every family member from that generation has passed and therefore I am unable to secure any more info.  I believe, dozens or more other people also saw the object, however as of this writing, I haven&#39;t attempted to confirm this information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If  one reading this report recalls this event, please file a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

The night was clear and warm, we were enjoying the beginning of summer. As we were sitting on the porch, we heard a humming sound. All three of us looked up and saw a saucer shaped craft hovering above a lamp post. It hovered for a few minutes, then it started to move away at a slow pace. My brothers and I proceeded to follow it, going up a side street by our house. We followed it all the way to a school (# 3) by our home. It landed on the roof of the school, then disappeared. My brothers and myself were back in front of the house, without knowing how we got there. To this very day I cannot remember how we got there. One of my brothers has since passed away, the other brother has been diagnosed with epilepsy. I have been diagnosed with lupus. Is this conincidence, or did something unexplainable happen to us that night? I continue to have vivid dreams of UFO&#39;s, cornfields, airplanes, and the like all the time. I watch the Sightings regularly, in hopes of finding someone who has experienced something similar to what my brothers and myself did. I have seen people on the program describing their experiences, and it sounds like they are living my life. It is a very eerie feeling. I want to find out what happened to the lost time, and how we got back home. I am 45 years old now, and it is still a mystery that i cannot let go of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The only sound, was a soft humming.  Suddenly, from somewhere on the craft, a beam of light shot out and directly onto my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1972, June. I was working the second shift in the local hospital in Sharon Ct. My mother who lived in Sharon was babysitting for my 5 month old son.  I left the hospital around 11:30, stopping at my mothers to pick my son up and her (she was coming to my home to spend the night). We left her house around 11:40pm enroute to my home in Millerton N.Y.. The night sky was very clear, staars in abundance.  A beautiful summer night.  The flashing lights of what we thought was an airplane caught our eye.  It was at a very high altitude, almost appeared that it was another star except for the colored lights, (blue, red, green)..To our horror, it started to &#34;fall&#34; from the sky at a tremendous rate of speed...I stopped my car and with my hands over my ears ( didn&#39;t want to hear the noise when it impacted against the ground)..watched as it plummeted toward us.  Then, right before our eyes, it stopped, just over the trees not 50 feet from our car. We were terrified, with my hands shaking I watched in shear fright as it hovered above the trees.  It was a saucer shape, metallic gray in color, with a dome that had what appeared to be rows of windows.  It was so close that both my mother and I could see inside.  What we saw will forever remain in my our memories!  They were not human!  Four or five beings with a grayish skin tone, and huge black eyes looked out at us.  Suddenly from somewhere on the craft a beam of brilliant, blue-white light, struck our car...this beam of light was so bright that it &#34;hurt&#34; our eyes, for about 15 seconds this light remained on my car and then suddenly it imploded back into the craft. Slowly the craft began to move directly over the car.  The only sound it made was a very soft humming.  I was absolutley terrified, my only thought at that time was to get my infant son home where we would be safe ?  I took my foot from the brake and proceeded to drive.  The craft remained at the same altitude and drifted just  about 100 feet ahead of me.  The road that I was on was a secondary road that joined with a major rt.  I intersected rt. 22 and began my 10 min. drive from there to my home.  The craft remained ahead of me at the same distance and altitude until I turned off 22 onto MaGhee Hill Rd., where I lived.  When I arrived at my house my mother and I could still the hummi! ng from the craft as it continued going north, above rt. 22.  The next day on the 12:00 news there was a brief report of &#34; a UFO &#34; sighting  in the city of Albany N.Y. about 50 miles from Millerton.  This sighting had been reported by two N.Y. state troopers !  It was seen about two hours after I had seen it.  They described the craft exactly as I did, same lights, speed, color, and &#34;it made a humming&#34; noise.  To get to Albany from Millerton one would drive north, on rt. 22.  I have always believed that this craft seen in Albany was the same one that I had seen two hours earlier as I drove home. This was my first sighting of a UFO, but it has not been the only sighting I have had.  Since that time I have had six or seven additional sightings. They have been different shapes, triangle, cigar..saucers.  There is no doubt in my mind that we are not alone here on this planet and we have not been for many thousands of years.  The technology behind the crafts I have seen, was and still is far to advanced for our world.<n>

It was night and my brother was outside trying to shoot bats with a shot gun when we heard him yell for us to come out, we could tell by his voice some thing was wrong.  it was dark with scattered cloud cover their was a bright moon back lighting the clouds. through the clouds we saw a cigar shaped object flying through the sky. it was just over the tops of the trees 25 to 30 feet in the air, it was silver in color with soft yellowish colored windows. their was no visable engines as in a plane, or jet, some type of landing system protruded from the sides, they seamed to be some type of pods like that of the lunar lander. their was no sound at all,  it disapeared flying to the south, south west.  the speed was not fast at all about 5 to 10 miles an hour.  the lenghth was aprox. 30 to 40 feet in length and 8 feet in diameter my mother, father, brother and myself witnessed this. my brother and I are the only ones alive...<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few nights later we all were watching TV and since we lived out in the boonies my dad would go out side to take a leak.  on this night he did his usual thing but when he returned he grabed my brother, the 50 cal. flintlock told my brother to grab the 12 gauge shot gun.  my mother and I followed them out to the porch where my father told us to stay.  about 100 to 125 yards away was the woods, these woods went on for miles before another house was seen.  up in the trees were glowing eyes, hundreds of eyes, or we think they were.  they say thay oposums eyes will give off a glow or reflection.  so thats what we figured they were.  my dad and brother walked up close to the woods but did not go in, they could not tell what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the next night we were a sleep except my father he was watching TV and went outside to go take a leak.  I remember him waking up my brother and again grabing some fire armes.  looking out my bed room window with my mother about 50 yards away was a row of peach trees and some out buildings ( a shed and a garage ) there were 3 sets of eyes, larger than the ones we saw the previous night.  where they were we had some rubarb plants growing so they must have been about 3 feet off the ground.  they were grouped close together about 4 feet from start to finish.  my father pulled the truck up into the yard just pass a stone wall that divied the driveway from the yard.  he turned the lights on high beam to try to see what they were, but they werent bright enough.  he started to walk twards them and my mother yeld at him to stay back.  he stayed back by the truck for a while when I saw him and my brother take aim at them I could see the flash from the 50 cal. flintlock and the flash from the shot gun.  both my father and my brother were good shots from hunting. the eyes never moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my father stayed out as long as he could, he did not shoot any more. we tryed to stay awake but we could not, in the morning they were gone...<n> <n><n> <n><n> the next night the same thing except they were on the stone wall.  I was awaken by my father screaming to my brother to get down stairs.  my father and my brother unloaded allmost every rifle we had... 44 mag. rifle, 12 gauge shot gun, 45 cal. cap and ball revolver, 222 rifle, 50 cal. flintlock.  how ever many bullets these would hold is what they shot. the final gun my father reloaded the 45 cal. cap and ball and walked up to them point blank and fired directly into one of the eyes or where the body should be... they never moved.  for all the shells we picked up the next day their was not a stray divit in the ground, no sign that any thing took place.  that was the last we saw of the eyes<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Triangular-Rounded Edges-Very Black-Rimmed evenly with small lights and unevenly on its underside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im only reporting this because on the front page of your web-site... a sighting(Triangular Object...) reported by a witness in San Diego California(apr 27,2001/23:00pm) was almost exactly the experience that i had!.  (Story): A school friend and i camped outside(after the last day of high-school exams) in the backyard at his parents place...my friend was listening to a recorded tape of a football game from the previous afternoon.  I didn&#39;t care to listen to it so i positioned myself so that half of me was outside the tent(laying down on my back). I folded my hands behind my head and looked upward&#39;s into the clear night sky to look at the stars(amazingly... at that time in Edmonton... one could still see the stars at night).  After a short while(30 to 60 minutes)... i saw something very odd and striking directly above me... very high in the sky. It was very Black...very clearly Triangular...with rounded edges, not sharp or pointed edges. Because i could make out evenly spaced lights all around the triangular circumference of the object, i could see that it had rounded edges... and interspersed within its shape was a limited assortement of lights with no pattern or organization. All the lights were white(no-colors)...and perhap&#39;s a little less brighter than the star-light( it blended almost perfectly into the black starry sky).  Like the other witness said... if he hadn&#39;t been directly looking at that exact position in the sky he probably would have missed it...this was the same for me... i was afraid that if i took my eyes off of it... that i might lose sight of it( the lights of the ship blended with the stars making it hard to see). It indeed was stealthy and hard to keep track of visually. It was without any sound at all!. At that moment my friend&#39;s dog which was inside the tent with him went absolutelely berserk...barking like mad...(the dog was quiet all evening)...I quickley got up off the ground to stand up to track it as it moved at a startling speed(no jet travels that fast...ever!) from the ! north-we st to the south-east in a straight line towards the horizion where the very 1st indications of the next morning&#39;s sunrise glow was just barely dicernable. As i got up i had only enough time to call out my friend&#39;s name 3-4 times to get him to come out of the tent to see the object with me before it was gone altogether!. He didn&#39;t even have a chance to come out... this whole scenario was over with in less than 10 second&#39;s... his dog returned to his normal quiet self!. Correctly or Incorrectly i evaluated this object as being very large... i thought that it must be approximately a half a mile to a mile long... it did not look like it was small at all!. At this moment i would not care to be contacted by phone... however E-mail would be alright with me.<n>

The incident happened about 32 years ago, I have never made a report like this because I didn&#39;t think it really mattered.  But because it was very interesting I thought you would like to hear about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident happened after my mom picked me and my friends up from school.  We went to school in Agura, California, so my mom would drive through the Santa Monica mountains to get to our home in the Los Angeles basin.  This time she decided to take a rest at one of the look-outs along the mountainous coastline.  What I remember is my mom pointing up to the sky and gasping at the brite light&#39;s over the ocean.  It was really incredible to see these brite lights just sitting there not moving.  It was a site to see.  The form they took at first was just kind of spread out, and I&#39;m not that sure how many there were, just that there were a lot of them.  Then with a blink of an eye all but one darted off into outerspace!!  Then they came back slowly and all of them merged with the single one that had just stayed there not moving.  My mom commented that the single one must be the mother ship.  She felt a calm feeling and that they were telepathically communicating with her. Also I was feeling very nauseous and under the weather.  But even though I felt sick I was overcome by a wonderful feeling.  As we witnessed these bright lights merging then they seperated again very slowly.  Then again in the blink of an eye they were gone.  The one distinct thing about these lights were that they were very bright white lights.  Everyone with us felt like they were putting on a show just for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was pulled from the cab of my truck. Bright light all around. Max of 8 shapes around me. I fought for a pistol under my seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As ststed above I was driving truck, got real sleepy all of a sudden. Pulled my truck over and layed across the full seat. It was as if only a few min. went by. all of at once the cab of the truck filled with a very bright light. I kept a pistol under my seat because I carried a valuble cargo. ( McIntosh Stereo Equipment) I strained very hard to reach it but was moving in very slow motion. One strange thing to all this is my eyes would not open no matter how hared I tried. This seems like it just happened to me no matter when I think of this or tell some one it never changes its always the same. There were at least 8 figures outside the trck looking in. Next thing Iremeber is having the same figures around me on some type of flate surface. I still kept fighting to open my eyes, but couldn&#39;t. I dont have anyother remberance of that the moment. For several years after tha I would get a burning in the back of my head. It stopped for a long time then once in 1990 it came back for about a week and then it was gone. This all happened over25 years ago but it still is on my mind. I was your web page and thought it was time to tell it to some one that might take it seriously. The one real noticible change to me is after that had happened I am very emotional and cant seem to get a handle on it at all. Thanks for your time. If you think this is more than a dream let me know. most I&#39;ve told thinks tharts all it is.<n>

Going south out of Provo, Utah on a 2 lane highway. Notice a strange, bright cloud up off my right front. Seemed close, maybe 1/8 to 1/4 mile. It seemed to tag along for sevetal miles and I started to take more and more interest. All of a sudden this thing takes off, turning into a perfect silver saucer. I couldn&#39;t believe it! When I came to my senses I got my camera out of the glovebox and started shooting in the direction of the craft, still driving. The saucer zipped across the desert and way to the west I could see the late day sun glint off the object as it now hovered over mountains in the distance. When my pictures were developed I only had one photo with a glared fuzzy object in it. I am currently looking for someone with digital enhancement equip. to look at it. Now for the final words. I know what I saw.<n>
6/15/72 22:00|Lowell|OH|Other|15 min.?|one incredibly large, silent  luminous vessel hovering like a large shallow soup bowl inverted over another of the same size and shapec|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30703.html|32|ndxe197206| one incredibly large, silent  luminous vessel hovering like a large shallow soup bowl inverted over another of the same size and shapec<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm evening--spring or fall.  The fog was so heavy as I traveled the gravel road from town to our country home that I had to open the window and drive using the ditch to my left as my guide.  I drove this road for five miles beside the river; then I made a 90-degree turn to the left, away from the river, but still with heavy fog.  A minute or so later I turned right into our lane and drove to the end of it, making nearly a 90-degree turn to the left, away from the corn field that was on my right. As I had driven the long stretch of the lane, on my left were railroad tracks, a narrow corn field, and then a ridge. The distance to the ridge was maybe a football field&#39;s length. I parked the car, got out, and started toward the house.  Something caught my attention.  I looked toward the lane I had just traveled and saw a luminous object hovering above the field.  It was maybe 50 yards from me.  Because nothing was near it, I have only a guess as to how big it really was and how high it was from the ground.  I think it was as big as a football field and 30 to 40 feet above the ground.  I heard no sound.  There was not even a breeze.  But the fog had cleared. What amazed me the most was that there was no sign of motion.  It appeared to be glowing metal.  It&#39;s shape was of a shallow, large soup bowl inverted over another large soup bowl the same size and shape, joined by a strip of the same substance such that it was perpendicular to the rims of the two bowls.  This joining strip had what appeared to be rectangular windows in it.  I don&#39;t remember whether they were horizontal or vertical.  I do remember that their shape was distinct--no blurring.  I wondered whether these really were windows and someone was looking at me as I looked at the UFO or whether these were energy sites.  They did have a different &#34;glow&#34; from the UFO, as though a light were behind them.  Nowhere could I see any opening or any notable feature.  As I stood riveted, it suddenly both rose and sped away to my right-! -at about a 45 degree angle to the field. It&#39;s disappearance took only a fraction of a second. Because I had no kind of drug in my system nor was I tired, I believe what I saw was real.  I went back the next day to see whether the ground below it showed any signs of heat or of radiation burns.  Nothing looked unusual.  I want to add that the area where I saw it was a path for low-flight jet maneuvers over the river, from a ridge on one side to a ridge on the other.  These jets were from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to submit an illustration of the object, which we may post.

I finally stopped the car and got our. I watched these objects hover, and as they did move they did not lose their distancce apart. but moved in a line from west to east, as I watched I noticed to the right that three more of them just appeared, as they seem to have come in a straight line toward me til I saw   them, as the threw stationed themselvess to the west of the others they then all seemed to just back up and thier lights just faded as they took flight backwards. I was left in a daze of fear and disbelief. I as with many others have been afraid to tell this to anyone other than my mother and now my children and husband....... I have often thought of being regressed to that time to see what all that I might reveal, because it seemed I lost time.....<n>

I was 20 years old at the time, home for summer after my sophomore year at UNC-CH. Considering the time period, it is important to note that I did not use drugs and drank very rarely.   We lived in the semi-country, about 1.5 miles from the Greensboro Airport.   I had just walked into the edge of the woods  to burn our trash in the burn-barrel.  As I came out of the woods, I saw a disk with a diameter of about 20 feet silently rotating just off my right side.  It was 30 to 40 feet off the ground and had alternating flat red and white lighted panels around its sides.  I stood there literally frozen for at least a minute watching the red and white lights as they slowly and silently rotated.  My German Shepherd sat down transfixed.  When I had the wherewithal to return to the house, I had to call him several times to come with me.  I went inside to call my father (no one was at home at the time), and my dog remained on the back porch steps, still transfixed.  Several minutes later when I went back outside, the disk had disappeared.  My dog, an excellent watchdog, never barked once. I can still vividly recall that night.  There is no doubt in my mind what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date.  PD))<n>

While lying on the floor, she pointed to the outside.  Thinking some bullies chased her, I went outside on our corner lot to take a look and then I saw it too, coming over the field near our house.  It was a huge black cigar-shaped ship the length of a football field and it slowly, very slowly hovered just above the tree tops.  It came right over the other houses and then it stopped right over our house.  I had two other sisters who saw it.  My mother came out too and saw it.  I ran to maybe four other homes and got them to come out and see this.  I was 13 at the time and very excited to know these things really did exist.  This craft just stayed there for about 1/2 hour hovering and it made a soothing humming sound.  It had some red and white lights flashing off and on the underbelly of the craft.  When it got dark out, the humming increased in pitch and frequency, then the craft slowly turned around while going upwards, turning faster and faster while it went higher and all we saw were three white lights spinning until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is sighting is approximate.

The &#34;light&#34; of each craft would vary from nearly invisible to extremely bright.  The objects were obviously many miles away, most estimates are that the objects had to have been in Huntsville and very likely above the Redstone Arsenal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Entire families and friends would gather on the back porch to watch the UFOs move in wildly varying &#34;formations&#34; if that term fits.  They would move up and down, circle one another, zoom back and forth, and generally each sighting event ended with the lights either disappearing or zooming directly up and out of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The individuals who observed the UFOs varied from a preacher, to housewives, to a retired WWII-Korea-Vietnam combat veteran (101st Airborne, winner of the Silver Star, etc.), and several then-enlisted Army and National Guard members.  These individuals were all very serious people who did not care for watching science fiction films, reading about UFOs, or even speculating about life on other planets.  These individuals would all be willing to testify under oath that what they observed were NOT airplanes nor any other form of then-known/conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

So i stood there at the top of the stairs with my hands on my hips and said, &#34;Whats the matter, did you see another UFO, cause his friend had reportedly seen one the week before&#34;, so we found the binoculars in the closet and came into the living room.  All of us saw it hovering across from the neighbours backyard, a small metallic disc shaped object.  It was definitly not an airplane.  So we hopped into my brothers &#39;56 chevy and followed it along the side of the town we were in.  Then it stopped above an old farmhouse which was approximately an acre from the corner of the hospital.  We parked and watched it as it hovered above a farmhouse which had a tv antena on top.  At that point we tried to become brave and thought we would leave the vehicle.  It seemed as if it was looking at us and could hear everything on the radio as the radio stoped working while we sat there and watched.  There was a beam of light that came fell upon the house and we thought we wanted to get a closer look and were discussing this.  All of a sudden, to our horror it started moving towards us really slow.  We freaked out sat there and looked at it and it suddenly shot off as if it were completely disapearing.  My teacher and several other people had also seen a similair object, it has been in the local newspaper.  If anyone knows about this or has seen something scimilair in SouthWestern Saskatchen I would like to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My parents had decided on going on a drive as they use to quite regularly. The sun was sinking in the western sky as they drove south from the city of Van Wert,Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They usually had no agenda when they went on one of their drives. As I recall they drove south on Route 127 for a few miles and turned right on a road into  what was left of the sunset. Now they were driving on a gravel road when they came upon a T road that went to the right so they turned on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not driving back towards the city of Van Wert where they lived when they seen a jack-o-lantern type of light in a woods to their left that was probably a couple of hundred feet from where they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was in or or on the side where they could see it OK. It was about six feet above the ground and it raise to the top of the trees and then went back down again. It done this several times as mom and dad sat there and watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly their engine stopped and dad could not restart it. He open the door and got out to raise the hood when, I think, they heard a strange &#34;wrirring&#39; sound over head. Dad looked up and there was a flying saucer flying over them. You could see the &#34;saucer&#34; shape easily in the twilight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirty years or so has taken its toll on my memory so I have lost some of the details over the years, also consider that they had seen something back then, at least, you could be considered a crack po. I imagine that countless sighting are lost because of our govenments effort to deny and also ridicule someone for sauing what they seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They told me that they seen window like lights around the top of the craft. Also I think that they mentioned green and red sparks eminating from the craft. I would estimate that the craft was 50 to 75 feet above them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO stopped for a breif period of time over the woods and then it resumed its course of I would estimate at about 280 to 290 fegrees true that would take it just north of Ohio City and somewhere around Fort Wayne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I had came from South Bend to visit relatives around Van Wert and we were visiting my parents. Dad and I were talking about science and he started to tell me about something and then paused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said that they had an encounter a few months ago and were afrai to tell anybody.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, &#34;dad you know me better than that, you apparently had just seen what I have been looking for&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes I had mom and dad in my car as we heard to the site. They told me about the whole incident as we drove to the location. They should me exactly where they stopped, where the craft went over head and the direction in which it continued on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now dad and mom are both church going Christians and I can vouch for their honesty, dad only &#34;sipped&#34; but he did get high on his home brew sauercraut, Ha! They both are not with us now and I was glad that I was able to learn about their encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If all the trousands that had seen UFO before them fully convinced me then I am sure that their encounter did. And the look of fear and concern as they relayed their story left no doubt to me of its autherticity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have nevere seen a bonafide UFO, I have seen lights that I diid not know what they were but I had enough objectivity to not think that they were extraterrestrial. But my parents did see something that was not of this earth, or at our concept of this earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that the apparition that they seen was some kind of a remote drone and that the flying saucer retrieved the drone. Perhaps they witnessed a terrestrial biological android or drone after it collected specimen from the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Then I noticed more lights moving extremely quickly at right angles. Was so excited that I had my buddy look at it. Then I asked others to look also. They all saw it and I wasn&#39;t seeing things. That was the extent of it and was encouraged not to report it for fear of ridicule. Never saw anything like it again.

After several cups of coffee, I went outside to relieve myself, when I noticed a round or oblong object high in the upper atmosphere. What drew my attention to it was the extremely wide vapor trail or cloud that emanated from the object as it slowly spiraled downward in a long, wide, and very slow spiral.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aside from appearing unusual, what really fascinated me was that the vapor trail or cloud the object produced, was a pale green color and was pulsating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for approximately 10-15 minutes, when it finally just stopped.  The cloud continued to pulsate and then slowly faded from pale green to white and looked then like any other cloud in the sky. It was a full moon night and very clear. I watched the cloud then fade to nothing.  I thought it may be a satellite falling to earth after losing it&#39;s orbit, but then I feel it would have been traveling at a much greater speed once it entered earth&#39;s atmosphere.  This object was moving VERY slowly and the spiral was gradual and very wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never shared this with anyone as I was the only one to witness the object and was afraid I&#39;d be ridiculed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My 65 year old mother lived just down the road from the hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular night I finished my shift and left work at the usual time of 11:25 pm.  I drove the few minutes from the hospital to my mothers home.  I lived in the bordering state and she had babysat for my five month old son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I had made plans to have her spend the night at my home so we could go shopping the next day.  I arrived at her home around 11:30 that night, collected my son and my mom and we headed out to my home.  It was a 15 minute drive from her home to my home.  The night was extremely clear, the sky filled with bright shinning stars.  We chatted as I drove, thinking of nothing more then the shopping trip we would be making the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My normal route was a &#34;short cut&#34; driving on mostly secondary roads with very few houses, just open fields and a beautiful view of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove along, I noticed right in front of me, very high in the sky, it appeared to be up there with the stars in altitude, a multi colored lighted object.  It was flashing blue, red, green and bright white lights.  My mother, sitting in the front passenger seat also noticed it.  One could not help but notice it with all the flashing lights, it was so obvious in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both thought it was a airplane.  Then, quite suddenly, it was dropping from the sky right in front of us.  I abrupty stopped the car and we both looked and watched in horror as it dropped from the sky! We both still thought it was a plane, about to crash!  I sat watching with my hands over my ears.  I didnt want to hear the impact that I was sure was about to happen.  Maybe dropping is the wrong word to use, because this object was desending at a tremendous rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as we watched, abruptly, just like on a dime, it stopped, hovering above two trees directly in front of us, on the right side of the road. One second, it was &#34;up with the stars&#34; and just a small object with lights, and withing 30 seconds, it was at tree top level right in front of us not more then 100 feet away.  The colored lights appeared to implode back into the object itself and now just brilliant white lights flashed.  It made a very soft, quite humming sound as it hovered just above the trees.  There were no other sounds of an engine or of any kind, except for this humming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was terrified, my hands shaking as I clenched the steering wheel, I was so afraid for all of us in the car, especially my infant son, asleep in his car seat in the back.  This object was absolutly huge!  Just tremendous in size!  It was saucer shaped, with some sort of dome.  Around the entire dome, we both could clearly see a panel of windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw through those windows gave me nightmares for many years.  There were &#34;beings&#34; looking out at us!  They were not human in appearance.  I counted 5, my mother, until her death five years ago, swore she counted 6.  I do not know &#34;what&#34; they were, but they were not human beings.  From our view, we could see large oval black eyes, with big bug like heads attached to what appeared to be very thin necks with long thin arms.  My mother and I both thought they appeared to be grey in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered there in front of us and we sat frozen, watching it for about 5 or 6 minutes, then, suddenly from somewhere on the underbelly of this object, a bright, blue white light beam shot out at us, lighting the inside of my car like it was daylight!  This light was so bright, so brilliant, that it hurt our eyes and we both had to cover our eyes with our hands to avoid it!  It was so bright that the best way to describe it is to say it was just like the &#34;blue white light&#34; that one sees in a lightening bolt!  This beam kept the car lit up for a minute or two, then just as suddenly, it imploded back to the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took our hands away from our eyes and watched as it abruptly started to very, very slowly move, again, with no sound other then the quiet humming.  It moved above the car.  In terror, I started to drive, anxious to get the heck off of that secondary road and onto the highway to get home!  I was only about a quarter of a mile away from the main roadway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove toward the highway, the object flew just a slight distance ahead of my car and it was again, within our view.  It was almost like it was leading me to the main route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued driving until I reached the highway.  The object was still directly ahead of us, and it had remained at the same altitued of tree top level.  I made a right turn onto the highway, it did the same.  It continued traveling just ahead of me, following the main highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued on for approximatly a mile and a half.  At that point, I had reached the left turn to go on the road to my home.  I turned, the craft continued, following the main route.  My home was just a few minutes away.  I got to my home and shut the car off and both my mom and I could still hear, faintly, in the distance the humming as the craft continued on.  I don&#39;t think either one of us actually slept that night, I was still shaking the next morning it was such a tramatic experience for us!  I felt compelled to notify someone about what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very next morning, I phoned the civil defense in a neighborring city.  I expected to be laughed at, I was not.  When I gave them my full statement of what had happened they informed me, that they had recieved thousands of phone calls from people that had witnessed the same sighting.

I was out in a large open playing field at my school during lunch time. It was a clear sunny day.  The bell had just rung (ending lunch break) and I noticed that I was the last person out on the playing field, so I started walking back to class.  For some reason I then looked up into the air and saw two round reddish orange metallic disks flying overhead.  At first I thought they were balloons, but I quickly dismissed that idea as balloons do not fly in formation (side by side) and they do not fly into the slight wind that was blowing.  I then thought they were two fighter aircraft, because of the small size, but the objects were round, with no wings, no tails, no projections of any kind and they were completely silent.  I stopped walking and started tracking them with my eyes and turning my head to keep them in view.  They were moving from my left to my right almost directly overhead, ~ 850.  After watching them for about seven seconds or so, t! he disks started to approach the area of the sun in the sky.  I turned away when the glare became too great.  I waited for about three seconds, thinking that I could see the disks again as they came out on the other side of the sun, but I could not find them.  I looked all over the sky for several minutes but they were gone.  I went back to class (no one missed me) and told my teacher I had just seen two UFOs (no reaction).  Back at my desk I wrote out a short description of my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

For awhile, I had a strange feeling it was following or &#34;pacing&#34; me. Trying to discount paranoia, I decided it was just &#34;there&#34;. I thought it was the Planet Venus, but it was twice the expected size. As I approached the stop sign at the junction of the main road, I decided to pull over, get out, stretch my legs and gaze at this thing. Shortly, the object appeared to &#34;quiver&#34;, separate into two parts, and spin faster and faster,counterclockwise around each other before coming to an abrupt halt. One object appeared to accelerate to the South while the other remained stationary. During this sighting, I shook my head, rubbed my eyes, pinched myself (it hurt!), but I was not asleep. I kept sight of the remaining object until I reached home. The importance of this seemed to dissolve, but the memory remains vivid.<n>

The first night we stayed there, my parents put my brother, sister and myself to bed, and sat on the front porch that overlooked a 35 acre lake on the property.  At some point my mother spotted an unusal light moving from her left (east) field of vision to her right (west) field of vision very close to the tree tops.  She asked my father what type of plane that it was.  My father had been a military pilot his whole life and noted that it did not look like a plane.  The object moved across their field of vision until it was right in front of them across the lake at tree top level and stopped (about 1/4 mile away). It looked cigar shaped and small port holes of different colors could be seen along it&#39;s sides.  It made a continuse humming sound. After serveral minutes it moved off.  My parents related this story to us kids the next morning at breakfast.  The only other unusal thing that happened was that a brand new station wagon that my parents had purchased would not start the next day, the battery had been drained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As we dropped the water we sat on the tank looking up at the sky when we noticed a bright ball of light in the sky just south of us.  This ball of light sat there for about 5 or 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a streak of what looked like fire shot from the north side of the object.  When the fire dissipated  it left another smaller ball of light just north of the larger object. They both sat there for a few more minutes and then the smaller ball of light left to the southwest so fast that it left a small trail of light behind it, this trail lasted only a fraction of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In just a few minutes the larger ball of light did the exact same thing.

Then I turned around and saw it. The object was very bright. It was large about 50 feet in diameter. It was hard to tell exactly how large as it was so bright. It lite up the road. The light was a &#39;white&#39; light. Very brilliant. I could not make out any detail as it glowed so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife yelled to me to get out of there.

Iwas looking up gazing at the stars it was a clear nite . Then out of no where a triangle formation of lighted dots drifted across the sky.There was no sound . If i had not been looking up i would have never seen this event.I was startled and amazed at what i was wittnessing .I had to move to the other side of the car very quickly because the dots of lights were moveing at a pretty good drift. The amount of dots or disk that i saw were between 12 or14  moving in a northeasterly direction.The lights did not stop or move in any wierd manner, they stayed on a straight path . Their color was like a white silver more whiteish sort of like a full bright clear moon. Idid tell my father and sister and mother about this sighting and fact on that nite i had also yelled at my sister to come and see but she was trying to get her clothes and didn&#39;t make it out in time to see . I have waited a long time to tell anybody else because most people think your crazy . I also didn&#39;t know where to report such a matter until i recently got on the net and found this site.<n>

At first I thought it was just a plane, but noticed it was covering a lot distance in short amount of time. I told my 2 friends, as we talked more about what we were watching we wanted to follow it. As we were talking we noticed that it started to get closer. It came along side us above a corn feild, it had 3 lights in a triangle,they flashed on and off at the same time. They flashed very bright they did not fade they were on then black. We couldn&#39;t see an object just the lights. It followed us along the road 100 yrds away. We slowed down, it slowed down, we sped up it did the same. We stoped it did also. We then shut the lights off and it stoped flashing. We then turned the lights back on and it started flashing again. We then turned the engine off, we could hear no sound of the object, it just flashed on and off with no sound. By now we were scared out of mineds. We decided to go back to town, as we did this the object stoped following us, like it could hear what we were saying. At some point we became brave and decided to go back after it but it seamed to start following the railroad tracks until we couldn&#39;t see it any more. We returned to the same place for a week but never say it again, and we quite telling our story. No one belived us. Even to this day I only tell very close friends. I know what I say!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  A celestial body--a star or a planet--will appear to a person driving that it is &#34;following&#34; his car.

It seemed to float up and stop, then all of a sudden it jerked to the left faster than anything i had ever seen, stopped on a dime, floated up, it did this motion 3 more times [ like a climbing stairs motion ]until the object was directly in front of the car. It then began to float over the car, my heart was pounding and my head was spinning, i was totally stunned!I cathered up all the courage that i could muster and jumped out of the car and looked straight up, there was nothing only blackness!

I was walking with a friend at around 21:00pm on a Friday night. We had been to a disco tech which was closed for some reason, and we were walking back to my friend&#39;s house in Emmarentia, which is a suburb in northern Johannesburg.  We were both around eighteen years old and sober.  My friend&#39;s house (parents house) was situated near a large lake, Lake Emmarentia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the lake we were both astounded to observe a glowing orange orb, the size and color of a harvest moon, pulsing and hovering over this lake.  It appeared to be pulsing and quite stationary.  Suddenly it began moving fairly quickly  across the lake, stop, go straight up, stop there suddenly, move horizontally, hover for a few seconds and continue these erratic up and down maneuvers for a few minutes, then suddenly in a lazy upward angle and in an Easterly direction it sped off, gathering speed very quickly, and as it did so the color of the orangy yellow orb paled until it  disappeared  and the last sight before it disappeared was that it was almost a see-through transparent white color. The faster it went, the paler it became, as I said, and then disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing had been spoken during this sighting apart from right at the beginning of the sighting when we first saw the yellow orb, and to which we both said basically, “Wow, what is that??”  After it had disappeared, as suddenly it, or another very similar orb reappeared and basically went through the same maneuvers, though the time was quite significantly less than the first one&#39;s maneuvers.  It too sped off in a slight upward and Easterly angle and it too disappeared paling as it sped up until suddenly it was invisible.  We exclaimed to each other that that definitely was a UFO, and we rushed back home, just a few minutes later and called the Rand Daily Mail, which was the cities morning news paper, and reported the sighting.  They informed us that all through that week they had several people call up with similar sightings....<n>

Ignition functioned and I persuaded a terrified 4 people to continue to observe, After 6 minutes it rose at an incredible speed straight up , becoming a star within 6to 10 seconds. No sound, sonic boom or trail. DIAMETER; 150 feet dome to dome height perhaps 40 to 50 feet. Stress not a blurry light. This was a vehicle that saw us on the shore and came in to examine us. One anomaly. We all sensed a force intruding on our minds once we reached car.. I was a science student and amateur pilot at time, a good observer, rational as hell. This sighting remains crystal clear after some 34 years and I have zero doubt it was a craft from a distant neighborhood. That&#39;s a joke.

What I mean is it was Hugh.  Bigger then any I have ever heard of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Father and I were traveling in a caravan on a move from Carson City, Nevada to Oklahoma.  About 200 miles from Las Vegas I guess,  We seen a Very Large Craft Hover up from Behind a small mountain range to the east of us, the best I can describe it was that it was like 2 tops off a football stadium flipped to make a ship, big, silver metallic with a lot of tarnish or a rust discoloration, a weathered look to it. with structure protruding from it on the side facing us, very much like the UFO&#39;s seen in ID4 only silver with tarnish all over it. It came straight up above the Mountains then back down a little back up then all the way down disappearing behind the mountains, I suppose it was somewhere around Area 51, yet I don’t know if it existed then, It looked very heavy no exhaust seem to be coming from it, I cant remember if it had any lights, but I want to elaborate it was real big, actually bigger then the top of a foot ball stadium big. I’m sure even with the best of our technology at that time we had nothing of that scale, and why would we? I am sure it was not a balloon or anything like that. I wanted to share this with you for I have been seeking a similar story to no avail. And was hoping someone might have a story that mimics mine. Well Good hunting, also was wondering why there never seems to be any real good UFO pictures? What gives, someone with modern Cameras needs to be out there photographing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was sitting in the back set of the car heading towards Orange, about one third of the way past Molong towards Orange when, while looking out the window to my right(towards the oposite side of the road here) i noticed a bright shiny onject, very large, if you wherent looking you would not notice them, it was saucer shaped with a dome on top, along side of it on the left was a very tall &#39;person&#39; dressed in an outfit which glowed the same as the ship, about the centre of the craft and walking towards the road(the ship was about 20-30mtrs away from fence line which was about 5mtrs from the road) till he was about half way between the fence and the craft and another one was standing on the right of the ship near a dead tree, all had the same &#39;cloths&#39;on if you could call it that, with like black visors for their eyes to look through, it was like absorbing the sun light but didnt reflect it, the closest i can describe it is like haveing a fluro light on outside in sunlight but brighter looking. they where very tall, it is i would say at a guess about 8ft. tall, mind you i was only young at the time but i see it now as if it was only yesturday and in slow motion, it may have only taken 10secs from the time i saw them to the time we drove past, maybe less. it looked like they where collecting things and looing at the cars going past, i am sure the one walking down to the road saw me as he turned his helmet and followed our car with his black looking visor. I never said a thing to anyone becuase by the time they looked around we would have past them and i would have been told not to tie. I know what i saw and to this day can show exactly wher! e they where although the road has been changed i am sure last time i was past their the road had not been widened on that side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always believed in UFO&#39;s since i saw this even though some people i have told never believed me, i only say this now becuase i want someone to tell who will believe me and get it off my mind at last. I am sure if the area was tested even after all this time it would show signs of something being their. the craft looked like it would have been twice as high as the &#39;men&#39; and about 6times the wide/length. and parked between two dead trees, i remember the detail so much becuase i had stared at it from the second i saw it just before we got to the corner until we drove around the corner so it may have been more than 10sec&#39;s. i made sure i got as much deatil as possible. I did have a plastic camera in the car but it was no good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know if anyone else saw it as i never asked, someone else driving past would have seen it if they looked in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On this particular morning I was sitting on the couch looking out the picture window when I saw it...a round silvery white craft flying very slow and very low, maybe 20 yards in front of the house. It scared me so bad, I flew back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the very same type craft 21 years later. I was 30, married, with one child and another on the way. I don&#39;t know why that seems significant. The time was around 12 noon on a Friday and I was sitting in the turn-off lane to go to McDonald&#39;s to get some lunch. I had my 3 year-old daughter with me. She saw nothing though. The craft flew over some trees on the side of the highway, seemed to stop directly over where I was, hovered a few seconds and then zoomed away at lightening speed, faster than a jet. I know that it was faster than a jet because I thought, I&#39;ll be able to see it when I get closer to my house. I never saw it anymore. It was gone. Funny thing, I asked around to see if anyone else saw anything strange in the town of Burnsville that Friday at 12 noon. Evidently I was the only one who saw it. Or anyone else would feel stupid admitting to seeing something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I know what I saw, both times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was followed by 2 more which came from completely different directions and appeared to perform the same disappearing trick at the same place in the Heavens. No sound.. any plane would have been heard over Bath which is an ancient Roman town in the West of England. This continued at about the same time each evening for next 2 days. (1 on each night.)They crossed the sky in approx 30 secs. Vision was immaculate...NO clouds and way out in the country very late at night. They never faded or had trails etc. They simply disappeared at full flight. At that speed a plane would have been very loud. Satelite... no, 13- 16 minutes would be needed to cross the stratosphere and then there&#39;s the rendez-vous point that they seemed to be going to where they disappeared. Never seen anything like it since, and believe me, I&#39;ve looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/72 00:00|Oxford|MI|Light|hours|As a child saw lights in the woods and had an encounter with being|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58854.html|68|ndxe197206| As a child saw lights in the woods and had an encounter with being<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was born in April of 1968 and I think I was about 4-5 upon this happening.  I lived in Oxford, Michigan and for an unknown reason I woke in the middle of the night, I do not know the time, however I was drawn to the window.  I looked out the window and saw a very bright light land in the gravel pit behind my house.  I figure it was about a mile out… Once the bright light landed it did illuminate enough to see a glow in the woods. (Just beyond the dig section of the pit).  I honestly cannot remember how I was drawn, but I was drawn outside.  If I had to guess, I would say it was a &#34;sound&#34; or frequency that drew me outdoors.  I remember knowing I was not supposed to be out of bed let alone outside, but was heavily drawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon entering the backyard, I was greeted by a Being.  It was slightly taller than me with a long neck, oversized head and large oval shaped eyes, long fingers and toes.  The feet were bear, but honestly do not recall clothing.  The overall color of the skin was grey/green.  When I came upon it, it took my hand and we proceeded across the yard to the back fence.  Once I passed the fence into the woods heading out.. I do not recall a thing.  But what I do remember is a feeling of warmth, friendliness and curiosity on both our parts.  I felt no fear and felt hugely curious.  I remember that my feet felt cool and damp and I remember very clearly the sounds of the night, and the feel of the warm yet slightly cool damp air.  There was very little breeze.  It must have been mid to late summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had not thought of that night until I was around 15 or 16 years old when my mother and I went into a book store and I saw the book Communion for the first time.  I started hyperventilating and feeling dizzy and week in the knees as the memory flooded back.  The major difference in looks is that the &#34;grey&#34; on the cover of Communion is a sinister looking being, when my experience was much different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I petty much put the whole thing out of my head and avoided anything regarding Alien abductions, whether it was books or movies for years.  I now feel so far removed from the experience that I am comfortable relating it.  I don’t know what it means or if anything happened or even if it really happened.  Was it possible it was a dream?  I did once talk to a hypnotist when I was in my early 20’s and described my memory to her.  She was a Stop Smoking therapist and did Abduction Hypnotherapy also.  She indicated that based on her experience, my details were too heavy and too much physical memory for it to be just a dream.  She wanted very much for me to follow up with her, but I never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done very little research, as I was checking out sites on the web I came across you site and decided to throw the information out there and see what came back.  Perhaps this is the time for me to do further investigation on this and determine if it were real or not.  I see that in 1966 there were a number of sightings in Michigan.  However that was years before my time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So here is your information.  Do with it what you will.  If it ties into other types of reports, perhaps this will be of benefit.  If not, I know that nothing will come from this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have always looked at the colors.. dead, white, blue white and sparkly. One of the stars appeared to be slowly moving and we verified this .. It was moving across the milky way, we figured from NW to SE... based on where we were facing. After awhile it slowed and stopped.. made a right turn and moved in that direction for a short while, then moved back to the track, continuing on till it reached straight up and then it stopped ,,waited and then a very long beam of light shone.. Then it slowly moved some more ,stopping occasionally and then another &#39;star&#39; on the same path started moving toward the first one and it too had a light. The stars moved towards each other and then both turned on their lights, which touched, then they moved together where they did not move again for an hour . We stopped watching. I had the strange feeling I had been told the display was for me because I had always believed. Some years later I awoke, wide awake to see a &#39;star&#39; moving in the leafless branches of a tree in the same manner of the one in Mississippi. I again felt communicated with. It again was a star, this time over Norfolk Virginia ..<n>
