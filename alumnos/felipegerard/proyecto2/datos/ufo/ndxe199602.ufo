They both thought it was another aircraft and were concerned that it might collide with them, so they turned on their identification lights and initiated a turn.  The object apparently was capable of &#34;jumping&#34; suddenly, perhaps as much as 20 or 30 miles within 1 second time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crew requested clearance to descend, which they did.  they descended to 9500 feet, but the object appeared to descend with them, staying on their now, &#34;12:00&#34; position.  They continued their descent to 3,500 feet, where they entered the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another airliner, a Northwest commuter (Callsign: &#34;Masaba&#34;) witnessed the interaction.

They made no sound, and moved fairly fast. Stayed in tight formation, one at point, two trailing. No visible detail.I thought it might be fighter planes, like a Stealth fighter, since president Clinton was in Santa Monica that night, but there was no sound. I thought perhaps the color was due to sun reflecting off the craft,but the Stealth are black, not bare aluminium, and no sun reflects at 20:15 in February.<n>

At approximately 12:40 pm, I was heading in a NNW direction on Stowe Road, 1/4 mile north of Scripps-Poway Pkwy.  I looked up into the sky and noticed a white point of light about 60 degrees above the northern horizon.  It was slowly moving toward the south.  The weather conditions at the time were as follows:  mostly clear skies, scattered cirrus clouds, temperature about 65 degrees, winds from the SSW (both at the surface and aloft), with wind speed about 10 mph at ground level.  By 12:43 pm, the object became stationary at a position about 70 degrees above the northern horizon.  It appeared to hover in that position until 12:45 pm, when another similar object &#34;blinked on&#34; just to the east of the first object.  At that moment, both objects began to move fairly slowly towards the west, with the first object pulling slightly away from the second.  Both objects appeared to pass under the cirrus clouds in the area.  At 12:49 pm, the first object changed direction towards the SW.  The second object continued to move toward the west.  The distance between the two objects continued to increase to the point where I could no longer keep both of them in a single field of view.  At 12:51 pm, the first object was approximately 50 degrees above the western horizon when it suddenly streaked across the sky from west to east and disappeared over the eastern horizon.  The elapsed time of this high-speed exit from the area was 10-12 seconds.  I immediately looked back to where the other object had been, but it was gone.  I did not see it leave. I have made the following conservative altitude and velocity estimates: 1.  Scattered cirrus clouds at approximately 25000 feet 2.  Both objects were below the cirrus clouds. 3.  Distance travelled by first object during high-speed exit from the area assuming altitude of 15000 feet = 25-75 miles 4.  Estimated velocity of first object during high-speed exit = 6000-18000 mph It is clear to me that these objects were not conventional airplanes, balloons, meteors, stars, etc.  They moved against the wind, hovered and displayed high-speed characteristics beyond anything that I&#39;ve ever seen or heard.  At no time did I hear any sound from either of the objects.  There was no sonic boom during the high-speed maneuver.  Both objects appeared as white points of light with no other details observed.  They were both clearly under intelligent control.  The sighting took place in an area where there were frequent flybys of Navy F-14 and F-18 fighters returning to Miramar from training exercises over the Pacific.  However, no military or civilian aircraft were seen in the immediate area over the entire duration of the sighting. I believe my estimates of altitude and velocity are conservative, my gut feeling is that these objects may have been at an altitude closer to 25000 feet and the velocity during the high-speed maneuver may have been more like 20000-25000 mph.

2/21/96 21:05|North Vancouver (Canada)|BC|Sphere|2 minutes|softly illuminated sphere about 15 feet in diameter traversed sky overhead at 1,800 feet altitude--no detectable sound.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05085.html|27|ndxe199602| softly illuminated sphere about 15 feet in diameter traversed sky overhead at 1,800 feet altitude--no detectable sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son (age 11) and myself (then age 41) were taking our dog for a walk near my house in North Vancouver. I am a private, recreational pilot and take an interest in everything that flys overhead. On this February 21/96 evening it was dark (9:05 pm) and a thick overcast of cloud was overhead--the cloud base was at 1,900 feet (because of the sighting--I immediately upon arrival home checked our local weather channel for cloud ceiling data and winds and wrote down the details of what I saw). Anyway, during our walk I looked to the west and saw an unushual glowing object, luminous but not glaring bright, no navigational lights or strobe. We stopped walking and I pointed the object out to my son. Its track would have it fly almost directly overhead. As it approached I said to him that this was weird--no sound, speed about what a small aircraft would fly at, 100 mph or so, but it was relatvely low as it went over--estimate based on known cloud base (1,900 feet) and the object was about one hundred feet below the cloud layer. Though it was night the  overcast was bright because of the glare of city lights but I could not detect wings or any form other than that of a sphere, illuminated in a yellowish-white light (the object was close enough that wings would have been detectable). I figured the object to measure about fifteen feet in diameter. The west to east course was more or less straight (winds were NW - 11 KM/H), it did not weave or change altitude though I thought there to be slight oscilation--I did not sense that it drifted with wind direction. All this seemed odd but it was not until the object had passed overhead and was about 4 miles east of our position that we were amazed. At this distance the cloud changed from a solid defined layer at 1,900 feet to dropping right to the ground. I said to my son that if this were an airplane it would not fly into the cloud at this altitude because there are many mountains less than a mile to the north that rise to 4,000 feet. No aircraft flying IFR would fly this ! course. The object, seconds before entering the cloud dropped what I can only describe as sparkles--just like the flickering white/blue flashes one would see from a halloween sparkler. These sparkles descended from the still illuminated sphere for a time span of about four or five seconds, dropping about 1,000 feet below the craft. We let out a collective &#34;whooo.&#34; Then twice more it dropped these twinkling bright lights in identicle fashion to the first then immediately entered the cloud and the illuminated sphere went out as if a switch were turned off as opposed to being obscurred by thicking cloud. We were pretty puzzled by what we saw and immediately upon arriving home I jotted down the details, it was only upon listing to your report on the Art Bell show and your invitation to submit both recent and past sightings that I felt compelled to dig out my scrap of paper with the details contained herein.

THe lights looked like there were about 7 huge spotlights pointing down. Then it started to move slowly down towards us. My wife was getting scared and I couldnt believe what we were seeing. This light was so bright it felt warm when I got out of the car. Then it came to a stop about 500 above us. You couldnt see exactly the shape because it was to bright to fully look at it. I would say it was bigger than a 747 but there were no wings as far as we could tell and there were no blinking lights. This is what surprised us the most is that this thing had no noise dead silence. Then all of a sudden it took off. It went from just sitting there to gone and I could see it leaving in the distance. I have seen F-16s and other fighter jets and they could not touch this. This thing did turn off his lights right before he left. THere still was no noise of it even when it took off. This object was just gone. My wife and I said to each other right there that we would never speak of this because nobody would ever believe what we just saw.

This object followed the car as we left, and proceeded to follow us through more than 8 miles along a gravel road. Along the way we didn&#39;t encounter any other vehicles. The object made no noise except for a slight humm, and stayed along the right hand side of the car, just above the treeline. There were 4 witnesses in the car, who all claimed to have seen the same thing. As we turned onto a highway, the UFO followed us from behind, and a huge spotlight came down, covering a large feild on one side of the road, and the highway behind us. It was following closely, and seemed to be catching up to us, and another car came over a hill from the other way, and the object seemed almost to disappear from view, it didn&#39;t exactly disappear, but it moved much more quickly than any manmade craft is able to. We checked as soon as we reached our destination and it seems that we didn&#39;t lose any time. I saw the craft numerous times after, always hovering near the house at night after dark, and two other witnesses who were in the car claim to have seen it other times afterwards. It was a different shape when it would hover near my house, it would change shapes to the pattern of the moon. If there was a half moon, it too would be a half circle, and if it was a sliver moon, it would be a sliver too, but it changed colors from white, to yellow, to orange, and even red. It would hover very closely, and would wake me up out of a sound sleep. I haven&#39;t seen it since August of 1996, and the last time, I was with two other witnesses who saw it zip across the sky. I can count over 10 witnesses in the year of 1996 who have all seen the same object that year in the same area.<n>

Several sightings afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kim, Terri, and I were driving to Nikki&#39;s house, Kim&#39;s cousin (about 6:30pm). We were all about 17-18 years old and it was Valentine&#39;s day.  Nikki and Kim were living about a 1/2 mile from each other in a remote farming area.  It was dark and the roads were icy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kim&#39;s mother had reported numerous times to her family that there was a UFO that followed her to work daily.  Each morning the lit object would wait for her above the mail box and one day, she claims the object beamed down a light and flew over the hood of her car.  On one hand, I believed her because she is an honest &#34;no nonsense&#34; person, but on the other hand, it&#39;s definately something you need to see to believe!  Kim began seeing the object after her mother woke her up and pointed it out to her one morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TO NOTE:  Kim has an uncle that is very paranoid of aliens being able to see him at night, to the point of shooting out the overhead farm lights.  He lived about 6-7 miles away.  My mother bought a telescope to watch the skies after seeing UFO&#39;s over Lake Miltona in the 80&#39;s.  My uncle has seen UFO&#39;s in Park Rapids, MN while jogging along wooded trails.  I have several friends and aquaintances who claim to have seen UFO&#39;s (about 10).  My husband says he used to watch UFO&#39;s while having field parties in Miltona in the early 90&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Feb. 14th at about 6:30pm, my friends and I picked up Nikki.  Terri was driving and Kim was in the passenger seat.  I was sitting in the back seat of a 4-door car.  When we pulled into the driveway, Kim yelled, &#34;See, there it is!  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been seeing!&#34;  We all observed a UFO hovering above the silo.  Nikki had also seen it and immediately jumped into the back seat.  The object was round and white in appearance.  Although it was bright, the light appeared to be self-contained, meaning that it didn&#39;t emit light like a flashlight or lightbulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we drove away, the object came straight down from the sky and then followed along-side the vehicle.  It was about the size of our car.  It followed along the ditches, move up over trees and power lines, then would dip back down along side us.  It was icy and we took back roads (gravel) for 8 miles to my mother&#39;s house in Miltona, MN.  All of us were hysterical and crying, yelling at Terri to drive faster.  There was no other traffic on the gravel roads and but Terri had to drive slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we hit Highway 14, the object moved higher up into the sky and moved behind us.  A large beam of light came down like a helicopter spotlight. I felt like something snapped in my brain. I&#39;m not sure how to explain it, but it seemed nearly audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the point at which I&#39;m not sure exactly what happened.  I&#39;m not sure if I imagined what COULD have happened,or if it actually DID happen.  The car was stopped. No one was screaming or crying and everyone else was staring straight ahead, motionless.  There wasn&#39;t any lights on the dash, no clock, etc., and the car wasn&#39;t running. I think there was a small man (being) next to my car door.  We had locked all the doors upon seeing the UFO.  The man telepathically told me to open the door and I refused.  It said, &#34;We&#39;re going to get in anyway.  Make it easier on yourself and unlock the door.&#34;  I reached over and unlocked it and don&#39;t remember anything else. BUT, it was as if we DIDN&#39;T stop the car. The light had come out and chased us, closing in on us slowly, and just when it was almost on top of us, a car came from the other direction and it was gone in a flash, going in the other direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had regression hypnosis to help me remember this incident, and as it turns out, I&#39;m just one of those people who can&#39;t be hypnotised. What luck! But, I was able to recall details just from simply telling the story to the hypnotist over and over again. It seemed that each time I could remember another small little detail. But, when it comes to the spot where I&#39;m not sure if we stopped or not, I was confused each time. I simply came up with, &#34;and then it was gone and we went to my house.&#34; My friend also had hypnosis and swears that she and her cousin were taken up into a spaceship. I was not present at her hypnosis session, but she said it was pretty intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next two months or so, I saw the UFO several times at my house (daily, sometimes). It would come after dark and it seemed immediately after I fell asleep. I would wake up feeling as though something was staring intently at me and would open my eyes to see it outside my window. It would change shapes to the shape of the moon (half moon, crescent, full moon, etc.) and would also change colors (white, yellow, orange). It did not have flashing colors, but would be one full color at a time. Once, it turned blood red as I reached for the phone to report it to the police as a sighting. I was scared to go to sleep and felt like no one could possibly identify with me what I was going through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually saw it less and less, but did start seeing it again about 3 years ago, spurring me to pursue the hypnosis. Before the hypnosis session, I swear that I woke to a female alien standing next to my bed reaching over my abdomin area. A few hours later I woke up laying crosswise on my bed without the covers on. I also had an incident where I woke up sleep walking, chasing a very short man out of my room. I dismissed it as a dream, but after going to the bathroom to take a drink of water, I noticed that the UFO was, once again, sitting outside the window! CRAZY! A few days later, I saw the UFO in daylight gliding across the sky. It did this for a few minutes, then quickly made a right angle and dashed away. That time I could see it was cigar-shaped, not round. I was curious as to whether or not other cars driving on the highway also saw it, but I guess I&#39;ll never know. I haven&#39;t seen it for quite some time now.<n>

This is one of five of my sightings and the most spectacular one out of the five.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and myself were heating and air installation employees who worked for Climate Control out of south boston at the time this took place. We were working on the sears building roof top,installing the last flue pipe on the job site that day.The sky was completely clear blue sky, no clouds anywhere, perfect visability! We had just picted up  our tool belts and heading towards the roof top stair door, i noticed a craft that i had mistaken for a small airplane at a glance in the distance that had hovered around the old Dan River Mills smoke stacks located closest to the worsham st. bridge area, down in that direction.After catching my attention i noticed that the craft was moving in our direction, straight at us. The moment that i realized this object was not an airplane was when it began to turn on its side at a 90 degree angle with no drop in altitude and not in a turn such as an aircraft would do.The object turned 90 degrees on its side and then it turned back to a level position as it was moving towards us on the roof top of the sears building, and keep in mind, this object was just a little bit higher than we were at eye level.Once the object returned to a horizontal position it was close enough to be fully visable with much detail.Once the craft leveled ot to a horizontal position i yelled out to my work mate and i pointed str! aight at it in total shock and disbelief. At that moment the craft turned upwards on its side at a 45 degree angle and shot across the sky at a speed so fast that the object became a streak of white light accross the sky, and there was a noticeable point of exit at the end of the streak of white light. Where the object streak ended in the sky there was something like white stars of light that shot back towards the direction of the streak of white light.Also this streak of light was not a vapor trail it was a split second exit, aweome and unbelievable.The craft was a disk shaped object with small areas on the top side like dark rectangular shaped indentations and the same on the bottom side of the craft as well.The object was a beautiful gold color like the sun and the classic disk shape like in the old ufo movies.The object had an appearence of a somewhat dulling effect of the light around the object but plainly visable. This was the first time i had seen anything like this! before, and until then i was a skeptic, not anymore! I rememb! er feeli ng like a kid on Christmas morning, with a new exitement and outlook on the world we live in, and somewhat afraid as well now that i new these were more than just science fiction stories and folklore!<n>

2/4/96 23:00|Manitoba (rural) (Canada)|MB|Disk|10 minutes|While driving on the highway one night, I drove right underneath a saucer shaped UFO hovering about 75 feet above the road.|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22081.html|63|ndxe199602| While driving on the highway one night, I drove right underneath a saucer shaped UFO hovering about 75 feet above the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen UFO&#39;s three times in my life.  Once during the daytime when I was twelve, and two more night-time sightings as an adult.  This isn&#39;t counting strange lights or something you&#39;re just not sure of, these are actual craft that I could see clearly.  Anyway, my most memorable encounter happened on the night of February 4, 1996 at about 11:00 at night.  At the time I was living in Brandon, Manitoba but the man I was seeing (now my husband) lived in Winnipeg, which is where I live now.  As he had two small children from a previous relationship that were with him every weekend, it was much easier for me to make the trip in by myself than for him to come out to see me and bring the kids with him (they were two and three at the time).  So every Friday night I would drive into Winnipeg and return home Sunday night, usually leaving around 9:00.  I would invariably be tired and anxious to get home, so the lights at the Carberry intersection at Highway 5 on the #1 was always a real landmark that I watched for because it meant I only had half an hour left before I was home.  I was always glad to see the lights at that intersection as I approached it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular night it was quite cold and I had left Winnipeg a little later than usual.  After checking my watch and doing some calculations I was thinking that by the time I hit the intersection it would be pretty much exactly 11:00 which meant I would be home by 11:30.  Having driven this stretch of highway so often I knew exactly when to expect to see the Carberry lights.  As they came into view, I noticed that there were two other lights hovering just above the streetlights.  I kept watching these lights as I drove and they didn&#39;t move at all, up or down or side to side.  From the time I first saw the lights to the time I reached the intersection was about 7 km.  As I got closer and closer I could tell that these lights were hovering immediately above the streetlights, I&#39;d say 10-15 feet above them.  Let&#39;s say that the poles are 60 feet and the UFO was 15 feet above that, that would make it about 75 feet off the ground - pretty darn close! As I approached the intersection, I could see the thing that was making the lights was on the other side of the streetlights, so I couldn&#39;t really see anything more than a dark saucer sharp as I drove through the intersection because I couldn&#39;t see past the glare of the streetlights.  It wasn&#39;t until I was completely through could I look up and clearly see the UFO.  I was driving in the passing lane because as I was coming up to the intersection there was a white van in the right hand lane that wasn&#39;t travelling quite as fast as I was, so I was in the left lane going around it.  We were travelling pretty close together as we passed through the intersection, so I know someone else had to have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at this thing the entire time as I got closer to it.  As I got past the glare, it suddenly came into very sharp view.  I was driving directly underneath it, it was right above me!  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing!  It was round and flat.  I couldn&#39;t really see the top of it, but the bottom was very clear.  The two lights that I had seen were different colours, but I honestly can&#39;t remember what they were now, it&#39;s been too long.  Blue and white, maybe.  Anyway, there was a third light as well on the bottom of this thing (this one was red, I think), which is where the first two were - on the bottom of the craft.  I remember thinking at the time that the thing must have been tilted towards the west and that was why I hadn&#39;t seen the third light until then.  I saw two other vehicles on the other side of the highway headed east towards Winnipeg and thought that they must have seen three lights as they approached from the other direction instead of two as I had.  It was hovering over the left side of the highway, not in the middle, so my car drove directly underneath.  I looked up at it and thought how it looked just like something out of a movie.  It was metallic, dark but shiny, reflecting the lights from below.  It was covered with what looked like machinery of some sort, all curvy tubes and pipes, all over the bottom of it except around the edge.  It was somewhere around 35 feet across and I did not hear any noise emanating from it at all (over the road noise, of course).  It was only about 75 feet off the ground so I got a really good, close look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have wished heartily ever since that I had pulled over for a better look, but I didn&#39;t.  First, it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 7:00 the next day so I really wanted to get home to bed.  Secondly, it was the middle of winter and it was, as I mentioned earlier, fairly cold.  Also, I was by myself.  If I had been with someone else I probably would have been braver.  And I was in the passing lane - you can&#39;t stop on the shoulder of the passing lane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, that&#39;s what I saw that night.  I did arrive home at 11:30, so there was no weird time loss or anything like that.  I&#39;d be interested to know if anyone else reported seeing anything there that night.<n>

We have a farm light in the back yard, but it shut off that night. I heard an electrical humming i thought was the light shorting out. So i looked up at it to see lights above the house, no more than 50 feet up moving about 10 - 15 mph. red lights lit up in a rotating circular pattern. Little airplane type lights. I could not see the shape of the craft or the edges. No light was reflecting off of it. It was a cloudy night, so the moon was blocked. the object slowly move from over my house from the west and moved eastward, overhead and eventually disappeared over a hill about 10 - 15 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

2/1/96 22:00|Kensington|MD|Light|Unknown|Stationary flashing colors of light behind mist appearing in night sky right above highway very large!|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43332.html|72|ndxe199602| Stationary flashing colors of light behind mist appearing in night sky right above highway very large!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not 100% sure about the dates but it was winter in 1996 and I was visiting my then boyfriend in Silver Springs Maryland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was night time and a very clear and cold night.  I was driving towards the Washington Beltway 495 heading home to my house with my boyfriend traveling to Pennsylvania.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we reached the beltway some 2 miles away in the distance my boyfriend and I saw an enormous flash in the sky.  Almost like lightning but hovering by the horizon.  I said &#34;did you see that? It was like lightning!&#34;  He said he did see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think too much about it and we finally arrived on the beltway.  We were coming up on the Mormon Temple in Kensington. The massive temple with the white spires and trumpeter and I noticed the lights were off (which I never have seen that before as the lights are always on) I thought to myself that was the flash we saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to my boyfriend, &#34;Thats what that flash was the Temple lights ble...&#34; I didnt even finish my sentance when right above us there were these fast flashing lights that flashed red, blue, green, yellow, purple, just poof poof poof poof poof...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationary, no sound that I could tell but we were in the car, but being that it was so close if it were a helicopter or plane it would&#39;ve been close enough to hear it even on the highway. There was a mist or something in front of whatever it was so we could not make out an outline of a craft, but whatever it was it was huge!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend (a skeptic in all senses of the word) was gaping at it with his mouth open and he stated &#34;Now that IS WIERD!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mostly all of the cars in front of me put on their brakes (not stopping totally mind you its a very busy highway) but you could tell everyone noticed.  It was so incredibly strange.  I dont know how long it lasted as I could not stop to find out since I was on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see these types of lights once more by my house in Pennsylvania about a year later.  It was Very late and I noticed off towards my left side the same exact lights flashing red, blue, yellow, green, purple, just over and over very quickly and again you could not see a craft and it was stationary and there was this weird mist in front of it.  There was a person in front of me that saw the craft as well and he slammed on his gas and took off... and I quickly followed suit!!!  It was very unnerving and eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am being 100% honest here and wasnt exactly sure about reporting it...but I really wanted to tell my story.  The weird thing is ... my (now husband) refuses to even admit that he saw anything and also swears he said nothing that night.  Which I think scares me even more than seeing the lights at all being that we talked about it for an hour or so afterwards.  Strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Quedamos inmoviles, sin habla, muertos de miedo, ya que en el lugar que estabamos era imposible ver algo asi. Ahora, el supuesto ovni no lo vimos, pero fue algo que no comentamos mas hasta el dia de hoy.  Al otro dia, al bajar hacia Coya por un rio, encontramos a una persona que creimos que estaba muerta en el rio, no nos quisimos acercar, nos dio miedo y al llegar a Rancagua dimos aviso a carabineros. Al otro dia aparecio en las noticias(tvn red ohiggins), que habian encontrado carabineros a una persona que buscaban hace tres meses.  Mas informacion no tengo , es todo lo que se.
