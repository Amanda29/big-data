He lived down the street from my house.  As he approached my home in his truck (my house was the highest on the top of the hill) he observed a small saucer shaped object hovering above it.  He stopped the truck shocked at what he saw.  It then hovered higher above the house and disappeared.  He never saw it again.<n>

It shows the vertibrae in my neck that has been fused which shouldn&#39;t be that strange.  Except for the fact that I&#39;ve never had any operations.  When I was a young boy, I had what the doctors thought was sever arthritis in my back.  It hurt so much that I had trouble walking.  I recall men, dressed in black, that used to take me out of my room at night while my parents slept.  They would perform tests on me and it was most always on my spinal cord.  If I tried to scream out and wake my parents, the dark doctors would leave before my father could find a trace of them.  I was then warned by these doctors that I should never speak of them or else I could be in great danger.  The treatments continued for a while then finally just stopped.  I&#39;ve never had any problems with my back after that and have been able to carry on a regular life.  Well, regular except for the fact I have fused discs in my neck and back dating back to 1956, and these marks I have on my back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  ))<n>
