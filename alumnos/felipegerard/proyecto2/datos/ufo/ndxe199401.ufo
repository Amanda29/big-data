Everything was like a usual winter day:  We were 2 kids playing in a high populated area in Chemnitz.  It had snow so we were out and enjoyed our winter holidays.  Roads were busy with people who came from work.  It was already dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From one to the other moment everthing was quiet.  Lights were switched on (more than before) in the residental blocks around us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A flying object flow about 50m away from us.  It wasn&#39;t easy to see which shape it had but we saw 7 lights on it.  Those lights changed colores all the time.  There was still no voice around us, no people around us, no cars on the road, nobody looked out of windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flew straight from east to west from one block to the other in about 20 seconds (about 50 meters).

1/25/94 17:56|Spring Valley/LaMesa|CA|Fireball|5-7 minutes|Fireball descending towards ground, changes trajectory, streaks away with giant tale behind|11/6/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115138.html|2|ndxe199401| Fireball descending towards ground, changes trajectory, streaks away with giant tale behind<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was just after your dusk, traveling in a car up a very steep driveway, when I looked up I saw what appeared to be a falling star, as it descended it got bigger and bigger. I stop the car got out of the car, the object became bigger and bigger and bigger and redder and glowing and like a huge fireball, would seem to be right above me. when suddenly it stopped, change to directory, and sped off across T and away from me, and he had what appeared to be a huge tail like a comet.the tail was all different colors it was amazing, it made no sound, and then disappeared out of the skyI couldn&#39;t believe my eyes I looked around and waited for anybody or anything to make any kind of sound very quiet in the neighborhood.. Nobody saw what I saw..it should be noted that almost immediately after a rainfall began. prior to this event two weeks before at the same house maybe a week before.we were awoken.buy a huge explosion the entire house into shape and everything came o! ff the walls..we called the Sheriff&#39;s Department to report this.coincidentally there was a sheriff sitting apparently on the street doing his report when he heard the same thing, he was out investigating the noise when he was called back to his car to take the report of what he was already investigating.I know this because this is what he told us when he came to the house they brought people out they had no conclusive evidence of what that was but it was like a sonic boom or worse..I mention this because it was very weird and very unusual<n>

Soon i realized as it traveled towards my location it was very different.I called my friend over to see this craft, saucer shaped with eight hemispherical lobes on the undercarrige,  that looked like light bulbs with swirling rainbow colors, then intensifing very bright and shuting off. The craft repeted this sequence across the sky sevaral times  silently. it flew directly over our apartment with a perfect view , i had no camera<n>
1/19/94 19:00|Summit|SD|Disk|10 minutes|Large Silver Disk explodes over SD Antenna Field....|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24559.html|4|ndxe199401| Large Silver Disk explodes over SD Antenna Field....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Left Fargo, ND at 4:45 pm for meeting in marshall, MN ealrler postponed that day due to winter storm warnings.   Took I-29 south, at approximtely 1845 hrs topped the &#34;buffalo ridge&#34; and was travelling along the Waubay nat&#39;l Wildlife refuge.  Shortly thereafter a large antenna field used by the US NAVY had its antennae strobes on, the weather was much better above on the ridge than towards north down the ridge to Peever, SD.   Sky was 20% cloudy but extremely windy and with a -35 degree fahrenheit temperature (the reason I know this is that the interior of that cars windows will begin to fog and ice up about 1 inch down and around the sides; at -40 they are completely iced over in side the car) the sky was partially clear, able to see some stars.   I was in the process of passing a slow semi-truck when I got neck and neck with him on I-29.   I thought the driver was asleep but instead saw he was slowing down, I discerned he was looking at something, so I glanced in the same direction West by Southwest.     The appeared to be the reflection in the strobes of a very large aircraft over the antenna field.  The reflection revealed at first a shiny silver surface, possibly the side or bottom of a fusilage but this &#39;craft&#39; was moving extremely slow and was huge, at least 100 ft in length.   As I finished passing the semi-truck, under several near instantaneous bursts of the antenna strobes  the was a 3-4 blue then purple colored lights which revealed the top of the &#39;craft&#39;, was slightly flat and the bottom was curved.   Severl seconds later, there was an intense flash from the object, while the strobes that blinked were blinking were bright this flash was like a welders arc, I mean damned near blinding if it had not been for the extremely short time of the burst.    I saw trhe trucker flashe his lights at me and put his cab light on pointing to the west at the antenna field.   I heard a loud thunderous bang, similar to hearing a heavy metal object fall like at a foundry or steel mill, only muffed by the dista! nce and wind.  I got off at the US Route 12 exit going across I-29 to the Conoco truckstop.    It was approximately 7:15 pm when I got because I pulled up to a pump and topped my gas tank off.    I told the attendant, a woman what I saw, that an airplane exploded in the air.   She said that i ought to call the sherrifs department, just then the trucker came in and went through the same story with the cashier.    After I phoned in what I saw so di the trucker.   The dispatcher said there was a depuites car in the area.    The Sherriffs depty came in at 7:35 pm, his car was spotless, as was his uniform and overall appearance; HE did not have a South Dakota accent.  As  the trucker and I were giving our  statements a rancher and his wife came in all excited about the the loud explosion and huge plane that fell.    When I explained to the Sherriffs Deputy that I saw no flames or crash on the gound-the rancher said he did not know the Sherriffs deputy cutting into our conversation.   The trucker and ranchers wife asked where he was from and he got flustered becasue as it turned out the uniform and car were recognized as belonging the the local sherroiffs department , the cashier was listening all of this we were the only people at the truck stop and the cashier spoke that the deputy was not from around here, he said eh would explain once he got our statements, later explained that he was on loan from near Aberdeen, SD.    Once we gave our statements he said that we saw a satellite re-entering the earths atomosphere.   For being a Sherriffs Deputy he unusually well informed, he said we would be contacted by the USAF after giving our name, age and phone number (he noted the sex of each of us, independently of his questioning).    I do not remember the daqte of the phone call but it was mid February, &#34;an official representative of the US Air Force told me I saw a satellite re-entering the earths atomosphere&#34;.   I was also told not go to any newspapers or media, the tone was not of a threat but practically a dare!   This! the fir st time that I have seen this website.  I am not loony, I have a Ph.D. am an Eagle Scout and was going through my old financial files when I stumbled upon an old expense report with some notes of what I saw attached to it.  To this day I do not if the &#39;craft&#39; I saw was a satellite re-entering  the earths atomosphere, a military plane crash or a &#34;flying saucer&#34; badly in need of a tune up.   However, I know a coverup when I see one.   I checked on the Sherriffs Deputy, later found out he did not even exist, know one matching name or description was on any Sherriffs department in the area, this I did on my own.   The sherriffs department did not even have a record of the dispatch after iasked further.   Who in the hell was that Sherriff&#39;s deputy?  What was going on with that flying craft?   Why in one of the most severe and dangerous winter storms?   Why were there not more people at the Truck Stop?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date of incident apparently are precise.

1/15/94 23:00|Acton|CA|Unknown|30 mins|it was like they knew i was watching them.|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79638.html|7|ndxe199401| it was like they knew i was watching them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I was on the porch smoking a cigarette looking at the stars, I was looking at a mountain side which was a big black silhouette against the night sky and stars, when I noticed one what I thought was a star blinking.  The elevation I can only guess but over 10,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as I watched it, it started to descend in a straight line. It stopped at the top of the mountainous ridgeline.  This whole time it appears as one white light.  Then it began to I don’t know how else to put it, but it began to traverse the ridgeline following it topographically if that makes sense.  I was amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have served in the US Forrest Service as a firefighter and I have seen mountains and ridgelines all up and down California, the only thing I have seen is a D-9 CATAPILLAR that can literally roll up and over a mountain.  And I know this wasn’t that, you can hear a CAT, this thing was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So anyway it was on the ridgeline and it was moving closer. I went inside my cabin and woke a camping buddy, I brought him out to the porch and asked him, ‘you see that?’ what is it man? He said, ‘I don’t know’. Then when it stopped on the ridgeline, in a direct straight line from where we were standing I got scared and so did my buddy, when it turned it presented two bright lights like a car. But there were no roads and no cars that I ever seen that could possibly be where this thing was. Then it started to descend the mountain side.  Smooth, slow, and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Buddy ran inside the cabin and got in bed. I had to see how far it would come so I waited outside and watched it.  Well, it came all the way down to the corner of the block which was around 30 feet from where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t see a shape of a craft because the lights were so bright, then the two main lights split, like the Indian GOD with the many arms lights came out 3 on each side. So from two lights it split into six lights.  That really scared me so I went back into the cabin and I told my buddy, ‘hey bro that ((word deleted)) thing is out there, it’s coming.  So I held the door closed from the inside, like I barred it with my boot and shoulder. Looking out the window I saw it pass but the lights were so bright, when I tried to see the craft as it passed me all I could see was a black void.  Then it floated off into the trees executing a quick right then a left turn and it took off into the sky at a low angle and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were waiting on the steps of another friends house and I pointed at a star.  The reason I noticed the star was that it was a really bright star and I had not noticed it before.  Seconds after I had pointed at the star it had turned into a saucer shaped object.  It took me a second to take in the infomation I had just seen.  It was a small flying object with lots of little colorful lights.  Within seconds fire was shooting out of the bottom of the saucer propelling it upward.  I had seen a lot of UFO television shows and I ran like hell for the house because of fear.  That was the last I had seen of the object.  My friend remained to watch it, but I cannot recall what he said.  I have seen or heard nothing of it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/12/94 18:00|Cedar Key|FL|Chevron|5 minutes|Huge bluish black delta  wing 50 feet or less  over my head while deer hunting from my tree stand in FL !!|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31116.html|11|ndxe199401| Huge bluish black delta  wing 50 feet or less  over my head while deer hunting from my tree stand in FL !!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hunting deer from my tree stand that is about 15 feet up on a palm tree in a very remote part of the state in a place called Tiger Island on the mainland portion of Cedar Key.  I have about 49 acres of my own and after sitting completely motion less for just over 5 hours I all of a suddon started to hear a vaccum cleaner noise or a sucking air with no motor sound comming from all around me , since I couldent tell the direction of the sound I remained motionless.  After about 4 or 5 minutes I noticed the noise was above me along with the sky getting darker as thou something was above my head,  I looked up and changed direction in my seat to get a better look at what looked like a flying delta shapped wing which was only about 50 feet above me.  I was able to view it in great detail before it just shot off in a fraction of a second.  The &#34;V&#34; shapped wing looked much like a modern B2 bomber except it was only flying about 2 miles per hour and had no engine sound.  The nose was missing or it was concave at the front portion with what looked like air &#34;vaperizeing&#34; all around the front of it and &#34;falling&#34; into the front of it.  The size was probabaly 200 feet across and 50 feet long, and was blackish blue in color.  It was about 5 pm and I noticed no lights although I could hear over the sucking noise a &#34;tinkling&#34; sound coming from the rear wing portion.  This sound was accompanied my an electrical or a shiny foil which seemed to be some sort of a discharge all along the rear of the wing, in other words it looked like sparkling foil?  It&#39;s hard to put into words since there is nothing to really compare it to.  I noticed no landing gear doors and no panels or rivets. I did see a few non typical panels whitch were outlined by darker lines.  It seemed to detect my movement when I shifted and I also pointed my rifle at it becasue I panicked in thinking it was not going to continue to move on. When I did so it just shot off without leaving any trail or sound, in fact it was far away -so fas! t the noise of the &#34;vacuum&#34; was sudenly gone. I have never seen a UFO in my life except for this occasion and the very next night 125 miles back home in St. Petersburg Fl.  My wife and I were both sleeping next to the bedroom window which was open when we were both awakened at exactly 4:20 am by an electrical &#34;humming&#34; sound,  we both got up and sat on out knees in bed and looked out the window and saw a large orange reddish sphere that looked like a miniture sun that was not very bright sitting on the grass just out side our home.  It was about 8 to 10 feet across and about 10 feet from the window.  As we looked at it it began to lift up and very slowly fly up and further away until it was gone from sight.  This sighting was about 10 to 12 minutes baybe much longer I dident time it.  It rose only about 2 feet every 20 feet it drifted away til it drifted over our street and a busy 12 lane street and disappeared about a mile away.  My wife now my &#34;x&#34; wife turned to me and said &#34;What the He&amp;% did you bring back with you from the property?!!&#34;  This was her exact words. I was in my mid twentys back then. I never offically reported this since no matter where I looked, phone book, information etc..  I couldent find any place to listen or take the info, and back then I wasent on the net.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night we saw the same lights from Cedar Key the lady in L.A filmed on 8-31-03 , and also got them on video tape, possibly the same ones since her footage on CNN looked pretty much like ours did. From what I could tell, and since we were able to see them also I think what ever that was, was going on in space.  The thing that haunts me after all those years about my tree stand sighting is the fact that I remeber clearing my mind and foucusing on a single leaf on the ground and starring at it for over 5 hours before I heard the &#34;sucking &#34;sound coming.  The strange thing about this is I have never sat in a deer stand for more then 3 hours since then or before that instance. I remember never moving or blinking!  I sometimes ponder if what I experienced was missing time and the last part of a sighting-  the craft departing the scene and I awakening and seeing it leave when I was supose to be out for another few minutes?!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

It first appeared as a very bright white light-like a star, that we noticed as we were traveling by car down a deserted counrty road at about 11 pm at night.  It got bigger and extremely bright, with bright lights swirling around inside it, as it approached us over a hill.  All of a sudden there was a triangular craft, huge, hovering over our vehicle.  It was very black, and the stars were out in force so you could see the outline of its blackness against the stars.  It had a phosphorescent greenish light on the bottom that pulsated in varying degrees of intensity within some sort of tubular triangle.  This area was much smaller than the craft itself and appeared to be an energy source.  There were very large pine trees right below it and to the side of our car and the craft was right above the trees, very large and just so black.  At some point we had rolled down our windows and were amazed to hear NO NOISE AT ALL..but you ! could FEEL an electrical current of some sort, almost static feeling, almost a humming felt in your body.  We could not stop looking at this unbelievable craft, it was above our car in the middle of NOWHERE in the countryside.  When our dog-a Boxer-started growling very uncharacteristically loud with fur standing up on her back, we became afraid and took off slowly so as not to disturb the craft. The craft immediately shot straight up into the sky in a white light, with many small white orbs circling it, and then at high altitude it shot horizontally at high speed followed by orbs and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went home and drew it several times for my parents.  We were in college and just could not even believe what we had seen.  We are educated and believe in God.  We never talked about UFO&#39;s or paid them any attention. Very baffling and something I will not forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

1/3/94 23:30|Albuquerque (30-60 miles west of city)|NM|Triangle|3-4 minutes?|Saw triangular craft approaching from horizon from the N.W., approached slowly, silently, and low to the ground.  Passed directly over|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04221.html|13|ndxe199401| Saw triangular craft approaching from horizon from the N.W., approached slowly, silently, and low to the ground.  Passed directly over our car as we drove west on I-40.  Very large - 200-300 feet long, with circular thing in front on bottom.  Saw beamwork, tubing, ducts, wiring, lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were travelling on I-40 westbound from Alburquerque, New Mexico toward Arizona.  We were approx. 30-60 miles west of Alburquerque at approx. 11:30 pm when I sighted a lighted object at the horizon line, northwest of us. I guess I must have noticed something unusual about it, because I became fixated on it.  It was triangular in shape, with lights.  I remember at least three lights at the point of triangle at front of craft and one on each back corner. It approached silently, at a very slow steady rate.  I continued to stare at it, and the next thing I knew it was gliding directly overhead, over our vehicle and I-40.  It was huge - I would say 200-300 feet long, and very low to the ground, about 3-5 telephone poles in height from the ground.  I could clearly see the underside of the craft as it was illuminated.  It was so big as it passed over it blocked out most of my view of the sky.  I watched it by looking directly up through the windshield.  It now appeared an elongated octogon-shape (rectangle with corners cut.)  I was viewing the underside: There was a large circular thing in the front center, beamwork, ducts, tubes, wiring of some kind. I would say it was dark grey or black metal.  As it glided across the highway heading southeast, and over the car eventually obstructing my view, I then looked through the driver&#39;s side rear window to continue watching it....but it vanished!  Completely!  I looked and looked, all over the sky--nothing!  I continued to be alert and watch the sky as we drove that night, but never saw it or anything else unusual again. I should clarify that I was a passenger, sitting in the front seat.  My husband was driving. I am sending sketches of what I saw via e-mail. Reactions:  I had totally conflicting reactions to this event.  The craft appeared mechanical in nature (lights, beamwork, even rivets) so it could have been some kind of military craft.  HOWEVER...the craft was moving at an extremely slow speed. I would estimate my husband was driving about 60 m.p.h, and the craft was moving slower than that.  It made no sound that I could hear.  What is even more bizarre is that even though I viewed it approaching all the way from the horizon, for several minutes, and I strongly desired to tell my husband to look and pull over I did not. I did not say anything. I just watched it!  There were other cars on the highway, and I could not believe they were not all pulling over and freaking out.  They were all just travelling like everything was normal.  Then it disappeared right after it went overhead!  Something 200-300 feet long just disappeared!  I was completely dumbfounded, and just remember continuing to watch the sky for the duration of drive that night. Although I thought I remembered saying something about it to my husband after it passed by, he had absolutely no recollection of the event at all, and said he did not see anything that night, that he must have been concentrating on driving. I think I did not bring up the subject and describe it in detail to him, including drawing a sketch, until we were in Florida a month later.  How could he have NOT seen something as big as a football field fly directly over our vehicle that night, even if he was watching the road? If it was some secret military craft on a test flight, why would it travel over a major interstate slow and low to the ground, with lights and in plain view?  I can&#39;t reason this through, and my reactions were definitely out of character.  It has been perplexing me for a long time, and I&#39;ve always wondered if anybody else on that highway that night also saw it. So I decided I should report it.  I am now 33 years old, female, married, own my own small business, have a bachelor&#39;s degree, and currently live on the west coast. I wish my memory was clearer so I could remember more details - I am capable of drawing and wish I could offer more information.<n>

My husband brought me out to see the comet since by then I needed assistance walking.  We were standing out in the cold, looking up at the comet when we noticed a light moving quietly in the clear sky.  We knew it was definitely not a plane when we saw how it was moving.  It seemed to be tumbling.  Sort of like rolling dice but slowly and absolutely silent. We watched for about 4 minutes when suddenly a light shone near the object.  The light came on like a flashlight and then in an instant, both lights were gone.  My husband and I looked at each other in astonishment and asked at the same time, &#34;Did you see that???&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed a tumbling rocket shell in orbit.  One of several reports from the same source.  We have spoken with her via telephone, and she sounds quite credible to us.  PD))<n>

We were leaving work, heading to my truck when I looked in the clear sky to the north, We seen flat black object. I called it the wing. It appeared it wasnt moveing. Then it was infront of us. I said its on silant mode,there was no sound. Their was a large thunderhead to the south of us, it headed twards the large thunderhead and tuned on a tweenty to thirty degree angle and slowly went into the cloud. It was as big as the cloud. We watched the front of the v shaped wing go into cloud on a angle until we could see the two ends went in. Thats why it appeared to be flat.It would have been 5 to 10 times the size of a large jet aircraft.<n>

1/1/94 00:00|Honolulu|HI|Light|varies|Strange sights in the sky over Oahu from about 1994 to 2004 seen by long-time resident|11/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39998.html|18|ndxe199401| Strange sights in the sky over Oahu from about 1994 to 2004 seen by long-time resident<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m so glad I found this site.  I was born and raised in Honolulu, and have spent a lot of time outdoors looking at the night sky.  I am sober; I don&#39;t use any drugs and seldom drink.  Over the years I have seen a quite a few things I could not explain in the skies above Oahu. I&#39;m glad to have a place to share them here.  At the times these things happened I was either alone, or with one person and it was wierd not to be able to talk about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ABOUT THE TIMES AND DATES, THE FORM HERE DOESN&#39;T FIT.  THESE THINGS OCCURED BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 1994 AND THE PRESENT AND VARIOUS TIMES AND LOCATIONS ON OAHU.  MOST WERE ONLY WITNESSED BY ME BUT ONE OR TWO WERE WITNESSED BY OTHERS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all the most recent thing was in the ocean outside Waikiki.  This occured approximately around 2002 or 2003.  On more than one occasion, I saw lights I could not explain in the ocean outside of Waikiki.  I saw these from Kaimana beach on the eastern end of Waikiki at the foot of Diamond Head.  There were yellow lights.  They did not behave either like airplaces or boats.  They were above the water. If I remember correctly they looked like flares (Although they were much larger, larger and brighter than stars or airplanes).  Their movements made no sense.  If I remember correctly, they burned brightly in one place and then sank slowly and disappeared before they hit the water.  They were perhaps a mile or more out to sea, seemingly directly out from Kaimana.  I saw these bright yellow lights on more than on occasion.  If I remember correctly there were more than one in a row.  My friend, a social worker, also saw then and we were freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps around 1994 I saw the most spectacular thing.  It was twilight at Queen&#39;s surf in Waikiki.  To the West, out to sea from Makakilo and Waianae, hundreds of feet up in the sky, I saw a spectacular display.  Fluorescent green squiggles appeared high in the sky, one after another.  They would fade and more would appear.  This went on for a while.  It looked like someone air brushing designs on a T-shirt.  This was NOT the &#34;green flash&#34; people sometimes see in Hawaii after the sunset.  In spite of the fact that thousands of people should have seen this, I found no mention of it in the media, and I checked. I think I also checked somewhere like Bishop Museum which has astronomers and people like that.  No one else reported it.  One friend speculated that it must have been was rockets or missiles launched from the military base on Kauai [which would probably be Barking Sands].  This occurance was spectacular,unmistakeable, distinct and went on for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At other times, I&#39;ve seen lights in the night sky that seem to behave in odd ways if they were to be aircraft.  This could be their movement, or brightness.  Most of these I&#39;ve seen from Kahala or near Sandy Beach.  Perhaps some from Waikiki.  I don&#39;t remember the details that much now, just thinking, that light isn&#39;t moving correctly for an airplane, or it looks too big.  If I remember correctly most were yellow light, or perhaps white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere in the early or mid nineties, I saw the most incredible sights at Waimanalo beach in eastern Oahu.  These may well all be natural.  I just thought they were spectacular.  On this particular day, I saw an awesome rainbow coming straight down from a cloud to the sea.  About sunset, which was taking place on the other side of a mountain range, a sight appeared in the eastern sky about where the sun rises.  This on the horizon was over the water.  Black rays emanated from this spot, like a reverse sunset.  Lots of people saw it, they just looked transfixed, but no one said anything, strangely. Combined with the rainbow and something else I&#39;ve forgotten, the energy was intense that day.  It was special.  I would be grateful to know what that was, if anyone knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, between about 2000 and 2002, I saw one more thing.  I was near Punchbowl.  It was probably between about 3 and 5 in the afternoon.  This cloud came overhead, but it was not like any cloud I have ever seen.  It seemed unusually radiant and important.  It resembled a city in the sky.  I was transfixed by it.  I remember I wanted to call an aquaintance who is spiritually sensitive and religious because I thought she too would understand that something was afoot.  I don&#39;t think that was an ordinary &#34;cloud.&#34;  I&#39;ve wondered in it concealed a UFO, or something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I can specifically remember at this time.  I&#39;ve noticed other reports on this site of strange lights over the ocean outside of Waikiki that are like my stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/1/94 00:00|El Segundo|CA|Other|30 minutes|What I'm seeing, please help.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103810.html|19|ndxe199401| What I&#39;m seeing, please help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in El Segundo, Ca.. I live on the very Westside of my town. Where I live my backyard ends and a sand dune begins for about a football size then starts Hyperion station begins then you’re at the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a night owl in bed by 4am. To the south of me is a Chevron refinery and to the north of me is LAX Airport.  For about 20 years or so I’ve seen odd lights in the sand dunes, i.e. (transparent shapes of crafts with lights on top or bottom or the sides or in the middle. The lights are always dim. ).  This happens in all kinds of weather I thought it might be reflex ion from planes taking off or landing or maybe flying over real high but they should change but they don’t.  I don’t have any great cameras that can take black night pictures so I don’t have pictures of them.  The oddness is I have sat in my back yard for 5 mins.  To 1 hour. And odd things happen. In that time have gotten up made myself a cup of tea and have come back and they are still there but if I go 2 house down to a gate to get into the dune they are gone and when I go back home they are still gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can they know I’m watching but don’t want me to get to close?  Please can you tell me what I’m seeing?<n>
