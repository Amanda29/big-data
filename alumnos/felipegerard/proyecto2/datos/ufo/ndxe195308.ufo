Here is what was observed by myself and 4 or 5 other people.  Something I never forgot as a child.  While looking across the water as we often did in the evening, we saw 4-5 round lights hovering overhead about 2-oclock above the horizon at what appeared to be above the normal flight paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we observed these strange lights they moved eratickly to and fro for about 3 to 4 min  then suddenly and silently moved into formation similar to the way military jets would position themselves ,only these objects were not moving in any direction they remained still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly one by one they shot strait into space in an instant and out of sight without a sound, faster then any plane could ever move more like a bullet I&#39;m hoping this discription triggers someone elses memory of this strange sighting after all this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

8/15/53 19:00|Artesia|NM|Other||Burnt orange spheres.|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96887.html|2|ndxe195308| Burnt orange spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1953/54 I around the age of 7 living in Artesia, NM; which is around 36 miles east of Roswell.  The neighborhood kids were gathered for a game of &#34;kick the can &amp;quot; when suddenly a burnt orange sphere around 3 feet in diameter appeared silently gliding about 4 or 5 feet above the power lines.  It was moving so slowly that we were able to walk and follow it down the street.  It paused above an intersection that had a large vacant lot on one corner and a small number of houses on the other corners.  I observed within the sphere what at the time I thought was burnt orange smoke swirling within the globe emitting a light that did not illuminate any of the surrounding area.  I also noticed in the center of the sphere was appeared to be a turning disc that reminded exactly of the disc on the old electric meters of the time.  We followed this disc giddily as children do, but after it paused it seemed we just as suddenly began to fear it for some reason and! all ran home to our own homes.  I told my folks, of course, they didn&#39;t believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that experience I began seeing UFO&#39;s for the rest of my life.  Particularly through the rest of my childhood.  I had my last encounter in the area when I was 19 years and was preparing to Nam.  I&#39;ve also seen formations of them; which was witnessed by many high school friends.  I do not want to diverge topics, so I&#39;ll return to the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 15 y/o I was helping a friend as he was flagging for a crop duster in the early predawn hours.  We were west of town and noticed the same type and color of sphere again, but this time it was at a distance of 1/4 mile or so and appeared larger that the one that was hovering over the power lines.  It astonished me because it appeared to be, at least, 6 feet in diameter from that distance.  It appeared to setting down in a gulley, but we could not investigate because we were needed to assist the crop duster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this relates to the fireballs you&#39;ve described, but it&#39;s closest to any comparison I&#39;ve ever heard.  I hope this has some relevance for you, so I wanted to share it.  I am now 65 y/o and of all my experiences this is the one that has dogged me every day for all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your tireless work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>
8/15/53 11:00|Louisville|KY|Circle|6 to 10 sec|I heard Them!|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42544.html|3|ndxe195308| I heard Them!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright sunny Saturday morning in August of 1953 and not a cloud in the sky around 10:30 to 11:00 as I left the barber shop.  I only live a half a block away and as I walked toward the curb to cross the street I was going in a southwest direction.  Now for what ever reason I just stopped and looked up and slightly to my right, which would be in a  northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that instant I saw a round object come from out of sight straight down.  It was as though the blue sky open to let this object in.  It was very high but I could detect that it was spinning and it looked as tho is was transparent because it was the color of the blue sky, round in shape and spinning.  This object moved extremely fast downward and stopped instantly, it was just setting their spinning no more that a few seconds when.  Now this is very hard to explain, I had a thought as I stared at this object  that someone was saying, &#34;we have been spotted,&#34; just as soon as that thought went through my intellect this round, spinning, transparent like object accelerated straight up and out of sight instantly. It was gone.  As I think back to this encounter  it last may have consumed 6 to 10 sec at most.  But it was 6 -10 seconds I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/7/53 21:00|Vallejo|CA|Light|60 min|At first we thought they were shooting stars|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17002.html|4|ndxe195308| At first we thought they were shooting stars<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a hot summer night in 1953.A group of boys were playing football on the front lawn of our grade school.After a while we tired and laid down on the grass and look up to a heaven full of stars. We decided to see how many shooting stars we could see.One kid said look there&#39;s one and after a while another said did you see that? We said what.He said that a shooting star came out of that bright star up there.he pointed so we watched the bright star.( It seemed brighter than the others) what we saw was not only objects come out and a light coming on and it shoot away a incredible speed.But then others coming back at incredible speed like a shooting star. stopping in front of this bright star.A beam of light coming on than disappeared into the bright star. We observed this for a while. We also felt a little uneasy.A cop car came slowly driving by so I went over to stop him and tell him.He got out but I think the strain on his neck was to much for him. (Sometime it took a while for one to show) I don`t think they believed us.They did pull off to the corner and watched.We finally left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the date may be approximate, although the witness has provided an exact date for the incident.

8/1/53 14:00|San Bernadino Mtns, Church Camp|CA|Disk|15 minutes|UFO SAUCER APPEARS TO 7TH GRADER GROUP IN CALIF. 1953|7/1/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23545.html|5|ndxe195308| UFO SAUCER APPEARS TO 7TH GRADER GROUP IN CALIF. 1953<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a church counselor at Forest Home Camp in the San Bernadino mountains. A group of 7th graders were supposed to swim in a lake on the mountain top, but moss or scum was on our side of the lake, so we just started talking. The subject was Hawaiian dancing, I remember, and suddenly, one little boy screamed, &#34;Hey! Look at THAT!!!!&#34; It was silver, and looked like two saucers glued together with windows where they joined.  It was so close, we could see figures at the windows that surrounded the middle seam. This was 1953, and none of us had ever seen anything move like this craft did. It hovered and then it completely disappeared until it hovered diagonally from where we had just seen it. These 7th graders were beside themselves enjoying this unbelievable demonstra- tion of mechanical manuvering. I was awestruck and was sure it belonged to our govern- ment, and how wonderful!  The boys in the group knew it was a UFO, but I didn&#39;t until years later. My friend and I went to the Iowa State Fair, and they announced that there was a showing of a guided missile. I was so excited to see it up close, and when we got there, it was like a stove pipe with a tin hat and nothing compared to the craft we had seen. I asked the military man where the craft was that looked like two saucers with the windows in the middle, and that hovered here and hovered there and disappeared in between times, and he looked at me like I was crazy and said, &#34;Lady, we don&#39;t have ANYTHING like THAT!&#34;  Well, I was so upset to think that what I saw might not belong to America, that my friend and I walked four miles home and I was in terror the whole time thinking how I was so wrong and those little seventh graders were so hep and right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how large this thing was because we had nothing to compare it to since it was above us and we were on the top of the mountain looking up. The windows were not clear glass, and we saw moving figures, but they were dim and didn&#39;t seem large-sized from where we were looking. (Years later, my husband and I heard a woman at my Dad&#39;s house in Myrtle Beach, SC, tell how the same type of craft that I saw landed on a freeway where she was driving, and it was enormous in size, and all the people moved to the side of the road and got out of their cars to get a better look. Some teen-ager was behind this woman, and he was so excited, he grabbed her and started jumping up and down and screaming...&#34;I finally saw one!  I finally saw one!&#34;  She was more afraid of him than the UFO.  She said she was always afraid to tell anyone about her experience because she felt people think you&#39;re crazy to admit you had such an encounter.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

8/1/53 12:00|Berkeley|MO|Fireball|5 minutes|Early 50's sighting in Berkeley, Missouri|1/22/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34514.html|6|ndxe195308| Early 50&#39;s sighting in Berkley, Missouri<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi, the date and time I listed is approximate. I was about 8 years old at time of sighting and some details (as time) are fuzzy. As I remember I was playing on street where we lived in Berkley, Missouri near Lambert Airport. I lived on Purefoy (maybe mispelled) its off Airport Road.  We saw a bright object (orange) in the sky and as I remember we just watched it.  As best I can recall we were looking north toward Florissant and the object was low in the sky but rising.  I went inside and told my mom of what we saw and that was about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Mr. Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for responding to our possible mutual sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Concerning my sighting and possible date, I tried to time frame it as best as possible.  We lived at the Berkley address for a short time from the summer of 53 to early winter of 54.  I heard you mention your sighting on Art&#39;s show in the past and said it sounded like my experience, but your sighting in 54 was a little late for mine.  If you believe summer of 53 is possible for yours, we may have seen the same occurence.  As I remember there was no sound associated with what I saw.  Just a bright object, believe it was orangish yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again for responding,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see sighting for July 1954 over Lambert Airport, St. Louis, MO.
