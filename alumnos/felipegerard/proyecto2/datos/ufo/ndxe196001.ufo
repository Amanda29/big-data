My brother and mother followed us between our house and our grandparents. It was cold, clear sky, mid winter. I have consulted with the memories of my parents and my brother as to be as correct as possible as memories tend to be distorted with time. We all agree to the following: It was dark and we were walking between houses. My mother noticed a large  fireball like-disc hovering in the sky,appearing very high, yet very visible and detail could be seen of pieces of burning material falling away, yet too, this object stood still for about 20 minutes. My grandmother and grandfather came out to see also. The object slowly began moving westward and stopped burning and simply glowed reddish yellow and over the next minutes of the sighting, the object faded away from our sight. At Peter&#39;s suggestion , I am filing this report  and felt it irrelavent, yet, according to Peter,any report, no matter how long ago,may very well be remembered by someone else also in a different geographic location, and become relavent, Thanks Peter Davenport, for the best Ufology site on the internet..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Thank you for the compliment!  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and have looked at video tape he took on August 2nd, 2003.  He seems quite credible and objective to us.  We strongly suspect there is merit to his reports.  PD))<n>
