6/15/51 20:30|Greenville|MS|Disk|5 minutes|Sighting of white lights in evening sky west of Greenville MS circa 1951.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48518.html|3|ndxe195106| Sighting of white lights in evening sky west of Greenville MS circa 1951.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observation from 612 Starling Street at late dusk or early night, approximately due west or WSW. Their elevations were approximately 30-40 degrees above the horizon. I do not recall clouds in the vicinity. One of the five objects was larger than the rest. I recall that the objects appeared white and having an intensity that you could continuously observe without having to shift your gaze. They did not appear shiny like looking directly into the beam of a flashlight, automobile headlight or an aircraft landing light. The diameter of each of these objects was maybe 2-3 degrees of arch and and entire formation traversed not more than 15 degrees. They appeared and disappeared several times over approximately five minutes. Appearance and disappearance were much longer cycles than pulsation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I learned later that several calls to the local police and the newspaper were made concerning this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/6/51 02:00|Mount Pinos (beyond ski area parking)|CA|Disk|2 hours|2 ufos seen over mt pinos,  people in sleeping bags gone in morning, airline pilots on ground see objects also|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58458.html|4|ndxe195106| 2 ufos seen over mt pinos,  people in sleeping bags gone in morning, airline pilots on ground see objects also<n> <n><n> <n><n> An earlier sighting in the early 50’s more than likely 1951 my family went camping on mt pinos in the los padres national forest. They would go out on the road past the ski parking area where only a few hunters and campers went.  There would usually be only 6 to 8 campsites occupied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They got there after 10 pm and noticed 40-50 people out in sleeping bags without tents. This is at 8600 feet so it gets cold.   Mom told me they set up their tent and went to sleep. My brother 3 or 4 at the time slept in the car with my mom’s aunt (grantee).<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 am my mom told me she heard a lot of people walking around and thought &#34;that’s a lot of people going to the bathroom&#34; in the morning the tented normal campers were there but all the people in sleeping bags were gone.  She ask her aunt how she had slept.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her aunt responded that she felt really safe last night as there were 2 helicopters hovering overhead for several hours and they were shining lights down.  They also had multicolored lights showing and made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several days later my dad who worked in Hollywood was eating lunch and 2 airline pilots who knew him ask him if he had gone camping on Mount Pinos on Saturday night.   They had some acres in alfalfa up near Quail Lake and were out irrigating that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had seen 2 UFO’s fly in from the east and then a few hours later fly back out to the east. These were army air corps bomber pilots that were now working for a major airline and could not ask anybody in the industry or they would have their pilot tickets pulled.<n>

Along the length (centered) was something that looked like port holes. The top was dome shaped.  I remember it just sat there, no movement, no nothing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked for about five minutes because I had never seen anything like it.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a blimp nor helicopter or plane.  Living about 40 miles from an air base I was use to blimps, planes and helicopters. What I saw wasn&#39;t any of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has haunted me for 54 years and whenever I go home for a visit I always ride over to just stare at the place where I saw that thing, trying to figure out what I saw and why.  Even when I&#39;m on the phone etc., I find myself doodling and ending up drawing the object without realizing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I am 60 years old and always kept that moment like a secert.  I told one person years ago and they thought I was nuts, plus seeing programs on TV concerning UFOs didn&#39;t help me open up either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOW I WANT TO FIND OUT OR TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS I SAW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

It did not rotate to show another shape but appeared to be moving sideways.  There was a single row of white or yellow lights from end to end of the object, halfway from top to bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was at dusk with the end of sunset taking place about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two intriguing reports from the 1950&#39;s submitted by this witness.

6/1/51 07:00|Brandon (Canada)|MB|Disk|30 minutes|Circular Craft and Man in Black Sighted in Summer of 1951 at Brandon, Manitoba, Canada|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16296.html|7|ndxe195106| ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Circular Craft and Man in Black Sighted in Summer of 1951 at Brandon, Manitoba, Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have included the following account of my 1951 observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PLACE:  					Brandonanitoba<n> <n><n> TIME:  					Saturday morn (7 am), Summer of 1951<n> <n><n> LENGTH OF OBSERVATION:  	Approximately 30 minutes<n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:		Circular, Saucer Shaped, Wingless Aircraft, 4 ft. to 6 ft. in diameter, 2 ft. to 3 ft. in height, bottom half:  black, top half: clear canopy with a 1 ft. square black box centered under the canopy, no insignias on the craft.<n> <n><n> SPEED OF CRAFT:			Varied from 0 mph to max. of 5 ph<n> <n><n> PROPULSION:				No sound, smell, light or visible means of propulsion<n> <n><n> DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION: Me and another 5 year old boy (can’t recall his name) were playing catch with a ball in front of Flemming Elementary school located in south west Brandon, Manitoba.  The aircraft was first observed by the other boy when he missed catching the ball that I had thrown to him.  I asked him why he had missed the easy catch and he told me to look over my left shoulder into the sky.  The object was first seen as round and black, about the size of a quarter, against a white cloud.  The craft was slowly descending until it reached about 30 ft. above us and about 30 ft to the west.  The craft was tilted on a 45 degree to the ground.  It leveled off and stayed motionless for a few minutes.  It then began to move at about 5 mph directly over our heads until it stopped across the street a few inches above some power lines.  It wobbled slightly as it hovered in this position for about 15 minutes.  During this time I threw a rock at the craft but was unable to reach it.  I shouted to the other boy to notify some adults residing in the nearby houses but he did not want to leave the area.  I crossed the street to a park about 50 ft away from the craft and sat on the grass without taking my eyes off the craft.  After about 15 minutes the craft started to move away from the power lines at a speed of about 5 mph and ascended over my head, disappearing into the clouds. The next morning, just before sunrise, I was visisted in my bedroom by a man in black standing at the foot of my bed.  I heard a sound, which woke me up, like many bees buzzing.  Very small dust-like particles were swarming at the foot of my bed.  The particles converged forming the image of the man in black.  He was translucent, ghost-like, and wore a black suit.  He had white hair in a pompadore style.  He did not make a noise but moved his right arm in a slow upward motion of greating.  A whiteish, blue light was emited from his direction.  I was so scared that I hid under the covers of my bed in terror.  I must of finaly fell asleep and when I awoke everything was back to normal.  I have never seen anything like this again.<n>
