I was completely paralyzed and lost conciousness soon after.  I had a dream in which I remember my skull being &#34;cracked&#34; open.  I didn&#39;t actually see anything, but I remember the sensation much like people remember sensations during surgery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke in my bed, I was unharmed, but for some unknown reason, I was terrified.  I heard a strange noise outside that sounded like a loud &#34;hum&#34; and a steady vibration that rattled every fibre of my body.  The noise circled around my house several times at an incredibly fast rate, at least one revolution every few seconds.  I could not see an object and I was too afraid to look out a window, but I did see some strange lights glowing through the window.  I had never heard this sound before, but for some reason, it terrified me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound had to have come from a machine of great power and the &#34;hum&#34; was similar to that your hear at a power relay staion only amplified thousands of times.  I recognized the sound, but had no memory of it.  I only knew that I didn&#39;t like it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to wake my family up, but to my astonishment, the would not wake up as if they were sedated somehow.  Eventually, the object left the area.  I was almost convinced it was a dream, but I forced myself to stay awake till morning and I turned on the television to establish my sanity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, as soon as the object left, I was able to wake my family, but they had no memory of the indcident and dismissed my experience as a vivid dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The experience was the most terrifying thing I have witnessed in my life and I have suffered from post-tramatic stress syndrome since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not the first person in my family that has had a close encounter with a UFO.  My grandmother woke in the middle of the night to observe a diamond shaped object that had a blinding glow.  The next day, her eyes swelled shut and the doctor that examined her indicated that her retinas were burned.  The ammount of damage to her eyes was consistent to light several times that of the sun; they had no explanation, but she recovered.  The object also burned a trail the the yard just outside the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father also experienced a close encounter with a UFO when he was young.  Since he grew up with no electricity and no automobiles in the middle of ND, the closest he could describe the objects he saw were, &#34;fire-wagons&#34;.  He has little memory of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a history of Schizophrenia in the Family, but my Grandmother, my Father, and I have not been diagnosed with the condition.  I have never experienced any other vivid hallucinations in my life...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am convinced that what happened was completely real…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

4/16/92 12:00|Bowling Green|KY|Disk|1 hour|Strange Witness Encounter: Famous Shootdown of US Aircraft by UFO|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45199.html|5|ndxe199204| Strange Witness Encounter: Famous Shootdown of US Aircraft by UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending you this message to report a very strange encounter that took place at the place where I work regarding the now famously reported shootdown of a P-51 Mustang USAF aircraft, or some other military aircraft, back in 1948? by a UFO.  I think the downed pilot was named Mentel if I can remember correctly.  This UFO shootdown supposedly occured over, or near, Simpson County Kentucky.  Back in 1992 I had never even heard of this story before, so I at first dismissed it all as a silly hoax.  So here is the story.  As I was working one day an older man and woman came in to my workplace and asked me for any information that I could provide to them related to the possible location of the crash site of a P-51 Mustang aircraft etc. which had crashed back in 1948? near Simpson County, Kentucky.  These two people did act very strangely, and were very secretive at first.  They seemed to be looking around the room in my workplace a lot for some odd reason.  I asked them what the crash was related to, and the man frankly told me that the crashed plane that he wanted to locate was shot down by a very large flying disk, or UFO.  I at first considered this man and woman to be some sort of pranksters.  So I proceded to ask the man how that he knew that this story was true.  Also, I told him that the US Military had probably already retrieved the downed aircraft a long time ago anyway.  Yet, he persisted and then told me an astonishing story-true or untrue.  The man informed me that he was a good friend of the pilot that was shot from the sky that day back in 1948?.  He told me that he was flying in formation with Mentel that day and witnessed the whole incident.  He said that he saw the object very clearly himself, and it was no balloon or anything like that.  The man indicated that it was indeed a very large and bright flying disk that he saw.  Strangely, he also said that he even saw the beam of light come out from the UFO that destroyed the military aircraft.  I told him that I would have to look in some older newspaper journals etc. and see if I could find him any material related to this subject.  He gave me his e-mail address and they both left.  I still thought this might be an elaborate hoax or prank.  Later on though I read in a UFO book that some sort of incident like this DID supposedly happen back in 1948? or so.  Needless to say I was a little bit shocked.  Could this man have been telling me the TRUTH about a very strange incident like this?  I tried to e-mail this man and woman in Indiana with this new information I found for them.  Yet, I never received a reply back from them.  Later on I found out that nobody with their names given to me even lived in Indiana.  Who were these people?  This story seems really creepy to me now after the encounter.  I don&#39;t know if their story is true or untrue, but it makes one wonder though.  Hoax, or no hoax, this story is somewhat interesting and odd.  We can only speculate as to it&#39;s accuracy.  I thought you might like to read this.  Thank you.----JG<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were comming home in my van on a dirt road. I looked to what I believe to be N/E at a large hill in the distance. Above that hill floated the object. If you held a quarter at arms length that is how big it appeared. It looked like a round ball of fire with small flames comming off in all directions including straight at the viewer. Every once in a while it would dip behind the hill and then back up. I blew it off at the time as a military flair, but what flair suspends that long a period of time. Here is the clincher. It did not look &#34;HOT&#34; at all it gave off a dull orange color but I did not get the impression of heat or light. Intense light like a flair would make. There was a military base in that direction<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are attempting to clear up some of the apparent inconsistencies in this report, but the witness has not responded to our queries, yet.  He indicates the sighting occurred in Connecticut, but he cites San Bernardino County as being the location.  Also, in his personal data, he indicates an address in a town in Canada, which we cannot find on a map.  Hence, the report may not be a serious one.  The date above is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP #1 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> My error: Landers California. I lived there at the time. Landers is just outside Victorville California. The home of the now defunct F-4 Wild Weasel squadron. Also referenced in the 50&#39;s Sci-Fi classic &#34;The Giant Tarantula&#34; they referenced the base in the movie. To paraphrase &#34;they were going to send to<n> <n><n> Victorville&#34;(for air support). This was George AFB. I also can add for a reference point that when the town folk tried to blow it up(the tarantula) it was traveling toward Victorville on Highway 247. My sighting was a few miles behind the spider away from the direction it was traveling and far to the left<n> <n><n> of the highway. I intent to look at the California map and draw a pretty good location and picture of the sighting. I believe the direction I saw the object was toward &#34;China Lake&#34; military installation. If you know the history of Giant Rock then you know the UFO history of the area. I now live in Mesa, Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END #1))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP #2 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Pete should have responded to this before I responded to the other e-mail.

I had recently moved from Ca. to Mo. I was with two friends about 10 o&#39;clock at night and we saw what appeared to be the head lights of a car, except the lights were spaced out further than car head lights. It was moving very slowly towards us, so we pulled over next to a pasture to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a tree line on the other side of the field, and whatever we saw moved in between us and the trees about 35 - 50 ft above the ground. The two lights became very bright and began to spin clockwise around each other. It seemed as if we could possibly see a silhouette of something behind the lights, but we could not tell what shape it was. After about 30 seconds of spinning they leveled off, dimmed and began moving slowly away in just about the same direction, and a few seconds later the lights just turned off or disappeared. The strangest part was that we never heard a single sound from whatever it was. I went to the the spot we that we saw it at 10 am the next morning, and there was nothing out of the ordinary, no crop circles or dead cows or any thing at all odd. of course, I had no testing equipment, so I don&#39;t know if there was any residual radiation or anything like that. I never really thought about reporting it or anything like that, until I recently saw a rerun of Unsolved Mysteries,and saw interviews with some people, including some police officers who had tracked something with a similar description moving across the midwest at about the same time frame. What did we see???<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a clear night you could see the stars great and we were laying on bedrock looking up at them. We talk of sattelite&#39;s something I had never seen or at least recognized. Later I saw what just seemed to me another star but all of a sudden it moved from north to the southern part of the sky so fast it was like a blink of an eye. Then it happen again only at an angle from which it had come from and then another did. At this time I tapped my friend and told him to look and pointed to were one had stoped and now three were moving at random moving across the sky so fast you could hardly keep up with them and then take off again in another direction. Sometimes in this movement across the sky they would make a right angle without hessitation, or delay. At this point I asked if he saw them also and he did, and about all he could say is that they did&#39;nt move like any sattelite he had ever seen? What were they? We don&#39;t know, they resembled a star or sattelite, but moved so fast across such a distance and at random making angled manovers that I believe that it was&#39;nt man made machinery. Nor were they falling stars those I have seen. Oh and I forgot all 3 moved off in a southern direction and just dissappered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Approximate date.  PD))<n>

It was in complete focus hovering above a large tree nearby a farm road. It was Oval and slightly Saucer shaped with an array of multicolored lights, some lights were blinking in a sequence across and some in a circular motion, while others where strobing and some slightly plusating. Lights were colored red, green, yellow, blue and white. THe UFO remained Hovering as we proceded down the US HWY 59. I felt drawn to go to it but, the person I was with was too terrified to pursue it. I know what I saw was a genuine UFO. I have a strong background knowledge of aircraft being, that my father was a pilot and was in the USAF. I have been taught many things about aircraft from air shows to flying in helicopters over the Gulf of Mexico. If anyone else has seen this same type of UFO please post your sighting I waited 17 ! years to do it and I don&#39;t think I will ever forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was laying on the hood of my car gazing at the clear night sky.  I noticed a very small light that was clearly too high to be an airplane.  I thought it might be a sattelite.  But it was then joined by several others. The most bizarre aspect was that they darted around in different directions in a manner that is seemingly impossible. I am not sure of the number but as stated above, it was 8-10.  The most exciting part of the event was that, after I watched for several minutes, I got the feeling that the objects were aware of my presence, (even though they were miles above)! It was a comforting feeling.  And after a while, they disappeared. I returned the next night to see if they were there again.  A smaller number of them did in fact appear, but the duration was only a few minutes.  I have never reported this before, officially.  I was inspired to do so after hearing Mr. Davenport on Coast to Coast AM.

I noticed a solid light ,  from a close distance I immediately thought it was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I listen for the noise of the motor but the object made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to alert my friends of this strange object with no sound but I could not because I felt in a trance or mesmerized by the sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I thought to myself it was heading in the south direction so it should pass over the Collin-Bennet building and the reflection of the light should illuminate the building and the object because it was passing at a low altitude so i stared. Continuing to walking down the sidewalk my friends was talking. I was so amazed with what i was seeing i did not hear a word they were saying. With anticipation the object finally proceeded to pass over the building and truthfully what i saw next is indescribable but i will try my best. The light hit at a very close proximity and it looked very dim and controlled the light illuminate a very small portion of the building almost like a beam unlike nothing i have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believed the object was no more than 10 feet from the top of the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the light should have been more visible. The light from the object was only visible within a diameter of no more than 5-10 feetin a controlled space. I never seen that in a beam of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object passed out of sight range i immediately turned to my friends and said&#34; DID YOU SEE THAT &#34;?. They looked at me with such confusion it still effects me to this day. Its been seventeen years and i still think about that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cant get it out of my head so i decided to write you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This date has an emotional connection because a week later my uncle ((name deleted)) died of cancer so that’s why i am sure that it was in April of 1992.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No later than the last week of March 1992 for any skeptics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved slow, steady, and balanced about 5 mph when it passed over the building there was no type of vibration or movement. I also remember that night the news had reported a strange light over downtown hartford.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Our home was high above the city and the back yard looked out on rolling hills of farm land.  We were trying to move some articles, after work, before the big move on Saturday.  As I brought in a load, my wife asked &#34;Is that a UFO&#34;.  She was standing at the sliding glass doors in the kitchen, looking out above the hills in the back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a disc shaped object off to the East, Southeast.  It seemed to have multicolored lights rotating around the perimeter, red, green, blue, and yellow as I remember.  There was also a very bright spot light shining directly down from the craft.  I really couldn&#39;t give a very accurate description of the size or distance, but my best guess would be that the object was about the size of a small plane, say 50 ft in diameter and possibly 1 to 2 miles away.  There was no noticable sound which I would have expected with a helicopter or plane.  This area is very quiet, and having served in Vietnam, I am quite familiar with the sounds of helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my binoculars and watched the craft until my wife said, &#34;We need to finish unloading the Van&#34;.  On each trip back in the house, I would again go into the back yard and look at the craft.  I think it just started moving then moved away real fast and disappeared.  In the following two years that I lived in that house, I spent many evenings in the back yard and never again saw anything remotely like this disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years later I tried looking up any information that might have been reported in the local paper.  I found none.  Roughly three years ago a local radio talk show host mentioned he saw a UFO when he lived in Santa Paula, which is roughly East, Southeast of Ventura.  The time period sounded about the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About four years after the incident I was talking to an ex next door neighbor.  She mentioned that there had been a UFO sighting in that area and that she had gone to pick up her daughter at an evening church class.  Something above the car shinded a light so bright on her car, that she had to pull over to the side of the road until the light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting, I had been a mechanic at a local dealership for about 8 years.  My wife was a technologist in the medical field, and the neighbor was the wife of a local doctor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was busy digging a hole for a post.The day was overcast, no rain, about 65 degrees F, no wind. It was serene and quiet. The cabin is on the shore of the lake between two stands of hemlock and cedar. The area between these trees affords a fairly wide look at the sky.  While working away I heard a sputtering sound above me similar to the sound you hear when dropping water on a hot griddle. I looked up and noticed a silver/gold sphere approximately 300ft. altitude passing overhead. It&#39;s speed was about 10mph, maybe a little faster. Diameter of the sphere was approx. 40ft. It had a sort of vaporish mist surrounding it that exuded no trail. I watched it pass over the trees and it disappeared from view. It appeared to be descending so I waited, listening, expecting to hear a crash of some kind. I did not hear a crash so I assumed it continued on. Because of the topography of the region I thought that by the time I found my car keys and chased out to have another look at it, it would be gone so I did not pursue the idea.       The sphere had no wires, ropes,etc. hanging from it. It was perfectly round. As it moved, basically in a straight line, it seemed to &#34;wobble&#34; a little at times. The hissing sputtering sound was constant.   I was not under the influence of drugs, alcohol or medication. I&#39;d had a full night&#39;s sleep. I have no history of mental illness.  I kept this sighting to myself for years. One day I was talking to another resident that lives in the area and he said he&#39;d seen the same thing several years earlier only over the river where it goes out of the lake. He didn&#39;t report his either.   Since then I&#39;ve told re-searchers about it and always get the response that my sanity is in question. Well, I know what I saw (and heard)......I never heard of a weather balloon that &#34;fizzles&#34; while aloft, however I&#39;m sure the experts will be glad to add their fact-based speculation.<n>

The li|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02453.html|16|ndxe199204| Summary : A green light was iluminating the ocean as we drove past-suddenly, a white light came out of the water and straight for our car. The light came up to my window and I screamed, my mom (the driver) hit the gas and the light stayed with us for about 10 seconds then retreated back into the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother is a nurse, I am a college student. Our family very upstanding in the community, PTA parents, my dad coaches Little League, I have 3 brothers, we are all conservative and skeptical, typical Republicans. My mother is especially rigid due to her profession, but what we saw was undeniable. My mom and I were driving along 17 Mile Drive about 22:05 one evening and we were perplexed by this glowing green light off the coast near Spanish Bay beach. We thought it might be shrimp boats(shrimpers fish usually in the middle of the night &amp; use irridescent green lights to attract the shrimp to the surface) but there were no boats on the surface of the water and the green area was far larger than shrimper lights. Plus, shrimpers as well as other fishermen do not usually fish off the coast of Pebble Beach,it is exclusive &amp; private. We kept driving, away from Spanish Bay, until we reached the Lodge. The green light was out of our sight as we entered the forest area. We were turnin! g to go home when I said, &#34;That light was just too weird, lets go see if it&#39;s still there.&#34; My mom was scared but we turned around and headed back towards Spanish Bay. About 22:18 the green light came back into view, underwater illumination that from a distance appeared to be a dome shaped structure laying on the floor of the ocean. We speculated that it was the lost city of Atlantis, it was really creepy, we were the only car on the road and we were both overwhelmed with a desire to turn around and head away from the scene. We continud a bit further, then we flipped a U-turn and began in the opposite direction again(I was  the passenger, with my side of the car facing the ocean at this point) Just as we accelerated to go, I looked out my window at the green dome, and this bright light beam shot out of the water and came directly to my window. I screamed and my mom hit the gas. We were going 81-85 miles per hour for about 10 seconds and the beam continued to shine in my window! , it&#39;s origin still the green dome under the water. I kept screaming and tried to climb into my mothers seat to escape the light, and suddenly the beam retreated back the way it came until it was back in the dome and disappeared. There was noise of some sort, like ringing at an almost inaudibly high pitch when the light was present, then it was gone when the beam retreated. We were both in shock, my mom drove home and I don&#39;t remember very much except talking to Pebble Beach Secirity with my parents later that night. I was severely disturbed by the incident, I couldn&#39;t sleep for about a week, and even then I slept in the same room as my parents. At the time of  this incident I was a senior in high school. I have since recovered, but I still have flashbacks. Needless to say I am now a firm believer in UFO&#39;s, as is my mother.<n>

Even though it occurred eight years ago I remember it like it was yesterday.  I pulled into a shopping center parking lot after first observing this while sitting in traffic.  I got out to look and follow it as it moved.  It was perfectly square-shaped with a textured surface.  It was probably about 300 feet or so up and it was moving in a straight line from south to north with no deviation from the wind.  It clearly was under controlled flight.  It slowly flipped end over end as it moved.  It was not travelling quickly; it was going at a slow, steady pace.  Even as it moved to the north and I began to lose sight of it I could still trace its path by the fact that the sun glinted off its trailing edge as it continued to flip end over end.  From the ground it really looked almost two-dimensional; it did not really have much bulk to it.  I have read books about UFO&#39;s off and on for years starting with Incident at Exeter by John Fuller and I never have read of an object even remotely resembling what I saw.  But it was midday during clear weather and there is no doubt what I saw.<n>

The orb was about 15 in diameter.  At that time my radio and head lights and other electronics on my car started to act funny (radio stopped working, head lights and dash lights started to blink out) When I saw it after going going down the hill it was about 30 feet in front of me hovering about 3 feet over the road in front of me (it was about 30 feet in front of me, when I first saw it, but I put my car in nuetral and coasted up to it within a few feet).  It then emitted a very bright green light that encompassed my car and then disappeared in a bright flash, the next thing I know is that I am pulling into my driveway in Meridian and it was 11:00pm in the night.  I immediatly called my mom and asked what time it was and she said it was 11:00pm.  It only takes about 25 minutes to reach Meridian from Nampa but yet it took me alomost 30 minutes longer.  I cannot explain what happened to me that night but I know what I saw was real. I would like to add that this is not an April Fools joke, this was a long time ago and I do not remeber the exact date, I just remeber that this was in April.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was sitting still above the tree line at the back of my neighborhood over the Nashua river.  It made no noise.  It had no apparent engines or flames or anything.  It was shiny – the craft was illuminated by the reflection from a full moon.  It was a very clear night.  About where the “2nd” story would be there was a row of what seemed like windows with an ivory light illuminating from them.  All along the bottom were colored lights (various colors).  I worked for the Air Force at the time as a contractor.  I know my planes VERY well.  This was not anything we have.  I held a security clearance at the time too and feared I would loose it if I came forward with type of information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I lost about 10 minutes of time.

While my scout platoon was in the desert at fort irwin ca on a training exercise I beleive we witnessed a ufo. Here&#39;s what I remember, about 2 am in the morning we were conducting a screen line waiting for an attack to come from the other unit that was in the box ie training area and we reported a light (helicopter) inbound about 500ft above the ground and roughly 5 miles out. we viewed this with night vision goggles. it continued in bound heading north, within a couple of minutes another scout vehicle reported contact with it. we all just kept looking at it because we thought it was a helicopter bringing in the enemy somewhere. A minute or so later another light and reported it as another helicopter was on the same path and heading in the same direction a few seconds after that we reported one more light(helicopter). so now we had three of them and at least one other scout vehicle was seeing the same thing and tracking it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a couple of minutes the lead copter went directly up in the air about  and the sky got brighter, really brighter, all this was happening about 5 miles from my position but it got so bright that you could see the change without your night vision goggles. we reported to the commander at the toc that we beleived a helo just exploded and we had a real world emergency. now all the scout vehicles could see the sky getting way brighter. I mean really bright and it was staying that way not like a firecracker but like a slow build to brightness. not daylight but definatly noticeable. We were rasing hell on the radio with the toc telling them to check with bluefor and see if they had a helicopter go down and we were looking for red stars which would signal a real world emergency. we saw none. after alot of radio chatter between the toc and us they said it was not a helicopter but they would investigate it. so for about an hr we watched the sky get really bright and the start to dim out and basically didnt do our mission any more but talked on the radio about what was going on. finally the toc told us that a missle from one of the airforce bases went awry and they had to self destruct it so thats what the lights were. about 1 hr later we saw orange lights moving in the desert floor like a fireball moving really fast. like it was racing up and down the floor in a super fast car. this also happened about 3-5 miles from my position but others saw it as well. the toc thought my entire platoon was nuts but we all saw it. finally the orange light went out and nothing else happened. after the mission ended a day or so later we all asked what was up and were told the missle story but no reference to the orange light other than special forces were supposedly in the area and may have been doing something. no special forces could have done what I saw. they had to have been driving on the desert floor 2000 miles an hr. after the first helicopter blew up or missle or whatever it was, the other lights just kept moving north and eventually went out of view. I truly believe I saw something and not what the army said it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The light was so intense my supply sergeant turned his back on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked what was wrong.  He said he thought it was the end of time taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light continued to increase over the next several minutes untill we could see all arround us, turning night into day, not quite like daylight but and orange glowing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time my whole company was awake and wanted to know what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light stayed this way for many more minutes until it faded back into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I tried to find out what had happened.

There were 80 foot trees on both sides of the road as far ahead as could be seen. It was at night when all of a sudden this huge object passed ahead maybe 100 yards ahead. Maybe 200 yards. It flew at tree top level and was as big as a 747 jet. No noise and it was traveling very slow. It had maybe 60 or 70 lights in different places. No certain order or anything. I have never ever seen so many lights on a plane in my entire life. I thought it was probably a military aircraft, but it had so many lights on it. I stopped the truck and we both just said WOW! What was that? We will never forget it. I know I will never forget it. I work for the City of Dallas ((deleted)) department. ((deleted)) years now. My friend is into real estate. He went to college in nacadoches, texas. I graduated from ((schools deleted)) Texas. I would say the height of it was maybe 60 foot high. We were headed to Sam Rayburn Lake in East Texas to go bass fishing with my friends Dad. His Dad had a house and boat there. We were maybe 50 miles from the Lake. The speed of this thing seemed like 30 miles an hour, but in the air it&#39;s hard to figure. That&#39;s about it. Just driving down an east texas two lane highway in the middle of the Angelina Forest and seeing a dark object the size of a jet or transport with so many lights it was beautiful. The lights were red, green, blue, white, maybe yellow, I can&#39;t remember. I wish I would have had a video going. It&#39;s been a few years since this happened but I felt compelled to send this to you. It&#39;s been on my mind for a long time. Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
