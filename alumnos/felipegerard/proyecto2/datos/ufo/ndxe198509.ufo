It was just after day break.  I was walking along the campus center pond when I looked up over my shoulder to see what appeared to be a rotating like drum/cylinder that was defined by vertical rectangles of light.  Nothing else defined the object but the rectangles of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the light panels were maybe 10 feet wide by 15 feet tall.  The drum was rotating in a right to left stop and go motion if I remember correctly.  It was a silent moving rotating object that stayed in place as it sat on top of the fog above the pond.  The UFO lasted for a few seconds and seemed to just fade out in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked about to see if there were any other people walking that morning on campus but there were not. I was alone.  I remember just having a sense of curiosity and wonder, but no emotions of fear or concern at what I saw.<n>

9/26/85 21:25|Austin|TX|Chevron|20 min.|Chevron flew 5 mph, 150 yards from me, 200 feet off the ground.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60995.html|3|ndxe198509| Chevron flew 5 mph, 150 yards from me, 200 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was inspired to finally report about what I saw 23 years ago by the recent interest spurred by the Stevenville, Texas sighting.  I have probably told this to approximately 10 to 15 people in all these years because as any other person that has seen a UFO can tell you “people think you are crazy”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened in September or October of 1985.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a teacher for a trade school for Austin Community Collage and a local union in Austin Texas.  I let out class around 9:00 PM on a Thursday night.  My route home took me down South Lamar to Brodie Lane.  This area of Austin was mostly farm land back then.  As I turned left onto Brodie, I saw an object in the sky moving over the farm house on my right.  I stopped and got out of my truck to get a better look.  There were a few other cars going by and I tried to get them to stop and see but they just kept going by.  It was approximately 150 yards from me and 200 feet off the ground.  It looked like both wings of a jet connected in the middle, boomerang or V shaped,  but there was no fuselage.  I later learned it was called chevron. On the front there were 6 extremely bright white lights, two close together on each side of the center and  single lights towards the tips.  Behind it where fuselage should be, was a hazy, foggy, reddish-pink glow.  It was moving steadily only about 5 miles per hour, silently except for a 3 or 4 second blast of what sounded like high pressure air release every 30 seconds.  I watched it for around 20 minutes  as it flew north-northwest directly over Barton Creek Mall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Bergstram, the closest Air Force base at that time, to report the sighting.  For the next few days I went back and forth with phone calls with different people and then they gave me the brush off.  They did, however, tell me they had no aircraft flying that night.  It feels good to report this after all these years.  This is the first time I have written down this experience.  I hope it will jog someone else’s memory that was in the area and serious investigation continues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I turned to my passenger and told him to look up and tell me what he sees.  He asked me to pull over quickly. We stopped and watched for about four minutes two disk shaped objects about 500 feet over Tradewinds Park.  There were fogged windows on each saucer and we could see shapes moving past them.  The top was silver and the bottom was a glowing orange.  After awhile, the left saucer slowly moved south and blinked out of existence.  About thirty seconds later the second did the same. When they departed, there was no sound whatsoever. I am a general manager of an office in Ft. Lauderdale and my passenger worked with me.  I also called the Sun Sentinel and they said there was already over a thousand calls about this sighting.  Then, I called the Washington State UFO Bureau and they wanted a response from me.  I sent a letter with a map showing where the sighting was, a picture drawn by me of these ships and a description, but never received an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At first I just thought they were from choppers in the area. There had been reports of livestock being mutilated in that area, so I figured they were ranchers checking out their stock. That is until they started moving vertically at a speed I knew wass impossible for a chopper to achieve. I pointed this out to my girlfriend, and she grabbed the flashlight and started flashing it in their direction. When one set of the lights went straight up and out of sight my girlfriens started hollering &#39;look baby, they&#39;re UFO&#39;s, at which time I freaked and grabbed for the light. In the time it took for me to grab the light away from her, one of the set of lights came to within a mile of us,(they were probably 20 miles away to begin with) hovered for a few seconds, took off to the West  and was gone.<n>

I was riding my motorcycle on Boot Rd. traveling west when I saw a huge UFO hovering about 150 feet above a home.  Cross member I beams underneath with clear dimmer lights eluminating the underside of craft.  I pulled over to view along with another person who was driving a station wagon.  Craft made no sound at all.  It was a very beautiful machine.  After viewing for about a minute I got a little scared and began to pull away and as I did it floated away from the home and hoovered out of sight very slowly.  This happened in the early 80&#39;s and my only regret was I didn&#39;t get the persons name in the station wagon to support my story.  Everyone thinks I&#39;m crazy when I tell them my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was looking out the windown and it was very dark. I suddenly saw a object it had lights with a circular pattern It had multiple colored lights mostly Red White &amp; Blue. When I returned home I went over to the tv and turned it on. There was a news report of about 5 sightings of a ufo flashing red white and blue lights. I then kept it inside me till there was this page<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had lights from my perspective with about a 2 foot per light seperation. It had a distinct pattern of the lights. It went White, Blue, Red. It flashed all the seperate lights at once. I observed it. My background is I am 16 know was 5 at the time have a good social life, very mature and very truthfull.<n>

I was looking out the window at the time. The sky was blue, and there were no clouds. The winds were calm as well. Then, I noticed an egg-shaped object that was slowly moving at about 15 MPH in a northerly direction, horizontally. It was about 150 feet above the water. Its distance from me was approximately less than a mile. I took my headphones off and got out of my room and continued to observe the object which seemed to be a goldish copper. The sun glistened on the front of the object, reflecting the light as if the object was made of some sort of metal.Another curious thing that I noticed was that there was no sound coming from it as it moved. It was perfectly silent. No type of engine was protruding from the object and I could hear the birds chirping in the trees. The object continued it&#39;s slow, northerly track until it disappeared from view. The event lasted approximately three minutes at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a believer of UFOs and have had dreams about them. However, I took the position of a skeptic and rationalized the event as I watched the object, and asked myself the following questions: is it a new type of private or commercial airplane, hot air balloon, helicopter, a blimp, a cloud, a new type of weather balloon, a hanglider. None of these applied to this object. All the crafts I have mentioned could have been easily identified had they been at the location where the object was traveling because we were always able to see Cessnas and helicopters fly close by, and we could hear them over a mile away. But this object was quiet and entirely different. It did not resemble anything known to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

While we were in transit with a Vessel to Seattle from Alaska&#39;s waterway&#39;s in the Wrangle Narrows, very brite white light&#39;s!!! almost a daylight effect on shore, I saw as I made us a snack in the galley, I ran to the bridge, tried to talk to my brother...turn on the light&#39;s his face had been burned, like a sun burn, only on part of his face...we were scared and didn&#39;t talk again until the next day, we didn&#39;t feel good...alittle werid feeling inside...you know? missing time I think also...we were wide awake it was our shift together while our father and the enginnier we sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of &#39;85, we all had finished our season as a tender in Alaska, our ship was a 300&#39; Vessel we were on our way to Seattle, there were four on board me (deleted) my brother (deleted) and our father (deleted) and our chief enginnier. Leaving the Gulf of Alaska, entering what is called Cape St. Elis, this is where you enter when there is bad sea&#39;s, it is also known as the inside passage, very beautiful passage you can almost jump off the ship to shore if you want to, the summer night&#39;s do not get dark, until 11:30 to 12:30.  My brother (deleted) is a first-mate and we share shift&#39;s together, ours is from 12 midnight to 6am,  were all up in bridge when I saw a Bright light under our ship, it lite up the whole ship under water we were in motion about 9 knots or so, can&#39;t go too fast in the passage, then it moved towards the bow of the vessel...within seconds it was gone? My father the Captain said I was a whale that was moving under us and the (phosferus) in the water was making the light...? mabe he was right but I remembered the jet that flew over head that woke us up earlier, it buzzed us a few times and was gone...we were very glad that we were on our way back home to Seattle! so nothing more about it...as our father said, are we ready to take over...warned us about going fast in here, we said don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll be fine, about this time I ask my brother if he was hungry, I said I&#39;ll go to the galley and make us something to eat...he said ok...I waited for a moment or two he said, what about the food?, I said ok then I traveled down the stairs to the galley, I was looking in the cooler to see what I can make... I think I started cooking on the grill or making sandwitches...I was looking out the porthole I saw the trees....wondering why I can see them so cleary? I was night time and It looked like daytime...so I heard my brother on the intercom yelling at me to come up to the pilot house!!!! so I ran up the stairs...as I got outside It was daylight! all around the ship! everywhere I looked I saw light it was bright at first, but my eyes were trying to get used to the light, I got upstairs finale and my brother is talking loud!!! can you see that? I said yeah I can...we opened the side door to the bridge and we could come out but I was stopped by him grabbing me saying Tony don&#39;t go!!!! as soon as we did stop or talk the light was gone...back to darkness...it was werid cause our or my eyes had to adjust back to the night....in silence for a long time my brother asked me did I see that? What Happened?....I turned on the light&#39;s and noticed that his face was burned, mine was alittle my right hand, had a werid burn on it, as I look on my hand now it&#39;s gone, I thought I would have that burn forever....my brother face cleared up the next day, mabe a few days...we told everyone we knew,  all thought we were crazy....by the way our trip back home? as soon as you leave the inside passage, you enter the outside Ocean,  it was to be bad weather....it was flat calm...not even a ripple...no wind...sunny skies all the way back to Seattle....that was very unusal for this time of year....I&#39;ll never forget what happened to me and my brother (deleted)!. I remember this as if it happened yesterday!....to be more detailed the lights did change from white to yellow, very bright colors, there was no sound...the night was black so fast as if someone turned out the light&#39;s? I know the object was round the shape was very huge much bigger and closer than I ever thought of to be, as the UFO left I did hear the engines again so mabe there was a sound?, there was not a loud sound that I remember? but we noticed that this did take time to do all this, It felt like seconds or a few minutes..but not 2 hours I notice that it was later than, it was alittle after 2am I believed it started around 12 ish...I guess the ufo went straight up or behind us cause there were light colored particles in the air, as if it sped away in a half a second, extermely fast, gone.…<n>

(The vent hole is a square hole with an opening of approx 32x32 inches) The nearly full moon caught my eye, and as I glanced at it I saw a small box like object falling towards the ground. The object seemed to be falling at a slower rate than you would expect an object to be falling at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another worker and I went  outside of the trailer to get a better look at the object, which was up in the air about 1000 feet or so and was East by south East of us. While trying to figure out what it was and how it got there. I noticed that it was falling with a precise pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The box was a rectangle, which had on one side a reflecting smooth light brown surface, and on the other side was a real dark brown matt or black color. I believe the other four sides were a light brown color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was falling it would turn on its axis. If I remember right it was in a clockwise rotation. That is while looking up towards the bottom of it. It would turn three times and then flip end over end, and continue in the same pattern over and over again. You could see the sun reflecting off of the light brown shiny side as it turned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got about 500 feet or so from us it leveled off and went into a glide like state, which brought over and passed where we were standing. By now it was about 200 feet up in the air and 150 feet in front of us. It went another 50 feet or so and then made a fairly sharp left turn and headed south across the road and towards the river and high power lines. It passed almost directly over the top of a small C model trailer which was parked next to the road. The trailer was approximately 18 or 20 feet long by 8 feet wide. And the object was pretty close to being the same width and length as the trailer, and looked to be about 3 or 4 feet thick, as I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed just above the wires which went over the river. When the object got approximately over the center of the river, it made an abrupt sharp left turn and started up the river. It went for about a hundred feet or so and then stopped. Not wavering up or down or left or right. Then it started to go into a rippling effect, which reminded me of looking at  a stingray from its side. It stayed there for about 10 seconds or so doing it’s rippling and then went solid again (or ridged) and then it stood on end and slowly rose up into the air and turned on its axis again. But this time it did not flip over as it did before when it was coming down. It slowly rose up into the air and slightly drifted south. As it rose up while turning you could see the light reflecting off of the shiny side till it went out of site. It looked like it was heading in the same direction from whence it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later while talking about the object with some material handlers, who were on the other side of the building at that time and which did not see the object, were discussing about a weird noise that they heard at the same time as our sighting, which sounded to them like a siren trying to start up over and over again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I did not hear any sound, because of the dust collector, which was on my side of the building was running and making to much noise to hear anything.) My memory is not to good, but I sat and thought about this for some time, and put down things as I remember them. I have only talked to a few people about it. And have never reported it, For fear of ridicule. (and also didn’t know who to report it to) If some one else has seen something similar I would like to know. Its been haunting me for some time now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Besides reporter, a number of other people were reported to have watched for hours while a disc hovered over Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant on Hudson River in Buchanan, NY.  Reporter watched spectacle from Rockland County side of river with sheriff&#39;s deputies in attendance.  Reporter relayed details for several minutes live.  However, no subsequent reports of this incident arose anywhere else (e.g., major newspapers, etc.).  I cannot recall exact date, but it had to be between late August 1985 and May 1986.  I believe it was Sept or Oct 1985. (Also, I spent most of my life in Rockland County and heard of numerous other strange sightings -- one in particular was from a friend of my father&#39;s who, when walking a dog early one morning in the mid-1970s, saw a very small disc (appx 3 feet dia) hovering over a neighborhood power line transformer &#34;shooting lightning bolts off of it&#34; until it zinged away at high speed.  Around this same time my father and I saw a strange reddish light dancing in the summer evening western sky as the sun was setting -- it hovered, drifted downwards, shot up, and randomly moved up and down, to and fro for appx one hour, before shooting off at blinding speed)<n>
