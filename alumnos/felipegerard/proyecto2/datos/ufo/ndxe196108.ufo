I wish someone could shed some light on this matter.  A lot of time has passed since the event, but I&#39;ll try to recall the incident as accurately as I can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late summer in 1961 when ((deleted--witness #2)), ((witness #3)), ((witness #4)), ((witness #5)), and myself were camping on ((deleted)) farm.  I believe it was on a Friday late in the afternoon when we set up camp.  I always gathered the firewood and started the fire whenever we camped out.  Just before dusk I set out to gather some firewood.  ((deleted)) farm was a pristine farm consisting of series of rolling hills covered with little vegetation except in the ravines or small valleys.  It was in these places that I set out to find some firewood.  As I reached the top of the second ridge I looked down into a grassy ravine and observed a dead tree lying on its side.  The bark had fallen away revealing a bleached trunk and branches.  It had been there a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went down to the tree and gathered as much firewood as I could.  I thought to myself, just before I descended the hill to the dead tree, how beautiful the contrast of the bleached tree was to the green grass cropped by the sheep.  I returned to the camp with my first load of wood and I asked ((witness #2)) if he would assist me in retrieving some firewood several ridges over.  Thus between the two of us had a sufficient amount of firewood for the night including my first gathering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late that night we were in our tent telling scary stories.  All of us were around 14 years of age since we were classmates at Princeton High School, in Sharonville, Ohio. Around midnight we heard a strange sound above us which lasted for about 10 or 15 seconds.  The best way to describe the sound is to say that it was a high pitched whiring sound.  It sounded something like a jet engine at idle, but not as loud and it had a softer sound.  We were already a bit spooked and this unknown sound startled us.  I grabbed my bee bee gun and quickly exited the tent, not so much as to face off with the intruder, I just didn&#39;t want to be in the tent where I could not see the present of possible danger.  All the guys exited with me and we gathered together looking to the Southwest.  That seemed to be the direction of the last sounds we heard.  I may add that it is also the direction of the GE, Evendale Jet Engine Plant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After spending a few minutes outside, we reentered the tent and bedded down.  I settled into my sleeping bag while listening for and pondering the possible sources of the strange sound.  As I said GE Aircraft Engine Group was West or Southwest of us about 6 miles and the nearest road was to the North of us about one half mile. I thought perhaps it was the sound of squeaking brakes of a Semi Tractor and Trailer descending down the hill on the road to the North of us or perhaps it was a late night test of a jet engine being tested in one of the many test cells at GE.  In the middle of my curiosity I must have fallen asleep and I didn&#39;t awaken until the next morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was chilly so I decided to gather some firewood from the same spot as the evening as before, which was Southwest of our campsite.  To my surprise, next to the dead tree was a perfect circle burnt in the green grass, green for empahsis.  The charred area was approximately 20 feet in diameter and it was Northwest of the fallen tree approximately 20 feet.  I descended to the strange circle and I remember wondering why I didn&#39;t notice the circle the night before.  Then I ruled out the possibility of missing such a blaring landmark since I recalled thinking how beautiful the contrast of the dead tree and grass was just the night before.  I even considered that the KKK may have had meeting and built the fire, surely they would have used the firewood from the fallen tree and it was undisturbed and the charred area was not that of a normal fire.  The grass was simply charred black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I would test my recollection of this site as it was the night before, so I returned to the camp and asked ((name deleted)) if he would help me gather some more firewood without telling him of the burnt circle of grass.  I wanted see if he would have any reaction to the charred circle of grass.  I remember this part of the incident and the conversation that ensued quite well.  As we arrived at the top of the second ridge ((name deleted)) said, &#34;Look at that!&#34; I said to ((name deleted)), Look at what? ((name deleted)) replied, That circle of burnt grass. I said, So...?  He replied, It wasn&#39;t there when we came here yesterday.&#34;  I knew then that this circle of fire had not been there the day before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) and I investigated the charred grass and discussed the possible origins, but all of the possibilities seemed rather lame.  We both agreed that it was not there the day before. I refrained from saying anything about a flying saucer though the thought came to my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) and I returned to camp and invited the others to come and see something.  All of us were baffled.  ((name deleted)) never burned open fires on his farm.  Open fires on local farms like ((name deleted)) farm or like the one I lived on at this time was an event that rarely occured.  To burn underbrush or dead trees was a fire hazard too great because of the dryness of the season.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime afterwards, I woke up in the middle of the night after a terrifying dream.  I dreamed that I was in a struggle or fight with someone.  It was very dark in my room even though my eyes should have been adjusted to the darkness.  I suddenly realized that a large amount of liquid was running from my nose.  At first,I thought I had a major nose run, but the smell around my face was strange and I could taste the liquid and it was different.  I made my way through the darkness to the bathroom and fumbled for the light switch.  I turned on the light and I saw blood on the light switch cover and then I looked into the mirror and to my utter surprise the lower half of my face was smeared with blood.  The blood was still gushing from both nostrils.  I had never been prone to nose bleeds even when I got into a scuffle now and then.  I cleaned myself up and woke my father and told him of the incident.  Lastly, my concentration on my studies fell way off and I do admit that I wasn&#39;t interested in school at the time, but stuff came to me easily until the above events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize for the lengthy description and I freely admit that I have in the past fifteen years read about people being abducted and/or abused by so called aliens but what I have expressed is true.  I have never seen any hard evidence of the existence of aliens or their spacecraft.  If there is something to my story and the many others I want to know what happened to me and the others...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It moved from east to west quite low on the horizon. The time/speed it took to cross our vision (which was limited by trees on both sides of the lane where we were walking) was slow but at the same time made me feel it ws moving very very fast. It was much too close and too slow for an aeroplane which I was used to seeing as there were many airbases in that area.  The colour was milky with a tail which remained the same size all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although some years ago now I can still picture it and especialy remember the strange sensation of very fast movement which was out of context with the time it took to move across the sky. Some years later I spoke to a neighbour who told me she had also seen something round about the same time and date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Sat in barracks doing nothing when a fellow guardsman came in ans said come out here and take a look at this. I went outside and looked up at about 75 degrees were 5 dull orange disks. They were bobbing up and down and moving from side to side.My first thought was they were helicopters part of call-up. I thought they were too close together and I did not see rotors. The guy who told us to come out said those are not helicopters.I suddenly realised they were U.F.Os. I watched them for a while and went back inside.I also realised they were watching us too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was only one light which|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02114.html|8|ndxe196108| Summary : Looking east about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon, I saw this starlike object at a very high speed. There was only one light which is the bottom of the craft. The object was round as I can can see it from below. It was at night so I cannot tell what the upper portion of the object look like.The object was coming at a very high speed and stopped over us.I was amazed by this object, traveling at high speed and made a suuden stop and hover with no overrun. As it hover us, the object turn on its bright light and I could see clearly for about a mile. It was like daylight with no heat.I would also like to add that I did not hear an engine sound from this object and thats what scared me. I thought to myself that this object is not from earth. Also, I have kept this a secret for 35 years, because I don&#39;t know what it was until last summer I saw on the television a special onUFO sightings. It was an astronaut orbiting around the earth who saw it first coming towards earth and I was the second one to see it here on earth. I don&#39;t Know if there are more people saw this on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/1/61 00:00|Mill Valley|CA|Disk|3 min|Clear view of a "flying saucer".|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17115.html|9|ndxe196108| Clear view of a &#34;flying saucer&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night in question, I was on the back deck of my house testing a new telescope mirror on the nearly full moon. I noticed a bright yellow light about a third the size of the moon travelling west to east (overhead) and apparently decending at a steep angle. The color was exactly that of a yellow traffic light, i.e. sodium yellow. There were four red lights, like navigation lights, around the rim; one on the forward side, one at the trailing side and one on the left and right. They were flashing on and off in a clockwise sequence as seen from below. As it decended toward the east it grew larger and disapeared over the roof of my house. I ran through the house, grabbing 7x50 binoculars as I went. Out on the front porch, I steadied the binoculars on the porch railing and looked at the craft, now at tree-top height and no more than a quarter of a mile away. My view-angle was no more than 5 degrees upward. The yellow light was clearly emenating from the bottom of the craft, which was flat and a bit inset. The craft was well-lit by the nearly full moon in very clear weather and appeared smooth and metallic, like new magnesium or aluminum but not polished. No seams or fasteners were visible. The over-all shape was that of a saucer with a dome on top. Over-all diameter appeared to be between 10 and 15 meters, with the dome taking up a third of that. the dome was flat on top and radiused smoothly into the sides, which were flat in cross-section, and had four keystone-shaped windows that I could see from my viewing angle. The sides of the top dome were smoothly radiused into the body of the craft, which curved continuously downward, and rapidly decreased in radius at the edge, curving under to the bottom. There was no haziness at all, and appeared as solid and real as a Cessna 172 flying along. Speed was maybe 50 kph. The interior appeared lit like an office at night, white and bright. No persons were visible, but a white column was in the center of the interior and took up perhaps a quarter to a third of the diameter of the dome, extending (apparently) floor-to-ceiling, and this could have blocked my view of someone on the forward side of the dome. Or it could have been flying on autopilot. Anyone with the technology to build one of these things would be capable of building an autonomous autopilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
