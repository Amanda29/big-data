It was a full blue sky with no clouds.  The object was about the lenght of an airliner fuselage, but had no wings or vertical tail fins, just the long tube shape, similar to a pipe.  At the time I told the passenger in my car that it looked like the UFO on the Star Trek Movie with the Whales.  The Movie had the Crew of the Enterprise go back in time to get a humback whale to save the future from a destructive UFO that needed to talk to whales before it stopped destroying earth.  I don&#39;t remember what installment of the Star Trek movies it was, as I am not a fan of the series, but it was a major motion picture, not a TV episode, that is what this object looked like.  The object did not move the entire time I watched it, also no soud that I could hear, I was in my car on a busy street.  I was traveling in my car with my girlfreind (now wife) and we both saw it.  We saw it just sitting in the sky, not moving, no lights, just this long black tube, tilted at about a 45deg. angle in the air.  I am a believer in UFO&#39;s, however my wife is not.  She does not believe in anything like UFO&#39;s, ghosts, and that sort of thing.  When I tell people I do beleive in UFO&#39;s, my wife will roll her eyes and make fun of me when we are around other people.  I am quick to ask her what we saw in Council  Bluffs that day, and my wife, who is a college graduate and works for a top law firm in Omaha NE, has to honestly say &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;  I am a police officer and my word is often the only thing that stands in the way of someone going to prison, or being free.  My honesty and observation skills are tested every time I go to court, I did see this thing and I don&#39;t know what it was either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/29/91 20:30|New Idria|CA|Triangle|150 minutes|Two silent perfect equilateral triangle craft observed for atleast 150 minutes at New Idria CA.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42604.html|2|ndxe199108| Two silent perfect equilateral triangle craft observed for atleast 150 minutes at New Idria CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat down for a rest(2300ft elevation) while hiking the hills on our property. It was early dusk with clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking west I saw two bright white lights maybe two miles distant approaching at approx. 40 to 50 mph as they cleared nearby hills(3400&#39;) by about 200 to 300&#39;. At about 1/2 mile each light resolved itself into 3 smaller white lights located at the vertices of perfect equilateral triangles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two craft kept approaching directly towards my position with the one on right side leading by 100ft and about 100ft separation to the other.  Both were absolutely silent and headed directly above me as they moved due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched intently when &#34;on a dime&#34; the lead craft suddenly stopped straight above me (at I guess anywhere from 700&#39; to 1200&#39; above). Looking straight up I saw the craft as a dull metallic triangles against the blue sky--I can&#39;t recall much else right then except maybe a central circular feature and the fact the other craft had proceeded east over a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became increasingly nervous as it sat perched directly above. After about 30 seconds I panicked and ran down the hill (1 minute) to my truck parked in workyard.  Looking up it was still there and the other one was slowly rejoining it from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped in truck and drove it across New Idria Road and up my driveway to my home (about 90 seconds), to find out that both craft were still just hovering there (in echelon as before). So I watched them in their silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes one of them headed slowly east over the hill again and minutes later returned again.  I went for my camera (35mm) to find no film--highly peeing me off-and I had no one to call (nearest neighbor 6 miles north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> returned outside to watch more of the same action (silent hovering with one and then the other every 5 to 10 minutes smoothly tracking east and then returning-in a sinister manner I recall thinking}.  I think I found binoculars but could not hold them steady to any advantage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I flipped them (the craft) off in my angst but quickly &#34;apoligized&#34; and started making arm motions &#39;to come on down&#39; and sit a spell--to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It got dark and yet they were still there. I pulled out my flashlite to signal--it did not work nor did any others I could find (not unusual but I can&#39;t say I checked later to ascertain their real status).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the dark I could see and remember the white lights at the vertices. At one point I got a stiff neck and went in for a sandwich.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back outside--still there.  An hour or so after dark they finally glided off slowly(at max. 15 mph) in tandem due east.  It seems it was 10:30 pm or so then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They made me feel uneasy and it&#39;s strange but I cannot recall telling anyone about it (except maybe one friend-who can&#39;t recall) which just wasn&#39;t and isn&#39;t like me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I might have even forgotten all of this but for the fact that a year and two weeks later I had another sighting which I will report (here in NUFORC database) as September 12 of 1992. It was this later sighting that seemed to trigger my recall of this one. Both sightings were absolutely real but leave me very perplexed (esp as to not telling folks and even not recalling this sighting).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no recollections of being abducted (though I&#39;m curious enough to want to try hypnosis) and it seems certain that this first sighting began a recurring &#39;nightmare&#39; of not being able to find light switches in dimly lit dreams of mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other details: My best estimate of craft size is 40 to 60&#39; on a side. Dull metallic silver hulls. Some sort of circular configuration maybe 10&#39; diameter at center of the belly of the triangles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Would have reported this long ago but just became aware of this website after Jenning&#39;s special.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Want to thank website creators very much and would appreciate knowing of similiar sightings, especially one&#39;s around same time and within 200-300 miles of central California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

8/29/91 03:00|Donnelly|ID|Unknown|1/2 hour|When there is an animal mutilation, what can you hear?|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75445.html|3|ndxe199108| When there is an animal mutilation, what can you hear?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it is the time to make this report. When it comes to animal mutilations, usually cows and occasionally horses, seemingly it &#34;just happens&#34; with no witnesses.  Some say black helicopters are in the area, but I think they were chasing what actually did the job.  A helicopter does not fit my understanding of the event.  Although I was not a direct witness, I was too close. Here is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Thursday night, August 29, 1991, my late wife and I were camping on Kennally Creek, six miles east of Donnelly, Idaho.  That night at 3AM there was a wild ruckus of coyotes barking.  It woke us up and our attention was on those coyotes wondering why this was happening.  It seemed like all the coyotes in the whole valley were concentrated just to the south of where we were camping. Imagine a hundred coyotes in one place barking and baying.  Then total silence.  By total silence I mean that nothing could be heard.  We were next to a stream and could not hear the stream gurgling. Many know the wonderful sounds that a stream can make to lure you into dreamland when camping.  However, this night, at this moment not even the stream could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, there was a screaming-screeching sound of great volume that lasted more than a minute. There was silence again, that same total silence defeating even the natural sounds of the forest and the stream. This time the silence lasted for about five minutes. Suddenly, that same loud noise, the intense lasting screaming sound could be heard once again, and after it was over, the coyotes were barking once again. We were listening to the coyotes in some degree of fear trying to figure out what was happening and then, oddly, we both fell fast asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We woke up together at 9AM, discussed the strangeness of the night and decided to pack up and go back home. About a week later we invited my parents to join us on a camping trip and returned to the same place. This location by Kennally Creek had been a family favorite since about 1956. In those forty years very little had changed at the campsite. Not even the tiny pond where my sister and I played with frogs and garter snakes has changed, and where my grandchildren did the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night of the first day camping with my parents a local rancher showed up on horseback and told us the story of how, just over a ridge a week before, just 160 yards from our tent, was a horse mutilation. He detailed the usual findings of precision cuts, no tracks, and no blood. It happened on the same night we heard the coyotes and screaming sounds. Some may say we just heard a mountain lion scream; however, a mountain lion does live there, just a few hundred feet to the north and we have heard it scream, and there was no comparison; however, if you need the mountain lion connection, you would have to have several of them in one place and screaming in more than twice the volume as they can do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little more about the location can be given. Using Google Earth ™ you travel nearly due east of Donnelly, Idaho six miles. The coordinates for the mutilation are: 44º 42&#39; 41.53&#34;N, 115º 57&#39; 39.82W and the coordinates for the campsite are 44º 42’ 41.53” N, 115º 57’ 33.39” W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An old newspaper article can be found at Google Newspapers by pasting this address into your browser:<n> <n><n> http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19910906&amp;id=ZTsVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PwgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6538,3646572<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the camping spot, Kennally Creek empties into Gold Fork River at about 2 ½ miles south as the crow flies.  The area is closed now.  In 2005 a new rancher up from California fenced off the access road that had been open for over half a century.<n>
8/28/91 00:30|Canandaigua|NY|Sphere|15 minutes|It was a white sphere and it was keeping pace with my car|9/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31481.html|4|ndxe199108| It was a white sphere and it was keeping pace with my car<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw cannot be of this earth!  I was driving home on a semi-desolate county road with a co-worker.  She was sitting in the passenger&#39;s seat.  We both were gov&#39;t workers at the time working the evening shift at the local VA hospital. She was an RN and I was a CNA.  At 12:30AM, she looked out her window and saw what she thought was the moon and said it was very low and bright that night.  I looked out her window and saw that it was moving through the trees and over the tops of the occasion house or two.  We were heading east on the road.  A couple of minutes later, it moved to my side of the car and was only about 100 yards from the road.  It was keeping pace with us.  When we came upon an open field, I decided to stop and get out to investigate what this thing might be.  So I got out of the car and this sphere just hovered above the field.  Again, it was about 100 yards away from me and about 200 yards above the ground.  My passenger elected to remain in the car.  It looked to be 3x the size of a basketball from the distance where I stood.  No noise, no sound, no trail,no pulsing lights....just a bright white light that seemed to steadily emanate from within the craft.  After a minute or two, I walked toward the thing and it moved away.  I slowly walked backward toward my car again and it came forward again.  I did this a few times and realized this was no weather balloon or any type of natural phenomenon.  I finally asked out loud, &#34;Who are you?&#34;  It then grew brighter and my car stalled and the radio began flipping through all the stations rapidly before everything finally quit on the car altogether.  After what I thought was 10 minutes, I got back in the car to start it up and it wouldn&#39;t start.  Then, everything came back on again and I turned the key and we were out of there in a shot!  But the craft remained behind my car and it was in view of my rear-view mirror, but it traveled over the road this time.  We were doing 80 mph for several miles until it disappeared.  When I dr! opped off my passenger and got back to my house, the clock in the car read 12:50AM as did my watch.  But, upon entering my home, I looked at the clock in my livingroom, it read 2:55AM as did the other clocks in the house.  I called my co-worker at her house and asked her to look at her watch and then the clocks in her house.  She, too, became scared and we both wondered what happened to the 2 hours that were missing from what should&#39;ve been only a 40 minute drive.  As it turned out, many people in the area saw this thing.  2 of my brothers saw it and they lived in 2 seperate towns.  One in Victor, NY and the other in Ithaca, NY.  Apparently this thing had been seen all around the Fingerlakes region for most of that evening.  Most of my other co-workers also saw this thing as they drove home too.  My passenger no longer remembers this incident, but I do!  It still remains a mystery as to what happened to those 2 missing hours.  I had another sighting 3 and 1/2 years later on this same road, which I will post in a seperate message.  By the way, I now live in SW Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

You are not the only one who saw this.  I personally did not see it, but my father and a co-worker of his told me about seeing something fly over the plant incredibly fast.  (They both were at the time at work, at the plant)  It has been a long time now so I don&#39;t have that much detail to say, but they said that it was very dark/black, and although it was getting dark, it was low enough to see.  They thought it was a training flight with a supersonic jet from the airbase.  The only reason I remember being told, was that I could not figure out how there would be a jet going above the speed of sound, less than 1000&#39; up over the smokestacks that made now sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was definately later in the month than the 15th as this report was changed to.  I am also not certain of the date, but it was later in the month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I was on the second floor deck, looked up for stars, craft went right over me, just above tree tops, no lights, covered mile to power co. in about 5 seconds. It was so low, others had to have seen it. It was small and the bottom was striped like a bullseye. There was no noise. At the time K.I. Sawyer AFB was nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had taken the dog outside, I stayed on the second floor deck, and looked at the sky. It was overcast, the kind that gives off a daylight glow. The small craft came over, just above the tree line. No light, no noise. I turned and watched as it flew toward and into the low clouds around the power co. smokestacks. The craft would have flown over Northern Michigan University and a fly-by of the hospital (with all those windows). I could not have been the only one to see it. There was a Miss ?? Pageant on TV that night. The next day the papers headlines were about tanks going down the streets of one of the Balkan Countries.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The situation was that it was getting fairly story outside, i was drifting off to sleep, and then all of a sudden there was a lightning flash, and the light from the lightning filled the room.  I could actually see with my eyes shut.  The more i tried to shut my eyes the more i could see.  What i saw was a type of staircase to heaven, seriously, up to a throne.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That lasted for about, well, i could have been meditating on it for minutes, i don&#39;t know, but it had a profund effect on me.  I never SAID at the time it was a UFO until the next morning when the prime TV network carried a story about UFO sightings in the area that night, and my sister confirming that she saw something in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the years since I have been &#34;contacted&#34; via specific dream events it seems, well, i have been tuned into something, something to do with flying crafts not of terrestrial origin, it seems. As a result, through the years, I have developed a theory of space-time (attached here as evidence of my initial exposure to something), derived from my awareness, and more to that, my sincere interest in a higher intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you could take a look at my manuscript (5MB DOWNLOAD) regarding a type of science and see if it matches any reports some of your subscribers may have lodged regarding the nature of the UFO phenomena.<n>

I was about 12 or 13 years old at the time, and my friend was travelling with me, my mother and her boyfriend back from town.  He was staying over at my house that night celebrating our birthdays and being a warm night, decided to sleep outside in the camper.  Being in a rather darkened area, travelling down route 209 from Parrsboro to Kirkhill, I regularily star gazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an extremely clear night with the sky lit up with stars.  I focused on approximately 8 - 12 objects in the air, about the distance of a plane but no flashing lights.  They were just lit objects in the air.  They travelled in and out of formation quite a bit, travelling much faster than any plane I had ever seen.  We watched them all the way home for approx. 3 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once arriving home, we never really thought about them again and went into the house.  We then shortly went outside to the camper, and with the power connection began playing nintendo.  We were concentrating on the game and talking when we noticed what seemed to be a &#34;silent&#34; engine get louder and louder (I say silent because it got louder so gradually that it was hardly noticable).  We looked outside at one point, towards the north above the &#34;mountain&#34; side.  Being such a clear night, we could see a shape in the sky that blacked out the stars around it, above the trees.  It seems almost surreal as when we were looking, it was as if it sensed us and backed over the trees and mountain.  This happened several times over the next hour.  We weren&#39;t really afraid, more intrigued.  At one point we fell asleep, not knowing if it happened again throughout the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just remember it being very large, blocking out starlight, (10-15 meters wide, 75-100 meters long), and having such a strange engine sound to almost not have a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just wanted to share one of my experiences in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

While he was talking I noticed a weird object in the sky from behind him. I asked him what is that? He looked back and said I don’t know maybe a helicopter because it was oscillating strangely. At this point it was still to far away but as it headed towards us I could tell it wasn’t a helicopter. I got out of my car and said, &#34;What the hell is that? That&#39;s not a helicopter. He turned and we watched it as it approached us from the south heading north. This was flying disk silver on one side with a black square in the very center of the disk and the other side was black with a silver square in the center. It was flipping end over end like a spiraling football. To the west of us was a hot air balloon, which do always fly in the area during that time of the year. The hot air balloon was barely moving so the disk couldn’t have been a balloon because it was moving at 30-60 miles an hour. It was approx 50-100 feet in diameter and flying about 500-750 ft in the air with out a sound. As soon as it was right above us I ran inside to my company and tried to get the photographer for our company to come outside and take a photo or video of it. I was working for a video dating service at that time. He finally came out as it was off in the distance still spiraling and heading north towards downtown Kansas City. He snapped a couple pictures of the disk with a 35 MM camera as it was heading off in the distance approximately 2 miles away. It was reflecting the light from the sun every time the silver side was pointing up. I watched it for a couple more minutes as it disappeared off in the distance and then went on break. I ran over to my girlfriends parents house and told them what had happened. My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me shortly after this incident. When I got back to work I told everyone that would listen to me about what happened my boss ((name deleted)) denied it and freaked out I guess because he was very religious. I ran into him on the plaza years later with some friends of mine and he finally admitted he saw the same thing and that he may have had a nervous breakdown because of it. I talked with the photographer that took the pictures and he said that the photos came out grainy he said he was using the wrong speed and type of film and exposure. I have seen many strange things before and since but this was the closest most vivid sighting I have ever witnessed. I called all the local News agencies and the airports not one other person made a report and no one ever contacted me about this.  Wussies.  Prepare yourself for the last revelation. Prepare yourself for the New World Order. Prepare yourself for mans destruction. Prepare yourself to die. MrN<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a clear night with many stars visible beyond the canopy of the trees. We suddenly noticed a light in the sky brighter than the other stars. We first thought it may be Venus, usually the brightest object in the sky at night. The light began to move slowly from side to side that suggested it may be a helicopter, only there was no sound. I would guess that the object was a mile from us but moving toward us. It made erratic movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For example, it would move very fast in one direction, stop suddenly, then move in the opposite direction. The object was very close to us now but it still looked like a bright star. We also heard no sound coming from it. Then suddenly it came to a stop, and sped to the south of us faster than any manmade flying object I&#39;ve ever seen. Maybe a minute or two after, two fighter jets flew in the direction of the object at top speed. It was the only time we heard any sound. At the time of this incident the naval air base in Weymouth, MA was still oporational and I believe the fighter jets were scrambled from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was so low, others had to have seen it.  It was small and the bottom was striped like a bullseye.  There was no noise. At the time K.I. Sawyer AFB was nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had taken the dog outside, I stayed on the second floor deck, and looked at the sky.  It was overcast, the kind that gives off a daylight glow.  The small craft came over, just above the tree line. No light, no noise.  I turned and watched as it flew toward and into the low clouds around the power co. smokestacks.  The craft would have flown over Northern Michigan University and a fly-by of the hospital (with all those windows).  I could not have been the only one to see it.  There was a Miss  ?? Pageant on TV that night.  The next day the papers headlines were about tanks going down the streets of one of the Balkan Countries.<n>

I remember watching what I thought was a satellite, a pinpoint of light crossing the sky at a steady velocity, as I watched the light, traveling from north to south, it stopped for a moment then accelerated very quickly forming a &#34;Z&#34; in it&#39;s flight path and continued to the south at the same fast pace. A report filed by someone on 8/1/91 in Toledo OH desribes very much what I saw and at the approximately the same time of night and calendar date.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was traveling from west to east. It had no navigation light,wings or vertical or horizontal stabilizers.  Ther was no visible vapor trails or engine noise. I really think it was at or near the edge of the atmosphere. The size is hard to guess at because I don&#39;t know its altitude.To give some idea of its size though  it appeared to be about the size of a C-5A aircraft viewed from about 500 yards.  The two other aircraft approached the larger craft,one from the North and the other from the South. The two smaller craft appeared only as small white lights approaching the large craft. What really attracted my attention to the small crafts was the manouver one of them made upon nearing the large craft.  The one coming from the north came to the left side of the large craft An instant before the one arrived fron the southand the light went out. The craft from the south approached the same location at very hihg speed and at the last moment stopped and circled and entered the right side of the large craft.  I hope I have given enough details.  I never reported this before because most people don&#39;t believe it or think you are crazy if you see something like this craft.  I was formally an Air Force Aircraft Maintainance Tech.  Staff Sgt.<n>
8/15/91 03:00|Chowchilla|CA|Disk|3 days|When I was 16 years old I worked on my Dad’s vineyard. The ranch was a large ranch, almost 1000 acres, and was out in the middle of now|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107594.html|17|ndxe199108| When I was 16 years old I worked on my Dad’s vineyard.  The ranch was a large ranch, almost 1000 acres, and was out in the middle of nowhere in eastern Central California, Fresno being the closest large town (city) about 35 minutes north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My UFO story begins one night during harvest that lasted three days.  (Wine grapes are harvested at night when the fruit’s sugar is at its highest.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My experience started one night about 2am while I was out watering down the roads driving a large tractor and that pulled a large water tanker that sprayed water onto the roads to keep the dust down during harvest.  I was at the eastern most edge of the ranch listening to my Sony Walkman (I think I was listening to Boys to Men…), when I noticed a red light out in the field to the east of me, looking out towards the Sierra Mountains.  This red light did not look too far away, probably out about a half a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south and was watching the red light thinking it was helicopter and pondering how strange it was that it was out in the field.  Then I noticed the red light was coming closer to me and I began to get nervous.  Never for a moment did I believe this was an alien craft, but rather a helicopter piloted by humans that were about to fly over me, and even harass me out in no-mans-land.  The red light got closer and closer, and suddenly when it was about 100 yards out, the red light turned into a bright white light, shining in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was then positive these people in this helicopter meant no good and wanted to harass or even harm me, so I put the tractor in high gear and took off back to the office that was nearly two miles away.  I got back to the office and began to recall what occurred and it was then that I began to realize or ponder if what I saw was actually a UFO.  I never saw the helicopter, nor did I hear it, all I saw was the red light coming towards me that suddenly turned white which gave me a very formidable feeling.  Absolutely creeped out I didn’t go back out to the vineyards that night! and fel l asleep in the office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I didn’t think too much about what happened and went back to work that night watering down the roads as I had the night before.  I remember staying out of the eastern most portions of the ranch and staying close to the harvesters where all the workers and machines were hard at work.  It was then that I had the most bizarre experience of my life.  I was watering down one of the main roads where the gondolas dumped the grapes into the bins of the big rigs to be taken to the winery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four harvesters that night; one would start down a row followed by the second, third, and finally the fourth.  As the fourth harvester went into the vineyard, I was approaching from about 50 yards away.  All the bright lights of the machinery and tractors lit up the area and there I saw hovering over the harvest about 40 feet in the air and 100 feet from me a dark gray circular spacecraft about the size of a large SUV.  It appeared to wobble in the air and it was shaped like two bowls glued together with a short cylindrical top.  I could see rivets and round nodules protruding here and there, something you would relate to sensors.  I could see no windows, just dark gray metal and its alien characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Terrified, I began to get my tractor closer to the workers wanting to point out what I was witnessing, but something inside of me made me pull away from them, fearing they would panic by seeing the hovering craft.   Remembering that moment I don’t think I have ever been that genuinely scared before or since.  Again, I raced back to the office and played sick so I didn’t have to return to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third day, still pretty frazzled from the previous night I was out and about the ranch on one of the ATVs, feeling rather safe from the daylight I was looking about the sky, and there high in the sky above the riverbed that ran along the vineyards was the craft.  I was far enough away where it didn’t frighten me so I stared for a moment when almost instantly flew off into the distance disappearing from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There you have it, my UFO story.  To this day, 20 years later, that memory still boggles my mind.  Did I actually see a UFO?  Did I see a spacecraft piloted by or operated by intelligent beings from another planet?  What exactly did I see?  Did that really happen?  I suppose I will never really know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve told my story to people throughout the years and I’m pretty sure they look at me like I’m insane.  Once I told my social psychology professor about my experience and he said I was in a wakeful dream state and it was all a dream or hallucination.  I know what I saw really happened, I know what I saw was real, but it is still hard to grasp what seeing such a thing really means.  If what I saw was real over that three day period, then that means the reality in which we live in is very different than the reality that our society has been brought to believe.  All of which is fascinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading my about my experience!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was a senior in high school during this encounter.  My boyfriend and I were parked along side of a country road talking.  We saw what appeared to be a bright street light, but then it moved. We watched it hover above a farm house and then a tree, radiating a bright white light from the bottom of the craft.  Then it moved towards us slowly.  It was about 15 feet from us and we were scared to death.  The craft was a gray silver metallic color.  In the middle was a band of lights.  The lights turned on and it was like the most profuse pinks, purples, reds, blues, greens.  The lights were astounding.  Then the lights stopped.  We could see the shape of the craft, where the lights came from and on the bottom there seemed to be a golden dome that was transparent in nature.  We assumed the bright white light over the farm house and tree came from this transparent dome.  We watched the craft hover with a slight hum, but nothing loud or distinct in nature.  Then the craft started moving away from us and it disappeared over a line of trees in the distance.  I was to afraid to turn the car back on because I was afraid of it coming back.  I had my face plastered to the windsheild watching this amazing site.  I&#39;ll never forget the bruises my boyfriend left on my legs begging me to start the car and leave.  I wonder if it were just some new aviator craft from the Grissom Air Force Base or was it some governmental project unbeknownst to the public, but what I saw with my friend that night, was nothing that the public would take lightly.  I&#39;ve never reported my sighting until now.  I will never forget my experience.  If there really are little grey people, I came too close for my comfort, if you get my drift.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He informs me that a car load of his friends headed off to see some bands playing one night. He informs me that one of the bands was not allowed into the province due to problems with Canada Customs. Seeing there wasn&#39;t going to be the band playing that they really wanted to see, they decided to stop by some record stores in the Montreal area to grab some new music before heading back home. As they were heading back home, taking Highway #40 between Montreal. This is when they all saw something very unusual. it was still light out and the fellows first thought they were watching a police helicopter staying stationary in the sky. Still thinking the object looked rather odd they slowed the vehicle and watched, eventfully they pulled the car over to the side of the road and got out to have a better look at this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they all watched it, it did start to move away and extremely fast. They knew that it could not have been a helicopter just due to the speed it was moving at. He said it may have been in the shape of a cube, or rectangular is shape. The witness told me it may have been dark in color, like charcoal. But it was hard to tell for sure. While these men were watching this strange sight, three cars and a van had already pulled off to the side of the highway on the opposite side of the road from them and were all watching the same object. After the object had moved off and out of sighting, the fellows continued on their way back home wondering what is was they just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I would watch the sky after dinner for hours until my bedtime.  After a while I started getting away from doing so but one night while shooting hoops under the street light near my house, I saw a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a shooting star (which was weird to me because the area where I lived was very bright at night, i had only seen shooting stars at a beach or on the sound where there are no city lights around).  I was facing north watching the object fly horizontal high across the other houses, but yet still far below the majority of the stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew west to east as i watched it almost as if it was a train on a track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 20 seconds into the sighting it started flying northward and continually got smaller and smaller.  I want to stress that it appeared to be flying slowly like a plane does at a high altitude, but this wasn&#39;t high and it changed its heading on a dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also appeared to speed up greatly once it made its northernly course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to include that this sighting was long before the Flight 800 tragedy, but i&#39;ve heard that some people think they could be related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I then saw two large spheres of orange light, one slightly behind the other, moving from south to north and traversing the entire sky in approx. 10 - 15 seconds.  This sighting was backed up three days later by a news cutting stating how local witnesses had seen two huge orange spheres hovering over houses and pit tops in a local village and then shooting off rapidly. I&#39;ve kept the cutting.<n>

It had a glow around the light signifying that it was bright.  It was hovering approximitly what looked like 10 yards sbove the road. I was heading west on 32 mile passing the romeo high school when i saw the glowing object. I quickly pulled off into the school parkinglot but tree were blocking my view. Pulled out to the road and the object was higher and no longer directly above the road. I quickly pulled across the street into a sub to get a better view. The object seemed to just be hovering in the air. It was slowly moving up at a very slow speed the object continued to do this till about 50 yards above ground.  I then yelled out my car window to see if it would change the pattern of it.  At this point the object moved a quick speed heading north east. I continued to watch the object but from the point it started moving it was gone in a matter of 5-10 seconds.<n>

I saw a round shinny object moving slowly at 090 degrees, at 12,500&#39;, then the object came to a stop directly over Mt Hood. The oject glowed, then moved 8 miles south (160 degrees)&amp; stopped, then moved 16 miles north (360 degrees)and stopped, then it moved directly back over Mt. Hood again, then sped out of sight (2 seconds) heading 090 degrees again. All this took place in a matter of seconds. I reported this to the park ranger, who said she gets UFO reports daily!?! So she was not concerned. The object was identical to the objects that was seen flying or hovering over Mexico City in 1990 or 91.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.

8/1/91 23:00|Podol'sk (Russia)||Disk|3-5 seconds|Noseless sauser, lucky witness.|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26731.html|24|ndxe199108| Noseless sauser, lucky witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a long time ago in Russia. I was about 6 (i am now 17). But by looking at my age don&#39;t turn away, i remember it quite clearly. Mum and i lived in a 10 storey flat and we were on the 8th floor. One night we went to our friends party in the same building and later came back with my friends for a sleep over. We were lying down in the loundge room and i was on the floor facing the window. We talked for a quite a bit that night and i didn&#39;t take notice of the time but the sun was gone and the sky turned dark blue. In the background i saw only the horison of the city and the dark blue skyes. About a minute or two after we all went quite but i kept looking at the window. Then i saw a large black object fly past our window and i said &#34;guys, look!&#34;. I wasn&#39;t dreaming that&#39;s for sure. Every body hopped out of their beds like an alarm had just went off. Sure enough they&#39;ve seen it but i layed there on the floor asking them what it was but they told me not to worry, yet they were talking about it the next day. I believe that by the time they got up and ran to see it, the object would have took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Becasue it was getting darker i only saw the outline of the object so i couldn&#39;t have been able to determine the shape of the object from top but by what it looked like from the side and comparing it to all the other ufo&#39;s i would have to say that it was a sauser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was made up of the main body which was oval but had sharper ends (more like two dinner plates joined together) and a semi sphere on top (may have been the cocpit). The diameter of the sauser was around 4-6 metres and in height about 2-3 metres. At the base of the semi shpere (cocpit) were different flashing coloured lights, spaced out about 40-60cm from each other. The sauser was traveling at about our window level as if it was scanning our floor level. It&#39;s speed would have been approximately 10-15km/h. There was no noise at all even though the windows were open, so if it wasn&#39;t for me we would have missed it completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I strongly believe in the ufo after that particualr encounter but i don&#39;t think i&#39;d like to get any closer unless they start communicating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

I cant say that there were any colors in these lights that was out of the ordinary either. They were just white. The behavior of the lights is what caught our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were outside about 10:00 and noticed what can be discribed as a very small pin of light. Just like that of an airplane very high in the sky. One at a time we noticed these lights coming out of the northern sky over top of us to the south and than breifly stopping (for less than 5 seconds) and shooting at an extemely high rate of speed directly to the east. It was definately not a normal aircraft because the acceleration was almost instantanious not to mention the the perfect 90 degree angle they were making to the east. We witnessed this about seven times in row that night all following the same exact pattern over the same exact tract in the sky. None of us are astronomers or anything but common sense leads us to know that this was not a natural thing. You could tell these were controlled and determined objects. The timing and speed of the objects were all the same in a very disciplined pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this event occured, the 3 of us commented on what we thought it was. Nothing we came up with then or even to this date has satisfied me. It was not your classic UFO sighting with lots of excitement and awe. What we all seen that night was not explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I lived in an area where an airforce base is located and was spooked once when I first saw a stealth bomber. This was like no aircraft I have ever seen. It was triangular in shape and had what appeared to be a spotlight on the front. It seemed to be made in a gridwork fashion and had smaller lights on the corners. What caught my attention was the fact that it seemed to hover and then move at a slow rate of speed. I got out of my car and watched the object for about 5 minutes. The front light seemed to be &#34;searching&#34; the ground for something. There was only a slight humming noise coming from the object. I went inside to get my parents to come look at the object because I had never seen anything like it. My father was in bed, but my mother came outside with me and we watched it for another 10 minutes. It continued moving in a slow fashion just over the tree line and turned 90 degrees and went out of sight. I do not know what I saw and this is the first report I have made of the object. The next day on the radio there were reports of multiple sightings in northern alabama not far from where I lived at the time. The date is approximate as it was a long time ago. I just read similar reports on the sight and would like to know what I saw. My initial thought was military but it has not been made public knowledge that I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As an engineer, I would estimate the objects were approximately a half-mile away from me, and were 50 feet to 100 feet wide, each. They were closer to each other than their widths. That is, they were not very far from each other. They were both vertically oriented squares, that is, they were not &#34;diamond&#34; shaped. They appeared to be without much depth, or so it seemed as I was unable to determine if they had a depth due to my viewing them straight on. The two squares appeared to me by descending from the clouds. The clouds were not very high; maybe a few thousand feet. The squares descended from the clouds, to the point they were just below the clouds, then they moved to the west. I was facing south so they shifted across the sky to the right. They only moved 1000 feet or so when they stopped, remained still for a few seconds, and then receded into the clouds again. I estimate the entire sighting lasted only 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  In 1993, I was swimming alone in the pool one summer night. The weather was nice and warm and the sky was clear. I was floating on my back in the water just looking up at the stars. My body was oriented from east to west, with my feet being to the east. I noticed a red light high in the sky that appeared from my right, from the south. I began following the light with my eyes although I remained in a laying position floating in the water. The red light appeared to be a common aircraft flying high in the sky. I watched the light move toward me and thought nothing of the fact that it was an ordinary airplane or an airliner, but at this point, I gave it no thought at all – I was just watching it fly over me. When the light reached my 11 o’clock position in the sky, it stopped dead. This was very strange to me, as I know planes don’t just stop in the sky. I rose up out of the water to see if I could hear the craft, as it may have been a helicopter, but it was not making a sound. The light was not flashing. I stood in the water looking up at the still, red light with amazement, trying to figure out what I was looking at. After a few seconds of being still, the red light moved again, but not how it was moving before. Previously, the red light was moving across the night sky in a slow, steady fashion, which gave me the impression it was an ordinary aircraft flying by in the night. However, after being still for a few seconds, the red light began moving to the north again. It went from my 11 o’clock position to out of sight as if it had been fired from a gun. It zipped across the sky at what must have been thousands of miles per hour and it was out of my sight in a second, or maybe less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I atte|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07740.html|28|ndxe199108| I was awakened by mercury vapor (orangish) light that illuminated about 2 acres of rural Kauai where there are no street lights. I attempted to go outside but was lulled back to sleep. When dawn broke I I rushed outside and could find no evidence or trace. However, I observed that bright but not blinding light for about 5 minutes. My neighbor also observed the craft and purportedly was abducted. Days later a clear discharge oozed from his neck for almost one year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> see above<n>

I remember looking out and not able to see anything but light, it was so bright that it hurt my eyes to look at it, but I had to look at it.  For about a minute this went on until I heard the sound of a helicopter.  The light then quickly darkened, but I was still able to see a small dot of light, and watched as this light went upwards as the helicopter flew over the house.  My eyes were too sensitive from the brightness for me to see anything else after that as the light moved further away.  The helicopter had only a blinking red light on it, no white lights.  Before the helicopter came there was no sound being made by wherever the light was coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/1/91 02:00|Commerce|TX|Circle|2 minutes|spoked wheel flies in front of the moon|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26459.html|30|ndxe199108| spoked wheel flies in front of the moon<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were sitting on the back porch.  We observed a cluster of lights moving across the sky.  It became apparent that this light formation was not a regular aircraft as it approached us because 1. it made no sound, and 2. the lights were arrayed in a circular pattern.  There was a full moon that night, and as chance would have it, this object passed directly in front of the moon in relation to our line of sight.  Because of this, my brother and I both were able to observe the silhouette of a circular object with what appeared to be 2 spokes, in a cross pattern, connecting its opposite sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Anyways, A friend and I had snuck out of my house one particular evening to meet up with his girlfriend.  We went over to a baseball park named Legion Feild a popular late night hangout for high-school kids.  As we were sitting on the blecher my friend noticed a bright light up above the horizon line.  I noticed that it looked like a flashlight or maybe even an incoming plane, but we are not in the way of any airport runways.  As we watched it approach where we were sitting we noticed it moved slower than a normal aircraft would have and that it made a sound that I could only describe as a vroom vroom vroom sound, maybe in vocal tones it sounds more accurate.  I cannot remember exactly but I do vaguly recall a light beneath the craft, I just don&#39;t remember color andf if it rotated.  My friend and I thought it very strange and noted that it did resemble what the stealth bomber might look like if it passed overhead.  The craft was very low to the ground as well it only felt as if it was about 500 or so feet above us.  We watched it pass over our heads slowly and disappear over the treeline behind us.  It has been 11 years since I have mentioned this sighting and I am sorry if this is too late to report.  I do remember my friend girlfriend showing up at the park shortly after our sighting and we asked if she saw or heard anything, she said no.  Is it possible we were the only two who were allowed to see it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>
8/1/91 01:30|Tawas City|MI|Oval|1 minute|Close encounter on Monument Rd., Tawas City.  Near Corsair.  Craft nearly filled the sky between the pines.  Very large, very close.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61509.html|32|ndxe199108| Close encounter on Monument Rd., Tawas City.  Near Corsair.  Craft nearly filled the sky between the pines.  Very large, very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on Monument Rd. towards East Tawas, around the Corsair cross country skiing area around 1:30am.  While driving, above the tall pines I could see a spotlight shining above the trees, crossing the roadway ahead.  My first thought was the typical helicopters, which my dad always said it was the DNR, that we would see with spotlights at night in the Tawas City area.  As I drove closer, the light was larger and brighter than a normal spotlight I&#39;ve seen before from a helicopter.  I began to slow down and stare through my windshield as I was coming upon it and was almost underneath.  I could tell it was coming from the right to the left as the beam of light was getting brighter.  When the front end of craft appeared in the opening of the roadway (above the trees by approximately 100-200yds), I realized this wasn&#39;t a helicopter.  I pushed my clutch in and pulled over to the side of the road.  The entire front end of the craft was the spotlight.  The best analogy I can give is it looked similar to the battlestar galactica in the first star wars movie.  It was very large and I was almost directly underneath it.  I pulled over, rolled down my window and looked almost directly up at it.  It was moving gracefully and slowly across the opening of the roadway.  The sound was a sound of a light to medium hum.  Almost like the sound of it going through the air.  There wasn&#39;t a rumble of an engine sound.  It sounded like when your furnace kicks on and you can hear the air blowing through the vent, except louder.    I remember thinking that this thing was huge.  The thoughts going through my mind where - this isn&#39;t a helicopter.  What kind of plane is this?  When I realized the entire front end, which was flattened, was the spotlight, I then looked for wings and there weren&#39;t any.  It was moving slowly as well.  I&#39;ve been in plenty of planes and currently live near an airport, and I know a plane moving that slow isn&#39;t possible.  At any rate, when I realized it wasn&#39;t a plane, around 1/3-1/2 ! of it wa s above me with the rear still hidden by the tree tops on the right hand side.  I then said to myself, scan this out and I started scanning all over it with my eyes.  The middle had a slowly pulsating red light.  There were many smaller white lights around the perimeter that were spaced, I&#39;d guess, at around 20-30yds each.  There were roughly 4-5 lights around the longer sides of the oval, with the spotlight out front.  After looking at the lights, I started to look at what was on the body of the craft.  There was stuff?  Again, like the battlestar galactica.  Whereas there were tons of protruding parts all over the place.  At this time, I realized I was out in the middle of no where, by myself.  I remember looking to my left out the window into the woods.  When I thought that I was alone out in the middle of the woods, and when I noticed the darkness of the woods, I got extremely scared, like a monster was about to come out of the woods and get me.  The scared/terrified feeling is like you get as a kid and almost become unable to move.  I remember locking my door and reaching to roll up the window and begin shifting into 1st gear.  As I was rolling up the window, I continued to watch it.  The front end was almost now out of sight and the rear end just broke out from above the trees on the right side.  I started to release the clutch and roll the car when the craft changed its speed.  It originally had to be going no faster than around 25-35mph (taking into consideration the distance).  When it sped up, it doubled/tripled its speed.  I looked forward and shifted into 2nd gear just as I saw car lights coming around the bend (just as I was pulling off of the shoulder of the road).  I figured they had to see this.  I began to slow down and they flew by going normal speeds.  I hit my brake lights to see if they would hit their&#39;s and no go.  I drove home, told my dad about it, he laughed and said it was probably a DNR helicopter.  I know what I saw.  I had time to evaluate it, it moved very slowly, it was dir! ectly ab ove me, and extremely close.  It did not have wings, it was not a helicopter unless there is one that is of this size, and it did not have an engine sound.  When I stretch my arms out, I can measure that the width of this was approximately the distance of my hands being apart of around 1.5 feet.  Extend that angle out to the length of those pines, then add around 100yds+ above that, and that&#39;s the width.  The length was the length of the entire view of the sky that can be seen across the roadway, then minus about 20yds or so.  When the front was about 20yds from being hidden from the trees on the left hand side, only then did I recognize the rear come out from the tree tops on the right hand side of the road.  It continued at its slow pace until it was around almost 1/2 out of view (I could still see the red light in the middle) then it sped up.  Total time from viewing the front of the craft until it was gone, approximately 1min.  I just closed my eyes and replayed the event and it was probably close to 30secs.  Very scary feelings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
