3/31/66 23:50|Dearborn|MI|Oval|20 minutes|Sighted, followed and was followed by spacecraft.|1/29/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21510.html|2|ndxe196603| Sighted, followed and was followed by spacecraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to first corroborate the sighting posted on the monthly report index dated 3/1966. This sighting occurred in Dearborn, Michigan. I was 16 not 17 at the time, and was with the metioned gentleman. Recently our paths crossed for the first time in twenty-eight years. What I saw was oval not boomerang shaped. It had an upper section of super white fluorescent lighting separated by partitions. It was approximately 200&#39; away and 100&#39; above the ground when we first spotted the craft on Monroe Blvd., between Outer Drive and Carlysle, what is known as West Dearborn. It appeared to be about 100&#39; ft. wide. Below the craft was a red glowing dome that pulsated with bright to dimmer intensity. There were no sounds emitting from the craft. My above mentioned friend was the first to notice the craft as I was the driver. The craft was hovering over a residental area near a elementary school. I pulled into the first driveway after spotting the craft and all three of us were in a mild state of shock. This craft seemed to be aware of our presence too. The craft immeadiately headed in a northwest direction with us following in amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s direction took us down Oxford Blvd., which dead-ended at Crowley Park in Dearborn, MI also. Just before the road ended, all the lights on the craft dissapeared. I then pulled into te last driveway on Oxford St. to turn around and head back to Telegraph Rd., (U.S. 24) when suddenly the craft was right over the car. At this point, I could have thrown a stone and hit it. This is where we got a good look at the red pulsating dome on the bottom.  There was now static interference on the 1963 Ford Falcon AM radio we had on at the time. Now... the craft began chasing us. My above mentioned friend was sitting in the middle and put his left leg on my accelerator pedal. My other friend sitting shotgun was throwing punches into my right arm and shoulder. I had no choice but to break all the residental speed laws by about 40 miles per hour. Now we were in survival mode. With the craft over us all the way, we made it to Telegraph Rd. south where the craft stayed at our right over the line of houses and business, rather than the middle of a major highway. We then pulled in to the only restaurant open that night which was near the intersection of Van Born Rd. We managed to get the male cook and female waitress to come out and witness the event. At this point, the craft headed west. Th restaurant employees did see the craft as it was leaving the area but it was too far off for them to describe it as we did. I was a high school student at the time at a Dearborn, MI school.<n>
3/31/66 23:50|Dearborn|MI|Chevron|1-2 hours|Sighted, followed and was followed by space craft and then had and still have lump in earlobe.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17965.html|3|ndxe196603| Sighted, followed and was followed by space craft and then had and still have lump in earlobe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not usually talk about this experience (Most people would think I&#39;m Crazy)...and have pretty much blocked it out of my mind until recently. It was late evening - early morning on the night of March 31-April 1, 1966. (This is a date I will always remember) A friend of mine and I had picked up another friend from work who worked the afternoon shift at an auto plant and were returning to the driver of the vehicles home in Dearborn, Michigan.  I was 19 at the time. My two friends were 17 and 24. We were heading north on Monroe street.  We had just drove past Outer Drive when I had a very strange feeling. About a block past Outer Drive, Monroe makes about a 45% turn to the left. It is just past that point when we all spotted a &#34;Space Craft&#34; hovering over a Public swimming pool/playground located at an elementary school off to our left.  I use the word Space Craft, because it was NOT a UFO as we saw it VERY clear.  It was about 200 feet from us at about 50-75 feet in the air. We saw it so clear that we could see the partitions that seperated the crafts lit up windows.  It was boomerang shaped with a row of large bright white windows. It was about 75 feet wide.  The craft had a red glowing light on it underside with smaller lights on it left and right side. It made no sounds.  The only unusual sounds were a static noise on the radio in the car we were in when we were near the craft. As we stopped to watch it, my friend who was driving, blinked the cars head lights at it.  This is when it started to move slowly. The rest of the details of that night are not clear except that I remember we followed it (were led by it) for about 10 minutes and that it seemed to land it a wooded area West of Telegraph road at an area that was then known as Crowley Park. This is when the rest of the nights becomes cloudy in my memory...until sometime after when we went running into a all night Hamburger diner on Telegraph Road.  There were two persons in the diner that also saw the craft as it was flying away from the area. All three of us had (and I still do) a lump in our ear lobe after the encounter.  I have not seen the other two that were with me in several years, so I can not say if they still have the lump or not.  I have been haunted by VERY BAD dreams and odd things happening to me from that night on.  It was just recently that I remembered another encounter some seven or eight years later with a HUGE craft. All the details of that encounter are slim in my mind. I hope to some day be hypnotised to bring all of the memories out...and to have the lump under my ear lobe removed and studied.<n>
3/29/66 20:00|Roscoe|IL|Chevron|45 Minutes|Multiple craft over Northern Illinois interacting with each other.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36402.html|4|ndxe196603| Multiple craft over Northern Illinois interacting with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time this sighting took place, I was 14 years old.  I was talking to the neighbor on the phone when I first noticed a goldish colored ball of light flying over the field behind our house.  My first thought was it was one of several local farmers who had small planes getting ready to make a turn in preparation to land.  As I watched it, I could see something just wasn&#39;t right with the way it was flying, even though most of the farmers were flying the old Piper Cubs, which are capable of flying quite slow, this was even slower than that.  I had seen probably hundreds of fly-bys by the local farmers over the same field, and this just didn&#39;t compare to any of those as far as speed, flight pattern, and the coloration of the lights.  Instead of turning as I expected it to, the light just continued to come straight on towards our house, and soon the brightness of it&#39;s light was just too different from any planes landing lights I had seen.  I yelled at the neighbor on the phone to tell his parents to look out over the field, I then yelled to my mother and two brothers, who were in the next room, to look over the field at the light, which they did.  Just as the light reached the edge of the field, and the fence line, it was if someone turned off a switch, and it went dark.  My mother and brothers came into the kitchen where I was, and I asked my mom if she knew what it could have been.  Before she could answer we heard something passing over the house.  It was more of a sensed sound, rather than audible, maybe more like we felt some sort of pulsing vibration.  Mom seems to remember it sounding like an air compressor, like those at gas stations as they replenish the air supply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I heard this I ran to the front door, and opened it to go outside, I can remember my mom yelling not to open the door, but it was too late as I had opened it and exited to the outside.  My mom and brothers were standing on the porch yelling at me to come back, as I stood in the front yard looking up at the bottom of the craft which I don&#39;t think was more than 200 feet or so above the house.  There was 1 large light in the center, with a ring over real small lights around that, and a medium size light at the end of each point of the structure, but under the edge, not at the wing tips. I belived the large light was blue, the circle of small lights were orangish.  The ones at the wing points were red and white.  As I looked up at it, I felt something like a mist, it reminded me of a very light spring rain as far as size of droplets, and intensity.   The craft was not moving fast at all, maybe 5 to 10 miles per hour, but that estimate may be off because of it&#39;s size, which was I estimate to be 200&#39; from furthest point to furthest point.  I then noticed that my eyes were beginning to burn, and that when I tried to look up at it, I could no longer keep my eyes open.  It was not a burn like an acid burn, but more like an irritation, as you would get spraying a fine mist of salt water into your eyes.  At this time I retreated back to the porch, where my mom and 2 brothers were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed to stop over the trees across the street from our house and just hover there for about 3 minutes, then began to ascend straight up.  It did not change it&#39;s attitude to ascend.  The front did not rise, the back did not drop, it just remained level and started to go straight up.  I then noticed that at a high altitude a single white light appeared and seemed to be getting larger and brighter.  In the next few minutes, I seen 3 more craft, identical to the one that had passed over our house appear, it seems from 3 other directions.  I remarked that the one that had passed over our house had arrived out of the south, of the others, one came from the north, one from the east and one from the west.  That large white lighted object grew to be about 10 times the size of each of the smaller craft and then stopped it&#39;s descent.  All 4 of the smaller craft seemed to be hovering, with fronts of their craft pointing towards this large white object.  Then one of the smaller craft moved slowly towards the larger craft, and when it&#39;s front seemed to make contact with the larger object, it suddenly began to rotate in a clockwise fashion, nose to large craft. This gave me the impression that the larger craft was in fact rotating in this fashion. and the small craft must have docked with it.  One by one each of the other small craft also docked with the larger craft, and soon all 4 small craft were, as best as I can describe it, sliding sidways around the perimeter of the larger craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about 30 minutes, when one by one each of the smaller craft broke away from the larger craft, and flew off in opposite directions.  One to the south, one north, one east and one west.  The large white object simply ascended back up into the sky until it was lost from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my dad arrived home soon after he was sceptical, so he split us all up into different rooms, and gave each of us a piece of paper and a pencil. Told each of us to draw the object and label anything we had seen. It wasn&#39;t long before he was frantically running from room to room, because all of our drawings matched.  My mom appeared on several local radio programs over the next few days and was interviewed.  Many of these programs had people calling in claiming they saw the same objects.  It turned out the neighbors had been so frightened by it, they closed all their curtains, lit candles and had all their children gather in the living room and prayed through the whole ordeal.  The story also appeared for several days in the local newspaper, The Beloit Daily News, Beloit, WI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 30 seconds into the event, I then saw a military jet fighter approach from north to south (and it appeared much closer than the object),  25 degrees above the horizon, make a sharp turnaround  and head towards the object. An afterburner &#34;puff&#34; of smoke was seen that remained in the clear sky for sometime afterwards. The unknown object was fairly sharply defined and appeared to be reflecting the (setted) sunlight, and I saw no condensation trail.  I saw the object by naked eye and through 7x35 binoculars. I admit I was looking for UFOs at the time. Many had been reported in the area. I was inside looking through a window pane.<n>

While I started to tie my shoe, I looked up as the girls pointed up, and saw an oval spaceship silhouetted in black with a white lights beaming out of windows or port holes. It was only 100 feet or so above us and moving slowly and totally silent, unlike I had ever seen to this day. It was moving slowly from east to west and about eight seconds later, it was right above us and stopped, hovering completely silent above us.  While we stood there spellbound, it had changed to a green color with white light coming from the port holes, and a few seconds later, it changed to red and as it quietly went away from us, it immediately disappeared.  No sounds of rushing, no black silhouette, or nothing. It completely disappeared as if it had entered another dimension. The three of us ran to ((witness #2)) home about a couple hundred yards away, jumped in his yard, and relayed all this to his mother. I ran down the street to my home and told my father and practically made him report it to the newspaper.  The next day, a lady on the west end of the city had reported a meteor falling over the eastside, but we knew the truth. It was a UFO unlike any technology I had ever witnessed. Twenty years later, I spoke with ((witness #2)) who repeated the same exact viewing, etched into his mind as I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.<n>

I don&#39;t know the exact date, but it was an evening when we were all studying for midterms.  A student in a room that faced the Arboretum (actually looked over it - the tops of the trees were level with our windows) called us to her window to see a huge disc hovering over the tops of the trees.  It was metallic looking, gold, and it had a red/orange light in the center and two blue/white lights on the sides.  I assumed there was a fourth light on the side we couldn&#39;t see.  It was perhaps 75 feet across and within a hundred yards of us.  As we watched, it moved forward, then backward and eventually sideways and away from us maybe a mile or so.  It then landed in a grassy clearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I remember it, we called the Civil Defense, the police, and the boys&#39; dorm.  A man from the Civil Defense came up with us to watch it.  We saw the boys run out of the dorm and down toward the object.  We also saw a police car drive toward the object.  As the boys and the car approached, the lights on the object went out.  It was not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, Dr. Hynek from Project Bluebook came out as did the TV and radio stations.  Oddly, I don&#39;t recall that the officials spoke to the actual observers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was labelled as marsh gas - an absurd conclusion as it there was no marsh and what we saw looked metallic and solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years later I read a Reader&#39;s Digest while waiting for a plane, and saw this story reported, so there may be more information there.  I think the R.D. story was in the 80s, but it could have been the 90s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The sightings by many students at Hillsdale College constitute a celebrated case.  This sighting is well described on pages 354-357 in &#34;The Encyclopedia of UFO&#39;s,&#34; written by Ronald D. Story, and published by Dolphin Books in 1980.  The section devoted to the Michigan sightings in March 1966 describe four sightings, on March 14, 17, 20, and 21, the last of which occurred near Hillsdale College, and which was witnessed, reportedly, by 87 students, as well as by Dean William Van Horn, who was the Director of Civil Defense for that college.  The object observed hovered over a nearby swamp for an estimated two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have changed the date above to March 21, in order to reflect what we know about this case.  PD))<n>

My older sister called out that she saw a UFO.  When we other two got to the window, there was nothing to see, but we stayed in excitement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it reappeared by fading into view over a few seconds.  It was a solid silvery-gray color, shaped like a rounded crescent moon.  It started slightly obstructed by trees in a generally northern direction and moved slowly and horizontally to the right with the &#34;open&#34; part leading the way.  It was about 15 degrees above the horizon and moved across open sky for an arc of about 45 degrees of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then stopped movement, in unobstructed sky, and rotated counterclockwise where the open portion faced upward.  In a matter of seconds, it faded from sight by a decrease in intensity of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Half way down the hill at the bottom of a newly excavated roadway, a round silver, metallic object came over the brow of the embankment very slowly and hovered there slightly wobbling.  It suddenly disappeared.  A coil of black smoke was seen in the light of the traffic light at the bottom of the hill.  There is an electric power sub station on the top of the embankment at the bottom of the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a care ahead of us.  It stopped and  so did we.  Then we saw a round ,silver metallic object.  It looked like one saucer upside down over a right side up saucer.  On the top, at the bottom of the rise of the dome were opaque, lit, windows.  At the center of the bottom was a black disc that rotated.  Iridescent sparks were seen at the perimeter of the disc.  There was no noise noted from the object.<n>

My husband went out side to check the steaks and he called to us in the house saying, &#34;hey!  I think I see some UFOs&#34;.  We all ran out side and just stood side by side and watched a most amazing sight... out over Lake Michgan. There were 3 big round BRIGHT lights out over the lake in a row... just hovering... then the light on the south side just shot off to the south towards Chicago... then the light on the north side shot off to the north... then the light in the middle shot off eastward... over our heads... at a speed the likes I&#39;ve never seen before NOR SINCE!.... it seemed to be climbing too as it flew over our heads... All the lights seemed to fly so unbieveable fast... that they just vanished in seconds. The next day in the News Paper, the News Platium of Benton Harbor, Michigan, had a huge article about the sighting (none of us called in any report)... the article was lengthy because 100s &amp; 100s of people called in reporting that sighting... the article even mentioned some prominent community members as making reports about the sighting... the article reported the sighting just as we ourselves witnessed it. I am sure there were many others like ourselves too out there on the Lake Michigan Bluffs who seen it all too, just like us 4 did... and just as we did... didn&#39;t call anyone to make a report... It was such a beautiful summer night... there had to be 1000s of folks out on the bluffs that night... and 1000s that seen those lights. I have considered going to the New Platium and looking through their archives trying to find that article... on the ocassions that I&#39;ve gone back to Michigan for visits; (I now live in Colorado)... Anyways... I know it occured sometime between 1966-1969... it seemed like it was in July or August... It was a night I&#39;ll never forget...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness has confirmed that her sighting was the one seen over Michigan in March 1966.  It was investigated by Dr. James Allen Hynek, and the investigation also involved Congressman from Michigan, Gerald Ford.  We believe the date was in early March 1966  PD))<n>

I brought our family German Shepard out our back door of the house for his evening outing. It was a clear night. Starry. No moon whatsoever. I often, when outside walking our dog, gaze at the night sky. We have a large piece of property out back-where you could walk around looking at the sky, without bumping into anything. I happened to see what I thought was a jet miles away- a single light moving accross the sky. About the size and brightness of a large star. As I just began to casually track its flight; my eyes picked up two other lights of the same size, moving towards the first light at what seemed like the same speed. It did not take me long to realize, that, they were all travelling towards an imaginary center point in the sky. As they approached each other, I could see that they were maintaining the same speed, and distance from each other as they got closer. When the three lights reached the center and each other; there appeared for just a few seconds-one light. Then, like a bursting firework in the sky, the one light became seven or eight, that, moved away from each other in a near perfect circle, at about the same brightness, speed and maintained distance. I watched as they disappeared, over about 20 seconds or so. Afterwards, I felt calmly elated, sort of comforting to observe this sort of show in the sky-that I still feel to this day, was meant for me to see. I went back in the house with our dog to relay my experience-which no one really paid any attention to. It didn&#39;t matter then-or now if anyone would care to hear about what I had seen. I saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The mind wanted to say it was just an jet airliner viewed from the side glowing in the east rising sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more I watched and listened to the comments made by my contemporaries and our teacher Mrs. Adams, the more I became convinced it was far too large and moving much too slow for it to be any type of air lift craft in current use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the craft seemed to spin in place on a central axis in our direction and began to rapidly fly in an east by south direction. The speed in which this happened was astounding. In fact it seemed that the craft moved from the far distance over the horizon to where we were and past in the space of a few short breaths and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time while observing this did my mind think I was seeing anything other than a solid physical object moving without obvious means of lift. The speed with which the craft moved was beyond anything I had ever seen or have witnessed since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it is worth I think the craft was in no way compatible with known human science at the time or aircraft manufacture of the mid-60s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date in March 1966 is approximate.

We have been stuck with it every since.  PD))<n>

We didn&#39;t report it at the time.    Unfortunately, my mother has since passed away, so I am the only one left to depart this information.  Her death and my age prompts me to speak now before the story is lost.  The sighting was years ago, but the details of the astounding craft, its show of interest in us, and the entire experience have remained clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please read my story and see what you think.  Something of  this nature is quite difficult to share, for fear of how it will be received, but I hope you will find it credible and interesting.  I would appreciate hearing what you think after reading this account, and if you have any questions I&#39;d be happy to try to answer them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely ((name deleted)) Shelby Township, Michigan<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1966, I was 19 years old and lived in Gibraltar, Michigan, with my family.  I don&#39;t recall the date, but at that time there had been a flurry of UFO sightings being reported in our area .  There was much discussion and speculation on the local radio stations concerning the reported sightings, and the topic was being handled with a mixture of curiosity and derision.   Later, I think &#34;swamp gas&#34; may have been given as an official explanation of the many sightings, but by then my mother and I knew there was more to the story than that. One morning, in the midst of the time period of the frequent sightings, we had our own UFO experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 11:00 A.M. my mother and I left the house to go shopping.  She was driving the car.  It was a bright, sunny day with a clear sky.  We were driving northwest on North Gibraltar Rd., heading toward nearby Trenton.   That road had, until recently, run straight out of Gibraltar to join West Jefferson Rd. near the Gibraltar McClouth Steel plant, but had been rerouted so that there was a left bend in the road and it now joined West Jefferson somewhat south of the steel plant. I mention this because, as we were approaching the new bend in the road, I could see straight ahead to where the road (still intact but blocked off) had once joined West Jefferson near McClouth Steel.  Over the smoke stack of the steel plant, there was a large shining disk-shaped craft, just hovering in the air low over the stack. I pointed it out to my mother and said &#34;Hurry and get up there so we can see what it is.&#34;   There had been a lot of press given to pollution from factories in those days and ! my first  thought was that someone was testing the exhaust from the smoke stack.  The nature of the unusual disc shaped object, however, caused me to quickly reject that simple explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The change in the road forced us to turn left instead of approaching the steel plant directly,  so I kept my eyes on the disk as my mother quickly angled toward West Jefferson Rd..  We reached West Jefferson, turned right onto it (now traveling northeast),  and began approaching the section of road in front of  McClouth Steel.  By this time, we had slowed way down in order to continue to observe the disc.  There were no other cars on the road at that time, or throughout the duration of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we slowed down and approached the factory, the disc began to move slowly and silently  toward the road, so that our paths would converge right in front of the steel plant.  This was a four lane highway, and the aircraft stopped and hovered, centered over our lane as though waiting for us to approach.  We did, very slowly.  The size of the disc was such that, centered over the far right lane where we were, it extended over the other three lanes on one side, and out over the shoulder and ditch on the other..<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time, even as it was happening, I became aware of a remarkable feeling that came over me.  I suddenly felt extremely comfortable and relaxed- completely unafraid and unthreatened, even though what I was seeing did not fit at all with my concept of reality and would logically have had the opposite effect.  It was the calmest, most clear headed, yet overwhelmingly curious I had ever been.  So much so that I can still recall that strange, very positive mix of emotions that were so contrary to the data my senses were taking in.  I&#39;ve never experienced anything like it since.   At this time,  I began to calmly describe aloud everything I was seeing, to confirm with my mother that she was seeing the same things.  It is this deliberate, and methodical process that we went through during the sighting that, I believe,  has helped me to remember so clearly after all these years, the details we observed that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc was shiny metallic in color.  It seemed to be made of an unpainted metal that was bright in the sunlight, but not highly polished.  It had come to a stop and was hovering about twenty five to thirty feet above the road.  It was a perfectly round disc shape, and the bottom surface was slightly rounded (convex), almost flat.  The top half was convex also, but the center portion of the top half was more raised and dome like, so that there was an elevated, angled surface on which there were large windows.   We could see just one side of the craft at that time, but the windows disappeared around the curved surface as though they went all the way around it.  The windows were rectangular in shape, wider than they were tall, and had rounded corners.  We counted four of them.  I described all these details to my mother aloud as I observed them, and she concurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the shape of the upper portion of the craft, the windows were angled farther away from us at the top than at the bottom.  I said to my mother, &#34;Try to look inside.  There has to be someone in there looking out at us.  They&#39;re probably looking at us just like we&#39;re trying to look at them.&#34;   We both tried, but something about the glass, or possibly the angle of the windows, kept us from seeing beyond them. The aircraft was close enough that, if it had been a house with vertical windows of regular glass, we could have easily seen inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was afraid to stop the car and, even though I kept saying, &#34;Stop,&#34; because I wanted  to prolong the sighting,  she insisted on allowing the car to continue to creep forward, though barely.  We continued to try to see beyond the glass, and to look for details to confirm with each other, until we gradually began to overtake the object, but as we did it moved very slowly off center of our lane and more over the right shoulder of the road and the field beside it.  At this time, I started describing what I was seeing on the bottom surface, because our angle of observation had changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mother, &#34;Look and see if you can see any markings, numbers or letters.&#34; - as you&#39;d expect to see on an airplane, helicopter, or other commercial or military aircraft.  We both looked closely, but couldn&#39;t see anything like that.  I did note, and verbalized,  that the bottom surface had &#34;seams&#34; in it.  It was not a smooth surface like one piece of metal but, instead, was made up of many different pieces joined together in a fashion I could not make any sense of.  I stated that possibly the seams marked compartments that would open, and we tried to tell if there was an entrance door, or compartment for landing gear.  We talked of that possibility, but there was no way to know if that was the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also looked for evidence of how the different sections were fastened together- large nuts and bolts, screws, giant rivets, etc., - anything that I&#39;d recognize as typical construction methods for other large metal objects that I was familiar with. There was no obvious &#34;joining&#34; system for the separate metallic sections that made up the bottom surface of the disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to roll slightly forward, the disc had moved off to the right a little but it was still ahead of us, so we were looking out the windshield and a little off to the right at it.  Then, without making a sound,  the craft moved a very little, slowly, paused, and then shot off at a great speed, rising into the sky at a very shallow angle and disappearing in about 3 seconds.  We noticed that, even though it departed extremely fast,  the tops of the trees near where it had hovered were hardly disturbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed as though the sighting lasted for about fifteen minutes, with about ten of that being spent face to face with the disc at close range.  However, we didn&#39;t check the time so I can&#39;t be sure how long we watched the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it left, my mother accelerated the car to a normal driving speed and we continued to our shopping destination.  Of course, we discussed what we&#39;d seen and wondered if we should report it, but it&#39;s amazing to me now that we were so unshaken by the event as to continue on shopping as though nothing had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home we told my dad about it and he laughed at us and said, &#34;Oh, you girls just saw a helicopter.&#34;   We explained to him that it was too close to make that kind of mistake, but he was intent on not taking it seriously and discouraging us from making a report that would draw ridicule.  Considering the public derision then being aimed at the reporters of strange lights in our area,  my mother and I became convinced that the authorities and general public would not have believed the up close and detailed experience we&#39;d had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years since that day, I have been very happy to have had this rare experience,  to know for a fact that U.F.O.s do exist, and to know clearly what at least one kind looks like.  I&#39;m still in awe of  the overwhelming sense of clear minded alertness, coupled with unnatural calm and a sense of safety that suddenly came over me in its presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below, you will see a picture I drew of the U.F.O. we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   Thank you for reading my account of this event.  I hope that, in some way, it might shed some light on this important subject.  Again, I&#39;d appreciate your comments, and will try to answer any questions you may have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely ((name deleted)) Shelby Township, Michigan<n>
