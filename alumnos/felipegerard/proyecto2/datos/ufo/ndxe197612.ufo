They called me from the other end of the House.  They did not know what they were seeing. I grabbed my binoculars and ran to where they were.  I located the objects.  They were like two pie plates placed open side to open side.  We saw them edge on.  Each one had a distinct pale yellow light on their bottom side or face.  The full moon was shining in a sky with scatttered clouds.  It was reflecting off the objects.  Also, the light on the bottom side was reflecting of that surface.   They appeared to be made of a very polished or shiny metal.  I tracked them through the picture window until they went overhead.  I then ran to the other end of the house and reacquired them.  One-the one originally on the left and now on the right continued on its original course.  The one originally on the right, but now on the left due to my change of position and viewing perspective had curved off and was heading straight north.  There was no apparent sound, and they moved at a steady pace.  The lights were steady.  They were probably two to three hundred feet up.  There was more perspective on their height as they were moving over some trees and were observed through same. I would guess they were probably 30 feet in diameter and a third that thick.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Craft made humming sound that wasn&#39;t heard until it was almost overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with a friend standing near an  intersection of town near my home when my friend said &#34; God, that&#39;s a big plane!&#34;. I looked  where she was pointing at the sky &amp; saw two large bright white lights. I thought it was a large plane also but thought it was strange because the local airport was too small to handle airplanes bigger than a Piper Cub. I kept watching the lights &amp; noticed that I could now see a red light between the 2 white lights. Couldn&#39;t hear any noise at this time. As the object flew almost overhead (it was cold that night with a bright moon w/thin kind of gauzey clouds) I could clearly see the shape of the object ,diamond shape with a white light at each point and a red light in the middle. It was at this time that I heard a humming sound coming from the object. The object was black on the bottom. The object flew over some trees &amp; we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I am a 42 year old woman w/a firm belief in UFOs.Have been very interested in the subject for many years.  I also read alot. Have a college education. The other witness was a friend of mine from high school (we were both about 20 years old at the time ) I don&#39;t know if she was interested in UFOs (never talked about the subject) but she was fairly intelligent.<n>
12/12/76 21:00|Minnetonka|MN|Disk|1-2 minutes|Disc shaped object, silent, with 2 search light beams, floating through airspace in Minnetonka, Winter or 1976.|10/3/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/114/S114146.html|4|ndxe197612| Disc shaped object, silent, with 2 search light beams, floating through airspace in Minnetonka, Winter or 1976.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Decades ago, in the middle of Winter, I believe 1975/76… my best friend and I experienced a U.F.O. event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had to be the weekend as I was at my best friends house late, well after dark. We were watching t.v. and when a commercial came on, we decided to walk to the local Tom Thumb convenience store for snacks. The store was near, less than a block away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left his house and walked around the side to the back of the house, heading toward Minnehaha Creek, which ran behind his house. The creek was frozen, and we chose to cross the creek over a bridge that was behind one of his neighbors house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, no clouds in the sky. The area back then was not overly developed, so there were only a few street lights scattered about, they did little to impede the view of the stars. The stars were bright against a black sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the beginning of the bridge, we noticed a light in the woods to our left, or from the North. Without speaking, we stopped on the top of the tiny bridge, to watch the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it might be a snowmobile, though I had never seen a snowmobile in the city, it seemed the only logical explanation. Moments later, as the light moved closer to us, it became apparent that the light(s) were coming from above. As they came out from the trees, we could clearly see 2 distinct light beams, like search lights, beaming down from a source we could not see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light originated from a source that was just above the tree tops, maybe 25 feet max? The lights moved slowly toward us, about the pace of someone jogging. The light crisscrossed slowly and seemed to be following the creek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pondered whether it was a helicopter, but it made no sound and should have kicked up loose snow and debris. I wondered if it was a hot air balloon, but I never saw a flame, and it seemed unlikely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it finally passed over us, we could finally  make out some shape, the object, which appeared to be black, with no reflection, cut a shape out of the sky. It blocked out the stars with a crisp circular shape. Though we could not see any details, the shape was undoubtedly circular, disc shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I stress, it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the hair on the back of my neck was standing on end, this was clearly nothing conventional, we watched slack jawed as it continued on in a Southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it slowly move around another cluster of trees and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hadn’t spoken a word the whole time, but then we turned toward each other, my friend spoke first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Buddy, we can’t tell anyone we saw this”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without further discussion, we went on our way. I knew he was right, no adults were ever going to take us seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never spoke about it again for decades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went down different paths, I lost track of my friend. But when I was a junior in college, coming back from a bar with my girlfriend, we ran into my old friend and his GF.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We exchanged phone numbers and went on our ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to wonder if I remembered the events from so long ago accurately, so I finally called him. Not wishing to taint his memory, I did not tell him what I saw first, instead I just asked him one question, “Do you remember that one night?” He then proceeded to describe the same event, in exactly the same details, with only one exception…  He claims we saw the UFO on our way back from the store, I am convinced it was on our way to the store. I consider this minor. The fact that he described the event in exactly the same details, confirms for me, that it was real and my memory is still clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this to MUFON, and the other 2 events from 2006/2009. They kept the 1976 report, and  the 2006 report, but deleted the 2009 report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all 3 events, I was not alone.<n>

They were some distance in height and traveled in a straight trajectory at slightly varying speeds and at such a speed as to disappear beyond the roofs of houses within a few brief seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

12/6/76 05:30|Davie|FL|Changing|40 minutes|I have checked your log report and found that the sighting I reported shortly after December 6, 1976, was not filed. I am dismayed but|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44257.html|6|ndxe197612| I have checked your log report and found that the sighting I reported shortly after December 6, 1976, was not filed. I am dismayed but have not forgotten a single detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 5:30 AM on 12/06/1976, as was ususal I was heading West on Sterling Rd. in Davie, Florida, to drop my children 4 and 1 1/2 years old at a daycare center. I was enrolled in BCC and my wife worked at ((name deleted)) restaurant on ((deleted)) Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was passing a bicyclyst I noticed in the Northwest sky a fireball falling.  After a minute I pulled my car over and shut it off to say prayers as I thought it was a plane crashing.  I sat for several minutes after the fireball disappeared behind trees several miles away but I saw no flash, nor did I hear an explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within two more minutes I and my wife observed a huge dull, grayish metalic looking object that was heading slowly toward us and southeast. The object was immense, did not emit any noise, smoke or any exhaust that would be noticable from thermal fluctuations of the air around it.  The object now appeared to be oblong or cigar shaped, more than 250 feet long and more than 30 feet high.  There seemed to be some sort of whitish light atop and a light at each end, front and rear but not white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached our vehicle my wife&#39;s upper body leaned out the window to look up at it.  I observed it from the windshield inside. We kept asking what the he** it was and when I looked at her I noticed her back and the entire interior of the car was illuminated. I then noticed my 4 year old daughter leaning on the back window looking up. I then looked at my interior light and saw it was not lit.  I immediately looked out my side window and it was still pitch black outside the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked up as best I could to get a fix on the structure as it was now less than 50 feet from us. The surface was not metal at all.  It had a sandy texture similar to that of shark skin.  I could not locate any seams or a single area that would suggest any conventional assembly that I am or have ever been aware of.  The object became stationary for an undetermined period of time and we just stared at it for minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the corner of my left eye I could see a small child-like figure run rapidly across the front of my headlights.  It was about to climb over the metal road barrier but hesitated and turned toward me.  I had immediately tried to get a glimpse of any articles that I might be able to identify but it had nothing.  No shoes, belt, tools, weapons or any other devices.  My first thought was to jump out and grabit and throw it in the trunk because no one would believe me if I didn&#39;t.  A voice of sorts told me not to move or I would be harmed.  I tried to lift my arm and was horrified that it looked as if it was cut off where the light ended inside the car. I looked at the figure again and thought that it was so small and having no weapons I could take it in a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The voice or whatever it was described the stretch cloth suit it was wearing carried 40,000 volts of piezoelectrical current.  This is a term I had never heard of and I knew I could not have imagined the thought.  The figure then hopped over the fence and went into a horse breeding ranch at about 140th st.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My last memory of the incident was when I was looking behind me in my car and seeing a somewhat different shaped object about 1 mile south of me moving slowly at first but then as I watched it the object seemed to accelearte so fast it just vaporized. It was also after sunrise and without a word to my wife or a word from her to me I started my car, drove to the daycare center, dropped off the children and did not say a word to the people. I learned later that we were at the scene for more than 40 minutes. I never saw the bicyclist pass us. A also lost my eyesight for almost 2 days after the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After years of horrible dreams and nightmares I learned that the subjects who occupy the craft are from a parralel universe. Their craft are not built but actually grown by reconstructing the atomic anatomy of what we call a &#34;Diamond&#34; where the conditions exist for such. The suit (for lack of a better term) that the small figure was covere with is also a mineral which is genetically altered. I also learned that, just as a diamond, the outer shell adapts to the temperature changes the instant the craft becomes stablilized in whatever atmospheric temperature it is suspended in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One issue that has stuck in my mind for years is the fact that whatever the voice was that conveyed the images to me also mentioned repeatedly; m&#34; You can be violent.&#34; I   am not sure if it applied to me or the people of this planet as a whole. However, the occupants of the craft I saw are neither friendly nor inclined to become violent. They have almost no emotional state at all, yet they are certainly aware of ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the interior of the craft; there was not a single sharp angle anywhere I could see and again, nothing to provide any evidence that the object was assembled. It looked more like something hollowed out areas of a huge iceberg with a torch. The area which was used to control it&#39;s speed and motion was a long, flat, glass-like surfce no more than 2 inches thick and less than 2 ft. wide but rather long. I also could not locate any source of light despite the entire interior ares I went being fully luminated.<n>

12/3/76 23:00|Monrovia|IN|Triangle|20 min|after being followed by a ufo, a beam of light shown down on my sister|2/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05431.html|8|ndxe197612| after being followed by a ufo, a beam of light shown down on my sister<n> <n><n> <n><n> This story is not my own but belongs to my sister. I have wanted her to relate this story for a long time but she does not have access to the net. In the winter of 76 her and her girl friend were coming home from a meeting and were driving on a lonely country road when her friend said look at that helicopter. my sister said, That is no helicopter, and she asked her friend to stop the car. Her friend freaked out and floored the gas pedal. The bright triangle object followed them to my sisters lonely farm house and was over the barn when they pulled into the drive. My sister got out of the car and the object slowly moved above her.it did not make a sound. her friend was hystrical and began to yell for my sisters boyfriend to come outside. The object was directly over my sister and she looked up and saw a trangle shape at tree top level . A beam of light shown down on her and  she looked down because she was afraid it would hurt her eyes. At her feet was a cat and the beam broke and also shown on the cat. by this time her boyfriend was at the door and when he slammed the screendoor the light went out. The object moved off through the corn fields and when it was far away a bunch of lights that were thought ,at the time, to be stars fell  to link up to it. I know this sounds crazy but she cannot tell this without tears in her eyes and getting all shakey. We knew nothing about abductions at the time so we know of no missing time.<n>
12/3/76 15:30|Milford|CT|Disk|2 hours|Saw five craft  and observed signaling after work.|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35162.html|9|ndxe197612| Saw five craft  and observed signaling after work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As reported to MUFONCT:  After coming home from work I observed a white fluorescent cigar shaped object 60ft high and 35 ft away at closest point.  The object was about 20 ft long and about 6&#39; high.  It moved into the southern sky about 1 mi away stayed and burst into a &#34;gigantic sparkler&#34;...which then moved in a straight line and exploded two more objects from itself.  Those two began to signal me by movements then went past their &#34;mother&#34; --then they began to turn red and blink then disappear over horizon.  I got into my car to chase &#34;mother&#34;, as I viewed it thru binoculars I raised the binoculars upward and observed the black crescent UFO which nearly filled my entire field of view.  I lowered the bino. and noted that it was several hundred feet in the air.  I ran to my car and encountered a &#34;mystery man&#34; who began to bang on my window. talked with him for a minute then drove to the police station.  Upon arriving home, I saw a chevron cloud formation, raised binoculars to one cloud and saw a classic flying saucer (hump above and below center line) which came from cloud with rotating disk and alternate red and green lights attached to disc.  It approached me and looked as if it would hit the house in which I stood--I hid behind storm door and watched saucer float above my neighbors house across the street--about 50 ft away and about 50  ft high.  Stepped outside as it veered off to the western horizon, where it hovered...after a few moments it came back towards me, turned on its axis and the rotating dissk turned on end moved to the right and disappeared piecemeal as if moving into a cut into the very sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
