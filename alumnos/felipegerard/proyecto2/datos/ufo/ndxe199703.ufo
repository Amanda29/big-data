We were hoping to see a clear night so we could later come back and photograph the comet.We drove out to the airport farthest from town. The road going in is dirt, and scary, but he grew up here, where I am from the east coast of the states. To me, it was extremely dark out, even with the clear sky.When we arrived at the final part of the road into the airport, we were facing an south easterly direction. In front of us in the sky, were some objects flying from east to west, as best I could tell.I asked my husband to stop, and we got out and watched them fly just under mars and disappear. Later I discovered he had seen two objects closer to the horizon, flying west to east, and flying in a closer formation than what I saw. They were orange in color, and round in shape, but also very far away.They were also flying to fast to be the usual satellite, and too high up to be a plane.I&#39;d seen a light like that last year while looking up at the comet of 1996, while at a pit stop, so I didn&#39;t think much of it.There is a light at the actual airport that didn&#39;t give us very good viewing of the comet, so we drove back onto the road where we could see. We looked around, and decided to go back home for the camera as picture taking would be excellent, and saw a car comingtowards us. He started up the car, and we took off to home, when out of my window, facing mars, I saw the light returning from the west...just one. I asked him to stop again, I see it I said. As soon as I said it, the object turned straight towards usand I started to scream to him, oh my God, it&#39;s coming at us! They&#39;re coming for us! I was so scared, and it seemed to fly from a high altitude to a lower one, at which point I began to get very afraid, and I started to yell at it to go away, that we didn&#39;t want it here, and it couldn&#39;t take us.By the time he had stopped and turned off the car, the object was already speeding away up into the sky, and as he jumped out of the car, I saw the last of it disappear.It happened so quickly, and I was so afraid that we went home to calm down a bit....he still wanted a picture of the comet, and I wasn&#39;t about to stay home alone, so I went with him, and we saw nothing, probably because we were prepared with a camera this time!Just this past weekend, a friend of ours said they saw something similiar flying over Hinton, around three am, when he was driving back from Edmonton.I also note that an earthquake, unusual for this area, happened the morning before our sighting, and was a 4.2 (?) located just southeast of Jasper. I reported this to a an association up here called AUFORA, but I haven&#39;t heard anything from them. We also checked the flight log at the airport when we went back, andthere was no flight recorded, although there was a plane landed from out of town, and a few unoccupied cars.My husband and I are 30 and 24 repectively, and lead fairly normal lives. Both of us have art degrees, and are planning our first business venture as I write this.<n>

It looked to be very large, it’s a little difficult to judge its distance but I would say it was only a couple hundred feet above me and it was moving slow but steady.   I remember walking slowly backwards trying not to take my eyes off this thing, watching it for as long as I could keep it in sight walking to the farthest corner of my yard practically climbing up on the fence just so I could get that last look until it disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole encounter only lasted maybe 2 to 3 minutes. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Listening to the radio program on Coast to Coast on the evening of March 13th 2007 got me excited because until now I thought that maybe I was only one of a few who had witnessed this encounter, when I was describing this craft to friends and family 10 years ago I was describing it then as a boomerang shaped craft.  It was surprising and comforting at the same time to hear stories from people that were so similar to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I did not see this craft on the evening of  (March 13, 1997) where many others did in Phoenix Arizona, I can undoubtedly say that this &#34;boomerang&#34; shaped craft was seen March 31, 1997 in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Canada!<n>

When|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02158.html|3|ndxe199703| Summary : A friend and I saw a strange low altitude bright object flashing orange and green rotating colors on Easter night in Juneau,Alaska. When seen through my telescope (wewere looking at the comet and the planets),it had this strange light and dark light,pattern or field around and above it, likelight defraction patterns. No other starswere as low or had that effect. I could notsee colors with telescope. Only by naked eyeobservations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was visting a friend and she and I werelooking at the comet on Easter night andshe said hey, look at that satellite! I wasfacing north and I focused my Meade telescopeon it. It was flashing orange and green in arotating fashion...I then looked at itthrough my scope and to my surprise I couldntdetect the colors!Instead it had this really weird lightfield...of dark and bright lines above andaround it...like a light defraction pattern.The object was really bright white with thosestrange lines going around it in a strangestriped pattern. The colors could not bedetected with the scope! I then thought itwas my lens so I focused on a bright star andthe patterns were not present on anything else!When I looked again with just my eyes I sawthe flashing rotating orange and green lightsbut when I used the scope, all I saw was thestrange dark and light patterns. It was lowin the sky, and stationary. I was facingnorth and it was to my right. I looked at itoff and on for about 2 hrs. while checkingout the comet and mars.I went home, I live a block away, and when Igot to my house and looked up again to find it,it was not there--to my right! I was stillfacing north. I looked to my left and thereit was! It was so close(low)that a one blockdrive was enough to move it over. So it meansit was positioned in between my friends houseand mine! I dont think high altitudegeosynchronistic satellites would be lowenough to cause that much of a difference ifI moved only a block away! Plus later, after2 days of clouds, it was no where to be seen!Ive never seen anything out of the ordinarybefore. I know what venus and mars and theother planets look like through my scope, soI&#39;m sure it wasnt a planet!My friend saw the colored lights, cause shepointed it out to me, but she went intoher house while I stayed outside and lookedat the sky and the &#34;object&#34;. It was too coldfor her! I didnt really think too much aboutthe strange erie lights until I got home andrealized that the object was WAY TOO LOW,cause it moved to my left, to be a satellitelike my friend first thought it was.<n>

We viewed it for about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was low in the sky and was bright orange.  It was like it was the sun, but smaller.

SIGHTING WAS MADE AT NIGHT, WITH NAKED EYE.  OBJECT FLEW THROUGH THE TREE TO TOP OF THE HOUSE, HOVERED, CIRCLED ONCE AND FLEW AWAY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside on the patio with the dog, talking to a friend on the phone.  From the corner of my eye, I spotted movement through the branches of the tree beside the garage, about twenty feet from me.  I turned to get a closer look.  There were no outside lights on, nor was there any light from the house spilling onto the paito or garage as none were on at the time.  As I turned, the object floated through the tree limbs to the top of the house visible from the patio.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then circled somewhat drunkenly as if determinig the direction to go.  It then flew over the house towards my neighbors house in a southwesterly direction. I was unable to track it futher as it was gone in an instant.  I described it to my friend as I watched it.The object was about the size of a tennis ball, perfectly round.  It had an orangey-gold glow, reminding me of the light a firefly gives off, but more yellow.  It was to large to be an insect.  I normally wear glasses for distance viewing, but did not have them on at that time, so the object was large enough for me to see without my glasses.  It was perfectly round.I am 47 years old, female and married.  At the time, I was home alone as my husband was in the hospital.  I have seen some things in the past that I could not explain, but never bothered to tell anyone for fear I&#39;d not be believed.  However, this was REALLY strange.  I have not been able to come up with any explaination.  The evening was clear, as I&#39;d seen the comet earlier and there were stars out.  There are not lights anywhere near where I saw this objcet.I do have a question that is not related to this:  Are there planes that fly low, rather large with bright lights that DO NOT MAKE A NOISE?  I have seen several over the past five months.  As we live near a large airport, I wondered if what I&#39;ve been seeing is a plane or planes?  It&#39;s usually late at night, after midnight when I see these.  They are not the planet Venus, unless the plantet likes to fly very low over our neighborhood.  I repeat, there is absolutely NO sound before or after this plane or whatever, flies overhead.  It&#39;s the bright lights that get your attention.I would prefer your not contacting me as it would upset my husband who is not in good health.  Thank you.<n>

It silently floated northbound in a straight line (not descending) as I gazed east toward the Gila Mountains. It was a few degrees above the mountain ridge and about the size and brightness of the moon (when the moon is high - not it&#39;s just risen appearance) Unfortunately, buildings &amp; trees blocked my full field of vision so I didn&#39;t get to see where it went. I watched it for about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, another UFO incident I know was when I was a child. My father worked at Cape Kennedy (in Data processing and died in 1969) came home all excited (a very stoic man) and said something came up to one of our unmanned rockets right after it launched and like a mosquito to a man (UFO to the rocket) and checked it out at many angels and then flew off in a blink of the eye. I&#39;m guessing this was during the Gemini missions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

They believed they were going to meet the spaceship behind Hale Bopp to go to a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the joking talk among my group at breakfast.  I knew the day would end much more pleasantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That late afternoon, back home in Palm Springs, I welcomed several friends, armed with binoculars and telescopes, all come to comet-watch from my front lawn, which faces West, the direction the Comet would be visibly arcing over shortly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wine was served and each staked out a spot.  I chose a spot on my outdoor-living room wall, facing the foothills of the mountains directly in front of my house.  Soon, just before twilight, the first lights of the comet, coming from the north west were visible.   Everyone made trips inside for snacks and drinks and chatter  until darkness began to fall.  The night was very still and clear and dark, and the lights from the arcing comet were spectacular.  Several of the group,  once they saw the comet,  had enough of that and were gathered in the living room enjoying each other’s company and the wine.  I stayed at my post as, from my point of view,  it was too wonderful to miss a moment of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leaning my elbows on the wall, I was very comfortably watching the show with my binoculars.  I did notice that directly in front of me there were two very bright  unblinking “stars”, just over the top of the foothills, it seemed: (it was by now quite dark, so I surmised they were right over the top of the foothills.)  Suddenly about 45 minutes  into watching the comet arc ever closer to the front of my house, (probably about 7 or 7:30 PM) , just as Hale-Bopp was almost directly overhead. The two “stars”  shot forward, like blazing headlights, straight toward me. Startled, I almost dropped my binoculars.  But I no longer needed them as these objects were so bright as to be blinding.  They looked like the headlights of the largest vehicle ever and they zoomed toward me.  Just as I knew they would crash into me and my house, they just as swiftly in concert zoomed to my right,( north)  toward Hale-Bopp.  When I say zoomed, these lights moved with  swiftness and with a smoothness of flight I had never imagined possible.  Obviously what I had thought to be “stars” was one object.  The two lights sailed in perfect concert  directly toward the comet, and seemed to disappear behind it, in moments going so fast and so far they became invisible in the light of the comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to see who else had seen it , but everyone else had been inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was later told  that some of my neighbors down the street saw it, and that there was something in the next day’s Palm Springs newspapers.  I did not see the articles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps the members of Heaven’s Gate were in that “spaceship” behind the comet, and just maybe they got to the anticipated UFO they sought?  I do hope so for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But that was not the only experience with strange phenomenon here in these mountains and foothills.  About a year ago, in the fall of 2007, Palm Springs experienced a night of thunderstorms.  The foothills and mountains were covered in clouds and thunder rumbled all night.  About 3 AM the noise woke me, and going into my all-glass living room, I looked up at the mountains in front of me.  I was astonished to see four huge squares of bright lights.  I would estimate that given the distance from me the largest one was about 50’ square, and the smaller two were about 30 ‘ square.  Each had a spectacular whiteness but while they were extraordinarily bright they were not shining the light anywhere.  They were like beacons.  And they were moving.  They were not stationary.  I could not imagine how people could possibly be way up there in those rocky  foothill-mountains, and moving those huge lights about. It just would not be possible to stand up there in the darkness and move those lights about.  I stared at this phenomenon for about fifteen minutes, mesmerized.  I hesitated to call the police.   I kept thinking perhaps the police were doing this!  (Now that’s crazy sounding , I know, but that is what I was thinking.)  Just as I had decided to call someone, the  lights just went out.  One minute they were there.  Then they were out.  Nothing sped away.  They just went out.  The next day I searched with binoculars that area and knew that it would have been impossible for people to be walking and standing in those areas, way at the top of those mountains.  And no way they could have in the dark held and moved those lights. But where did they go?  What were they? And a third occurrence  in these mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day I was driving home from the Palm Springs airport, traveling west on Tahquitz.  At one point I happened to look up, and there over the top of the mountains at the end of that street, was an enormous blimp-like object, just hovering there.  It did not move while I was looking.  At the next stop light I noticed it had moved slightly forward but not much.   I could not see any windows or anything distinguishing about it, as it was very far from me at that point.  But I could see that it was gigantic in size, nothing like the blimps we see advertising things from time to time.  This thing would have fit five or six of such blimps into it.  Again I notice the huge thing move slightly backward.  I called Le Vallauris restaurant, as it seemed to be directly over the area where they are located.  But lunch service was on and the secretary in the office was out to lunch.  I drove as fast as I could trying to get to the end of the road to have a good look at it.  When suddenly it just disappeared.  Gone.  No sign of it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously these three occurrences are connected in that they all happened in the same location.  Yet they all appear to be totally different one from the other.  What can any of them have been?  Not one<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

MO near Glenstone and Grand on the very night of the Lunar Eclipse and Hale-Bopp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the very night of the Lunar Eclipse, while Hale-Bopp was still in the sky, we were cooking outside and watching the sky because the Eclipse was getting ready to take place. I had the urge to look up into the south sky (opposite direction from the comet) and saw what to the best of my recollection was either the front of a disc or a large batman type of wing floating overhead. I called loudly to my husband to come out and witness this, as I knew he would not believe me. He came out just in time to see the craft go over the house to the north. It was above the streetlight and it appeared to be round. While it was overhead, it was not visible, as though looking only at the sky. It could only be seen on the cusps of the craft. It flew off and curved right away to the northwest after passing over our home. I watched the news that night hoping others may have seen this, but there were no reports of it. My husband at the time was teaching at a local college. The next day he asked if anyone had seen anything odd the night before, whereupon one did tell that he and his girlfriend also saw something similar in the sky the prior evening, while watching for the eclipse. The thing that was confusing to me was that, in my mind, an object that appeared that size would fall out of the sky, were it flying so smoothly and at such a low speed. It seemed to be on cruise at a low speed. The only other solution to this speed is that it could have been much larger and much higher, appearing smaller and closer. However, we could see the streetlight in front of our house reflecting onto the back of the cusp or disc as it flew off. I have tried to do a search on the internet to see if others spotted this ufo during the Eclipse and Hale-Bopp, however, the only other thing I have found was references to Heaven&#39;s Gate. I/we were never in the slightest interested in cults. I have thought of this many times and hoped others had seen the ufo on that very night and also wondered if they, whoever they are, intentional! ly flew the craft that very night because they knew people would be watching the eclipse that night. Was it some kind of a test to see if people would report it?<n>
3/27/97 20:10|Carlisle|PA|Formation||This is an investigative report of this sighting report from your webpage.|6/18/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03881.html|13|ndxe199703| This is an investigative report of this sighting report from your webpage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Carlisle PA sighting of a formation of lights - 3/27/97 I have investigated several similar reports from the Carlisle area.  There  is a club of ultra-light plane pilots operating from a small airport nearby. They like to play UFO games, and also fly formations.  The fact that the lights reponded when the witnesses flashed a flashlight is a sure giveaway.  Also, this sighting was near twilight.  Ultralights pilots are not licensed.  They are not supposed to fly after dark, but have lights for twilight.  They use Visual Flight Rules and almost never fly flight plans because they return to the same field from which they took off.  They are too small and fly too slowly to appear on radar screens, if at a distance are noiseless (or if the wind blows the wrong way) and may seem to hover, particularly if flying into a headwind.  I have been told by a member of this club that &#34;If you want to see a real UFO, you should see us turn our spots on and fly IN A CIRCLE,&#34;  and he roared with laughter. How to identify possible ultralight formations: 1) the &#34;leader&#34; effect, wherein the lead plane (as with birds) moves around, but the others seem to be steady because they have someone to guide on. 2) unequal number of lights on each wing of a VEE (even number of lights or planes) 3) seen in twilight (although illegal after dark flights are sometimes made) 4) motor noises (but only if very close) 5) usually no motor noses, particularly if at a distance 5) slow or hovering 6) respond to lights or signals from the ground. Investigators should seek out local flying fields on a nice Saturday and make friends with pilots.  They are good sources of info, but be careful you don&#39;t give them any ideas. Conclusions: These sightingswere most likely ultralights. PS: I once spoke to an ultralight pilot who told me that in the ealry 1980s he belonged to a flying club which operated out of the airport at Stormville NY.  They even called themselves &#34;the Martians&#34;.  He said a pix of their formation once made the New York Times.  A 1984 investigative article in Discovery magazine concluded that they were small planes.  He said that the small plane pilots also also tried UFO hijinks, with spots and Christmas lights, etc., but he said the &#34;real Martains&#34; were the ultralights.  They stopped doing it after literally thousands of commuters were stopping on roads and they were afraid they would be heldl responsible for traffic accidents.  These were the stimuli for the &#34;&#34;Hudson Valley UFOs&#34;.  Of course, once people started looking up, they saw UFOs everywhere. There is an incredible amount of air traffic in the NY metro area. Delgado and Hynek&#39;s book &#34;Night Seige&#34; dismissed the Discovery explanation with only a couple paragraphs, yet included sightings with &#34;UFO motor noises&#34;, no radar contacts, &#34;hovering&#34; etc. This book can&#39;t be taken seriously because of its dismissal, withouht much discussion, of the Discovery investigation. My acquaintance related this story to me and then roared with laughter, &#34;Now everybody&#39;s doing it&#34;, he told me.<n>

They passed over Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio and took a 90 degree turn to the West, and vanished.  The objects were round, extremely illuminated, and although flying together,were not attached - they were &#34;zig zagging&#34; and not together, although generally in the same line of flight.  The objects were about 3 times the size of a star, not colored, and moving at an extremely high rate ofspeed.  They moved faster than any plane, or anything else I everobserved in the sky.  They were white in color, not blinking and slightly larger than an airplane would appear to be.Background of observer: 51 yr old American, married, professionaland business owner.  Observation was made while looking for aview of the comet.<n>
3/26/97 22:30|Winslow|AZ|Triangle|30-40 minutes|Triangle craft  positioned over Winslow, AZ for 30-40 minutes|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62947.html|19|ndxe199703| Triangle craft  positioned over Winslow, AZ for 30-40 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 21:50 on March 26, 1997, I left home with my mother to drop some items off to some friends at the Pilot travel center in the north part of Winslow (1/8 of a mile, perhaps, north of I-40), at the I-40 and North Park Drive interchange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t take long for us to drive from home, to the travel center, for me to run back and get back out to the car park. I think it was probably about 22:15 when we were leaving the travel center parking lot. As we were driving toward the traffic lights at the interchange, my mother had asked me what that streak across the sky was, and the object that was hovering high above the town. I had to squint hard to see it at that time, and at first dismissed it as Venus, as the twinkling colours looked the same. Then I realised that Venus was in the opposite (Eastern) part of the sky!  We drove down North Park Drive to Aspinwall Street, and had nearly a dozen blocks to go before we arrived home. As we drove west down Aspinwall Street, the object started to become larger. Two blocks from home, it was apparent that this craft was waiting for us at the end of the street (it&#39;s a dead-end). At the same time, on the same block, my aunt&#39;s boyfriend was outside their home throwing out the rubbish and spotted this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was shaped like a equilateral triangle, silver in colour. The strangest part was it looked only like an outline of a triangle. It moved up and down, side to side, in a very quick manner. Like a helicopter, but with a million times more precision and speed. Its maneuvers were amazing-- I had never seen anything like it. The craft was riddled with several lights along the &#39;outline&#39; of the triangle. They were mostly white, but would periodically change from white, to red and then to blue. As it moved, there was a sort of red and blue aura around it, and there were trails coming from these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother drove the car to the very end of West Aspinwall Street. That area of the street is a dead end, blocked by a large hill. On the north side at the end of W. Aspinwall street, there is rather large empty field. My mother drove to the empty field and turned off the car lights, as well as the engine. I had her roll down the window. The craft was probably 150-200 feet above us (rough estimation), a bit to the west (above the hill). It&#39;s hard to tell the size of the craft; I&#39;d say if I extended my arm all the way out, and made a fist, the sides of the craft would have been visible by about three inches or so. I&#39;m not keen when it comes to distance measurements, so I could be off on how far up the craft was in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no noise coming from the craft. My mother started the car again, and we started to drive through the field. This is where I got very alarmed-- if our car was moving, it would move with us. If my mother would stop the car, it would stop its movements. My mother was trying to convince me to run in the house and grab a video camera, and my 35mm camera. There was no way I was getting out of that car! I urged her to drive back to the busy travel center we had just left from, as I felt safer there, amongst many people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove back to the travel center and stayed in the car park and watched the craft hover, but slowly ascend until it was a small speck in the sky, then we saw it dart off to the west at an alarming rate of speed. After it dashed off, it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting, coincidentally, occurred on the same night as the Heaven&#39;s Gate suicide in the San Diego, Ca. area. We had arrived home around 23:00, just in time for Nightline (Ted Koppel). The feature story was on the mass suicide and the whole story involving the Hale Bopp comet. I honestly don&#39;t believe these two incidents were connected. They just happened to occur on the same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following evening, my mother and I went to my aunt&#39;s house (she lived two blocks east of us). Her boyfriend kept asking us if we had gone out the previous night, and definitely  beat around the bush regarding what he saw. He wouldn&#39;t come out and say it-- he wanted to know if we had seen anything. When we both confirmed that there was something in the sky, he showed me the drawings he made and description he wrote out. It was the same exact thing we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting, I was working for the local newspaper as an editorial assistant and photographer. I didn&#39;t report this to any local authorities, nor did I mention the incident to anyone I worked with, although the newspaper&#39;s editor did mention a rash of phone calls that came in to the local police department.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, one of the local police officers had come into my mother&#39;s hair salon for a haircut, and had mentioned to my aunt (his hairdresser; same aunt I previously mentioned, whose boyfriend saw the craft at the end of our street) that approximately two dozen reports had been made that night. It was then that she told the officer what her boyfriend saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I heard from friends that there were sightings of the same craft the following night, in the Camp Verde/Cottonwood/Clarkdale area of Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was pulsating about once/second, and was much brighter than any aircraft light I had everseen. After a minute or two, it gained altitude and flew off to the southeast. As soon as it stopped hovering, the light dimmed to a more normal level. As it flew off, I sawa blinking red light near the white one. Itwas too  dark to see anything of the craft itself.I initially thought it was a Helicopter with a searchlight, but it was absolutely silent.  We have helicopter overflights on occasion,both military and commercial, and, at thedistance I observed this object, they arequite easily heard. The neighborhood wasquiet, and I should have been able to heara helicopter. Also, if it was a searchlight,it was not pointed at the ground as one wouldhave expected with a helicopter.I am a 40 year old Electronics Engineer, and am a stable individual. We just moved intothis house in Owings Mills last summer. Itis a more rural area than our last house,and has frequent overflights by military cargo planes flying in a corridor thatusually extends from the southwest to thenortheast.<n>

The completely,silent object had absolutely no sound and was so low to the ground that I felt as though I could throw a rock at it. I won&#39;t forget seeing the orangeish red lights come on one at a time it was so scary they were giant I had two brothers and three family friends that saw it and were so scared they won&#39;t even talk about it. Oh and when I came outside they were screaming about something falling out of the back of it. I watched it and followed it as it went off into the distance. I lived in the middle of a densely populated city of Stockton I can&#39;t believe no one reported it to the media I was only seventeen at the time and was pretty shook up and scared they were coming back. Oh and Hail-Bop comet was visible in the sky at that time which was scary enough to look at. I will try and have one of the others come forth and tell their story about that night in 1997 they may have a better way of explaining what they saw. Thank you very much for this opportunity to tell my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was getting cold and it seemed like the eclipse wasn&#39;t really getting &#34;full&#34;, I was getting ready to head in and I noticed a very faint light, like a blur, kind of like when a search light goes across the sky.I looked back up and I seen 4 very soft or faint lights directly overhead and very high up.  I looked up with my binoculars to get a better look and I could see 4 lights, shaped like a triangle with 1 of the lights sort of trailing off the back right one, closer to it than the rest were to each other.  I watched them through thebinoculars for about 10 -15 seconds before they were out of sight.  The whole thing happened in about 20 - 25 seconds.  The lights were very faint sort of a hazy yellow color.  The sky at the time was crystal clear, about 10 minutes before the &#34;sighting&#34; the last of some clouds had passed by.  In comparison to any airplanes flying aroundtonight these lights were probably 3 or 4 times as high and 10 times faster.  I didn&#39;t hear any engines.  The whole thing is a bit of exciting also a bit of alarming, its the first time I&#39;ve ever seen something in the sky and couldn&#39;t figure out what it was.  It might have been military stuff but I don&#39;t think so, it was really very fast.I would just like to know what it was, I figure with all the people observing the eclipse tonight someone else should have seen it too.  If this service hears of someone else seeing it please e-mail me and let me know. Thanks.<n>

Othersthought they were UFOs. The other half of the group immediately began looking in the sky for the objects. Within 30 secondstwo of the craft return moving east to west at 15 feet above the groundand dance, move in and out away from each other, separate with sharp turns, one left, one right, and then in perfect formation, depart into the northwestsky at tremdous speed disappearing.. The caft also had two red identifying lights undeneath the wings. They were luminous, as if litonly by the moonlight.  They were completely quiet and fast.  The writter has seen Large orange balls of light which were believed to be UFOs in the past, but these ships/craft were dimensional-see-thru to a degree.  ONe witness who was standing awayfrom the group with the writter, thought she was seeing someone flying a kite-the kind used incompetetion-two handed.  She remarked to the writter that the kite had little red lightson it so the owner could see it.  She hadn&#39;t heard any word from the group and the writter turned his head just in time to see the craft to the left, turn to the side and then disappear.The writter mentioned to her that there wasn&#39;t any wind.   This was around 8:45pm in a small city park without lights nearby to disturb the evening events of the eclispe and comet.  The writter talkedto most of the group who described the event as it has been written here.  The witnesses were business owners, professional Spiritual Teachers, Artist, Musicians, and everyday people.There was no alchol or drugs at this event, and was a Ceremonial Gathering.<n>

Some of the group had traveled up to Nederland to join in the event.  We said prayers to the earth and the directions and the spirits. We blew flutes and drummed. The group was in different stages of the ceremony when two males standing apart from the group looked west to the comet and saw between 15 to 18 space craft flying in formation over the mountain tops towards the group. It took a few moments for the craft to move overhead and past us.  At that time two of the craft broke formation returning to do a low altitude flyby. At this point, those who hadn&#39;t seen the first fly over saw the second. The two flew in wing to wing -a few yards apart- and did a zig-zag dance. Which meant at the same moment each craft flew away from each other a few yards and then flew back together.  this was done before thye reached the group.  So that by the time they had flown over they had created a vapor trail and within 15 yards after passing the group they abruptly turned their noses up and flew straight up and away at tremendous speed.  The vapor trail following was easily seen and as the craft flew up nose to tail the vapor swirled like smoke following them.  .....now,as to my witnessing the event. I also was standing apart from the group with a woman friend and my back was to the group while she faced it.  The lunar eclispe was full and the country surrounding us was dark.  It&#39;s a very small town and there aren&#39;t many city lights.  Now as we talked we heard the group give up a great cry and whoop.  She said, &#39;look somebody&#39;s flying a kite.&#39;  I turned to my right and saw a craft that was about 12ft wide with wings and a center sphere for the flyer.  The two wings were bent in three places like elbows and wrists. From the sphere the wing dipped down a few degrees then one-third out bent again up, at a sharp angle to almost the length and about a foot short bent again with a down wing. The wings where shaped like a long skinny triangle with the end points showing lighted opake(sp)tips. The sphere was also partly lit. The sight of the craft did not throw me because as a clairvoyant I have seen space craft before.  But none of the others in the group had had my experience.  My thought at first when my friend told me about the kite was that it was a mistake. We dismissed the idea and said go night to each other and she left.  When I walked back over to the group some 20 yards away in the darkness I was approached by several in the group who were all smiles and laughing excitedly.  After they began telling me what just happened, I began asking questions to each one separatly.  They all said the same thing basically but the two males standing apart proved to be the most interesting in their witness.  Each one told me a different number of craft but it didn&#39;t matter to me. What was the most compelling to me was the description that I saw matched their&#39;s. Especially the lighted tips of the wings.  Well many of the group that kept in contact over the next week were blown away. At first it was really cool and something they had waited years to see.  But as the week went on the event began to shock them and really bother them in many respects. It&#39;s different to think you see a ship, most of these folks are new-agers and try to be open, but when the encounter is like this one, up-close with plenty of witnesses, it throws the thinking around. This was also around the time of the Arizona sightings.  Nederland is 18 miles west up the mountain from Boulder.  I did enter this information on a site but had no idea who to talk to. I had just heard of the Art Bell show and hadn&#39;t even tuned in to the program.  Well anyway I thought I would pass this along.  Small craft with a sphere for a center and oragami wings that bent for flight control.  The reason my friend thought she saw a kite was the lighted tipped wings and the swirling vapor trail that looked like the tail of a kite.  My witnessing came from my psychic sensing of a foriegn object in the area.  The picture I received was a left-over image of the craft.  This is hard to explain but the craft had departed before I had even turned to see what my friend was talking about.  My view was the craft eight feet off the ground at level flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain of the date, but the solstice occurs on 21MR.  The comet was most dramatic on Sunday, 23MR97, so we have arbitrarily assigned a date.  It may be incorrect.))<n>

Its speed was at least 500 Knots and it seemed to be accelerating as it passed directly overhead. It was  at about 2500 feet AGL and climbing. Its heading was 170 degrees.  It appeared to be at least 400 feet wide and 700 feet long. Its size and speed were difficult to judge because it was totally silent and it traveled from the Northern to Southern horizon so quickly. It had a faint purple glow along its leading and trailing edges, and had a series of luminous red-pink box like sections along the belly at the front. I&#39;ve been trying to convince myself for the past five months that it was some top secret aerospace plane prototype.  I have never seen anything like it, and I am fairly familiar with aircraft.  I have no interest in defending the credibility of my experience, I saw it and it was weird, period.<n>

I saw the object in the nothern sky, while I was star gazing.I took some pictures and am waiting for them to develop.At approx. 22:45, I had gone outside to chart its locationand take some pictures. After this I took my flashlight outand started flashing at the object seeing if I could get its attention. I started to move closer in my direction, not knowingw hy, I went into my house.  I then watched the object from my bedroom window.<n>

Then out of nowhere, two circular lights formed a perfect isocoles triangle with the North Star and just froze there and held that beautiful formation. Then suddenly they began to dance around eachother with amazing speed and eventually they zoomed off into deep space so fast it was incredible. Then they came back and danced again and then zoomed off into space and were gone. We were stunned. We stopped a jogger to ask him if he saw what we saw and what he thought it was. He said it had to be a UFO of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For some reason, I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. After about 45 minutes, I saw that it was in the same position, and had not moved. I looked at it with my 11x80 binoculars (on a tripod) and it started to move (at about 1&#34;/second) steadily parallel to the horizon (eastward). I do not know the exact date, but it was sometime in March and I told a friend about it the next day. A few weeks later, several very bright orange lights were seen to the south all over Eastern Ontario. My friend saw them (I did not) and said that they were bright enough to cast a shadow - his wife and several neighbours watched them for a few minutes. The Ottawa Citizen newspaper had an article about them (with photos) a couple of days later and claimed that they were flares being tested as Fort Drum, USA (about 70 miles due south of this sighting). When my friend&#39;s wife phoned Fort Drum, she was told that the Canadian Government was testing flares near Prescott!! (approx. 20 miles south of the sighting). On Aug 6, ~2300 hrs, the sky was overcast but there was a clear band over the northern horizon. I saw the &#39;same&#39; object in the approximately the same position and went into the house to get my binoculars. When I came out, about a minute later, it was gone.<n>

IF I AM NOT TELLING THE TRUTH THAT GOD STRIKE ME DOWN DEAD WHERE I STAND THE TRUE GOD!! TODAY NOW!! The TRIANGLE was MADE of BERYILLIUM. I ((name deleted)) machined it at LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABS. It came in on a overhead crane as a 2000 pound plus plate of UNCUT BERYLLIUM. The scientist wanted it cut into a triangle, since I was the ONLY ONE QUALIFIED to CUT this TOXIC METAL, I WAS THE ONE WHO CUT IT.. After I was Done I called the SCIENTIST in question. He arrived in the MACHINING ROOM at the TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED MACHINING FACILITY and he didnt even want help. The TRIANGLE I had machined to EXTREME TOLERANCES that should HAVE STILL BEEN UNMOVABLE without a CRANE or OTHER MACHINERY, now was WEIGHTLESS. THE SCIENTIST pulled on it and pushed it, IT WAS LIKE A HELIUM FILLED BALLOON filled with just enough helium that if you leave it, it wont float away, it stays in PLACE, HOVERING IN THE AIR!! He took it with him this LARGE PLATE with NO HELP OF ANY KIND. The scientist KNEW IT WOULD FLOAT obviously by what ((name deleted)) SAID, so there MUST BE MANY MORE OF THEM!! THEY ARE TRIANGLES made of BERYLLIUM METAL, AND HE BECAUSE HE WAS HELD BY CONTRACT NOT TO RELEASE SIZE OR ANY OTHER DATA HE DIED WITH THE DIMENSIONS IN HIS HEAD!! He only said &#34;A COUPLE OF THOUSAND POUNDS OF BERYLLIUM IT WEIGHED WHEN THEY BROUGHT THE PLATE IN ON THE OVERHEAD CRANE. I WAS THE ONLY ONE QUALIFIED TO CUT THAT METAL!! When I was DONE IT FLOATED&#34; SO I put this for NOW DECEASED ((name deleted)) ON THE NET I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.  I am not ((name deleted)) but that IS WHAT HE told ME so I AM JUST LETTING YOU KNOW SINCE -------YOU NEED TO KNOW!!!------- He died a FEW DAYS LATER.  IF I AM LYING MAY GOD STRIKE ME DOWN DEAD NOW SO YOU KNOW I AM NOT LYING AS TOWARDS WHAT HE TOLD ME.....  I TRIED MANY TIMES TO GET THE DIMENSIONS, HE ALLWAYS STONEWALLED ME WITH  &#34;I SIGNED DOCUMENTS that DISSALLOW ME TO DO THAT, JUST ACCEPT I TOLD YOU THIS and I TOLD YOU WAY TOO MUCH ALLREADY!&#34; Shortly later he Died, and I have been FOLLOWED by MYSTERIOUS VANS with ANTANNAE govt plates and other MYSTERIOUS VEHICLES with ELECTRONICS IN THEM GALORE!!!

Strange orange balls in a triangle pattern, in march of 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t realize it at the time of course, but this sighting was on the same night as the famous Phoenix lights in 1997.  I heard the mention of them on Coast to Coast AM on Saturday and it got me re-excited.  I live aprox 30 miles west of Tucson Az, between Tucson and the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range.  I do not live close enough to the range to ever see flares or ordinance dropped, however.  Between 19:30 and 21:00 I was driving a friend of mine home on my ATV, when he spotted 9 orange balls in the sky in a triangle pattern.  When my friend hit me on the shoulder and made me look six of them had gone out and I only saw 3 orange balls in a triangle pattern.  They way they went out was strange.  It seemed like they turned, or maybe like a larger black circle had covered them, almost like an eclipse over them. I stared at them for aprox. 5 seconds and then 2 of them went out at the same time, then the last one about 1 second later.  The Impression I got was that they were about 10 miles away, and very large.  When I returned home, 2 of my neighbors called me over and told me they had seen weird lights in the sky out towards Kitt Peak (which is a observatory in the same direction I saw my lights).  Because they were towards the Barry Goldwater Range, I dismissed them as flares, even though they appeared to be well outside the boundaries of the range. &#34;What else could they be?&#34; I thought.  A few weeks later I heard about the Phoenix lights from my neighbor who also saw my lights, and told me she wondered if the ones we had seen and the Phoenix lights were related.  Since this sighting, I spent 4 years in the Marine Corps, and became familiar with aerial and ground fired flares and I have never seen anything that looked like this.  When I heard On Coast to Coast AM that there were sightings west of Tucson on that night as well, I wanted to report mine, even though it is late.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

March 1997<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been silent about this encounter because I was afriad of what people might think.  But I have seen a bunch of TV information and programs speaking of this incident (UFOs over Phoenix) and I must tell what I saw so it may help people and investigators plot its coarse.  At around 8:30 (can&#39;t remember exactely what time) a saw bright blue-white lights pass directly over my house.  It completely lit up my entire back yard and the green field behind my house.  To see my backyard I was looking North out of my house.  The lights traveled right to left or east to west.  My wife was also present.  She was looking slightly away or to the side when the lights flew by.  When they did fly by it of coarse lit up the entire backyard and the living room which we were in at the time.  I also yelled out loud when it occurred so she did turn around and see them after I did.  We ran outside about 15 - 20 secs later because I was a little cautious, only to see nothing - not a trace of what it was.  About 30 minutes later there was a special news report on the TV about &#34;lights over Phoenix&#34; then I knew what I say was true.  If you feel you need more info or need to contact me please do so.<n>

I noticed its approach and then realized that it had a unusual, triangular-shaped aircraft flying close and to the left of its tail.  This craft? was about 1/4 the size of the UAL plane, triangular-shaped, flat, light grey color. Why?<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Feb. 17, I was returned from Chicago on a United Airlines flight to Ontario, CA at about 10AM in the morning. We were flying at about 32,000 feet and the weather conditions were very clear.  Approaching us from the south going north and a bit easterly, I noticed another aircraft flying beneath us.  I am no expert, but I could identify the aircraft as a UAL aircraft. What originally got my attention was that it didn&#39;t seem too far beneath our flight and it seemed so clear because of the lack of clouds, dust, etc.  Then, I noticed that something (another craft?) was tagging along with it, rather close and off the left side of the UAL&#39;s tail.  When I looked closer, I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was or why it was following so closely.  I am not sure of the model of the UAL aircraft, but the &#34;unknown&#34; flying with it was about a quarter of the UAL&#39;s size, triangular shaped, point forward (but the forward point was slightly rounded toward the tip).  Its color was a flat, light g!rey - not shiny as a usual, unpainted aircraft would be.  It was as though the two crafts were flying in formation - that close.I keep them plain in sight until they had passed completely beneath our flight.There is probably a logical explanation for this, but it seemed very strange to me and when I review the sight in my mind, it still seems strange.   Others on the plane may have noted it, but no one else mentioned it.  I was sitting in a row next to a window, just forward of the leading edge of the aircraft, by myself.  My husband picked me up at the airport in Ontario and I mentioned it to him right away.  He guessed maybe it was some kind of target or balloon, but it did have some depth to it, yet nothing on top that I could see which might be like a raised cockpit area, nor did it have any tail(s) or projections, nor any indentation on the back edge like I have seen on some experimental aircraft.  Strange color, too, not too noticeable in the distance and if it had not been so clear, it might have disappeared into the desert sands and dust.  If there is an obvious answer to this one, I would appreciate some feed back.  Thanks<n>

Appx 9 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed 2-4 very faint fuzzy lights coming from VERY VERY (NW) general area of Hale Bopp/Cascade Head area.

One man said &#34;Oh My God they know we are watching because of comet and eclipse.  They want us to see them&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Getting larger... no - getting closer, high in sky.

Now hovering directly above enough to see triangle formation of 3 seperate crafts. Hover above for 1-2 minutes, we felt they were almost trying to communicate w/us through lights. NO SOUND or &#34;WIND&#34; AT ALL. Suddenly, still blinking, crafts split into 2 groups, one SPED OFF SO FAST (no sound) toward NE others to NW (VERY GENERAL DIRECTION). In a second or 2 they were gone as we watched them, not faded as in fireworks but gone as in car lights. Travel at unheard of speeds. TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE! All crying, one went back in room and wouldn&#39;t talk. (Day later says he&#39;d been in military all life and this was not military, and that he was scared.) I Called police about 10 minutes after 9 pm, who gave me # to UFO in Seattle, and I called as PD advised even tho they vehemently said it was a flare(s) and that they do not recognize/acknowledgethe presence of UFO&#39;s. We were also attempted contact by Coast Guard and Air Force, but had new ph. # and I gave them old one, which I found out when I called back to see if any other reports came in. At appx 9:30 PD called me and said flares were now being shot off Cascade Head (so I guess my question was answered!) After so many years I have only told this to family and a couple friends as it is so outrageous.

I lived at that time in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  The Calgary airport is in a north easterly direction about 10 miles away.  It is not unusual to see airplanes’ coming into land in this area of the city, what is unusual is that the object was only 200 feet above my head, whisper quiet, and had no landing gear extended beneath it.  Also, the speed it was travelling, about 30 mph, would have stalled the engines had this been a jet aircraft.  Most aircraft when landing power up the engines to prevent a stall from happening and the engine sounds are very distinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, I noticed only two white lights on and pointing straight down.  One light was located at the front of the triangle, the other on the right end.  The lights reminded me of car head lights; the same color white but only larger and much farther apart.  I estimate the length on each side to be greater than 30 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I believed the object sighted wasn’t an aircraft.  I scanned a channel on TV recording landings and departures of aircraft at the airport.  The Calgary airport I believe has restricted landing and departure times between midnight and 5am. There was no scheduled arrivals’ showing on screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a regular listener to Coast2Coast and very soon after I learned of a similar object that was seen in Phoenix on March 13, 1997.  I eventually pulled up a photo on the internet of what is now known as the &#34;Phoenix Lights.&#34;  The photo showed a triangular object with a white light in each corner, but was much higher in the sky.  Phoenix is almost due south of Calgary about 1500 miles.<n>

In the midst of these lights a small line of 6-8 bluish-white smaller lights suddenly appeared; the lights flashed in sequence from left to right 3 times, then suddenly moved very quickly off to the West and disappeared.  Approximately 30-45 seconds later, the bluish-white lights reappeared in approximately the same position as the first time and repeated the flashing and movement; then reappeared just to the west of te original location repeated this once more.  About 30 seconds after the last repeat, the orange lights simply disappeared.  The orange lights appeared very similar to the sightings on Sept. 13 in the area around Phoenix, but we have heard no one mention the bluish-white lights which we s! aw.<n>

We wathed for about 15-20 minutes, all trying to figure out what it was.  Could not hear any sound at all, even after the big red flashes.Then, saw another big red flash on the horizon, not in the sky.  Then, they went out all about the same time.  Two of us remained to see if the lights would come back.  They did.  But this time all shifted to the left.  Again in a straingt line and again the big red flashes on the ground.  They stayed for about 15 minutes, with one to the left noticiably moving, the others not moving, then went out again at the same time.  We left for home shortly thereafter.  ((Name deleted))<n>

It was very quiet.  Then when I went outside and looked up into the sky I saw rows of much smaller white lights mixed with a few red lights near the middle.  These lights were all moving slowly together as though they were on the bottom of a very large moving object. The shape was elongated but it appeared to have wings on each side in the middle. The lights covered this base and wing surface area. I felt that I was looking up underneath the object.  It slowly and quietly moved in a straight line right above the trees across my backyard and my neighbors backyard.  It moved at the same speed until it disappeared.  I listenend for a helipcopter or plane noise but only noticed a low level hum as it disappeared in the distance. Then I heard a swhoosh noise.  The object was massive and it seemed as though it was deliberately scanning the area. Later I saw the two lights again bu!t this time they darted away.<n>

They slowly moved out over the lake, were joined by 2 more from behind hill. Rose and moved rapidly over hill out of lake valley. As we drove out of the valley driving to town, observed objects moving toward town. More objects were observed rising from trees a few hundred yards away, one split into two, all moved away to the northwest at an extreme rate of accelleration and disappeared. As we drove we observed more objects. The other observer was career army, said he had never seen anything like the objects (had been stationed at Ft. Hood). A Major at the base could offer no explanation the next day. Objects rose, hovered, made right angle turns, and made no sound. The area around the lake was being used for military maneuvers, as it was for the six months I worked there, and nothing of this type was observed at any other time. Closest observation of these objects was about 200 yds. Estimated size at 18&#34; dia. Helicopters were in the area, but seemed to not notice them.<n>

I entered the Marine Corp in 1997, and that is the year the event took place.  I heard about this on Coast to Coast, and they said to report any event no matter how much time has elapsed.  I was in boot camp at MCRD San Diego, and during my thirteen weeks there, there are several times that we were taken to Camp Pendleton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular occasion we made our way there, and had to hump (hike) a mountain by the name of Old Smokey.  Old Smokey is a mountain on Camp Pendleton that was particularly high and steep.  Three quarters of the way up you have to basically crawl up the mountain it is so steep.  I remember actually passing through the clouds on the way up the mountain it is so high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 21:00 hours my company was getting ready to go to bed when a huge craft appeared right above us.

If visitors to this site have any questions I&#39;ll be glad to answer if I can. If anyone has any further information or explanation on them I&#39;d appreciate a reply. I&#39;ve copied these experiences from a past journal.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went for a drive one evening, down south on highway 71 and about 6 or 7 pm when I was returning, happened to glance off to my right, in the sky and noticed two light-blue colored lights, side by side, heading angle-wise toward the road (&#39;8 oclock&#39;). The distance between the lights, perspective-wise, was less than an inch apart, and didn&#39;t blink or flash. Also, what struck my attention had been the color...almost a neon blue. I kept an eye on the because I knew they&#39;d soon pass across the road; however, when they got closer and I could see better what they were attached to, they began to arc south (back toward &#39;6 oclock&#39;). These were particularly curious because I&#39;ve never seen that color blue before ~ this neon or flourescent blue is as close as I can describe it. I pulled onto the shoulder and stopped, got out and watched. THIS event scared me damn near as bad as the moon-looking orb. The object or craft was a thin rectangle, and the lights were inside either end. It looked like a big 2x4 on its widest side, and perspective-wise, about 3 feet in length if at arm&#39;s length.  The lights were inside the narrow-most side, like the eyes of a hammerhead shark, only in front, not the side. ___________________________ <n>_*_____________________*__<n> Initially I assumed it was a plane but it made no sound at all...literally soundless, and as it went by, there hadn&#39;t been any more to it ~ just a simple, black (or possibly dark gray, steel color) rectangle. If it would have been a plane (and this was a low as a low flying plane could fly without dropping out of the sky, and about twice as wide as the wing span of a little charter plane), I could have seen the rivits and seams and bolts, etc. This was solid and looked seamless. It cruised at plane speed. My rationale tried to convince me this was likely some new machine  that they&#39;re testing out...maybe a remote operated spy plane or something...military jets do a lot of low flying out there in that part of the city (outskirts of Bossier City)...but reality said it was doubtful...this IS Barksdale. I watched it head south at a languid speed until it was no longer visible, and gathered myself, and went home. Later, I mentioned this event to my mother, who related a similar account she&#39;d had with the same sort of object being chased by two military jets, and it shot off out of sight. I also asked an Air Force buddy of mine if they were testing something out there and he said they weren&#39;t, it wasn&#39;t ours, and several pilots on base were all wired over it because no one knew what it was or where it came from.  I found this a little hard to choke down tho, because I would think that it would&#39;ve been shot out of the sky had it breezed in over an air base. He also said, tho, that we have nothing at Barksdale that could fly that low without making deafening noise, much less crashing. I would appreciate any details on this from anyone military with suggestions!! *** I have posted the other events here also. Look for: 1. MOSES LAKE  WASHINGTON  MARCH 23, 1995 2. SPOKANE/FORD INDIAN RESERVATION   WASHINGTON  APRIL 1995 3. LAKE SULLIVAN - PEND ORIELLE MOTEL   APRIL 1995 4. PLAIN DEALING LOUISIANA  JANUARY 1996 5. OIL CITY  LOUISIANA  JANUARY 1996 6. OIL CITY  LOUISIANA  APRIL 1996 8. PAGE-LAKE POWELL  ARIZONA  AUGUST 1997 There have also been a series of bizarre &#34;injection dreams&#34; that preceded these events, but also happened after them. Since this isn&#39;t a forum for that, I can supply details for anyone interested, or who might have a reasonable explanation; I also feel these might be connected.<n>

There were no red beams or any other light which regular aircraft use. it was a plain circle light. It stop there for four or more minutes. I know other planes saw it because I could see the other airplanes pass in their normal path. This one was as bright as the light of a full moon. I have never seen that light here on earth. Then a beam of light came out from this light ... a conifer light like a triangular cone. it was aiming at a cloud. It turn 360 degrees and its beam intensify. It was looking for something. Then it turn off its beam and the light was so strong the cloud look like a neon toy when you turn the lights off. (glow in the dark)  it stayed there 30 seconds or so. It moved closer to us, then it move really fast like a shooting star to another place but it was still the same size. it hover a little (stayed put) Then it blasted into space and shrink right before our eyes and I lost it when I finally blinked my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That my friends was the spacecraft (light) i saw.

I pulled open the curtain and through the blinds saw that the sun was barely rising. I thought to myself I have only been asleep for about 5 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am so unbelievably thirsty but if I get up and go get a drink I wont be able to go back to sleep.  I am going to feel like crap if I can’t get a few more hours but my mouth was so dry when I tried to swallow I hadn’t any saliva and gagged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With The adrenaline rush and the thirst I rolled off my high pedestal waterbed and when I tried to stand my knees buckled. I became extremely weak I felt like I had hiked a mountain lifted weights and been beaten and in a car accident all at the same time.  My whole body was sore. My muscles were aching legs weak head felt so heavy I actually felt drugged. Sort of how you would feel after having outpatient surgery where you get anesthesia and an hour later you are woken up and ready to go home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled myself together and walked to the kitchen.  I never drink tap water but this time I grabbed a kid’s cup and went to the sink.  As it was filling I looked out the window that was over the sink and saw my 6month old kitten sitting on the hood of the neighbors car across the yard looking at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember gasping and almost choking because I hadn’t drank yet when I saw her.  I thought damn there must be a hole under one of the cabinets to the outside or something.  She was an indoor cat and never had been outside and she was in bed with me when I fell asleep that prior evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly drank the water and went to the door which was locked (both locks) unlocked it opened it. I gasped again because the scrunchie hair-tie that I ALWAYS wore in my long hair to bed so my hair stays out of my face was on the front porch step.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out grabbed the cat and went back to my bedroom feeling very bewildered and confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thoughts immediately went back to my dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband got out of bed and got dressed and left for work he was going in earlier than usual since we were awake 3 hours early. I didn’t tell him anything other than I had a bad dream. I didn’t want to sound crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as he was gone I called my mom in Illinois to tell her about the dream and how real it seemed when it comes to paranormal and metaphysical things she is very open-minded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her how I woke-up found the cat the hair tie etc. and I expected her to say something like oh honey you just had a bad dream or maybe I was sleepwalking (which I have never done).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what she told me instead of something comforting and reassuring was a story that thoroughly freaks me out and yet sounds so familiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to my mother Sharon lee mowatt-hardwick in the summer/fall 1975 my grandparents ken and Ethel mowatt were on their way to las Vegas to go gamble like they did every so often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere between the Arizona border and Vegas my grandfather saw a very bright light that seemed to be following them.  He was positive it wasn’t Venus as they were in the mountains and the horizon where Venus rises and sets wasn’t visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light followed for so long that he decided to pull the car off the road to see if it was a helicopter would pass over them and my grandmother had wanted her sweater, which was in the trunk of the car Granddaddy told my mom when he got out of the car he saw the light getting really close and really bright but he was puzzled as there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from what he assumed to be a helicopter. As the light was right over them another thing he noticed was the lack of the blinking lights that every plane helicopter aircraft are required to have just the one steady white round bright spotlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing my grandfather says he recalls is the fact that when he blinked his eyes it was suddenly daylight my grandma who had been inside the car was standing right next to him wearing the sweater he had never gotten out of the trunk inside out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked at each other dumbfounded got into the car and proceeded to Vegas When they arrived at the motel the desk clerk immediately informed them that they were almost 6 hours late for check-in and our family and the Highway Patrol had been looking for them fearing an accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next month they both started having dreams and flashbacks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Granddaddies were of seeing Mum on an exam table surrounded by 4 grays and they were doing something to her breast. He attempted to sit up from a laying position and a grey placed his 4-fingered hand flat on granddaddy’s chest and that’s it. Mum just had dreams of being examined by children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Granddaddy died on Christmas Eve 1984 of lung and esophageal cancer when the chest x-rays were given to my grandma the clouded mass of cancer in his chest was in the exact shape of a small hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mum passed in ’92 of breast cancer and she had a mastectomy done prior to her death where a small long thin piece of metal was removed from her breast tissue and analyzed. The lab could not identify what is was or was made of they gave it to my mom in a small glass vial and my mom doesn’t remember what happened to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently moved to the country and I feel like I’m losing my sanity and I also found a lump in my forearm no scar went to dr. and they said to leave it alone?? My issue is the grey touched Mums breast and granddaddy’s chest and I specifically recall a grey touching my forehead with one long skinny finger to put me back under?<n>

It lit up the whole sky, the ground and my truck.  It traveled from the ground to the clouds and split up into several parts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in March in the early morning my friend and I were traveling east on &#34;D&#34; avenue and somewhere around the cross street of N. Westnedge a bright red flash illuminated the whole sky, the ground, everything in the truck, it was like a flash of bright lightning.  The flash was so bright it lit everything as bright as day in red. It originated from the forest to our right, my view of the actual object was blocked by the truck but my friend said he saw something like a beam of light shoot from the ground into the low clouds as it traveled up it seemed to split up into different parts and travel through the clouds.  There were some low clouds around the area that were kind of thick but the whole sky was not covered, there were many parts of the sky that were clear, no thunderstorms or anything.  Though this left us in awe we did not report it to the police.  I just saw the report address in the Battle Creek Enquirer (local newspaper,) so I decided to report it.<n>

I looked outside the window for no reason cause thats what i do almost everyday cause i dont go out that much. I was lookin outside and then all of a sudden i see something out of nowhere fly down above the highway around 2-3 stories high hovering for 6 seconds moving and then dissapeared. It was like a frisbee with an oval cylinder cockpit on top of it with an orange light and it moved 360 degrees. i got scared and looked away and only got to see it for 3-4 sec.I will never forget it. People think i am crazy but i am willing on taking a truth test to prove it and i can even draw the exact thing is saw.It also had a small black window/mirror around it. I can&#39;t believe it flew so low above the highway.<n>
3/14/97 22:30|Colorado Springs|CO|Triangle|10 seconds|Triangular light formation in Colorado.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68961.html|66|ndxe199703| Triangular light formation in Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently watched a documentary (UFOs Seeing is Believing) hosted by Peter Jennings on the National Geographic Channel, which prompted me to report after all this time, something I saw when living in Colorado Springs over 10 years ago. The particular discussion on the type of objects seen in and around Phoenix, AZ at roughly the same time made me think there was something more to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After returning home from a friend’s house on the evening of the 13th or 14th of March, 1997 at approximately 10:30pm (I remember it was around this time as I had returned from a vacation shortly before, but can’t remember if it was a Thursday or Friday), I went out on my back deck to look at the Hale-Bopp comet which was clearly visible with my small binoculars in the North-Western sky.  At that time I was and still am a Financial Analyst, but have always loved backyard astronomy since I was in Jr. High School and had an issue of Sky &amp; Telescope which told me where to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking at the comet for several minutes with the binoculars, I saw a distinct flash of light, which caused me to lower them and look to see what had cause it.  For about 10 seconds or so, I saw 5 lights in what seemed to be a triangular formation move quickly from South to North from my perspective.  It moved very fast to the North until it was out of sight, but it was visible long enough to see that the triangular &#34;V&#34; formation was kept throughout.  There was no noise or contrail(s) visible (I expected to hear jet noises thinking it was a formation of fighter planes, but there was none). Unfortunately, it moved too fast for me to determine if it was a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This obviously was quite exciting and unusual.  After spending a few more minutes trying in vain to see the object(s) again, I thought this was peculiar enough to report to someone. I looked in the phonebook for someone to call and eventually spoke briefly to a person (whose name I cannot remember) at the local MUFON contact number and gave him the description of what I had seen.  As it was quite late, I agreed to call back the next day to go over the sighting in more detail, but I did not call again.  After thinking it over and keeping in mind that the simplest explanation is most often the right one, I determined that it had to be a formation of fighter planes or maybe a stealth fighter which sort of has that shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this documentary and subsequently researching the so-called Phoenix Lights on-line, what I saw and especially the time I saw it is a little too coincidental. I have never seen anything like that before or since, but due to the similarities with what was seen in Arizona, I thought it was time to report what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There were no lights and there was no sound coming from the object.  We noted that everything around us (city noise, etc) was absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hovering/gliding over us about 30-40 feet up (we almost felt we could jump up and touch it), and the outline could be easily made out against the stars in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the Runyon Canyon area, and was moving south, at less than a snail&#39;s pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it passed by the pool and cleared the edge of the building, it seem to just blur/distort into the city sky.   We all jumped out of the pool to try to see where it was going, but we could not located it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  this happened a LONG time ago, and the dimensions are purely best guesses.  I recall the circumstances and experience vividly, but the size thing is really difficult to say.  It didn&#39;t really seem very big.  Nobody had been drinking alcohol or taking drugs, and we were not disoriented by being in a heated pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

That decision led to the most thought provoking and unexplainable incident ive ever encountered in the night sky.  I-10 just west of Tonapah AZI noticed an unusually bright, white light directly ahead.  I wondered what it was. It was brighter than the stars, and too high for a tower light, no skyscrapers in this area, mentally I eliminated what it wasn&#39;t.  Ithought I was moving towards the object, but in fact it was moving towards me.  Maybe it was the Hale-Boppcomet, but no traveling light.  I thought I would soon discover the origin of the slowly growing white light.I had been watching the object for a good 10 minutes.  Im not sure whether I blinked and missed something orthe object just moved up very fast.  I could see that the bright white light was a cluster of 3 lights.  Itmoved to the far left as if circling and moved out in front but below the cluster object.  I assumed thiswas something examining the larger object, possibly an USAF jet.  My mind curiously questioned,if the smallerobject is a jet what in the world could the big thing be?  The smaller craft (size of a tack)  stayed out frontfor a while.  Then it moved around to the right.  I assumed it was making a full circle check of the light clusterwhich appeared to be the size of three lined up golf balls, intensly bright lights.  The smaller craft was a fewinches in the night sky, to the right and due south of the cluster when the lights turned off.  I watched the smallcraft make a wide ark turn to the right.  It headed south towards Mexico,towards Barry Goldwater USAF base. I checkedmy watch 8:25pm I watched for a good 20 minutes.  Not until the lights abruptly shut off had I allowed myself to thinkof this as a UFO mystery. Where was the noise?  Then the reality hit me, I had seen the stealth bomber a dozen timesand its baby bird next to this<n>

My wife also saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, it was far south and within matter of no time it moved towards our direction up in the sky towards the north. As it came in line above us it veered 90 degrees and went towards the eastern direction and disappeared. It was very fast without any noise. Other than the bright silver light there was no trail of light or fume following it. The distance that it covered in less than a minute was huge and was much faster than any aeroplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported the matter to the officials at the observatory here, but they were unable to give any authentic answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Even initially, it was an exciting event.  This was a huge object.  Following a precise course and maintaining an exact altitude, this craft intercepted Scottsdale Road, made good a southerly heading until approximately Indian School road, turned over Sky Harbor Airport and eventually disappeared in the vicinity of &#34;South Mountain.&#34;  As the craft approached, we began to eliminate what it wasn&#39;t.  Not airplanes, helicopters, blimps etc.  It&#39;s speed was estimated at 40--50 mph.  It was titally silent.  It featured large amber lights on the leading edge with some smaller lights underneath, some on the side (left from our vantage point) and some visible aft.   As it passed 90 degrees and aprx 1 1/2 mile, we thought we could see substance to it, i.e, blocking out lights behind it  but transparent at the same time.  I estimated it&#39;s altitude to be 10,000 feet at the iniitial contact, roughly the same altitude as inbound air traffic bound for PHX... as it passed, the lower portion of the craft was an estimated 200 feet from the ground.  Note: There was nothing to compare this machine to, so size, etc. could be quite different.  I am a retired airline pilot, have flown for 40+ years, have flown everything from the J-3 Cub to the 747.  I retired as a 727 Captain for one of the big 4. I have never seen anything like this - not even close.  The assertion that this craft was flares is a pathetic attempt at coverinvg up the truth.  I have no idea what it was, but definitely know what it was not.  Flares do not maintain altitude, nor navigate a precise course.  The sighting/s are well known at this point, and have been the subject of many TV documentaries, etc.  Yet, no word is forthcoming.  The paripherial events surrounding the sightings are nothing less than erie.  Unfortunately, this and other events are falling into obscurity because we as a society! are all owing that to happen.  I am happy to discss this with anyone.  Be advised I am NOT seeking any publicity, etc.  Since reporting this sighting, long time friends look at me with a jaundiced eye, strangers who hear the story often think I&#39;m crazy, etc.  On this the 5th anniversary of the Phoenix Lights the image is fresh in my mind.  This did happen.  Had the comet not been in the skies that evening, I doubt we would have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This report is submitted by a retired airline captain, who had accumulated 13,700 hours of flight time at the time of his sighting, and who is well known to NUFORC.   He is well known in the Phoenix area, and he has been one of the more visible, and vocal, witnesses with regard to the dramatic &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; sighting of 13MR97.  PD))<n>

As we were traveling west on Interstate 8, approximately 1 hour from Yuma, AZ, we saw some weird hovering lights (approximately 9:30pm local time) in the southern sky that looked like they were 2-5 miles away.  The lights were white and in some sort of circle formation and didn’t seem to move as they were in our sight while driving for about 10 minutes. The lights were about 1-2 miles off of the ground.  We jokingly said that they may be UFOs, but dismissed it as some military exercise, but we didn’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought about this for a long time and not until last week did I start to put it all together.  I was watching a program on Discovery or one of those channels last week on the &#34;Phoenix UFOs in March 1997.&#34;  After some more research, I found out that the incident happened on March 13, 1997.  I wondered if that happened to be the night in which we drove to San Diego.  I remembered that our trip happened on the first night of the 1997 NCAA Basketball because we were so surprised that we were able to watch the late games when we arrived in San Diego because of the 1 hour time change from Arizona to California.  I looked on the internet, and sure enough, the first night of the Men’s 1997 NCAA Basketball tournament was March 13th.  I am still not sure what it is that we saw.<n>

I was living in an apartment in Phoenix Arizona at the time and had some friends over that night.  We all went outside and I noticed several lights in the sky over Phoenix.  Soon my friends and I were all staring at these lights in the sky.  There was no noise at all coming from these lights.  They were yellowish-orange in color.  As I focused my eyes on the lights I could make out the shapes of actual solid craft in the sky.  It wasn’t one large craft, it was several craft which made a large triangle shape, then a large oval shape!  My friends also could see the shape of these craft in the sky.  These craft would move up and down, and left to right but didn’t move all that much.  They didn’t shoot across the sky or anything like that.  But I could see the shape of these craft in the sky.  This lasted for about 30 minutes and the lights turned off and the craft disappeared.  I have spent 8 years in the Army and I know what flares look like and how they act.  These were not flares.  I can say this with confidence.  The U.S. Government stone walled the people of Phoenix.  Thousands of people had to have witnessed this event that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))<n>

We lived in North Tucson and my friend&#39;s house was in a pretty undeveloped area, so it was very dark out.  I was riding in the front passenger seat when I looked out the window and saw bizarre lights in the sky, toward the north.  I pointed this out to my friends and we pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road to watch.  It was a formation of 4 bright white lights, they were in a crescent shape and they didn&#39;t blink or move.  We had no clue what we were seeing; as we got out of the vehicle to look further, the formation suddenly changed shape in one very fluid motion to where the lights were in a very large triangular shape, the fourth of the lights down next to the bottom right corner of the triangle.  The lights were still white, we didn&#39;t hear any sounds and they didn&#39;t blink.  After a few moments the formation shape changed once again, the lights moved into a straight line and CHANGED COLOR from white to red.  They then started moving in a line very quickly in a south-west direction (I think), before suddenly all disappearing at once.

3/13/97 22:00|Glendale|AZ|Fireball|2 hours|Fireball on the top of  mountain behind Luke Air Force Base, AZ.|5/29/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81234.html|79|ndxe199703| Fireball on the top of  mountain behind Luke Air Force Base, AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 10pm and my husband ran through the front door almost paralyzed w/ fear.  He ran down the hallway and I followed asking him to please tell me what was wrong.  He initially said, &#34;I can&#39;t tell you and I&#39;ll never tell anyone&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept at him and he suddenly grabbed me by the arm took me out the front door pointed up to the top of the tall hills on the back side of Luke Airforce base and said, &#34;That&#39;s whats wrong.&#34;   He then ran back into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there focused on what appeared to be a glowing fireball on the very top of the mountain.  I watched it for a while then yelled to my husband that I was going to take the truck and go up there, as it looked like a crashed craft of some sort.  He became hysterical and said, no way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw jets being scrambled from Luke AFB and a few minutes later I could see headlights from vehicles climbing the mountain trying to get to the fireball.  The road back there is part of the Base, so I assumed they were Base security climbing the mountain.  They only got about half way up the mountain and either stopped or shut off their headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back in the house and tried to call local news (perhaps channel 10?).  There was a busy signal, which I thought was odd for a news station.  I managed to calm my husband down enough to tell me exactly what had happened to him while he was on his way home from his meeting and he put his hands on his head and said, that he was on his way home and came to a stop because the man in front of him had stopped suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You have to understand this is out in a very sparse desert area where it is pitch black w/ no street lights.  He had his window down and then a &#34;huge&#34; object floated over his car and the man in front of him.  The man in front of him also had his head out of the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband said there was no sound at all, but it blacked out the stars above seeming like it took an eternity to pass directly over the two idling vehicles.  My husband said, he yelled at the man in front of him a! fter the object finally passed over and said, &#34;You saw that right?&#34;  He said, the man said &#34;yes, but would never tell anyone that he did&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband said, the huge object floated rising slowly and went to the top of the mountain just on the back side of the base and that&#39;s when he had run into the house and into the back bedroom, completely ridden w/ fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I can only report the fireball that I witnessed that I thought looked like a crashed craft as it completely lit the top of the mountain. But the whole story needed to be told, as my husband has NEVER been the same.  It shook him to his very core and would refuse to talk about it as it brought back the intense fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while the fireball on top of the mountain slowly began to fade, but remained glowing for about two hours.  I get angry at myself for not taking the truck up there to see for myself, but it&#39;s very rugged terrain to get up there even w/ a dirt road or a fire road on which to travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has taken me this long to tell this eye witness account, but now it is told.  By the way, I went to the front of the Air Force Base (about 3 blocks away)  the next day and it was locked down tight.<n>

We were heading out of town to his house travelling west on HWY 87. My friend suddenly pointed out of the front window and shouted, &#34;look&#34; or something to that effect. I leaned forward in my seat and all 3 of us witnessed lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a row of lights about five across. They appeared to be very close, the windows were down and we heard no sound. I did not have much time to consider what they were before this happened: each light, one at a time in order went out, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and in the same timing/rythm all five came on together, stayed for a beat longer and then all five blanked out at the same time. We saw no more, heard nothing, the lights did not fly away or appear to have moved about. They just went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Casa Grande, on this road in particular, there is nothing to obstruct the view of the sky. No streetlights, no tall trees, and no hills or mountains. It is flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I refueled helicopters at Fort Hood, Texas and it did not appear to be anything that I have seen before. Furthermore there would have to be five helicopters together generating lots of noise and hovering very, very close togther or a LARGE helo with five landing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This did happen at the same time that the Phoenix lights appeared. I am certain that this was a part of that occurence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above to March 13, 1997, which was the date of the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; sighting over Arizona.

3/13/97 21:30|Sciotoville|OH|Formation|10-15 min|The phoenix lights were also seen in Ohio.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65980.html|81|ndxe199703| The phoenix lights were also seen in Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred 11 years ago and at the time I was only in 8th grade. I only put in a small amount of effort to find out more about the sighting. Even though I only put in little effort in finding out facts at the time, this was a significant event for me in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 9 or ten o’clock; I am not sure the exact date, the big news was the hale bob comet. A few friends and I decide to go out and take another look at the comet since you could see it perfectly and clearly in the sky. We walked out on my front porch and into to my front yard facing southward to look at the comet. After being outside for a few minutes we noticed a light southwest above a hill. Next thing you know right beside it in consecutive order 3 or four lights appear right beside the first light, from left to right. Next, two lights disappeared from right to left and then reappeared. Then two more lights appeared in consecutive order with the others and one more after that. These things were staying perfectly still in the air not moving at all and making no noise. After a series of lights disappearing and appearing again a second row of consecutive lights started appearing directly in order and below the lights above. These things were hovering in the air whatever they were. I have seen pictures of the flares that people used to try to duplicate the phoenix lights (which wasn’t even close), and I have military experience in which I have seen flares with my own eyes so I know for 100% fact they were not flares. All theses lights appeared, disappeared and reappeared again in the exact same spot in the sky. They all also stayed perfectly still. Nothing man made could stay as perfectly still and in order as these did. The only thing I have ever seen in my life that I could use to compare this experience with is the phoenix lights. The way the phoenix lights appear and disappear was exactly what I seen. All I can tell you is, I seen exactly what was seen in phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly after the event my friends and I called our science teacher and told him about what was going on and he said maybe some debris was falling off the comet and my friends and I knew that was not the case. A few weeks later my teacher told me he heard the military was doing something with flares. I do not remember his sources; actually I am pretty sure he never told me exactly how he found that out. I knew, once again 100% for a fact, they were not flares. At this time in my 8th grade life I knew no other way to find anything out about this. Then after even more time started going by I never really even thought to pursue this. Then after having kids and settling down a bit I started watching more TV and about two years ago learned of the phoenix lights. The incident had already been bothering me for years but now it has been tearing me up. I am becoming more obsessed with finding more about this interesting subject and what happened that night Also I have seen other strange things in the sky but nothing that was as definitive as this. I would really like to know if there were any other sightings around this time, or ever around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

3/13/97 21:30|Monterey|CA|Sphere|3-5 minutes|March 13, 1997 Monterey, CA UFO incident|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25816.html|82|ndxe199703| March 13, 1997 Monterey, CA UFO incident<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you recall there was footage of orange lights over one of Arizona&#39;s cities. I believe it was Phoenix.  Anyways the orange lights all appeared in a line across the city.  After the ordeal the military came out with there own statement saying they were flares I believe. The ufo footage was taken by a gentleman from his house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazing as it may seem I saw the same colored lights that night in Monterey, CA. It was around 9:30 pm. On my way back home from class I was driving east on Highway 68 near the Monterey Airport.  The night was clear with no moon.  While looking off to the southeast I saw what appeared to be two stars of orange color. However, they were moving together at a fixed speed while I was driving. I lossed them for a few seconds in the trees and then there was only one.  As I drove further passed the airport the orange light kept on a straight path at a moderate speed. It looked like the UFO was flying at the speed of a small plane.  While driving about a mile east of the airport I was right under the UFO. The light did not change course nor was it landing at the Monterey Airport. It kept right on its path going north-northwest of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now you are wondering why this is interesting and if there is any truth to this. Well one interesting clue about the UFO is the lights. The UFO did not depict the normal aircraft light pattern on an airplane. No wingtip lights were visible or flashing. Nor was there any headlights visible through the entire experience. The object(s) were a round soft orange color. They looked so much like a star at first that you could have easily assumed they were. Another thing when I drove under the object it still was orange all the way around. Still no wingtip lights were visible.  In addition, normally when an aircraft passes you at night it should be dark from the rear since the headlights are pointed in the direction of flight. Anyone think this is not a normal aircraft?<n>

I could not tell the altitude of the objects.  They were moving due north in a wide “V” formation.  There were about ten objects in each arm of the “V” all the same rectangular (shaped like a postage stamp, slightly longer in the north-south dimension, the direction of travel).  Meantime, a commercial airliner was climbing out on a NE heading as if it were heading for Denver (very noisy) to my left that would place it over the far northwest area of Glendale, probably over 67th Ave. and Bell Rd. or slightly farther north, possibly over 67th Ave. and Union Hills Rd.  I was riding a bicycle on a dark side street facing east.  As I recall, the evening was clear and moonless.  I figured that the “V” formation would cross the path of the jet airliner and I would be able to get an idea of the altitude and size of the objects as they intersected with the airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the “V” formation approached overhead, slightly to the east, if low, possibly traveling above 35th Avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If higher, they possibly would be above Black Canyon Freeway (I-17), over the Metrocenter regional shopping mall.  The “V” formation was not directly overhead, but slightly to the east of me at an undetermined altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the “V” formation approach the point directly east of me, the objects did a coordinated maneuver: They moved out along the “V” and spun in a coordinated circular pattern and then moved close together in a circular group packed tightly but none of them overlapping.  They moved out of the “V” formation in opposite directions and formed two separated circular clusters.  In doing this complicated maneuver, they never changed speed or their north-south orientation.  The motion out of the “V” formation reminded me of the Paramount logo at the start of Hollywood movies where the star flow up an around the mountain forming a circle of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened out of the arms of the “V” forming a rotating circle of rectangular objects that then tightened the circle into a paced grouping also having a roughly circular perimeter with all the objects maintaining their north-south direction only now formed into two separate circular tightly packed cluster – still moving toward the jet airliner.  The separation between the two clusters was approximately the length of the ends of the “V” when I first saw it and when it reached the point direct east of me..<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects continued moving due north and at some point would intersect the path of the jet airliner – either In front of it or behind it – at least one or the other of the now two separate circular tightly packed clusters.  The jet airliner continued NE.  The two clusters were moving toward the rear quarter of the plane and I was sure one of the cluster would intersect and pass over the plane either above it or below it and that would give me some idea of their relative size and altitude.  As the two clusters moved toward the rear quarter of the plane, probably at about a 45 degree angle if a passenger on the plane were looking back over the plane’s horizontal tail assembly.  As both clusters approached the plane and reached a point fairly close, both clusters simultaneously blinked invisible – as if the simultaneously and instantly turned on some kind of “cloaking” effect that rendered them invisible.  Neither cluster passed over or under the plane.  They just suddenly turned invisible.  The jet airliner continued it NE heading, the pilot or crew or passengers, unaware that a large cluster of rectangular objects had nearly intercepted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived home, about a half mile from where this sighting occurred, I looked in the White Pages and found two listings for UFO reporting.  The first one I called rang with no answer.  The second one I called, UFO Watch I think was the name, located in Fountain Hills east of Scottsdale.  The man I talked to said it was extremely unusual to see rectangular objects and even more unusual to see multiple rectangular objects.  He said the complex coordinated maneuvers I described the objects performing would not be possible from any current technology he was aware of.  The U.S. Air Force didn’t have anything capable of such a complicated, coordinated maneuver and they certainly would not perform something as complicated as the circular spin and tight formation clustering over a densely populated city such as Phoenix.  He told me to make a note of what I had seen and leave it at that.  He said no one would believe me.  I told him that I had two thoughts.  One was that this was the first UFO sighting I had ever experienced and couldn’t believe that it occurred over a metropolitan area.  I thought UFO sightings usually were seen over remote, rural areas.  And second, that this occurred in the early evening and surely I wasn’t the only one who had witnessed it.  People would be out playing tennis or shooting baskets or doing other outdoor activities and would have seen the same “V” formation and the maneuvers that I had seen.  I watched the news the next couple of days and never heard any report of such a sighting or similar UFO report.  I find it hard to believe that I was the only one who witnessed this unusual event.  There was a different sighting reported over Phoenix of some kind of unusual “lights” but they were moving in the opposite direction, from what I have heard, moving from north to south.  I told the man in Fountain Hills that I was sure that if I went out and purchased some video or photography equipment that it was unlikely that I would encounter such an unusual display of UFO mass coordinated maneuvers in the rest of my lifetime.  I probably would be wasting my time expecting to see such a sighting again and hoping to record it on videotape or on photographic film.  But what I had witnessed spanned about ten minutes at the most, maybe not that long.  The objects were not moving very fast, no faster than the jet airliner.  If I move my hand to trace the movement of the objects, the time lapse is more like one or two minutes, possibly less than one minute.  When I first saw the “V” formation, it was about halfway between the hor! izon to the SE and zenith looking due East.  This is the first time I have ever given a written report of that sighting.  I have told family and friends what I saw.  Each time a movie started showing the Paramount Pictures-Gulf &amp; Western stars spinning in a circle, I would mention that’s what I saw those UFO objects do as they moved out of the “V” formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  However, we assume that he describes here the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; event, of March 13, 1997, so we have changed the date above, in order to reflect that fact.  PD))<n>

The craft displayed no visible lights, but were lit by background light from the city of Las Vegas.  The speed at which they operated seemed extremely slow by comparison to &#34;normal&#34; aircraft that I am familiar with, being an airline pilot. And there was complete silence.  Thier size was larger than any aircraft I had ever seen, appeared to be flying wings or triangles.  I would judge the altitude to be approximately seven to ten thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so struck by the sight of this experience, I remained motionless and made no attempt to obtain binoculars or cameras.  Again, thier size was incredible as was thier total silence and lack of speed as they &#34;flew&#34; overhead.  I first thought that it was some refueling operation, but they were within just several miles of McCarran airport, in the airports controlled airspace.  The craft appeared to be black in color, and reflected just enough light that I could make out thier outlines.  The two craft continued in the formation described, to the west and then blended into the night.  No lights were observed, no sound what so ever, however, not trying to be dramatic, I &#34;felt&#34; thier presence, that is the reason I loked up.  At the time I was employed by Continental Airlines, and elected not to mention this experience to  anyone.  I am now retired, and I saw a piece on cable that referred to the &#34;Phoenix&#34; lights. I thought I would share this with others.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was slightly after dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I both noticed a V-shaped formation of 5 lights flying south at a slow speed.   The lights were to the right of us and almost above us (we needed to lean forward and look up and to the right through the windshield of the car).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights continued south along I-17 at roughly the same speed as our car for almost 30 minutes.  There was no visible object between the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were moving slowly for an aircraft and we assumed it could only be something like a group of helicopters flying in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove to a hotel near Sky Harbor airport in Phoenix.

The lights were visible along the west side of I-17, traveling south, for at least 20 to 30 minutes.<n>

I was taking the dogs out before bed (I&#39;mnot exactly sure what the time was, around 2100 I think)and I looked to the north and saw 5 very bright white lightsin a triangle (or V) formation moving really fast southeast.Then they broke formation.  The light in the back and below(from my angle) slowed up.  Now I started to wonder what I waslooking at because most planes would keep formation or at leastbreak formation completely.  Never saw a plane with lights asbright as these also.  The group seemed to rotate 90 degrees tothe left and go a little south of Mingus mountain.  I was suprisedthat I couldn&#39;t hear them so I listened harder.  I did hear thesound of a faint rustling in the sky, not like a jet, but of somethinmoving extremely fast through the air.  The sound was a ways behindthem also and did seem to follow them.  I then started lookingaround at two other planes flying.  Sessna&#39;s by the sound andspeed of them.  Also by the red flashing lights.  I saw the lights fadeinto the distance and I headed back inside.  My first notion was whathas our government got up there?  New stealth technology?  Then whythe lights?  I also thought the lack of sound could have been some formof some top secret frequency cancellation system that the governmentis checking out.  But still, why the lights?It didn&#39;t hit home that these could possibly be UFO&#39;s until I heardpeople talking about it on Friday.  Then I knew I had seen somethingthat was definately unexplainable.  At least by me.It was definately not the comet, flair, balloon, or any other thing ofthat nature.Anyway, feel free to call if you want more information<n>

I wanted my wife to see them but was fixated on watching and figured she would not have time to get outside before they were gone. My watching time was a couple of minutes or so and I immediately knew I was seeing something not natural/normal. I was watching six or more bright orange lights in a V formation (like a boomerang) moving slowly at a low altitude. There was no sound. The minute it had passed I went in the house and told Mother and wife what I had just seen. I wondered if others had also witnessed the happening. The next morning it was big news and was seen by  hundreds from towns starting  in northern Arizona.....through Phoenix and on down to Tucson. I called the Arizona Republic and told the reporter what I had seen and assured her I was not into UFO happenings and was hopeful of an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day a reasonable explanation has never been given.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I am a retired corporate VP living in North Phoenix)<n>

I looked to the east and saw a very strange looking craft flying (?) very slowly in the sky. It was moving away I assume as it was getting smaller. It was very visible against the Superstition Mountains. It moved slowly from north to south and back again in what appeared to be a ric-rac pattern. It was quite large, I agree with the others who put their arm up and measured with a closed fist. It appeared triangular in shape, I related it to a &#34;squashed&#34; pyramid. I saw three very bright white lights, one in each corner and one at the top of the  &#34;pyramid&#34;.  In the center was a very, very bright pulsating red light, bigger in circumference than the three white lights. I would describe the white lights as three powerful strobe lights. We watched the object for several minutes and we amazed that something that large could move so gracefully! and so silently. We could hear no sound at all. It gradually faded into the south east sky.<n>

I had just left work.I boarded Interstate 10 northbound from chandler Blvd.As i was looking north I noticed 5 then 6 then 7 bright lights suddenly appear in the sky afew miles ahead.they formed a straight line, then formed a V shape formation then back to a straight line this lasted afew mintues.Then I noticed the lights blink out one by one. I started to get goose bumps up and down my arms.I drove faster to get home and turn on the news to see if I was seeing things or if infact other people saw this too. When I got home A friend of mine was waiting outside my apartment for me and seemed very excited about something!! The first words out of his mouth were &#34;Hey Kevin you will never guess what I just saw!!&#34; I said &#34;Did you just see a bunch of UFOs over there?(pointing northwest). He said &#34;YES!!&#34;. We went inside my apartment and turned on the TV.But nothing about it was on yet.We compared our stories and they were the same. Neither one of us could shut up!!!.When the news came on we learned that we were not the only ones that saw this,and that there was also a seperate second sighting of a V shaped object that flew over the entire   state witnessed by hundereds of people.We were both very excited and very concerned.We kept on talking about our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness may have erred with respect to the time of the sighting.

Almost 7 years ago my friend and I had been out riding in the woods outside of Libby, Montana, about 4 miles up Pipe Creek Road.  We had stopped so that I could take a nature break and as I got out of the pickup I notice an odd kind of light in the sky just north of our position. The light had a fuzzy apearance as if it were a real bright, but seemed to have a creamy skin surrounding it.The object wasn&#39;t really bright like a star would be and I couldn&#39;t tell just how  far away or  how  high it was in the sky.  I hadn&#39;t seen anything like it before but know it wasn&#39;t  a star or a planet and when I said to my friend, &#34;Hey, check out that weird fuzzy light in the  sky.&#34;  It  moved slowly in behind a tree.The tree blocked our view of the object but I told him to keep looking  at the  upper part of  the tree  thinking that it would appear on the other side of the tree as it passed in the direction that it was moving  but it didn&#39;t come out the other side .It apeared to me to be hiding out of plain view from us.I had a feeling that this was something that maybe didn&#39;t want to be seen.As we continued to focus on the tree for about 30 seconds or so,it  shot off from behind the tree in a southern direction so fast that it apeared to leave a streak across the sky.I asked my friend if he had seen it and if he had ,what direction it went, he said  &#34;south&#34; and  I knew then that I wasn&#39;t seeing things .He  asked me what the hell was that? and I said  it was the light that I had seen when I first got out of the truck. I really  can&#39;t say how big it was norit&#39;s altitude. It  seemed to  hover silently and then instantly travel  in a  southern direction at a very high rate of speed. Nothing I know of can move that fast from a standstill to instant  acceleration. We talked  about it  to ourselves for a few days and then I heard about the major sighting in Phoenix,Arizona via an Art Bell broadcast a few days later. I&#39;m not too sure if it had  anything to do with the Arizona sighting but it was on the same night and  right arround the same time of that  event. I did look on a map and Libby Montana is  almost due North of Phoenix so there may be something  to this sighting that connects the two together.There is also a hydroelectric dam about 15 miles  north of where we were so it may have been of intrest to the object.I do appologise for my late entry of this sighting but feel that it may be helpfull in some way, Sincerly, ((name deleted)), Libby, Montana  ps: I Do Believe we are not alone<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness via telephone, and he sounds quite credible to me.

I would email my copy but it was saved on a hard disk that no longer workd. Ed Dames said it was theatrical lazers on a rooftop in south Phoenix that were invisible to the eye until they crossed in the air. Since the sighting, somebody fed the press a picture they took of parachute flares being droped far to the west-south-west, that were clearly parachute flares on another date completely. By the way, I&#39;m a retired Air Force Pilot with a million miles of flying, and another million miles of driving trucks and taxi cabs, and I&#39;ve never seen aliens in the sky. Yes there are UFO&#39;s - for example when I see a 747 I try to count the upper floor windows to see what series 747 it is. The 747-100 was glued together and they&#39;re not flying anymore - it had fewer than 7 upper deck windows. The current 747-400 has two rows of upper deck windows. It&#39;s an unidentified 747 until I can get a look at how many windows the upper deck has, but it&#39;s not an alien ship, just a Unidentified 747. There are no flying saucers, sorry. I&#39;ve never seen one. I&#39;ve seen thousands of unidentified flying objects but none of them were alien spaceships. Goodness. Get your act organized. Ed Dames long ago explained the Pheonix lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness gets date for the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; wrong; it is March 13, 1997.  We have corrected date above.  Ed Dames, appearing on the Coast to Coast radio program with Art Bell, its host, declared that through a process of &#34;technical remote viewing,&#34;  he had determined that the entire event over Arizona had been caused by &#34;two, blue-green, one-half, split-beam lasers,&#34; which allegedly had been mounted on the tops of buildings in downtown Phoenix, and had projected the images into the night sky above Phoenix.  The proposition is so absurd, in our opinion, that we won&#39;t bother to address the issue here, but rather leave it up to the reader to make up his own mind.  We will comment to the extent, however, that the &#34;lasers&#34; would have to have been able to project their beams through clouds, dust, and even mountain ranges (!!) in order to have been able to do what is claimed by Dames.

They looked like missles, but they didn;t go in one direction. They would descend, go left, bo right, go back up, go down again, and disappear. To me what I thought it was, was the military testing missles. I got seven friends who all saw the same thing. The lights then flew south and disappeared.

I was at the corner of Ramuda and the block behind my home when I somehow became aware of many lights coming toward me very slowly and deliberately.  They were red in color and not too bright but low, very low to the ground coming right towards me.  At first I thought,oh it&#39;s helicopters from the airforce base or something.  The lights were in a v shape but a very wide or fat v.  I saw 4 lights that seemed to be evenly apart and one lagged behind, uneven compared to the rest.  As they got closer still, I was acutley aware that this wasn&#39;t just helicopters                     because they were close, low and no sound could be heard from them at   all.  I just stood there in total awe.  Even the dog seemed to be aware  of this object or objects.  The object changed altitude right in front  of me, I tried to see stars throught he middle of the lights but saw  none.  As the object moved away it turned toward the west from coming  south and west. As the object changed direction,I could only see 3 lights,still red in color. It also changed speed.  I live in North  Phoenix in a subdivsion called Tatem Highlands closest crossroads being      Tatem and Jomax.  Many of my neighbors walk dogs late at night, however I seemed to have been out alone this particular night.  There were three folks I yelled at immediatly after the object moved away from me, but they didn&#39;t seem to understand what I was saying.  My husband is an astronomy teacher and &#34;poohed,poohed&#34; me when I told him what happened.  Of course the next day when the story was in the news, he seemed more interested.<n>

We were walking west when something caused us to look north and up into the sky at approx 45 degrees above the horizon.  There were seven lights equally spaced in a row parallel to the horizon.  They were equally illuminated and approximately the color of stars but larger.  They were stationary in the sky. They seemed to be further away than what an airliner would be but not like a distant planet or star.  We watched then for 5 or 6 seconds then they disappeared one at a time from west to east.  I believe it was the next morning on t.v. there were reports about lights the night before in Arizona and maybe New Mexico.

3/13/97 20:30|Phoenix|AZ|Chevron|20 minutes|Witnessed the object travel south along Interstate 10 toward Casa Grande|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11614.html|103|ndxe199703| Witnessed the object travel south along Interstate 10 toward Casa Grande<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of March 13, 1997, my son and I were driving on I-10 where it flows due East through Phoenix AZ. The time was approximately 8:30 P. M.. I noticed what I initially thought was a long line of commercial aircraft approaching Sky Harbor International Air Port from the North preparing for a Westerly landing. I remember thinking it odd that they all appeared to be at the same elevation and none were changing position. As we continued on, I-10 turns South heading toward Casa Grande and Tucson. At that time I lost sight and interest  in the lights. We left I-10 at the Riggs Road exit and headed East towards my son&#39;s home. I again noticed that the lights were still in the same type of pattern and at the same altitude. They also appeared to be much closer. We arrived at my son&#39;s home some 5 minutes later and I went outside to check on the lights while the rest of the family ate dinner. By this time, it was clear that the lights were not separate lights but actually fixed in position relative to each other. They appeared to be part of a structure that was in the shape of a very large v and were moving South and appeared to be over, or very close to, I-10. The lights were on the leading edge of whatever this was. I remember that there were approximately 10 to 13 lights which would appear to extinguish and re-light in no particular sequence. (Could the lights be some form of propulsion?) To say that the object was large is an understatement. It was traveling South approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, moving very slowly and with absolutely no sound. If it was directly over I-10 1 mile to the West, it would be in the range of ½ mile wide. I followed the vehicle for nearly 15 to 20 minutes as it passed through my field of vision from what would be North by North West to South by South West. Using 15 minutes to traverse this roughly 210 degree arc, 1 mile away equates to a an approximate air speed of 15 to 20 mph. The vehicle was obviously solid in nature. As it passed by, the stars in the field of view were not visible behind the vehicle (or whatever it was). As it passed by, the number of lights still visible was reduced as the starboard leading edge was blocked from view. This only served to further substantiate my opinion that the phenomenon was solid. I was located in an area that had very little ambient light so the stars were clearly visible. It passed from view as it traveled toward Casa Grande, 25 miles to the south. It is important to note that the lights I witnessed had nothing to do with the widely reported Phoenix Lights that descended behind South Mountain, West of my position. I did not observe those lights which have been reported, from at least one source, that they were a diversion to draw attention from the vehicle that I saw. Name to be withheld, please.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time to 2030 hrs..  Witness indicated &#34;1830&#34; hrs., which we feel is an error.  PD))<n>

They burned about 15 mins. before they went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a security officer for the GBAF at the time, I was on patrol duty and located at the salvage yard at the Southern end of the Base.  At approx. 2015 hrs. I observed 15 flares dropped in close succession with in 3 mls. of my location. This was unusual because the area seemed to be over &#39;D&#39; area or Dart Drop as it is called but is NOT used for night target exercises because of the close proximity to the Base. The closest target area is South in Range 3 - EastTac another 5-8 mls. SE. The flares dropped were close enough that I could see the white smoke as each burned, but the parachutes were not visible.  15-16 flares were dropped into a near perfect &#39;V&#39; shape pointing west. I had only observed 2-5 flares used at a time and usually staggered. Another officer remarked on his radio that he thought a bunch of people were going to report a UFO after seeing that.  Someone else said he did hear on the news over the radio that people were reporting a v-shaped ufo over PHX.  Later, I listened to the Art Bell show for the begining 10 mins. and heard the same.  There are at least 3 mt.ranges between here and Phx., all of which are at a higher elevation than the height of the flares I observed. The closest town is Ajo another 40 mls. S. of Gila Bend, and I doubt that anyone there could have seen these flares. And about 10 mls. further N. on hwy.85 the ranges start blocking the South view.  It seems obvious to me that the connection of my observation of an unusual flare drop to the &#39;Phx. lights&#39; that evening was a pretext to the authentic  ufo reports.<n>

This event changed everything for me...  Later that year my wife left with the kids, followd by a nasty divorce.  I tried to forget what I know I saw...  for 10 years I made it, working nightly in the same outdoor welding shop that I was working in, on THAT night. The guy on the radio starts talking about the upcoming 10 anniversary of the &#34;Phx Lights&#34; mass sighting, and it was like a switch in my head came on.  I was instantly awakened...  no longer can I hold back on what I saw, and it has become an obsession.  I then reported my story on any ufo website that had the ability.  That&#39;s been a few years now and I have yet to be interviewed on what I saw. The vision of the massive yet elegant airshow that was displayed to those who were watching that night, will continue to play on my head like no other memory I can think of.  As I watched it silently make a banked turn as it glided gracefully at the same elevation (or below) as the South Mtn range that it was effortlessly floating along as it flew away from me.  When I first saw it, it was floating over the S.East end if the airport area, and it was in a semicircle pattern about 5 miles wide.  Each of the orbs that made up the outline could move individually (and a few did).  The light of each orange/red orb came from within and didn&#39;t radiate out (like molten metal).  The orbs started moving and formed into a V shape with one side lopsided by on or 2 orbs.  when it pivoted to start moving the orb in the middle became the nose of the now V craft and when it pointed as if it were going to come my way...  I panicked and turned to run...  I then realized that this thing my be 9 miles away from me.  I turned back around and instantly my fear was gone and as I watched it for the next 15 minutes, I tried not to blink, as I didn&#39;t want to miss a second of it.  I then told a few people and mentioned it to my wife, and it lay dormant in my head until t! he hype of the 10 year anniverssary of it brought it all back. The &#34;flare&#34; explaination is insulting to my intelligence...  I&#39;ve lived here in the Phx valley all my 52 years and have seen my share of flare drops...  Not even close.  We have nothing on this earth (maybe inside it or interdimentionally) that could put on a show like we saw in Phx that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have to tell you that our military and government makes me so mad. Everything has to be a cover-up with them. Maybe they should be more honest with us; don’t we at least deserve that? I was 17 years old and I was teaching a Pop Warner cheer squad on a football field out in Goodyear. There were also other Pop Warner cheer and football teams there practicing. I don’t remember the exact time but it was between 8:30 P.M. and 9:30 P.M. from what I remember. There weren’t less than 500 people there easily, parents, coaches and kids. I noticed that in the field next to us there were several bright lights, almost like street lights. I didn’t pay much attention to them because they weren’t moving and it wasn’t interesting. It did get interesting though when they starting floating towards the field where all of us were practicing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone just seemed to stop and look up. It couldn’t have been more than 200 to 300 feet above us. We couldn’t see anything; it was just dark like the night sky. We just saw that the lights moved together in perfect formation and floated right over us until it faded off, almost like it disappeared. I didn’t really pay attention to its shape because it was so large in circumference, and so close to us. The lights were not too close together, but close enough together that we could see that it was an object. It also made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am angry because the military says that the lights were caused by flares. That is crap. Do they think we’re stupid? Last time I checked, flares could not stay in perfect formation with each other, as if they were connected. And I also wasn’t aware that flares could float over a crowd of people without moving up or down, and then all go out at the same time. These lights all went out together, at the same time as if they disappeared. I personally don’t believe that our military has the kind of intelligence to create something like I witnessed that night.<n>

I went to close the window,when three huge, white, bright lights caughtmy eye. A plane was crashing from SkyHarbor Airport in Phoenix, the angle andspeed would not allow a plane to survive.I ran to the living room, grabbed my glasses,and told my wife of 25 years, Get outside,NOW! Never said that before, in that tone.We were standing on our porch within 8-10seconds. This craft was 3000 ft. off thesurface. at least 1 mile in length. Thereis no doubt in our minds that what we wereseeing, was one object. It appeared to betriangular or wedge shaped. Three bright whitebeams of light up front, and 4-5 solid, non-blinking red lights on east side and rear.The moon at that time was at 45 degrees anddirectly facing us. I told my wife, &#34;We&#39;llbe able to see detail as it passes in frontof us, directly in front of the moon. As thecraft passed thru the light of the moon, thecolor of the moon changed to dingy yellow,and we could see horizontal &#34;waves&#34; as itpassed. These waves were similar to gasolinefumes if one to take the lid off of a gas can,and look at the reflection of the fumes. Thecraft was viewed by us from a straight linenorth to south. It never moved irratically,nor did it make a sound. It was totally quiet.Our viewing sight was approximatly 2 milesfrom the craft. We witnessed a plane in landingformation pass right over the object. It neveradjusted its course. It didn&#39;t see it. I toldmy story to MUFON on 1-15-97. We were on,&#34;Strange Universe&#34; on 3/31/97 as witnesses tothis great event. The video on the news and tvis not what we saw at or near that same time.Our sighting was one solid object. We live inthe far eastern part of Chandler, and had anexcellent view point. This craft had no visiblemeans of propulsion and was totally quiet.Itnever changed course and went straight southtowards Tucson, Az. The object was dark andwas not big in height, but beyond huge inlength. We were back inside by 8:45 in totaldisbelief of what we had seen. It wasn&#39;t untilwe saw the news the next day, did we realizethat others had seen massive sightings.

Observed streaking object leaving one orb and traveling at a high rate of speed in a horizontal manner and leaving a &#34;tail&#34; or &#34;trail&#34; behind (much like a meteor, but in a straight path).  The lights extinguished quickly with no fading of &#34;fizzling-out&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been observing these &#34;lights&#34; since approximately August/September, 1996.  I live approximately 4 miles north of Buckeye and in an area that is in a diaganol line approximately 15 - 20 miles south/southwest from Luke Air Force Base.  The first night we observed the lights back in the fall, they appeared due South of my home.  There were three large orbs and were yellow/white in color.  I called to my roomate to come and see and she observed them at that time.  We concluded they were flares of some sort.  However, they disappeared very quickly, as if a switch had been turned off.  A few moments later, they appeared, all at once, in a location several miles to the west of the original sighting.  We were not at all convinced that these lights were unexplainable, and we were mildly curious.The second sighting was perhaps a week later, with the same type of behavior.  This time, however, I retrieved my binoculars and both my roomate and myself wathced the lights for several minutes.  It appeared that there was heat emanating from the orb...we thought it might be smoke, but it appeared more to be like radiant heat.  We assumed that if it was a flare of some time, it would gradually burn out, but once again it exstinguised itself very rapidly and we did not observe it again that night.In visiting with my new neighbors, I asked whether they had seen these lights and they had not.  However, a week or so later, once again they appeared (in the same location), and I called them and had them come outside to observe with myself and my roomate.  They confirmed the sighting, and also thought that perhaps it was some type of flare.  The also observed the heat radiating from the orbs.  They disappeared as before.I am not a very good judge of distance or size, but if I were to estimate the size of these object in relation to the night sky, I would say they appeared to be the size of 1/2 dollar piece.  They have appeared in numbers of 3, 4 and in a configuration of 3 with 2 to west side.I remember two other occasions in which I observed these lights and began to feel that it was some sort of Air Force exercise or some other explainable phenomena.The night of March 13, 1997, I was driving from Phoenix, west on I-10.  I had left town at approximately 7:45 p.m., and am guessing it was around 7:20 to 7:25 that I began to notice the lights.  I remember thinking that the lights were in a different position that I had observed them before.  They were more closely situated near the Estrella Mtns (west side) and seemed to be moving.  Before, I had only observed them being stationery.  It did not really dawn on me that they were moving until I turned South off of the interstate and began traveling south.  I realized that the lights had moved to the location I was used to seeing them...approximately 20 miles west of the Estrella Mts.By the time I was within one mile of my home, I began to sense that these lights were moving much more erratically than I had previously observed.  They had moved even further west (it was approximately 7:25 - 7:30 by this time) and suddenly I saw the streaking object seemingly coming from one of the larger orbs (there were 3 at this time) and move VERY rapidly horizontally across the sky (to the northwest I believe).  It seemed there was a tail of sparks or matter coming from this smaller object and I can only compare it to a meteor, although I am certain it was NOT a meteor (it moved in a straight line and then went out very quickly some distance from the orb). I ran into the houseand summoned my roomate, but by the time we went outside, all signs of the objects were gone.I began asking people at work back in Aug/Sept if they had seen any of these lights.  I suppose they thought I was a bit touched, but now that this major sighting has occured, they are remembering the days I came in with details of what I had seen the night before.  I wish I would have known how to contact someone back then.I am a Data Processing Assistant (15 years) with a large school district in Phoenix.

After noticing, I jokingly said, &#34;Hey guys, I think i see a UFO!&#34;  This was more of a gut fealing than a joke.  My four friends then saw what I was looking at. Since we were right by Skyharbor Airport, there were commercial planes flying East and West.  The red lights seamed to be lower in altittued and oblivious to the fact that it was flying directly toward commercial aircraft traffic.  They were in a V formation, three red lights in front, two red lights behind and to each side.  As they moved closer to us we moved into our parking lot.  There seemed to be no &#34;body&#34; to this aircraft, only lights.  When directly overhead, it was so large, it wouldnt fit it into direct vision, I had to shift my eyes to see the entire object.  At this time, we realized that this was not one object, it was five, or more.  The red light in back and to my right, was trailing slightly.  In talking !with my co-workers, some say the lights were red, and some say they were orange.  The lights slowly moved to the South, and then they were gone.  Then the following day, we saw the six o&#39;clock news ( at work ) and all doubts were gone, it was a UFO!<n>

I looked at the time, listened for any fire truck in case they had released a microwave or something, but there was only the normal sound of city traffic.  Several days later my brother said, &#34;did you see the lights?&#34;.  Also, I talked to a man who had seen the flyover.  I didn&#39;t know anything about it until the video made the news and I put two and two together with my encounter.

They left such a deep and disturbing impression that I still think about them from time to time, as I have never heard an adequate explanation.  I discovered this website while searching for something, anything that might have come to light in the intervening years, and felt compelled to add my account, as it includes some additional items that I haven’t seen reported by anyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of March 13, 1997 I was camping just outside of Prescott, AZ, in the forest near Hidden Valley Dr.  There was a campsite nearby that was closed for the season, but my tent was outside of the campground area, on a hill I would estimate to be about a half-mile from Highway 89.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after 8:00 PM, I noticed several lights in the sky off to the West-Northwest.  I assumed at first that they were airplane lights, as they seemed to be the usual colors of red, green, and white, but they seemed to be moving somewhat erratically (hovering and bobbing in the air), and I got the impression there was something generally weird about them.  The colored light they were casting seemed to project in much stronger beams than I have ever seen from an airplane, and they seemed to be rotating and changing colors from a common source, rather than the clearly separate lights that airplanes have.  I recall that there were two of these objects, but there may have been more that I dismissed as airplanes before noticing the oddness of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around this same time, I saw first two, then three lights off in the trees to the Southwest.  At first I had thought they were the eyes of an animal, God only knows how I could have thought that, but then I noticed the third light, and also noticed that they seemed to be pulsating, growing dimmer and brighter by turns.  These lights appeared to be very low to the ground, somewhere amongst the trees and evidently some distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As all this was going on, and I was getting generally freaked out, while I was looking in the direction of the red/green/white lights, I saw a chevron formation of five very bright white lights appear out of the West-Northwest sky.  This formation banked towards the South, and flew directly overhead.  I was observing this from just inside the tent, with the opening facing Northwest (I was already pretty badly frightened by this point, and had gotten into the tent for security), so I lost sight of them after they passed overhead.  I cannot really make a decent guess as to their altitude, or how fast they were moving--from the time I saw them to the time they passed overhead was less than half a minute, so I had the impression they were moving pretty fast, and at the time (having seen them from a great distance off) I assumed they were at high altitude, but descending as I watched.  My impression was that they were five separate objects, although they remained in perfect formation when they performed the banking maneuver.  I believe these particular lights passed over at around 8:15.  They made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This brief sighting of five lights flying in a &#34;V&#34; was my only glimpse of what is now called the &#34;Phoenix Lights.&#34;  For several hours, however, I continued to observe a number of strange things in the sky, including the red/green/white lights, several lights that I would have thought were stars if they had not been moving in jerks and starts in random directions, and at one point what appeared to be a circle of orange light (pretty much the color of fire) passing through the sky from East to West, also without any sound.  I was so exhausted that night that I eventually fell asleep despite all the bizarre things in the sky.<n>

The object was seen on the northwestern horizon.  It appeared as a horizontal line with a red glow.  We arrived home and got some binoculars to see what it was.By this time it had changed color to a brilliant white and was in the shape of a triangle.  The best discription at this time was the leading edge of the B2 bomber.  A light on the nose, one on either side and toward the back, then one moreon either side spaced farther back than the first pair.  There were five lights in all.  The object moved from the northwest to the southeast, almost directly over head of our house.  As it moved across the sky is believe I was able to seethe stars between the light formation.  We tried to hear a sound from the objects, thinking it might be helicopters flying in formation, but there was no strobe or red and green marker lights.  The formation of the five objects did not changeas you would expect from aircraft.  There was no change in spacing, no noise and it was as bright overhead as it was comming or going.  We could not tell how high the objects were, but while discussing what we saw the next day we realized thatwe might have see these objects while they were over Prescott because they started out red then changed to white while over Phoenix.  We do not have any explanation for what we saw, but we both saw something we&#39;ve never seen before.<n>

The point of the &#34;V&#34; was in the direction of movement. The first three lights were in a fairly tight &#34;V&#34; while two of the lights were further back along the lines of the &#34;V&#34;&#39;s legs. During the NW-NE transit one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position.  I estimated the three ;ight &#34;V&#34; to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky.<n>

I read with some interest your report on the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; as I was a witness to their passage on the night in question. I am a pilot with one of the major carriers here in the valley and I live in the South Mountain area. On that night I was on my way to work and traveling north along interstate 10 at approximately 8:15 PM. The lights first appeared to me to be over the airport in a wide formation and traveling in a southerly direction, roughly over the interstate. There is no question that they were anomalous, they got my attention immediately, and I was concerned enough about distractedly weaving into other traffic while observing them, that I pulled off the interstate to watch them go overhead. Where my account seems to differ from the accounts of other witnesses is that I perceived the lights to be individual objects, five in all, traveling in a roughly triangular formation. As they passed overhead, I took note of a particularly bright star and noted that the star was never obscured by any solid object as the lights passed it. When the lights were directly overhead, they appeared to be comprised of two lights per object, the bright light in the direction of motion and a much fainter light immediately behind it. There was no variation in the color of the lights and no blinking or twinkling. It was very difficult to judge the altitude of the objects, as they were never more than pinpoints of light moving very slowly; if I had to guess, I would say they were at very high altitude. I know this is at odds with some of the more dramatic reports of a gigantic dark object, but I am certain that I am not mistaken. Being a pilot, I am a trained observer of lighted airborne objects and, while these lights were indeed strange, there is no doubt in my mind that they were individual objects and not the running lights on some single large object.<n>

Shortly after they hovered in place, pulsating and began moving at odd trajectories.  They did this for several minutes, blinking in and out.  Moments later, they had vanished from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving Northbound on West I-10, from the Chandler Blvd exit, Miles looked out the car windshield and noticed the objects positioned at one o&#39;clock. As they were falling, I noticed five objects, three with sparks coming off of them.  Then I got Demian&#39;s attention and we both witnessed them stop above the horizon of the city lights, hover, and began pulsating.  Two, started moving independantly of the others at various right angles and spiral motions, while the others maintained a steady pattern.By this point we had passed the Elliot Rd. offramp and were proceeding toward the Superstition Freeway.  By the time we had crossed beneath the Guadalupe Rd. overpass, they had vanished from sight.  From our assumption, they appeared to be East of Sky Harbor by a few miles, somewhere over Tempe.There is not a dought in our minds that this unexplained phenominon is indeed explainable.

Here is one more for you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think my sighting was somewhat unusual, because I saw the craft flying southward above Interstate 17 about 60 miles north of Phoenix.  I&#39;ve heard reports from the Prescott area, and of course in Phoenix, but not many from in between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please refer to the following map:  http://maps.google.com/?ll=34.174885,-112.136593&amp;spn=0.099698,0.100079  This shows I-17 north of Phoenix.  The map is centered on the Sunset Point rest area, which is about 1/2 mile up the road (north) after my sighting ended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from Phoenix, and the time was approximately 8:15 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t take that time too seriously -- I didn&#39;t check the time while watching the UFO, and came up with an approximation later based on the time I got home. (I was used to making the trip and new how long it took to drive between Phoenix to the Sunset Point halfway point, and then home in Sedona.)  See where I-17 is split lower in the map area?  That is the stretch of the interstate that connects the Sonoran Desert with a mesa area at higher altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road there is curvy and is on about a 7% grade, with little or no shoulder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was getting dark, and while driving about halfway up that part of the road, I noticed an inverted V of bright lights far off in the distance.  They seemed low near the horizon, and at first I thought they were lights on a distant mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But that didn&#39;t make sense, because the mountain is off to the left (west), and the lights were just about 5 degrees left of straight ahead.  Also, they were white color and steady, not flashing red as with a radio tower or something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was thinking those thoughts, I realized there was no way the lights were on the ground, since they were getting higher in the sky and nearer (bigger)!  Obviously, it was something or some things flying through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was getting difficult to watch the lights, because I was in traffic, navigating curves uphill on a road with almost no shoulder and a cliff to my left in case I messed up!  (BTW, I was in the left lane of traffic.) As the lights got nearer, I had to push my head forward toward the windshield and look upwards.  It was a little tricky...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights stayed on the left of my car, apparently flying over the southbound part of the interstate.  I could clearly see there were five lights, one at the tip and two each on either side, in the V shape.  The lights were white, but not pure -- slightly yellowish, like an incandescent light bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights were just a short distance away, I thought, &#34;That is either 5 military jets flying in formation, or a UFO.&#34; I watched to see if I could see a solid shape of a big ship, but it was too dark.  As the lights got the closest, I thought, &#34;That is either an alien UFO or some secret government project.&#34;  It didn&#39;t seem to be jets in formation.  There were only the 5 whitish lights, and no green or red lights, or flashing lights of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing I remember thinking at the time was that I wondered how big the craft was.  If it was flying low, it might have been the size of a commercial airliner, but if it was higher up (tens of thousands of feet), it would have been huge and moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first spotted the lights off in the distance, they were about the apparent size of my thumb held at arm&#39;s length.  When the lights flew by, they were about the size of my fist at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time the lights had passed by my car, I had driven all the way up the hill to the mesa where the Sunset Point rest stop is located.  I thought of pulling over since there was some shoulder there, but realized that by the time I got out of the car, the lights would already have flown far away, and I wouldn&#39;t see much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I didn&#39;t stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later (Saturday) I was out socializing around town, and mentioned to some friends that I&#39;d seen something while driving home from Phoenix.  One guy looked at me and said something like, &#34;Oh, you saw it!  You saw the UFO that was reported on the Phoenix TV news!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it weren&#39;t for that, I probably would have never connected my experience with the big UFO sighting, which I otherwise would have heard about months or years later, after I&#39;d forgotten what day it was I saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t watch TV or read newspapers, and if other witnesses are anything like me, that would explain why you don&#39;t get many more reports.  It wasn&#39;t until months later I decided to do a search on the Internet and learned that people were calling the UFO the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34;. When I learned that the UFO was a mile wide, I realized that when I saw it, it must have been at a high altitude and really moving! I haven&#39;t tried to do any of the math -- the calculation would be rough at best -- but I guess it must have been going about 2000 miles per hour. (?)  If I can figure out how many apparent angular degrees my thumb is, and use a stopwatch the next time I drive home from Phoenix, maybe I can come up with a better number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll be happy to do my best to answer any questions you have regarding my sighting.<n>

As it got closer we got out some binoculars and looked at it, what looked like white lights were actually two lights forming one. One light being green the other one was red. During this time the oddest thing about this, was there was no noise at all. There was no moon to backlight this so we could only see the lights. I thought perhaps because there was no noise that it might have been a pedal plane that I saw on the discovery channel once. It appeared to be about 1000 feet in the air. One observer is a principal at a local gradeschool, another telephone man, one dental asst., and a 14 year old.<n>

I looked to the north and saw a delta formation of amber lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were heading directly in my direction(Flying South). I thought, &#34;oh boy, if this is a UFO I finally get to see one.&#34; I could not figure their speed. But I would say they were flying slower than a civil airliner on approach. (200-300 mph?) As the lights got closer I observed the lights moving individually(as a plane flying through (or on) the air).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft came overhead I could hear the faint  whine of jet engines.

While I was sitting there I happened to look to the northwest where I saw what looked like four large, very bright white lights in the sky at about 30 degrees. It appeared that they were about one or two miles away from where I was, probably somewhere around 43 ave. or 51 ave. and Olive. These lights appeared to me to be in the shape of a very large diamond they were as bright as and maybe even brighter than those you would see on a commerical jet airliner. When I first saw them they were coming straight down out of the sky in a verical direction. I thought at first that they were the nose, wing, and tail lights of a large jet crashing into the ground, but what was really strange about this was that they were moving downward very slowly. As the lights came down closer to the ground they began to disappear behind the houses in the area, I was thinking to myself that very soon I would be seeing a large fireball in the sky from the crash, but it never happened. As I sat there thinking about what I had seen I decided that it was not a jet crashing because it was moving to slowly. I also decided that it was not helecopters because all of the lights moved downward at exactly the same speed, it did not look like flares because all of the lights were of the same intensity and were a bright white color more like you would see on a jet for it&#39;s landing lights, except much bigger and brighter. I could not see the body of any craft partly because the lights were so bright but also because it was so far away from me. I do remember that as I was looking at it thinking it was a jet crashing, I thought that it looked to big to be a jet, at that distance it would have been at least 10 times larger than a jet. A couple of days after this happened I was talking to my mother and told! her what I had seen, after I told her about it she told me that she had just seen on the local TV news a story about the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; that so many people all over the valley had seen on that same night. I was not going to post this at first until I read on here how many people had seen something like I had. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this and I know what I saw was something out of the ordinary, I will never forget it and it has made me much more aware of the skys around me.<n>

It was sometime between 7:30 and 8:30 P.M..  My recliner seat in my jacuzzi at that time faced the north.  I could see planes coming in from the northwest every couple of minutes which I assume were coming in from Las Vegas and they still fly that same pattern today.  As I was looking what would be due north I notice 5 lights heading straight this way as if they were following I-17.  I was thinking I was going to see maybe the concord. The lights were not real high off the horizon when I noticed them.  I set an watched them coming in anticipation to see what they are.  At a distance they looked like they were in a straight line.  As they got closer they gained in altitude gradually and I could see a V formation.  There is a tree in the lot behind my house that they went behind for just a few seconds.  When they got on the south side of the tree I was amazed at how they had even gotten higher in the sky.  The lights never broke there V formation.  I could see that this was one object of an enormous size.  The lights flew directly over Phoenix while gaining altitude at an accerlerated speed.  I watch the lights along with my Mom and cousin Katy.  As the lights gained in speed and altitude the craft made a straight angle turn with no curve in its turn.  It was simply amazing.  I have seen footage over the years and only one  video showed the same object or one similiar to what we seen.  The lights that supposedly appeared down in south phoenix I do believe were flares.  The object I witnessed was flying and had no sound at all.  It is way to big for any aircraft that we as the general public no of.  I do not know much about the other lights in south phoenix but I wish they would debunk them and focus on the huge craft that actually flew from the north and over the city of phoenix.  I saw the video of the lights that were over Phoenix last night[4/22/08.  At first they resembled the lights I saw however the front light was not there and that video showed the lights moving towards and away from each other so I know it was not the same object I saw in 1997.  The object I witnessed had &#34;fixed&#34; lights on it and they looked the same in roundness from any direction you looked at them.  When I was a kid my brother and I have one other sighting I would like to talk or write about but at this time I would like to know more about the object that flew over ! Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were coming over a mountain, to the north of my house, that is used for hang gliding. That was my first thought, a hang glider strung with lights.  But the lights were bright enough to show that they were not attached to a hang glider frame. A friend was coming to my house the same time I was leaving, so I pointed the lights out to him.  On my way to the store, I noticed my neighbers outside also watching the lights.  I stopped to talk to them about it, and we all came to the conclusion that what we were seeing was a UFO. The object didn&#39;t emit any sound, and flew from north to south.  I first noticed it above Shaw Butte Mountain (15th Ave. and Cholla) and last saw it around 13th Ave. and Mercer Lane. The store trip took me 10 minutes, max.  I drove around a little, looking for the mysterious lights, but they were nowhere to be found.<n>

I looked and what I saw was what looked like at first a pattern of 5 lights in a half oval on its up side. I thought it was a blimp with lights on it. It seemed to be floating but I noticed it was coming directly in our direction. My son went in the house and got my wife, my 13 year old grandson and my 18 year old daughter, to come outside. We all watched these lights approach. Whatever it was it was moving rather slowly. As it came close it no longer had an up-oval shape, but began to look more lie a &#34;V&#34; of 5 lights, with one light in the center lead point and two lights on each side. The angle of the &#34;V&#34; was not very sharp, maybe 60 degrees.As we stood there watching we were completely flabergasted because it was going to pass directly over our house.  And it did. It passed directly over head maybe a thousand or so feet overhead. Our house is up on the side of a mountain in the Northeast part of Phoenix and we can see pretty far to the northwest and southwest. When it passed overhead we all were looking at it and talking. For one thing, it seemed to float over us and it made absolutely no detectable sound at all.  We were trying to imagine what it was. It certainly couldn&#39;t be a group of aircraft flying in formation, because the lights remained absolutely fixed in relationship with each other. As we looked up we could see through the middle of the &#34;V&#34; but each arm seemed to be flat shaped like a ruler, and rather long from the first lead light to the tip lights, maybe a couple of hundred feet or more. It was huge.The kids got a little frightened, I suppose because we had no explanation for what we were seeing. We watched it continue to fly towards the southeast until we no longer could see any lights.My background: I am 54 years old, in perfect health. I have a Masters Degree from Columbia University Teacher&#39;s College. Formerly worked for IBM as a systems engineer. More recently worked in the electronics repair industry in management. Presently executive in a manufacturing firm. My wife is a secretary at St Mary&#39;s Catholic High School. My one daughter is an honor student at the High School. We live up on the side of this mountain and are always looking at the sky, so if we&#39;re outside not much is going to go by without us seeing it. And we all have never seen anything like this.<n>

It was dark outside on March 13, 1997.  I needed to head out to CompUSA which was located near Scottsdale Road and Shea Blvd.  I was heading north on 56th street and I made a left on Shea Blvd which had me heading east towards Scottsdale road.  As I was driving east on Shea, when I got to about 60th Place, I noticed a couple lights coming around on the east side of the McDowell mountains on my left.  They were higher the peak of the mountain which is 3,900 feet, my estimate would be somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove to about 64th street, I noticed about 4 lights spaced at what I would estimate about a 1 or 2 blocks apart.  My immediate thoughts were these are some military helicopters because the speed they were travel was way to slow compared to airplanes.  Scottsdale Airpark is right in the same area and I’ve seen hundreds of planes coming in and out of that airport and none ever flown in that formation.  And I would not say commercial airplanes because none have every flown in that direction either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking out to the left out my window and counted about 7 lights now.  All evenly spaces and was in kind of an arch, like the arch of an old fashion bow.  Totally strange to me because I have never seen any lights like this before, so I was excited to think it was a convoy of military helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I made it to my destination and got out of my car, I looked up and watched the lights come and pass right over me.  2 of the 7 lights went right over my head.  When they went over, I heard ZERO sounds.  Just a light that sputtered and it was completely black around the lights.   I watched as the 3 light went over and in my head, I said this is really strange because I hear NOTHING.  The lights traveled very slowly.  I waited more than 5 minutes in the parking lot for the first light to travel over and then probably 3 to 5 minutes for the second light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I headed into the store and did my shopping.  Never once did I think of it as a UFO.  I used to watch XFiles at that time and didn’t think of taking a picture.  I was thinking they were silent helicopters that ran about a mile or more in length.   After about 20 to 30 minutes in the store, I came out and the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t for a day or two later when I heard the news and it made me think different about what I saw.  The strange part, these lights were in northeast Scottsdale.  Not southwest Phoenix like the Phoenix lights were reported and known for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event, these lights are burned into my memory like it was yesterday.<n>

At approximately eight o&#39;clock I observed five spherical lights the length of a football field floating towards us. My mother said &#34;What ARE you looking at?&#34; Mom, I said,  &#34;LOOK AT THIS;  THERE IS NO SOUND!&#34;  Both of us were in awe as we KNOW the difference between ordinary aircraft and what we were looking at. She, the widow of an Air Force war correspondent and myself having logged MANY air miles as a flight attendant/travel agent/international tour guide. When it was reported as &#34;flares&#34; my comment to her was &#34;NOW you know why I didn&#39;t notify anyone!&#34; What I did do was write the verse and commission an artist friend of mine who painted a 3 foot by 9 foot oil on canvass of the lights with camelback mountain in the background.  It is almost as awe-inspiring as the event itself.  Prints are available if inter- ested.  If I had been online and known of this website on March 13, 1997; not only would I have reported it immediately but I might have saved myself the grief of wondering about a temporary tenuous grip on reality!

My husband said “There’s an  F.O. , I  said F.O. what’s that? My daughter who was about 13 then, said flying object Mom. My son who was  11 at that time, interrupted her and said you mean U.F.O.   I  asked him how  he could  tell that its not an airplane or something. He said, ‘cause it looks like a boomerang with orange lights., and it’s moving too slow for a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had  5 big lights,  looked like headlights , but the one in the middle was white, and the other  4 were amber in color 2 on each side. It was very dark against the dim lit sky, you could see it was in a “V” shape and you could not see the sky between the lights . It was very large and looked to be as long as a football field  from wing tip to wing tip. We watched it all the way to our house , which was only a couple of minutes. We got out of our truck and watched it for at least  10 more minutes as it was moving towards Phoenix it looked to be right over Phoenix International Raceway going towards Sky Harbor International Airport. We could see the airplanes, coming  and going from the airport, and they were much  faster and higher up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen  some strange things in the sky where I grew up, west of Phoenix  on  195thAve. or lovingly called Jackrabbit Trail, I’ve watched the jets from Luke A.F.B. scramble out to the White Tanks mountain range on several different occasions following a sighting near or around Litchfield Park, Rainbow Valley , Goodyear/Avondale, and Buckeye  Arizona. One time we had a cigar shape U.F.O. hover over our own house, with a light so bright it was like lightning at night only not a flash but a steady ultra bright light, When my mother tried to take a picture with a Polaroid camera the whole inside of the camera melted, when she went to pull out the film, it was like melted strings of plastic or rubber and it stuck to her fingers like hot wax, she had a bad burn on her thumb and first finger from it. Then just as fast as it came, it just lifted up and out of sight, a few seconds later here come the jets from Luke A.F.B. That one I’ll never forgot about. I was  only around 10 years old then. I am  a firm believer of  U.F.O.’s  and you have to pretty self centeredCall to think that we are the only ones in this whole universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Wife, in-laws, nephew and son witnessed with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20 miles east of Gila Bend, AZ on I-8 about 50 miles SW of Phoenix. I noticed two bright lights shining over the desert south of the freeway. At first I thought they were to very tall light poles.  2 then 3 then 4 lights appeared.  The lights went out and 3 more appeared lower in the sky immediatedly.  It seemed a set of lights went off and then the bottom set turned on.  Five indiviuals in my car witnessed these lights for approx. 20 mins from I-8 interstate.  I could still see the lights as we entered Gila Bend&#39;s business district. The lights always remained stationary.  Smaller lights seemed to split off from the right edge of the rightmost light, do a very quick arc and return.  The light from the small ones lit up the background clouds. No sound was heard.  We tried to take a photo but it didn&#39;t turn out. This was the same night as the famous &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Location of these lights may be important to understanding the nature of the events that took place later in the eventing, e.g. after 2100 hrs..  This is the only report NUFORC has seen to date, which indicates an earlier time.  We believe that they had nothing to do with the object(s) seen over Henderson, NV; Paulden, AZ; Prescott, AZ; Dewey, AZ; Cordes Junction, AZ; Phoenix, AZ; Casa Grande, AZ; Tucson, AZ; and Kingman, AZ. ))<n>

I know airplane landing light formations for just about every type of aircraft.  This was no aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second event were flares dropped over the Gila mountains.  They acted exactly like flaires and it is my opinion that they were dropped to confuse everyone from the first event.  I lived in Phoenix for 10 plus years and never were flares dropped from that position at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky Harbor is not far away and never once were flares dropped at night.  It would freak the passengers out if they saw something like that while landing.  Even the Marines in Yuma draw attention if they practice at night.  Flying in the Southwest between California and Arizona, you can easily see night activity from far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as soon keep my name to myself.  Just found your site and wanted to share what I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  We agree with his assessment about the flares.  NUFORC has long argued that the flares, which occurred at approximately 22:00 hrs., occurred after the genuine UFO event had ended, which occurred at approximately 21:45 hrs..  PD))<n>

I was gardening in the back yard of my Scottsdale home. I noticed 8 or 9 soft glowing amber lights in the sky approaching me from the south in a V shaped (flying wing) formation. The &#39;flying wing object&#39; gradually flew &#39;directly over&#39; my home (in the course of about 5 minutes) at a perceived altitude of about 500 feet (about the same height of near-by Thompson Peak Mt. of the McDowell Mountains) at a speed &#39;I thought to be&#39; about 40 MPH. The object was like a dark shadow (rather than a solid aircraft) and emminated a deep, soft, quiet, vibrating tone (like an electric turbine generator). I was stunned (in awe) and just watched it pass (as it veered slightly WNW). From that evening until now, ALL reports made by ALL witnesses have been discounted / unexplained by ALL governmental entities... *even though Sky Harbor air traffic control reported its unexplained existence in the Phoenix metro area that evening. I am well skilled in matters of aviation AND not convinced (either way) in matters of extra-terastrial &#39;whatever&#39;, BUT what I saw was not &#39;unidentified&#39;... *It was awesome and real... and it WAS NOT (I know for sure) &#39;of ANY earthling&#39;s doing&#39;. ** A difficult thing to assess (from one who STILL doubts life exists anywhere else in our universe... close enough to travel here at the speed of light in a time frame of a million years or more). Of mention... I have had two other similar experiences (that are not of human cause). I assure you. They were &#39;real&#39; too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I wanted to memorize every detail. It was close enough that I could see that it had lights recessed under the wings and they were of different colors.  There were 4 down one wing and 3 down the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched till it disappeared behind the trees, heading west.

I saw them from the base of Granite Mountain in Prescott, AZ., which is approximately 100 miles North of Phoenix. It was still light when I saw them traveling in a Southerly direction. The most important point I want to make is that they were absolutely not flares, as some would later claim. I come from a family of pilots and have my flight ratings as well. These craft seemed to be moving faster than most planes I have observed. They were traveling in a very symetrical formation-- like an elongated triangle, with probably three lights on either side of a single light at the point. They simply looked like round white lights to me. They seemed more luminescent than typical jets; made no sound; left no contrails; contained no other plane-like lights; and again, seemed to be traveling very fast. I have wondered if they might be some new secret military craft, but couldn&#39;t understand why they would fly over a highly populated area like Phoenix-- wouldn&#39;t make sense. This would also have placed them on Sky Harbor&#39;s (Phoenix&#39;s international airport&#39;s) radar as well. Anyway, I don&#39;t know what they were, but they sure as hell weren&#39;t flares. I will always consider them as having been individual craft unlike anything I had previously seen. I wish so much I would have had a video camera. I know others reported seeing these lights at least as far North as I did. I just hope that my report will lend support to the idea that they were not flares. That was one of the most obsured conclusions I have heard. Hope this can be of some help to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live across the street from a golf course.  We were watching the sky for the Hale- Bopp Comet and we suddenly saw a triangular shaped object hovering over the entire area.  It was large, we could see lights all around flickering with a bright yellow green color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in shock at first and then began to study the object.  It was low to the ground but not so low it would hit a wire.  I could see into its systems.  This craft had a lot of new mechanisms.  I could see things flashing inside that appeared to be advanced technology.  Having grown up overseas in the tropics with a father who was a flight simulator instructor, I have seen many things in the skies.  This resembled nothing I had ever seen before or ever again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise whatsoever.  The craft maintained it&#39;s position for what seemed to me to be a couple of minutes.  It then shot out of the area in a blink of an eye. I have never seen anything move  so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned into the house to get my husband. He was worried about me because we had been gone for over 25 minutes. Time had escaped both of us. When the entire family returned outside it was gone, much to their dismay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Reese AFB and asked if they were conducting anything unusual and they replied no flight out. I called the University of Texas Tech to inquire what it could have been. They blew me off with some cooky &#34;it was the comets tail&#34;.  Well I have seen my share of comets and their tails and this was no tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched a special about Arizona Lights and it resembled quite closely to what I had seen.

During daytime same day of the phoenix lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a round silver craft from my former work location which sets on a hill west of Boeing air field. From my vantage point I look east over the airport. I was sitting in my truck during my lunch brake. I was watching a small plane making an approach towards boeing field. It was a split second later that a spherical craft passed the plane in the opposite direction. This craft was moving at a very high rate of speed. I did not take my eyes from it, I thought it would dissappear at any moment. To my disbelief the craft made a sudden turn west towards my location. The day was sunny and mostly clear with some clouds. When this thing came over, once again I thought it was going to be gone. It was very quick and the craft started to dance in the sky. It litterally stopped to change directions and went east to west up and down (diagonally). I would guess the average travel distance was about one half mile per each direction change. Each traveled distance was done a second or so. It actually would at times pause in and out of the single cloud that was in that area. It went in the cloud, and when I thought it was gone it would pop out somewhere else. The craft finally left. I am surprised not to see any other reports in my area, but I am convinced that I would not have even been aware of this if I had not been focused on the aircraft that it intersected. I would like to talk to anyone who also experienced a local sighting that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didn&#39;t look like anything I had seen before. I pulled over to the shoulder of the road and watched it for a couple more minuts. It seemed to move slowly in a nothern direction and the suddenly vanished. I can&#39;t say what way it went. It just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky that morning was 100% clear. At that time of day ther is not much traffic on the road. This part of northern N.J. is covered with more trees and less popopulated the areas closer to N.Y. It was a long silvery shape that didn,t seem to be moving at first. After I stoped i could see that it was moving very slow. And then it just vanised in the blink of an eye. It was easy to see thet it had no wings or a tial section like a plane would. I live next to a small airport and have a fair idea of planes. Both my Inlaws flew most of their lives and being around planes is common. This was not a plane. I don&#39;t know what it was.<n>

3/13/97|Las Vegas|NV|||Two days after The Phoenix Lights - A different kind of sighting|9/6/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24815.html|149|ndxe199703| Two days after The Phoenix Lights - A different kind of sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fairly new to the &#34;on-line&#34; thing when I tried to report my news to you around 3/17/97. I am a freelance broadcast engineering type. For the &#34;event&#34; itself, my head was deep into a computer repair. What I believe is significant, is that early on 3/14/97 I flew to Colorado Springs to do a boxing event. That is where I heard the news about &#34;The Phoenix Lights&#34;. The following morning(3/15/97) I flew to Las Vegas for a hockey game. I arrived around 9:30am. I knew my remote truck would not arrive until after noon so I went to check in to my hotel. The company put me up in the Howard Johnsons motor lodge located[with other&#34;fine&#34; hotels(Motel 6/Days Inn)] right at the entrance/exit to McCarran airport. As I pulled in I couldn&#39;t help noticing what had to be almost 1000 Navy Seaman,between the 3 hotels,checking out and getting on buses. I went up to a few of them and asked &#34;What are you swabby&#39;s doing here in the middle of the land locked desert?&#34; The reply was basically &#34;we just concluded about a week long joint exercise with the Air Force at the Nellis Range.&#34; Maybe nothing but I don&#39;t think so. Flight path of sightings could easily be originating from and returning to Groom Lake. Rumored to be a &#34;stealthy&#34; airborne radar platform [AIRSHIP] in development around that time. Who handles all things truly &#34;spooky&#34;? NAVY. Who handles airships? NAVY. Perhaps someone who knows where to look could find some record of the &#34;joint exercise&#34;.<n>

It was the night before the phoenix lights sighting occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened after I went through a most incredible series of events. I went to the Justice Department anti-trust division in San Francisco and provided a letter detailing my discovery of a non-detectable computer virus which was extremely destructive. I characterized this virus a Planned Osbolescence/Monopolization virus. I provided the Justice Department with a list of symptoms and a technique I discovered to resolve this problem.I got no assistance from them nor the FBI nor the police, as I was experiencing coersion in the harassment of my computer repair company by affluent people in the East Bay of California, Phone tapping and other manipulation, price fixing, and threats which made me fear for my life. My harassers were connected to the computer industry and large financial institutions. I was never formally interviewed by anyone and told my brother on the phone that &#34;They&#39;re only hope is to turn me into a Jesus freak or something, cause otherwise I&#39;m going to the supreme court about this.&#34; The next day I started hearing out of place voices on my TV and Radio which were of a religious nature. It was very convincing and I had started reading the bible because I was all alone as my family couldn&#39;t help and my friends didn&#39;t understand. I started having visions of things I read in the bible. These voices and visions went on for four months. I had to move as my business went from $5000 per month to about $100 per month once I announced this virus to lawyer customers who were trying to prove that I wrote it to increase my business when in actuality, I had no idea what was behind the harassment I was experiencing. I am including this information because I feel that my business problem is connected with this ufo sighting and thus shows an agenda for the phoenix lights vehicle sighting and a connection between ufo&#39;s and the system. I swear to the authentisity of this story and am prepared to testify to anyone in this reguard. I am certified by Apple, Compaq, Epson, IBM, NEC and toshiba to service thier desktop and laptop PC&#39;s and printers. I have about 15 years experience troubleshooting, maintaining and repairing electro-mechanical equipment including computers, printers and radios.<n>

3/12/97 21:50|Glendale (SSW of)|AZ|Light|over 3 weeks|Stationary object SW of the Phoenix AZ area seen over several nights. Quit appearing after the Mar 13 incident in Phoenix.|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02119.html|154|ndxe199703| Summary : Stationary object SW of the Phoenix AZ area seen over several nights. Quit appearing after the Mar 13 incident in Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over about a two week period I noticed a single light in the sky at about the area of the estrella mountains south west of Phoenix. I thought it odd because I am not aware of any roads or power lines in the Estrella mountains. The light was a yellow light similar in appearance to a low power sodium vapor street light. Observed at about the same angle that the peak of the highest peak of the Estrella mountains would be from my observation point. (I had concluded that because it did not move that somehow someone had installed a street light on top of the Estrella Mtns). I did notice that it would occaisionaly fade out and later reappear in the same spot. This light was last observed on Mar 12 the day before the mutiple lights observed across Arizona. The yellow light description of the multiple lights reminded me of what I had been observing, so I double checked the angles from various reference points where I had observed the light and consistently found that that the locatio!n where I had rembered the light being was further west than where the mountains are located. This would place the light in open sky rather than on one of the peaks.I did observe this light on several different nights at various locations several miles apart. The object&#39;s aparent location was consistantly in the same area which would place it approximatly 20 miles south of Luke Air Force Base or about 20 miles ssw of downtown Glendale at an altitude of about 1000 ft (comparable to the nearby mountain peaks).Despite looking for it, this light has not re-appeared since the major event of lights here in AZ<n>

We lived in South Marysburg, near the community of Black River, in Prince Edward County, Ontario(Canada) on the north shore of Lake Ontario. Our home overlooked Prince Edward Bay to the south and the spectacle witnessed appeared in the eastern sky above Waupoos Island and beyond over Lake Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange/gold lights, brighter and much larger than the brightest, largest object in the sky at the time seemed to priodically wink in and out, each lasting at least five minutes, varying from 9 to 12 at a time. They seemed toform discernable geometric patterns appearing simultaneously as triangles, diamonds, crosses and other shapes. When a shape would emerge they would hold very still for great lengths of time, not moving but seeming to fade in and out to form new patterns. There was absolutely no movement, no sounds, no smoke and through binoculars no method of suspension or delivery as detected. After about 20 minutes, with my entire family outside watching all this we decided to go next door and alert the neighbors, an elderly couple. From the waterfront vantage point of their deck we all watched in amazement for a good houe trying to make sense of it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With all the attention poised towards the east, we hadn&#39;t noticed until I glanced south towards the bay that an object was clearly hovering close to the surface of the water about halfway across the bay, aprox. 3/4 kilometre. It was too dark and the glare of its lights too bright to make out any shape but it appeared as a red and white flashing light group like the grouping of lights on top of a police car. It remained there until the orange/gold lights stopped appearing and then it simply vanished. The whole event lasted about two and a half hours and when it was over I got into my car and drove to the opposite side of the bay exactly where a police cruiser would have to be parked to provide the red and white flashing lights. There was no indication of a vehicle disturbing the vegetation any where in the area. I returned the next morning and still found nothing. We waited for the news to appear about the sighting by other witnesses but never heard a thing about it until much later when we heard about the phoenix lights which apparently happened about the same time as the ones we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned it to a senior member of the local Ontario Provincial Police and he said no cruiser was out there that night and no reports were made about the event. However someone did confide to me that they had witnessed the very same thing twenty years earlier off the south coast of our county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

AT 8:40 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 24 hours before the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; sighting(s)in Arizona, my next door neighbor and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of my home located in Northwest Las Vegas, Nevada on March 12,1997 at about 8:40 pm (20:40),when I glanced up(looking WNW) at the Spring Mountain area and saw a huge formation of off white or yellowish lights in a relaxed V or chevron shape gliding (ENE)directly towards and ultimately over our position!  I asked my neighbor if she was seeing what I was seeing and she confirmed same.  This formation of &#34;lights&#34; was very low (estimate slightly higher than local air traffic), and VERY wide (estimate 1.5 miles wide as I scanned the object) Our major intersections are approximately 1 mile apart, and I am located between Cheyenne and Craig Road off of Alexander, so the apparent width was fairly easy to guesstimate. This formation of a dozen or more lights didn&#39;t appear to have substance in between the lights, because as it slowly and silently moved directly over us we could see the night sky (stars) in between the lights of the formation. The sighting lasted probably 4 minutes.  I wanted to run in the house to grab my camera, but we were both kind of frozen on the spot watching this event. The formation of lights glided silently overhead towards the location of Nellis Air Force Base approximatey 16 miles ENE of our position.  As soon as the object? was out of sight my neighbor, (65 year old female) and I parted. I ran in the house and told my husband. I called Nellis Air Force Base to report what I&#39;d seen, and the Airman on the other end didn&#39;t seem very interested and said he was &#34;in the basement, and probably couldn&#39;t see much anyway&#34;!  He suggested I contact your UFO Reporting Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also called KLAS TV Channel 8, and they were pretty vague, with no other calls at that time.  24 hours later the Phoenix lights stole the show in my neighboring state of Arizona!  I heard the hoopla on the Art Bell show March 13th as well.  I have tuned into his show since 1984 when he first started on the AM station in Las Vegas.  I did call Mr.Davenport about this sighting, and he asked me to write a letter documenting what my neighbor and I had seen.  I did so, but did not see it in the archives, when I was recently reading through them.  Please know I am not confusing the dates.  My &#34;Las Vegas Lights&#34; sighting 24 hours before &#34;Phoenix&#34; is etched forever in my memory, as March 12th is my brothers birthday, he had just left my home about 2 hours previously.  Did anyone else in Las Vegas see anything the night of March 12, 1997 at about 8:40 pm???

Then the stars would disappear untill the object moved past us and stopped blocking the view of the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The National guard radar did not paint a target they told me, as i called them. but this triangle shaped craft suddenly moved faster than a jet plane as it left our area, and I wonder if there radar could even register that speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was close, real close to us, like 1-200 feet above us, and all black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also no sound either before, during or after the sighting from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It gained enomous speed and curved north and east as it departed in a big hurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have not seen it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later contacted Dr. Stanton Friedman via e-mail and he suggested I report this.

On the evening of March 12, 1997, I went to visit a friend and former neighbor of mine from ODU college. He lived in a one story ranch at the end of Rogers Avenue, in the Glenwood Park section of Norfolk, VA. Glenwood Park is a small rectangular shaped residential neighborhood, approximately 5 blocks by 5 blocks situated inside a residential section of the Norfolk Naval Base. A street level maps shows quite clearly that this neighborhood is surrounded on all sides by what is collectively referred to as the &#34;Norfolk Naval Base&#34; or just NAB by locals. IN clockwise direction, to the South of Glenwood Park is all Navy Housing, to the west is the Norfolk International Terminals, to the North is Norfolk Naval Air Station, one of whose major runs parrallel and just to the north east of Glenwood park about a 2,000 yds away. Also just north east of Glenwood is the home of the US Atlantic Fleet, complete with ballastic and attack submarines, Arleigh Burke class destroyers, and usually a few Aircraft carriers and their support craft. To say that the area I was in was a &#34;military area&#34; is an understatement, for the Hampton Roads Area has over 250,000 active duty personel, which makes this area, in effect, collectively, the largest military base in the country. (USA) At any rate, at approximatley 9pm EST, while flipping through the basletball games of the &#34;March Madeness&#34; basketball season, in which ODU was playing a major game, my friend (Tommy) not his real name, told me his father who lived next door, was having some plumbing problems. I was a plumber at the time for national plumbing company, and told him that I could help his dad out. I didn&#39;t have any buiness cards in my wallet so I walked outside to my service truck which was parked nearby, to get some cards. I dug through my messy paperwork and finally found a few cards and began walking back to my friends house along a 30 foot long path towards a small 3 step concrete porch before entering his door. As I walked along the path, towards my right hand- upper right about 45 degrees from the horizon level, I could see the constellation of Orion with its three stars, AL nitak, Al mintak, and Al- whatever it called, shining very brightly. I could not see the moon, (it was close to a New Moon) the temperature was probably about 40 degrees F and the sky was crystal clear with no clouds visible. Humidity was normal to below normal, and the air was crisp. As I walked The Path, I noticed that &#34;something&#34; was catching my eye and I felt distracted by something. I kept walking, and as I walked I glanced up again at Orion&#39;s Belt. My attention was drawn to the area in between the first star on the left of Orion&#39;s Belt and the star Sirius which is directly to the east of it. I&#39;m not sure why I looked up there...but my my peripheral vision was catching something moving and I strained to see something, but I didn&#39;t know what... So I kept walking up the path and by the time I got to the first step of the porch I looked up again briefly at Orion&#39;s Belt and noticed something odd. As I began to walk up the three steps of the Porch, I kept my eyes fixed on Orion&#39;s Belt. Something had passed in front of the left star of Orion&#39;s Belt blocking out the starlight. &#34;That&#39;s Odd&#34; I said to myslef, because as a Former Civil Air Patrol &#34;spotter&#34;, I have been on many flights in small cessna 152&#39;s and Piper&#39;s and knew from experience that any aircraft in this area of NAB would have to have their FAA approved Anti-Collision Lights on at night. Moreover, I also knew from experience that any craft traveling at night, over a military Terminal Control Area (TCA) wihtout lights on, near the final approach vector of its major East-West...would certainly lose his license to fly...in a heartbeat.. Intrigued, I paused at the top step of the porch to wait and see if this idiot pilot would turn on his running lights. I waited for the white random flash in the middle if the craft with red on left (port side) and green on right side (starboard) indicating its presence in the nights sky. Just as soon as that thought passed in my head, I saw the middle star of Orion&#39;s belt blink out, as if the craft had passed in front of it...passing as it were from the left of Orion&#39;s belt straight across and in front of the middle star of Orion&#39;s Belt and the then on to pass in front of the third star on the right...blinked out...all in succession....like One-Thousand, Two- Thousand, Three- Thousand. &#34;This guy&#39;s screwed&#34; I say to myslef thinking of how much trouble he&#39;s in, (or she, not to offend any woman pilots) when my eyes adjust enough so that I can now see that the dark object is some kind of huge flying wing or boomerang shaped object. &#34;A B-2 Bomber!&#34; I say to myself? Then I say, there aren&#39;t any B-2&#39;s stationed here? Just as my eyes were able to focus on the craft (with no lights on it whatsoever) It initiated some type of maneuver and I lost it for a few seconds. I took this moment to look at my watch...and as far as I can remember it was 9:08:00 pm EST. From that point on my recollection of how time passes is very bad. I lost the craft for anywhere from 3 seconds to maybe as much as 20 seconds....I&#39;m not real sure. When I first saw the craft, as it passed in front of Orions belt stars, it was approxiamtely 3-4 inches, wingtip to wintip as measured from my face to my outstretched index finger. The shape of the craft was a &#34;boomerang configuration&#34;. Some might call this a &#34;chevron&#34; configuration...but I think that describes something more like a carpenters square than what I saw...the bend in the middle, the Dihedral, was only about 5 or ten degrees maximum, meaning that the boomerang shape was only slightly bent in the middle, not 90, or 45 degrees, but much less. Ok, so when I first saw this thing, I had absolutely nothing to gage its height by. I automatically assumed that it was a B-2, not just because its shape resembled a &#34;Flying Wiing&#34; but because I couldn&#39;t hear any engines. So I assumed that it had to be a B-2..... As I was pondering all this in the brief period when I &#34;lost&#34; it against the night sky, I got the overall sensation that it was performing some sort of &#34;maneuver&#34;, another thought popped into my head... I thought to myslef, &#34;Maybe it&#39;s the Navy Seals!&#34;. Yeah that&#39;s it, it&#39;s the Navy seals on a hang glider on a stealth mission...like that scene from &#34;Escape from New York&#34; and I thought to myself &#34;they are training for a mock take-down of NAB! this is cool, I &#39;m gonna watch this! Just as I had convinced myself that this thing was not a B-2 and had to be a hang glider, because there was no sound, I noticed something coming over the treetops to my left hand side. (southwest). My dad was in the Army and I remember him always telling that if you want the best visual acuity at night, you don&#39;t look directly at an object, you constantly move your focus &#34;around&#34; whatever object your trying to look at, this keeps your rods and cones replenished. The reason for this added detail is because, I got the impression that the craft made some type of maneuver to fall from its original position which had to be 6-10 angels high. It moved so fast that I totally lost it from my vision, even though I was looking right at it...I didn&#39;t pick it up again until it was about 20 feet above treetop level and about 100-150 yards away! What I&#39;m trying to say is that I don&#39;t know whether this craft &#34;fell&#34; from its first position or &#34;dematerialized&#34; and then rematerialized over the treetops...because as I was trying to explain before...I changed my viewing from looking directly at it to focusing around it and it just sort of &#34;materialized&#34;...I don&#39;t know if it was because of the way I changed my focus on it (night Vision) or if it really did &#34;Demateraialize&#34; and then &#34;Rematerialize&#34;, but my gut feeling at the time was that it did some type of rapid circling maneuver, like when you took the seed pods of maple trees and threw them in the air, we called them, &#34;helocopters&#34; and played with them, they would fall and spin on a central axis while spinning rapidly...I am aware of the brains ability to &#34;fill-in&#34; areas where it does note have enough data to form an opinion, I call it projection, I&#39;m sure some psychologist out there has a name for it. It may have done both or just did a super tight, super fast, &#34;helicopter&#34; maneveur, I&#39;m just not sure. Having flown right seat in cessnas and pipers and having flown hang gliders at Kitty Hawk quite a few times, this intrigued me, because if it was a hang glider, it would explain why it was so silent, but there is no way a hang glider can drop 6000 feet in just a few seconds, without having a catostrophic failure! Hang gliders can drop very fast and silently, but their center of gravity is such that it always seeks the horizon, I just can&#39;t imagine a hang glider going straight down like that, unless it had a catastrophic failure, but these thoughts were all muted in a few seconds as It grew closer... So after it made this falling maneuver, it was now situated approximately 200-300 yards away to my left, at about 200 ft ASL or just above treetop level. The craft is moving quite slow now and I am just starting to get a glimpse of its shape, which has changed, not because it actually changed shape, but just because I was now looking at would have been it&#39;s right &#34;wing tip&#34; from a position that was in front of and to the right and below the craft. Now the craft, instead of &#34;appearing&#34; like a boomerang, now looks like.... A saucer? I say to myself? No how the hell it went from Boomerang to Saucer shape was beyond me.... AS it grew closer to my position I could see that it had some type of dome shape on the bottom of the side I was looking at. (At the exact time of this angle of view from my perspective I thought it looked like some sort of Dome or oblong shaped Craft...) Ok now I&#39;m standing at the End of Rogers Ave which runs nearly exactly East West and I am at its most Eastern part. The Craft is travelling From due south to North, without any deviation, except for whatever maneveur it made to fall in height. It was just as if I was on a parade stand and this craft falls from the sky and silently floats in front of me going from my left view to my right and out of sight.... But at this time the UFO is now directly in front of me. Rogers Ave is about 5 blocks or approx 2000ft long and lined with yellowish High Pressure Sodium Streetlights. Rogers ave, from my position is exactly perpendicular to me, meaning that it is forming a right angle 90 degrees from my viewpoint. To be more descriptive draw an upside down T and I am at the position of where the Bottom and top of the T intersect, looking down the vertical part of the T. Also important to remember is that this was March and the trees that year hadn&#39;t quite bloomed yet, and there were many trees in the nieghborhood and along Rogers ave, so at times during the sighting, the craft was behind the branches. In my original report to MUFON VA I said I thought it had some type of antenna on top of it, but after going back to the sight a year later at the same date, I quite clearly mistook the branches for an antenna. As it got to a point where it seemed to hover over the streetlights I was looking at the craft directly through it&#39;s right side. From this perspective it actually appeared to be classic Saucer shape with a rectangular body, with smooth corners and dome on the bottom! But just as my brain was trying to tell me it was a Sacucer, I noticed that the craft seemed to slow down and seemed to almost stop, directly above the streetlights. As it did slow down the right tip seemed to dip down a little as the left tip seemed to yaw to the right, like a conventional plane would do in a turn, but the difference is this thing was nearly at a hover, less than a stone&#39;s thro away trtavleing at most 1-5 mph....I knew it wasn&#39;t a hang glider or B-2 or anythign like that at all... Right around this moment I noticed that I could &#34;feel&#34; a very low frequency hum, a frequency that sounds much like an eighteen wheel truck in the distance on a deserted hwy, the way you hear it is like a long drawn out huuuuummmmm.....huuuuuuummmmmt. The biggest difference is that I seemed to &#34;feel&#34; this not necessarily &#34;hear&#34; it. Realizing that this was an extraordinary event, I tried to shout out my friends name who was only 20 feet from me through that door...but only a whisper seemed to come out....thinking I had lost my nerve I took a quick breath and shouted again....but nothing came out.....in a panic, I took a really deep breath and exhaled a shout that my mother could have heard 600 miles away....I felt my lungs contract, my throat muscles contract, my tongue moving and breath exhaling....but not a whisper came out! Truly terrified now, I just stood there transfixed on the craft as it seemed to hover over the streetlights and as it did so its right front and right bottom wingtip had the amber colored lights off the HPS streetlights illuminating it. It was at this point that its shape and form were very clear and defined. From my perspective the craft appeared to be approximately 30 or 40 feet from front to back. About 20-30 feet high and ...well at that time I hadn&#39;t seen it from any perspective that I could gage its length-wing-tip to wing-tip yet. It most definately had a dome about 15-20 feet wide which protruded down from under its right wing-tip about 5 feet at most. I could also see the outline of another dome on the left under belly of the left wingtip. The right front or leading edge of the wingtip was essentially a vertical surface as was the rear leading edge, but I don&#39;t want to confuse the reader into thinking that this craft actually had any laminar flow. The top and bottom edges of the craft were rounded like the Quarter round mold on your floor. In general it was an immense rectangular cross section, boomerang shaped craft with rounded smooth radius edges with no other protrusions or lights or windows or whatever, just perfectly smooth as if it had been injection molded out of a high temperature ceramic composite. The color of the craft resembled what I would best describe as a Black-Bluish. It blended so well with the night sky it was almost impossible to see unless you were looking right at it. You probably could have been sitting right under it, looking stright up at it and the glare of thelights would totall block your view...you wouldn&#39;t even know it was there! I have a some Engineering experience and I would say that it most likely resembled a Metallic flame spread coating, whereby metal powder is heated and melted in situ as it is applied to a substrate. This gave the skin of the craft a texture which made it appear from a distance to almost be pourous, like a lava rock or something of that sort but much smoother. It fit in with the sky so well that I think you could have been driving right under this thing and if you werent looking directly at it, you would go right by.... Of course by this time it was apperent that it was not any type of &#34;Air&#34; craft. The &#34;wings&#34; were 20 feet thick, there was no chance for the wings to produce any laminar flow whatsoever and without laminar flow and the Bernoulli principle, you can&#39;t produce lift, there were no jet engines, no jet exhaust hitting the trees and moving branches, nothing at all just that all invasive humming. After it did its little slow down and tilt, it then seemed to regain its bearing and slowly began to move a little faster and straighten out its flight path continuuing on its northward path and gently, quietly passing over the homes in that area before I lost it over the horizon. But this was probably the most awe inspiring thing of the whole event for me, because now I had a third perspective from which to gage its true wing tip to wing tip size or length....and I was completely dumbfounded by what I saw.... Before my eyes was a craft that had to be no less 800 feet from wingtip to wingtip. To give the reader some perspective of it&#39;s shear size, a 747 looking at it head on is about 187 to 200 feet in length, so if you took 3- 747&#39;s and laid them tip to tip they still wouldn&#39;t be long enough to match the size of this thing. It was so long that I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on one part of the craft and still be able to see the rest of it....from 2000 yards away! I actually had to move my whole head to scan its size from left tip to the middle and then all the way back over to the right where a tree got in the way! One side of the craft was on the right side of tree and the left part on the left side of tree with 20 feet of branches in between! One more thing, on the back of the craft there was some sort of &#34;line&#34; which ran parallel to the body of the craft. In other words it looked like a rectangle within a rectangle. In retrospect it must have been a protrusion of a few feet out because it was passing over a huge playing field and the lights which illuminated it were now coming from an angle which would could only have made the shadow line I saw if something was protoding as opposed to recess within the crafts structure. Also when viewing craft from the rear, I could see that there were three domes on the bottom of the craft, one on each tip and one in the middle. The next day I searched every paper and news item...but I heard nothing. I thought that I was the only person in the world who saw this thing. Then on July 4, 1997 the SCI FI channel did a special on the 50th anniversary of the Roswell crash...and at the end Jonathan Frakes says, &#34;and in Phoenix Az, on March 13, 1997 Strange lights were seen.…&#34; You have no idea how nuts I went, my roomate thought I was losing it...Now here I was, with proof that others saw exactly what I saw, but only they were 1000 miles away and it was the next night! This began a 4 year quest to find out the truth, the disinfomation, and meaning behind my event. I reported my sighting to MUFON....but they weren&#39;t much help at all...I am hoping that posting on this agency will encourage others who know the TRUTH about 3/13 to come forward about this and other sightings in the Hampton Roads Area....I have more information about this sighting for those interested contact Peter Davenport.<n>

Moving GIF scetch included.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I`m a graduate at faculty of mechanical engineering. I underwnt fighter pilot med-exams and have confirmed excellent eye-vision. I`m also very familiar with all types of aircraft, helicopter, other airborne crafts and satellites, their in-flight behavior and day/night identification. I`m also familiar with stars and other astronomical objects that may be observed with naked-eye or binoculars on night-sky. I wrote complete data of every one of series of events right after they happend. Location:  (on the balcony of my house) Hotedrsica, Slovenia Air temperature: little above zero °C Clouds: 0/8 (clear) No sighted air traffic (towards E and SE commercial flights can be observed about 7° over horizon coming into Ljubljana/Brnik airport area) First 1/5 of moon over western horizon (hidden behind house), Hale-Bopp comet behind the nearby hill. Light pollution of sky zero (rural area). Car traffic in vicinity: zero Wind: none Observer in dark area, no lights in field of vision. Event: I was lying on a deck chair looking straight up, covering approx. 80° left and right, 30° down and 70° up from vertical line (legs facing west). After observing stars through binoculars for a while, I decided to proceede naked-eyed. After a while an object appeared from behind the top of the roof of house wherer I was. Size of objcet was approx. 20° times 6°, movement vector 120°, no sound, 15° per second. I tracked it over 90° of sky for 6 seconds. Object was composed of numerous lights (approx. 30 of them), at visual magnitude of +6. Flight path of object went through Coma Berenices and Leo. Object was transparent (stars behind it were visible). As said, object came in from the direction of my legs, proceeded through zenith after what I stood up, turned around and watched it egress behind the roof of neighboring house. After this event (after 10 minutes) I observed 4 satellites in 2 minutes time. Picture at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www((URL deleted))&#34;&gt;My Page&lt;/a&gt; Duration:  Approx. 6 seconds Appearance: Object transparent, composed of many lights, generally simetrical left/right with slight annomalies (light positions), arrow-headed with very small leading-edge sweep angle. Besides lights (star-sized) no other visible parts. Nor the object neither the lights left no smoke/fire trails. During movement the shape of object remains unchanged (position of lights), heading and speed also. Light color: white, (none of them is blinking, all the same intensity) No sound during the observation. In fact, no ambient sounds at all, 15 mins before till an hour later. Angular size of object:  approx. 20° x 6° Angular velocity: approx. 15°/sec. Conclusions: Due to slow movement, no sound, transparent appearance, formed of approx. 30 star-sized lights of equal intensity in roughy wedge formation (bird-like formation) simmetrically positioned in general, I assume I saw a very large formation of smaller crafts (indefinable shape) flying at very high altitudes or even in orbit. (It is out of the question that the event could be one craft at very low altitude) Later comments:  I read in a paper that there was a scramble alert in USAFB Aviano, Italy (which is located at 300° 80nm from sighting location) on the 11th of March 1997 due to a wave of UFO sightings over the base. I don`t know if the news is valid, but I seek explanation of this and my further two sightings in it.

The event, as yet unexplained, shook a surface area 80 miles n/s and 100 miles e/w.  Military installations in the area deny supersonic flight by any of their craft, and, at least on this occasion, they should be believed. This was no ordinary jet boom.  In mid New Orleans, people went into the streets to look for signs of the explosion.  The next day, newspapers reported the event, but, now, 5 days later, no explanation for the occurrence has been offered.I can send newpaper clipping if needed.  I would need a fax number<n>

Last year I saw in Canada an account on &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34; which I taped to show my wife and our friend who was visiting us when the TWO INCIDENTS which the three of us saw on MARCH 12 and 13.  I just reviewed your database and see that one entry is for the 12th. OBSERVATION: Usually every night I take a &#34;walked around the block&#34;, a couple or three laps around the our mobile home south of Florence, Az. Mar. 12:  probably around 8:00 p.m, perhaps 8:30pm (between TV shows) I did my laps and noticed the a band of lights to the west where we can see the glow of Phoenix lights.  Unlike what was seen the next evening, there were gaps in the display.  From our perspective the lights were in one line dipping to the north, higher at the south end.  The lights were white BUT there were gaps between them;  as best as I can recall there may have been 5 or 6 displaying a pattern but with gaps in the pattern, such as #1 was on, #2 wasn&#39;t, but #&#39;s 3 and 4 were and #5 may have beeen of while #6 was light.  Anyway I called out my wife and our friend to see them, and I speculated that perhaps these were flares from night jumping;  (the Coolidge airport where paratroopers have done night jumping is in line with the Phoenix air port, in fact, we are on the flight path for aircraft approaching Sky Harbor from the east or south east. I just can&#39;t remember if I took my binoculars out but I believe I did.  What surprised was that there seemed to be not perceptible downward movement yet this the fact that I jumped to the conclusion that the north end was lowest fit in with my idea that the first flare would be lower than the last flare dropped. March 13:  Again I saw the lights about the same time and again no perceptible downward movement BUT as been widely reported, this time there where no gaps in the lights--which to me meant that none of the flares were duds. I am really surprised that perhaps only one observation was make for the evening before since while there were fewer lights each one had the same intensity.<n>

One morning as I stepped outside to a clear blue sky my attention was drawn toward the sky to something I&#39;d never seen before.  Above the Holloman Air Force Base runway at an unknown height was an abnormal contrail.  It was not the usual long straight contrail but a single consistent contrail that looped in a tight group.  It looped in not only tight radiuses but also sharp right turns! It may have been weeks or even months from the above incident when an Albuquerque news broadcast showed a picture taken of an abnormal contrail over Kirkland AFB over 100 miles away from Holloman.  The report was made public after people swamped the news network with calls.  The news reported that they had contacted the local Air Force Base and questioned the contrails in the sky.  The Air Force responded that they were not created by military aircraft but gave no other explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The contrails on the television were very similar to those I had seen in the past.  If that was not surprising enough, as I stepped outside that same morning, in the sky over Holloman AFB was the same type of contrail as shown on the news broadcast over 100 miles away??<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked up at the full moon behind the thickening layer of clouds. It glowed beatifully in a halo of mist. As I was admiring the view I suddenly noticed a strange point of light &#34;wandering&#34; around the sky at extremely high speed. It crossed my field of view in under 2 seconds. Because I could see a slight halo effect around the light I decided that it must be either inside or above the cloud layer. This would mean that its altitude was above 20,000 feet. The light was extremely small yet intensely bright. It was yellow or gold in color. The point had some dimensionality---it appeared to be a tiny sphere or oval---it definitely had some ball-like shape to it. After zig-zaging around the sky, making sudden turns and traveling in wild arcs, it vanished. The whole process took only about 2 seconds. I watched the sky for about 10 more minutes. During that time I witnessed 4 more lights appear, zig-zag at extremely high speed, and then dissappear. I could hardly believe my eyes. I was so entranced, I didn&#39;t think to ask any passers by to look at it and confirm what I was seeing. At one point two of the lights were in the sky at the same time, flying in very different erratic paths, almost as if they were dogfighting. All the other lights appeared in sequence, only 1 at a time. In each case, they seemed to appear from about the same point in the sky and then follow roughly the same erratic flight path and then vanish at approximately the same area in the sky. I could not tell if they were simply turning off or going behind thick clouds. After about 10 minutes the activity stopped. These lights were so small and fast that they were hard to catch even if one was looking up, so I wonder if anyone else saw them. A number of commercial jets were coming in or taking off from area runways during this event and they were quite clearly different in both appearance, sound, and behavior from the lights I witnessed. For one thing, the lights were single points of light and seemed to be far above the clouds, and moved much much faster than any of the jets (or any jet I&#39;ve ever seen for that matter). The lights did not flash or change color, although there was a slight flicker to them as they moved. It almost appeared as if something was literally skipping along the upper atmosphere. I considered the possibility that it might be some sort of debris burning up, but no debris can change direction or travel in series of loops, arcs and sudden right-angle turns, as these lights did.<n>

3/10/97 10:30|Alpharetta|GA|Triangle|hour|Boomerang UFO sits on barn|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17224.html|169|ndxe199703| Boomerang UFO sits on barn<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was made by ISUR.  I would like to add additional info. that was not listed.  When first seeing the moving lights(several in the trees next to barn about 100ft away from me) I thought it was helicopters, but there was no sound. After opening the gate, I looked up the balls of light morphasized into a boomerang shaped craft and was sitting on top of my barn with wings overlapping both sides of the barn(150 ft wide)and just 15 ft above my head.  It was of unusual texture, almost like a shark, did not reflect light and was boomerang in shape. I was not afraid at all. The really strange part of the story was after opening the gate for my husband to drive in.(He always waits for me to close gate and get back in the car)This time he drove right passed me and did not stop. Somehow I got to the entrance of the barn before he did and was there when he got out of the car.(I can not get this point off of my mind and I wonder if we were abducted) There did seem to be some time lapse of 30 to 45 minutes.   We both watched the UFO disappear over the barn. It seemed to go invisable and we could see stars through it. Over a year later we were informed by ISUR that a neighbor(in his seventies) had seen so many lights over and around our barn that he had bought a Video Camero in hopes of video taping the lights.  This makes over 5 people other that my husband and myself that had seen ufo type objects over our farm. The following is the case study by ISUR At approx. 11:30 pm on a weekday evening during the first week of March 1997 (*there is some uncertainty as to the exact day), Mr. and Mrs. Doe (pseudonyms) were returning to their home, located east of the city of Canton, in unincorporated Cherokee County GA. The Does run a horse farm, utilizing a large industrial-type building (which they call a&#34;barn&#34;) located some 200-300 feet off the highway. As they got up to the fence gate at the end of the driveway, Mrs. Doe noticed a large, lighted object up above and to the right, above some very tall pine trees. From the car, both witnesses then observed the object begin to descend, moving toward a position above their barn, in a series of jerky, stop-and-go motions. Mrs.Doe got out of the car to open the gate, and both continued to observe the object while Mr. Doe pulled the car forward to the front of the barn. The witnesses state that the object was hovering only a slight distance (perhaps 10-20 feet) above the barn. Meanwhile, Mrs. Doe walked forward to a point at the corner of the building, where she could clearly see the object directly above her. About the time Mr. Doe got out of the car, the object vanished. The two are not sure whether the disappearance was by &#34;blinking off like a lightbulb&#34; (Mr. Doe&#39; impression), or by near-instantaneous acceleration and flying away (Mrs. Doe&#39;s impression). Total time of the sighting was estimated, with difficulty, as 3-5 minutes. The object was described as triangular or boomerang-shaped, and very dark, &#34;darker than shadow,&#34; &#34;darker than black.&#34; There was one &#34;dull red&#34; light at each (side) end of the object, while the other corner was unlit. It appeared to be as wide as the building (approximately 120 feet). Mr. Doe said that the area between the &#34;arms&#34; of the &#34;V&#34; was difficult to see and may have been either solid (making it a triangle) or not really filled in (making it more like a boomerang shape). Finally, even though the farm houses about 50 horses as well as geese, cats and dogs, both witnesses noted a total, complete silence throughout the event, a silence the witnesses felt was very strange. Mrs. Doe states that she was not going to report the sighting until a property developer working on a nearby parcel of land came to her home, introduced himself, and said that some men working for him had seen a football-field-sized object above the Doe&#39;s property. After the encounter described here, Mrs. Doe then found ISUR&#39;s website. An onsite interview and walk-through was conducted by ISUR investigator  and myself on 6/12/97. The two witness&#39; accounts matched up well, although not perfectly, which does not support the idea of a preplanned deception. Mr. Doe could not verify his wife&#39;s first impression of a more-lighted object when she initially saw it, although he says that from the drivers&#39; seat he was not in position to see it well. Driving onto the driveway at a later time, I judged that this makes sense; and also, I noted that the driveway lacks enough angle to put a car&#39;s headlights up enough to have struck an object hovering above the barn, so there is no logical discrepancy there. Mr. Doe is an amateur astronomer and states that he is very familiar with the night sky, and had recently spent considerable time viewing comet Hale-Bopp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Doe&#34; appear to be pseudonyms.

Hale-Bopp comet behind the horizon for almost an hour. Light pollution of sky minimal. Car traffic in vicinity: 2/min Observer in dark area, no lights in field of vision. Event: After the event that occured the day before, I observed southern skies approx. half an hour, naked eyed. I just wanted to go inside when a dark object flew over the town of Ilirska Bistrica, paralel to the valley in which the town is located (ie vector 150° ). I observed object at elevation of 20°, angular size 3.5°. Picture at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.((website deleted)) Presumed craft shape: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.((website deleted))&gt; Duration:  Approx. 1.5 second Appearance:  Object flew in the direction of 150°, straight. I started to observe it when it appeared from behind the roof of our house and stopped when it disappeared in light-polluted air low over the horizon. The observed flight path was 20° angular size. The main part of the object was dark, you could not tell what shape it was, you just noticed that your view at the background stars was blocked by something moving and black. At the end of this black mass, there were 4 white lights (I`d say they were about at visual magnitude 4 or 5), at equal distances in a line. Between every two strong lights there was a weak light, not the half way in between, but a little up and right. Those weaker lights were also at equal distances and in a line, that was paralel to the line of the strong lights. From the direction of motion, paralel movement of all lights in that direction and the perspective changes, I can tell by feeling that the object was close and low over the town. I`d put its route over the local factory. And by the movement through the air, you could just tell that the two lines of lights are perpendicular to flight path. After it passed by, I heard a one second long weak buzzing noise. Like the sound of tyres rolling but buzzing and much more quiet than car tyres. The sound pitch was lowering as the object egressed, like the doppler effect. Angular size of object:  approx. 3.5° Angular velocity: approx. 7°/sec. My conclusions:  The four strong lights were at equal distances and always in the line, at their fixed positions. No smoke trails behind. If they were parts of a meteor broken by Earth`s tidal forces, they would go apart, they`d be much more close together, their light intensity would change and they would leave smoke trails (I`ve seen a few meteor break-ups, and I know how they look like). The weaker lights were also at equal distances and formed in a line that was paralel to the line of the stronger lights, but they were located a little to the right and up from the strong ones. I don`t know about the size of the object. If I assume it was about 20m wide, then the 3.5° angular width would give it the distance of 320m. That would go together with that feeling of mine plus the sound did not come to me immediately, but with approx. one second delay. So, that would put the object over the factory 300 meters away at about 150 meters above ground level. Assumptions. Later comments:  I read in a paper that there was a scramble alert in USAFB Aviano, Italy (which is located at 300° 80nm from sighting location) on the 11th of March 1997 due to a wave of UFO sightings over the base. I don`t know if the news is valid, but I seek explanation of this and my further two sightings in it. Added in November 1997.<n>

Hale-Bopp comet behind the horizon. Light pollution of sky minimal. Car traffic in vicinity: zero (exclusion of probable mid-air-haze light reflection) Observer in dark area, no lights in field of vision. Event: After observing eastern night skies 20 minutes (Boo,UMa,Cas,Ceph) I went inside to get my binoculars in order to observe unclear stars between Leo and Ursa Major. After that I observed that area naked-eyed in MTI technique (Moving Target Indication - I use that radar-mode expression to explain a wide-angled background-fixed observation which enables to detect slight movements of faint objects in large field of vision). After a few tens of seconds I detected a movement of a very faint object above Coma Berenices, too faint to lock a naked eye on. Convinced it`s a satellite (because of its initial south-north polar movement) I checked it through binoculars (from now on observing through binoculars). In this second (from detection till the start of observation) the luminosity of object increased greatly. It grew in size from a dot to a dash-shaped object oriented perpendicular to its flight path. I know that angle of attack of a craft in orbit is of no importance, so in the next second I thought &#34;it`s a sattelite flying sideways&#34;. But then the dash started to rotate around my line-of-sight changing its direction fast towards east. Instead of travelling through UMa towards Cas (initial flight path would send it through zenith), I followed it through Bootes, Hercules to Cepheus (it lowered to the eastern horizon and then away towards north). Object was changing its bearing around 60° to left and right of its general way (right-left-right turn duration approx. 3 seconds). After it passed through Hercules, size and brightness of object started decreasing, and in the vicinity of Cepheus disappeared quickly. Picture at: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Starship/6070/Stores/09-03-1997_0005_HRS.gif&#34;&gt;My Page&lt;/a&gt; Duration:  Approx. 1 minute Appearance:  Object was all-light, no visible hard parts, light could not be separated into series of lights. Light color: pale yellow (yellow-white), hat shaped with ratio width:depth = 5:1 Brightness (comparing to other stars): zero or less magnitude. Object was rotating and turning (R-L-R turn time approx 3 sec), flying perpendicular to its flight path. It did not have left-red and right-green lights, no blinking lights. At the end of observation brightness and size of object rapidly fell to zero. Even after 1 minute no sound could be heard from that direction (normally aircraft over eastern horizon are audible in night-time). Angular size of object (no binoculars):  approx. 0.1° Angular velocity: not known. My conclusions:  Object behaved like no to me known aircraft. Due to hat-shaped object (with narrower end of &#34;hat&#34; trailing, hat oriented perpendicular to FP) of pale yellow color, I conclude the light was propulsion. Besides &#34;propulsion&#34; nothing could be seen. Due to knot known size of object and not very accurate angular size, distance to object and its velocity could not be determined.

One evening while driving westbound on I-40 through Arizona with my wife by my side and two other trucks (one with husband and wife team, the other a solo driver) driving together and staying in communication with each other via CB radios.  I noticed the glow of lights on the horizon as the sun had set. I didn&#39;t think anything of them at first as I chocked them up to street lights.  Three of the lights however did catch my attention, then my wifes, then the others behind us.  They seemed different than the other lights as they seemed liquid ( they didn&#39;t share the glare that the other lights had) and they seemed to be moving in our direction between the interstate and the parallel mountain range on the northern side ( to our right).  They looked like a triangle in shape (considering the angle as it approached).  I used the CB to communicate with the others and they concurred that we were all seeing the same object. As! they got closer, the size became more apparent.  There was a mountain about 3/4 of a mile to the north of the hiway.  The forward light (front) was directly over the mountain, the left over the hiway, and the right now out of view as the mountain became dwarfed in the foreground.  We all pulled to the shoulder of the hiway as we noticed that 3-4 cars on the Eastbound side had pulled over and were standing in the hiway.  We did the same. We looked up at a huge triangular object that made no sound as it hovered on by darkening the sky from the stars.  Then in an instant, shot south toward Phoenix without creating a slight breaze. It has been a life changer for all of us.

It was appoximatly 7:00 pm, I was standing out by a farm building when all of a sudden a glowing object saucer shaped object with a triangular protrusion from either side caught my eye. It was about 25 degrees above the horizon to the west. The object stayed stationary. At the time I did not think terribly much of it because I had only just arrived in Tacoma from Auckland so I was rather tired. I was not until a day or to later that I had a think about what I had seen. I refrained from telling anyone about my experience for several years. I do except the fact that it could of been one of many human or natural phenomonon. McChord AFB is also in the area, I do not beleive it was an aircraft from there because McChord only operates C-141 and C-17 transport aircraft.

The movements were smooth and not jerky or bobbing (like balloonswould do) then sped off to the south faster than any wind might propell them.  I waswishing I had a pair of binoculars as they grew smaller above a building to the south.When I first saw them circling each other it appeared almost as if they were linked bya tether since they moved in tandem, but then when their path became straight they seemedto be at a greater distance appart than if this were the case.  Strangely, a dark heli-copter was circling the area directly above the closest approach of the objects at the time.It performed a pretty tight loop that seemed to focus on the area and was quite low as well.I looked up at it only two or three times and didn&#39;t notice any markings.  It didn&#39;t strikeme as a traffic helicopter and was in the wrong location if it were so if they were doingtheir job.  After the sighting I pondered whether what I saw were ballons, but this possibilityjust didn&#39;t seem to fit.  I didn&#39;t notice any wind that could account for it and the windusually comes from the west off the coast.  These objects flew from north to south.  Asmentioned in the abreviated report, the first two objects were followed by two more on thesame path, but without any circling maneuvers.<n>
3/5/97 14:00|Phoenix|AZ|Chevron|60 minutes|V-shaped craft observed flying east over Phoenix.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16322.html|183|ndxe199703| V-shaped craft observed flying east over Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a clear sunny day I observed what looked like a V-shaped silver craft approach Phoenix, Arizona, directly from the west. I watched it cross the &#34;valley of the sun&#34; for an hour. At the time I was at work. My desk was next to a window on the second floor of a building that was situated on the side of South Mountain. From my vantage point I could see the entire valley for 20 miles in every direction except south. I could also see dozens of aircraft approach or depart Sky Harbor airport all day long. When I first saw the V-shaped silver craft approach from the west, I at first thought that it was a specially designed aircraft coming into Sky Harbor. I pointed it out to a co-worker and asked him what he thought it was. He didn&#39;t know. Strangely, as the craft neared Sky Harbor, it veered to the north and skirted the airport. Both my co-worker and myself wondered out loud about the craft and where it was going. Fortunately, as the craft continued to fly due east it got closer to us. It completely bypassed the airport and continued east. Though we couldn&#39;t make out details, we noticed that the V-shape of the craft began to change and warp. We then realized that we were probably witnessing a flock of silver-backed ducks. They eventually disappeared out of sight still heading east. I only mention this because it may have a bearing on the V-shaped silver craft that was witnessed at night flying over Phoenix just a week later. I did not see the night sightings because I was in bed, since I had to work an early shift. Though I had seen ducks in flight, I puzzled over why they were heading east. After all, this is a desert, and most migratory birds fly north and south. A week later I found my answer. Thirty miles due east of Phoenix there&#39;s a town called Fountain Hills. In the middle of this desert community there&#39;s a huge man-made lake. In the middle of this lake lies the world&#39;s tallest fountain. I drove out there. Once I got to the lake, there were hundreds of ducks, all species. Brown, black, white -- and sil! ver. I c annot confirm that the V-shaped craft many people witnessed that one night in March, 1997, was a flock of ducks -- but it&#39;s the truth that I saw them migrating during the day just a week prior. My experience might help provide a logical answer to why the V-shaped craft proceeded over Phoenix at such as slow rate of speed. Most people usually report UFO&#39;s flying at a high rate of speed. By the way, the V-shaped craft, if I recall correctly, was also flying east. I know that this explanation might prove disappointing to UFO enthusiasts, but not all UFO&#39;s are alien. Some are of earthly origin provided by mother nature herself.<n>

3/3/97 02:00|Dublin|OH|Triangle|3-5 minutes|Up Close and Personal Triangle UFO sighting in Dublin, Ohio|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74907.html|186|ndxe199703| Up Close and Personal Triangle UFO sighting in Dublin, Ohio<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, let me state that until you actually see an ufo, you can definately be skeptical.  For those that have seen something spectacular, like what I&#39;m about to describe, it can be a particularly tedious burden.  Even your best friends and family that you trust with your life may struggle to comprehend and accept it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad and I were standing by a lake behind our apartment in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio.  I was about 25.  My Dad would have been about 48.  It was late, very late.  Clear night.  Dark.  But, even though it was about 2-3AM and dark, there&#39;s a glow from all the lights in the area, which almost makes the dark night a little luminescent...  it&#39;s a little easier to make out stuff against it&#39;s background.  Not as if what we were about to see was difficult to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This wasn&#39;t just a distant group of lights.  This wasn&#39;t one of those sightings that could have been something else.  This was an extremely close-up, almost to the point of being scary sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started as I was looking up at the beautiful night.  I said in total panic/excitement as it approached, &#34;DO YOU SEE THAT, DAD...  TELL ME YOU SEE THAT...&#34;! It was coming across the sky at a fairly slow rate of speed....  maybe about the same rate as a car on a backroad....  about 40mph.  Seemed slower, but I&#39;m guessing that 40 mph looks slower at about 1,500-2000ft.  The excitement was indescribable.  As it flew from the left(going west) it nearly crossed rt above us.  You could easily see the structure of the craft.  It was like a dark black against the lit up gray nt.  It was a perfect triangle with slightly rounders corners.  Just inside the outer rim in each corner, fitting perfectly, there were perfect circle lights.  Subtle lights as in an extremely soft white light bulb.  As it got closer the lights appeared to have movement, possibly circular, almost gasious in appearance.  There was NO sound as this object came to a halt nearly right above us.  Sat hovering still for about 20 seconds, pivoted on an axis about 90-100 degrees, and then flew away in a fashion that is very hard to describe and accept. After pivoting it sta! rted to move south at the earlier slow rate of speed, only this time, within seconds, it accelerated at an astronomical rate.  Going from right over our heads to out of sight in about 2 seconds...  the first second slowly moving... and then out of sight about 1 second later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when the harsh reality sets in.   We both went back inside the apartment(about 60yards away), and pondered what we should do.  Our hearts were still racing.  SHould we call the cops? No Way.  The Paper? No.  It didn&#39;t take long for us to realize that our sighting, as clearly defined and unquestionable as it was to us, would sound crazy.  I think i remembered reading something in the paper, maybe the day after, that talked about multiple sightings of a simliar craft around Bellfountaine, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was something that Dad and I both took extremely serious for a long time.  But, after years of realizing that our little secret was actually better kept that way, it still haunts us in such a profound way that it has literally changed both of our views of religion and science.  What we saw WAS NOT human.  It was NOT built by humans.  It was NOT being flown by humans.  Could NOT have been flown by humans.  Could NOT have been built by humans.  It was unquestionably a craft from another world.  This is information that we have shared less and less as time has passed since the event.   It has changed our very lives, but it&#39;s not something that we bring up very often.  I think we both regret not being able to talk about it more.   We both regret that more people didn&#39;t see what we saw.  I guess for some people there&#39;s sightings that could have been something else.  This sighting was nothing else.  It was exactly what we thought it was.  It will always be.  I should ! feel very priviledged.  Not many people see something like this that is so clear and undeniable.  So unlike how the event comes off when it&#39;s told to anyone else.  Everyone else wants to explain away what we saw - if only they had been there to see there was no explaining away this &#39;ifo&#39;.  That&#39;s the way i refer to it...   because I have identified it as something not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad was a minister of 30 years.  After the event, he stopped preaching and basically dropped religion altogether.  The event had a similiar effect on me as far as religion.  I just want to yell at the skeptics, but you can&#39;t.  If I had a clear tape of the event, and took it to the media, it would probably get dismissed away as &#39;such a great sighting that it couldn&#39;t be real&#39;.  And that&#39;s the sad reality of things when it comes to ufo sightings.  The media and the government have made it so taboo.  It&#39;s crazy.  You&#39;re literally deemed psychotic if you&#39;ve seen one.  We are two very normal people.  No mental health history in our family.  No reason to make up something like this.  I can only imagine that people that actually make up sightings suffer the same fate as people who actually see something out of this world - denial and rejection.   My Dad and I are about as down to earth as anybody.<n>
3/2/97 21:00|Hemet|CA|Triangle|15 min|My friends and I saw 1 very large, triangular shaped UFO, silently hovering approx: 100 ft in air and about 35 ft away from our car.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57977.html|187|ndxe199703| My friends and I saw 1 very large, triangular shaped UFO, silently hovering approx: 100 ft in air and about 35 ft away from our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it has been 10 years since I, along with 2 of my friends, witnessed a triangular shaped aircraft in the sky over an empty field, I recall the details of what we saw quite well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was between 9 and 10 p.m., we were travelling on a remote road west bound out of Hemet, Ca to our friends house in Winchester, Ca. I was in sitting in the back seat, my best friend was sitting in front of me and her husband was driving.  We were driving about 65 mph, when we saw bright lights hovering in the sky up ahead to our right, My friends Husband slowed way down as we approached the object finally coming to a stop.  We stopped the car and we were adjacent to the &#34;UFO&#34;, first I was stuck by the size of it, as this thing was about football field sized in width and length. Then I was struck by the absence of any sound, I mean this thing was absolutely silent, also, the object was hovering, and it was only about 100 -150 feet in the air. The air-craft was black or dark in color, with three very large, bright white lights located at each of the triangle points, and there were several smaller more dim lights on each side, also there was a large red light in the center wich was casting a red glow to the ground directly beneath the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there observing this air-craft for a couple of minutes, when my friends husband said he was going to get out and go get a closer look, my friend and I immediately protested telling him that we had seen enough and begged him to please get us out of there.  Then the thing started moving further away from us slowly to the norththen in what seemed like an instant it was about 1/2 a mile away and had gaind alot of altitude. We drove on to our friends house wich was only a few more minutes away, as we drove I continued to watch the thing in the sky, and even though it was 1/2 mile away or more it was now west bound and adjacent to us. We arrived at our friends house only to find that no one was home so, we left. My girlfriend and I asked her husband to take the main street home, as the continued presence of the &#34;UFO&#34;, was making us very nervous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left heading north first then we turned onto the highway heading east bound, once we were heading east, we could see the &#34;UFO&#34; then futher north now but trailing behind us heading northeast. As we rounded the last bend right before you enter the city limits we lost sight of the triangle shaped &#34;UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years my friends and I have discussed the encounter we had with the &#34;UFO&#34;, we are not really convinced that this was anything extraterrestrial. Since we are not far from March Air Force Base, the possibility of the air-craft being some kind of new technology the armed forces have is very real. On the other hand, an air-craft that size being able to hover at such a low altitude without any sound, nor causing any kind of, (for lack of a better term) &#34;wind&#34;,  seems to be impossible.  Out of all the people I have spoken to about our sighting I have only found two other people who had seen the same thing in this area. In 2003 I watched a program on the Discovery channel and saw that people all over Arizona, had seen the same thing around the same time we had our sighting. Today I watched another Program on TV stating sightings of this same &#34;UFO&#34; all over the world, and so I thought I should also share my experience as well. I hope this information will help in some way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Small rotating object seemed to join large object which decended blow treetops, resembled a formation. a week prior during daylight another object witnessed by 2 people in two different places seen suspended in north sky, very bright, and quiet and floating, not like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The small object with the rotating lights seemed to linger in a general area of the sky and spin around, soon after we saw it, a large object came from the northwest and the small object seemed to disappear, whether it joined the large objectwe don&#39;t know for sure. the large object was very brilliant in the shape of a cross with 4 bright lights accross the back and 3 bright lights up the center (a bottom view), we were traveling north and the large object rapidly disappeared below the treetops to our Southeast.  The week before I and my daughter who was going home from work 10 miles away, saw a shiny cigar or flattened oval shape, very brilliant in the north sky in broad daylight.  I watched it and so did she, it didn&#39;t seem to be going anywhere and didn&#39;t make any noise.  It just sort of drifted in the sky,and appeared quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was in Baraboo heading northeast and I was standing outside my home just looking at it for at least 3 to 5 minutes.<n>

I turn to see what I saw out of the corner of my eye and I caught a glimpse of it, but it sped away. So I figured I was crazy and there was nothing, like a flare or something. Ten minutes later the ball of light followed the same pattern, down from the sky (into my view) and off to the upper right. But what really convinced me was the hovering. Flares don&#39;t hover, but I guess they can be picked up by the wind. I kinda got freaked out, but I ran outside and waited for about 30 minutes and it never came back. I don&#39;t live in a podunk part of Louisville, I live in a well populated area. Anyway I hope that this small encounter helps let somebody else share their close encounter of the thrid kind someday. It didn&#39;t look like a 1950&#39;s disk, so that&#39;s why I ignored it the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We live across the Santa AnaRiver in unincorporated Riverside in an area commonly known as IndianHills.  My wife and I were enjoying a night in our hot tub around 8:30to 9:00 PM and looking up at the evening sky which for our area,although obscured somewhat by city lights, was very good for stargazing. I remember we did not have the jets or pumps on at the time soit was very quiet also.  My wife was looking to the southwestern sky andI was looking to the northwestern sky at the time. All the sudden, atalmost a ten o&#39;clock position, I could see a black but translucent likeobject moving through the sky west to east at a tremendous rate ofspeed. This object seemed to pulsate as it moved. However, it did nothaving any lights or normal jet aircraft type blinkers on it. It wasV-shaped at the front however I could not make anything out at the tailend of the object (whether it was flat, circular or angular).  There wasno noise at all associated with the sighting or any heat exhaust comingout from the rear of the object.

Maybe 3 seconds hadpassed at the most from the time I spotted it till I spoke to my wife&#34;Holy cow honey look at this.&#34;  Obviously she could not see what I wasseeing right away.  I just grabbed her head and put her line of sightover my arm towards the object almost like a gun barrel.  Finally shecould see it at around the the 1 o&#39;clock position.

Almostspeechless.I remember holding my thumb against the sky to see if I could size theobject. My thumb could obsure it but not completely cover it. It wasvery high in the sky but I could not tell exactly how high. We are closeto Ontario Airport but this was not a jet aircraft that I know of.Normally aircraft that we see and hear coming and going from our areaare moving at a rate of speed that you can watch for almost a minute ata time. This thing moved in a matter of seconds from the far west to fareast.  And it pulsated. Not in steady patterns either. Almost quick andjerky at times.  Not like the steady movement like a jet aircraft.How do I know? First of all, I have a good knowledge base aboutaircraft. I have logged over a million air miles in my occupation overthe last 14 years.  I am very good at spotting 727&#39;s to 747&#39;s or DC-9&#39;sto DC-10&#39;s.  I know commercial aircraft. Was this one? No way. Secondly,I also lived near Offut Air Force base in the 70&#39;s and frequently takemy kids to airshows at several airforce bases.  I know how normalmilitary aircraft move through the sky. Was this one? Nothing that Iknow of.My background. I am a sales manager for Fortune 125 company that hasmultiple divisions. Many which supply sophisticated electronic equipmentto the military.  I have an educational background in computers andelectronic journalism. I once installed the equipment that I now sell.I am more like a sales engineer. My daily routine is technical anddetailed.  My reputation involves making reliable and sound informativedecisions, statements, and judgements.Obviously, I am somewhat skeptical.  I have tried to rationalize in mymind what I saw that night.  Maybe that&#39;s what has taken me so long torelay this to you.  The reports in Arizona have finally prompted me totell our story.  I have no video. No pictures. No other evidence.  Onlytwo eyewitnesses that I know of.  My wife and I. But we saw it. Now Ialways look to the night sky differently.<n>

I went back inside and told one of the people i was working with and showed him where i saw it etc. Then later on in the day, i was driving into Salisbury with my mum when all of a sudden in front of us in the sky this triangle appeared again hovering, it stayed there for about 2 seconds, then dropped like a stone and vanished. So all in all, myself, my friend and my mum saw it. I still have no idea to this day what it was, the thing that intruiged me the most was when i went into work the following day the guy i had told about it the previous day he came up to me and said &#34;you know that thing you saw yesterday?&#34; and i said &#34;yea&#34; and he said &#34;you didn&#39;t see it&#34; and that was it. Since then i have wondered A - what it was, and B - what that guy found out about it to want to keep a it a secret. Weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

All I could see was the underneath, I was standing directly under it. It had a outer circle of Bluish White lights that were triangular shaped. The flashed , first one then the next until it went all the way around the circle. Sometimes it went around fast then slower. It had a smaller circle of round lights that looked as if the circle were opening and closing. I don&#39;t know what it was I do live by an Air Force Base, could have been a new type of aircraft. I got my neighbor and daughter to come out and see it. It was also reported in the local newspaper. Many, Many people saw it, and I work for the schools and they were talking about seeing it too. It&#39;s not the first weird thing I&#39;ve seen but it was very close and I was right under it looking up.

He led another friend of ours along with myself through a small thicket of trees to a clearing just beyond a small baseball field. what we saw was the strangest thing, an almost perfect circle measuring approximately 60 or 70 feet across burnt into the ground. The ground looked like it had been boiled(for lack of a better descrip tion). the trees that had been there just disappeared, no charred hulks you would normally would find after a brush fire,just gone. the wildest though is the soil that exsist today is almost looks like lava but very brittle wich is completely out of character of the surronding soil. in fact the ground dirt is only a couple of inches thick due the fact that this location is on top of a large granite ledge. I would be happy to send a sample of this area to anyone who is serius about doing some kind of analysis on this &#34;dirt&#34;. I will (by permission of the land owner) give the location of this area for scientific (serius inqueries only) study.<n>
