From the anc|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89759.html|1|ndxe198109| I am an extraterrestrial human being. The spacecraft that I came from is referenced by numerous cultures around the earth. From the ancient Egyptians who have a representation of the craft on king Tutankhamun&#39;s Golden Throne to the Chinese who represent the craft with a trigram theory and the theory of the life cycle central to martial arts, and from ancient Israel which has a representation of the craft in the Torah and hidden within the Torah Code to the ancient Mayans who made the Mayan Calendar which represent the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spaceship is represented by the ancient Egyptians on Tutankhamun’s Golden Throne (5).  On the left side of the backrest of the throne is an image of the spaceship’s floor plan. At the center of the floor plan is the circular table and the profile image of the table is shown rising from the center of the circle. Under that symbol is a profile of an inner rectangular wall section; and under that are curved profiles which represent the view screen in the craft. The floor plan is also represented by the Aten symbol at the top and center of the backrest, and there the circle represents the table from the top view and the lines extending from it represents the floor sections. The open gold rectangle made around the central Aten represents the entryway into the space craft.  On the left side of the backrest Tutankhamun is shown seated in the Throne with darkened skin exposed because that is the location of the black thrones in the spacecraft as seen from the perspective of on! e entering it, and that is what signifies him as an important space being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ancient Mayan Calendar (3) represents the spaceship as well.  The circular center represents the table, and the surrounding rectangular signs patterned around it represent the walls.  The solar light rays represent the table profile.  As in the Golden Throne image in the left side of the backrest, the Mayan Calendar also represents the rectangular entryway on the top and the curved view screen under the centered face of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my account of being on a space craft.  I walk through the entryway in space.  The entryway is black and rectangular, and it is a part of the wall.  The wall parts are black, rectangular, and smooth; and the rectangular parts are patterned around a central white table so that the wall is a polygon.  The rectangular wall parts are similar in proportion of width to the width of my shoulders, and similar in proportion of height to the height of my body from bottom to top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In white robes I walk forward through the entryway in which my body fits comfortably.  I walk toward the white table which is about the height of my wrists from the ground.  The white table is circular and gently curves outward from bottom to top, and the top diameter is larger than the bottom diameter.  At the top of the table the circle is extruded a small amount to make a side, and the diameter of the top surface is about the width of my shoulders, and the bottom diameter is about the width of my feet.  Around the axis of the table there are lines which extend to the wall and between the thin lines which can appear white there are wide black wedge shaped floor sections which mate perfectly with the polygon wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look to my left and I see multiple black thrones located at the wall and which are patterned partially around.  The thrones are far away because the room is so large, and in the thrones are sitting people.  I continue walking and a woman walks in a straight line behind me from my left side to my right side.  I approach the clean white table whose surface is empty and I walk right around the table and I stop walking while I am one fourth of the way around the circumference.  At that point I have a conversation with another man wearing white robes.  Together both of us walk toward the front of the room where a view screen appears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The view screen appears to curve around the joining of the floor to the wall yet appears flat when looking at it.  On the screen I see the Earth and I see that I am in space.  Next on the view screen I see the future life I am to have.  I am told of the importance of my mission.  I contemplate my decision.  The glory and importance are attractive, the pain and suffering are not.  I do not fear the dangers that I am told of.  The importance of my life is high enough that I feel the need to live it.  I make my decision of my own free will to live the life I have seen.  I am told that our armada of space crafts will be arriving at the Earth within my lifetime.  I speak with the other man in the white robe to the right of the view screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I have completed speaking with him I proceed to my right and walk close to the polygon wall noticing the precision joining of the floor and the wall.  The floor looks like the ancient Egyptian Aten and the wall looks like the inside of a Jewish synagogue.  I walk toward another man who is touching one of the rectangular wall parts; the touch screen computer is black and resembles the ones in Star Trek TNG.  I am located to the front and right of the entryway.   I levitate upward and I am transformed into light and energy. My soul is free and I look down at the room from above and I feel as though I am seeing myself when I enter the room.  I look forward at the view screen and I begin moving very fast. Suddenly I am inside the womb of my mother on the Earth.  I am pleased.  I am delighted to again walk the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had a family reunion in South Dakota. I didn&#39;t realize that was in the shot, I was just trying to  get all of Mt. Rushmore in the picture. Once i pulled my eye away from the view finder, i noticed it. I told my family to quickly turn and see it. The object was there for another good 3-8 seconds. It flew away really quickly but it was just barely slow enough to remain visible as it traveled, until it was out of sight. It seemed to be emitting some sort of aura, but it was difficult to tell because it was such a hazy day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/25/81 22:00|Blue Springs|MO|Other|10 minutes|When I felt the bed sheets grazing my back, I knew I was the one moving and not the bed.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27540.html|3|ndxe198109| When I felt the bed sheets grazing my back, I knew I was the one moving and not the bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had an unusual experience when I was 15 in the fall of 1981.  I had never had an experience like it before, nor since, and I am now 37.  Right after it happened, I told two friends and my mom.  They did not believe me though I had never had a reputation for lying or even having been a daydreamer.  In 1981, I was popular, had good grades, was a cheerleader, and did not do drugs or smoke.  I had nothing to gain by telling a false story.  My friends and mom thought I had a &#34;dream,&#34; though I kept insisting I had not.  I had no clue as to what the experience was about, but as the years went by, and I heard more and more about people’s experiences with UFOs, I came to wonder if it was of the same nature.  I have always been skeptical of UFO stories, but there are so many similarities to my experience.  This is what happened (exactly), as I remember it like it happened yesterday.  It was right after 10:00 p.m. on a school night.  I had just hung up from talking on the phone.  I wasn’t sleepy yet, so I dimmed my light and turned over on my left side with my head propped up on my pillow.  I closed my eyes to relax when I distinctly heard a scurrying sound coming from the back of my closet.  Since we lived at the end of a cul-de-sac near the woods (only one other house around), it wasn’t unusual to have squirrels on the roof.  I thought maybe one of them had gotten down in the wall.  I recall giggling to myself thinking how appalled my mother would be when she found out there was a squirrel in her wall.  It was such a nonthreatening sound, I didn’t bother to open my eyes.  Right after the scurrying stopped, I heard crinkling paper (but it was distant).  Again, I thought, what are those rodents up to now?  Then the crinkling stopped, and in its place I heard a faint murmuring of voices (like in a crowded room).  I thought about getting up and looking out my window, as teens like to come down into our circle to hang out.  Maybe someone was playing their radio.  As I debated on whether I should get up or not, a l! oud clea r voice suddenly spoke near my right ear (the one not on the pillow).  It said something I didn’t quite catch, but the last words were &#34;the gun.&#34;  When something startles you, your natural reaction is to fly up, and that’s exactly what I thought I was doing, when I had what I call a &#34;time gap.&#34;  In the split second I was turning to see what had spoken, I found myself flat on my back vertical with my bed with my right arm extended upward.  It was pitch black (though my light had been left on), and I strained to see the tips of the fingers on my extended arm.  I was paralyzed, but not in pain.  My whole body had an electrical current running through it (like when your leg goes to sleep).  I was stunned because I had no recollection of coming into that position.   I thought, how did I get like this?  Then something else began to happen.  Up to this point, I thought I was lying on the bed.  I didn’t realize I was actually levitating over the bed until my body, in a perfectly straight form (with arm raised), began slowly moving counterclockwise.  When I felt the bed sheets grazing my back, I knew I was the one moving and not the bed.  In a 180 degree position (cross with bed), my body would be longer than the width of the bed, so my head and feet would stick out in the air.  As my head cleared the bed, I literally felt my hair FALL off the edge!!  That was when ALL doubt left me as to the reality of what was happening.  This was NOT a dream!  Reaching the 180 degree mark with the bed, I stopped, then began moving back the same direction I had come.  When I was vertical with the bed again, my whole body dropped (including my arm) onto the bed.  I was released from my paralysis, though not from the electrical current.  In a panic, I reached for the phone on my right, but it had no dial tone, just a loud buzzing sound.  I threw it on the floor.  I then leaped out of my bed to the left side and landed upright on my feet.  I was going to run out of my room to my mom’s across the hall.  I took one step and looked! up all at the same time.  I stopped in dead fear because instead of my bedroom door being there, there was a very black hole (tunnel like) in front of me.  It was already pitch black, but this hole was blacker than black.  I was too scared to go forward, so I decided to yell instead.  When I opened my mouth to yell<n> <n><n> &#34;“mom,&#34; my voice was electric and it came out like I was holding a vibrator to my throat.  The sound scared me so bad, I threw my hand over my mouth in utter shock.  At that very moment, I had another &#34;time gap.&#34;  In a split second, I was back on my bed, turned to the left, head on the pillow, light dimmed, just as I was before the whole event happened.  I spun around and looked at my whole room.  My phone was back in the cradle, and only 10 minutes had passed on the clock, though I felt like it had been at least an hour.  If you saw or know anything unusual that happened in my area during the time mentioned, please let me know.  This has bothered me for years.

Being that the only thing I can remember as far as the month would be arround September or possibly even October. The area I lived in was mostly farmland and the fields got plowed just before winter after the crops were harvested. I lived on route 2 Twin Falls,Idaho in a big two story home surrounded by bean and lettuce fields. It was arround 8 o&#39;clock or so when my two brothers and myself went out to go clobber each other with dirt clots in the bean field just left of the house. The sun had just barely set wit hjust a hint of purple left in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was when the low hum and the mistlike clouds came. Kinda like a fog. We all looked up and saw a craft right above us in the field. It was about 100 feet or so high. Again this is an approximation, being I was only about 8 years old when this happened so it could have been lower. It had one main large light which made a beam shooting straight down. It didn&#39;t burn or make us feel weird or anything it was not brilliant. The beam was about the strength of a good maglite flashlite. There were off center on both sides of the light in the middle a row off smaller colored lights which changed color. We were in awe as I can remember just standing there looking at it. Off in the distance we heared sirens and soon we heard my Father pull up to the house in quite a hurry. We looked away from the craft to see our Father and the flashing lights comming down the road. When we looked back and I know it was very quickly looked back. The craft was gone. Now the strangest thing is that my Father saw this craft near the south hills as he was comming back from a customer sight, he leased farm equipement, he called the air force and they were chasing this thing. How it came to be coincidentally above us when he got home is odd. We do recall that there was some time loss because when we got back inside it was 10:45. We were not outside that long, there is just no way. The air force did investigate this sighting and questioned us and my Father the next day. I have yet to get any information from the air force on this investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

But actually it was way beoned that. I know this because there were big thick tree&#39;s at the end of the block. And the ball of light was in the middle but beoned it . About a nother block or so. It just hover there. I&#39;m going too say about 10 to 15 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all at once it Shot at a angle, Until it desapered out of the earth&#39;s atmosphere. I was very fast.

Clear skies with a slight breeze.  I walked out of our house to go for a walk after dinner, on the front porch I stopped and looked up and there not terribly high above me was a rectangle shaped object of substantial size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a 9 domino with a pattern of 5 dots of light on one end and 4 on the other, the lights were white and red and did not blink.  The object appeared to be rectangular but I do not recall actually seeing edges only the impression of them.  The object made no sound, and did not move.  It appeared to be perhaps 75-100 yards above me and slightly in front of me so that the leading edge was not quite over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at this object for approximately 5-10 min and put my hand on the door knob to go get my parents ( I was a teenager at the time) when the door opened behind me.  I turned away from the object and saw my mother opening the door and I said &amp;quot;mom look at that&amp;quot; and turned to direct her attention to the object and it was gone.  Also she was coming to look for me because I had been outside for a little over an hour and it was dark and too late to be out.  She did not see the object at all, but later she mentioned that a police officer had reported a similar object as had a few others that night so if their reports were documented the exact date should be easy to determine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date and even the fact of spring or fall is uncertain to me 31 years later, but I do recall very clearly that it was a beautiful clear comfortable day with a slight breeze and clear skies and what this object looked like and how I felt.  There was no fear, only curiosity and interest.  Also I know that I was not standing on that porch for an hour looking at the sky, only a few min.  How the time difference is accounted for I have no theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Time of year I'm not sure|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17212.html|9|ndxe198109| 2 silver cigar shaped objects N. of Fort Huachuca sometime in &#39;81 or &#39;82. Time of year I&#39;m not sure<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never reported this but have told skeptical friends and relatives. I had just finished a job in Fort Huachuca servicing a cash register. I ate lunch and was heading back to Tucson. It&#39;s been so long ago that the exact times and dates are fuzzy. I never expected I&#39;d have to remember. Anyway, I was just driving down the road back toward Tucson (it&#39;s the shortest road between the two so it shouldn&#39;t be hard to figure out which one it is) and I caught a view of something out of my peripheral vision to the right of me (east). I started to turn my head to see what it was and before I could turn my view more than 5 degrees, two silver cigar shaped objects crossed the road about 60 to 100 feet off the ground and about 200 feet ahead of me. I tried to follow them with my eyes but they were flying so fast I had to turn my head quickly west to see them. By the time I had turned my head they were 2 small dots on the horizon flying between the peaks of a mountain range probably close to 30 or 40 miles away. It&#39;s hard to judge distance in the desert. Maybe it means nothing but it seemed that time slowed down when this all occurred. There were other cars on the road at the time (two lane road) but I don&#39;t know if they saw them or not. There was one in front of me and one behind me. It seems that the traffic slowed when this happened but the whole thing happened so fast it was difficult to remember even at the time. When I got back to Tucson, my boss and the secretary gave me grief for taking so long getting back. It was like I lost an hour or two. Anyway, believe it or not. I know it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was early, 6:30ish, I also remember that it was overcast outside, whether it was cloud cover or fog, I do not know.  The weather was mild, maybe spring or early fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember looking up for some reason or other and seeing &#34;something&#34; in the sky hovering no more than a few feet over the trees.  It was almost like it was using the clouds or fog as a camouflage.  I never heard any sounds or felt any breeze or wind from any aircraft type vehicle.  The aircraft that I saw was shaped like a rounded triangle with red and blue lights, I can not remember if they were flashing or solid.  The color of the entire thing was silver, not like stainless, more of a brushed nickle color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being that I was a young child at the time, I was terrified and ran back into my house to get my Grandmother.  By the time we got back outside so I could show her what I saw, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom&#39;s house is no where near any Air force bases or airports, so it couldn&#39;t be passed off as any type of experimental airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t seen anything like that since that day.

It followed me as i backed into the woods to gain cover.  I noticed I was deeper into the woods than I realized, I think I lost a little time.  I became very scaed and ran directly towards the streetlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I emerged onto the road I was a half mile away from the trail entrance.

I had a newborn son and my husband was with him at my home in Henderson NC.I was driving up Creedmore Rd or Highway, and I put my brakes on at the top of the hill because I saw an object that I thought was a soapbox, like a soapbox derby. The moon was full that night, and I wondered why there were kids out on the street at 11pm. After I slowed down, I looked at this object, and it started to take off at an incredible speed down the hill. It was going at a fast speed, but it always maintained a low altitude, almost flying on the ground. I started to accelerate my car speed, until I looked at my spedometer, and realized that I was going 85 to 90 miles and hour trying to catch up with this object. The object left the highway, and I pulled over on the road and I was very shaken. If I were to drive that road again, I probably would remember the white house on the road that seemed to be a farm. The object was parked in front of that house. I got to my home that night, and told my  husband what I had seen that night. He laughed at me,and even when I drew him a picture, he didn&#39;t believe me. I am 55 years old now, and soon will be 56. If you were to give me sodium amytal, I would garantee you that I could create the same image that was given to me those many years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was in shape of a triangle, with round lights along each angle. It flew away at a slow speed for around half a mile. I ran inside the house and started flashing the outside lights and the ship stopped in mid air turned around and came and stood over us for around 4 minutes. I saw in the center of the ship what looked like a comand center and people looking down, one of the smaller round objects detached itself from the ship and flew away from it maybe 100&#39;, by then my mother and brothers were all scared and they ran iside the house. The smaller round ship re-attached itself to the main ship and then flew away at the same low speed. This object was seen once more last year in the same location, Moca, Puerto Rico, by my sister.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To my knowledge there is no way that this event could have been a hoaxed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was about 1981 or 1982 and I was seven or eight years old at my home in Raynham, MA. It was just around dusk time in the front yard of my house when I happened to look up to sky and, at 4:00, saw a disc shaped object. I vividly remember the object as being disc shaped with a raised bump in the middle, silver colored, completely still and silent. The strangest part of the episode was that the object was slanted down at an angle almost as if staring at me. I watched, frozen in awe, for about two minutes before running inside the house to get my parents and a camera. By the time we made it back to the front yard, the object was gone. Moments later we all saw a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I again saw the same exact object but this time on the left sky. It was doing the exact same thing, just hovering there suspended in mid air at a downward slant. When I glanced away to yell for my parents, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first sighting,|3/23/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35742.html|17|ndxe198109| While walking on route 209 south, 2 miles north of Port Jervis, ny, I noticed a dull red light far in the distance.  At first sighting, the object would be approximately over Milford, PA.  It slowly came closer, following a northeast heading.  As it came even closer, passing directly over Port jervis, I could see it was a cluster of red lights that formed a right triangle, traveling with its long side forward.  Standing there on the highway, (looking straight up at it while cars drove past me), it looked like several rows of red lights, (8-7-6-etc.), forming the triangle.  It was a cloudy night and I couldn&#39;t see any real shape, just the perfect triangle of red lights traveling as one thing.  I guessed it to be about 200-300 feet wide and 100-150 feet from front to back.  It was approximately 400 feet over my head and silent, except for the faintest hiss. It was not rounded like a blimp, but flat.  It continued in its northeast direction traveling about 30-40 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I screamed for someone to let me in and that there was a UFO outside. My uncles were standing in the front yard and the object resided there for a few seconds. The lights on the saucer moved opposite of counter-clockwise. They seemed to chase each other much like chasing lights you see at Christmas time. The object hovered around the front porch of the house for a few seconds then disappeared. It moved that fast. There one minute, gone the next. The surface area of the craft was bigger than my grandmother&#39;s house--her house was average sized, somewhat big. My uncle called the local airport to see if there were any testing going on in the area. None were reported and no weather balloons had been released.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I watched more, and at that time saw 3 other lights. One was on the left hand side of the road from my viewpoint, the other 3 were on the right hand side of the road...and seemed to be quite some distance off, I felt beyond the little town of Diamond which would have been 2 1/2 miles at beginning of sighting, and 1 1/2 miles when sighting over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well as I was studying this group of lights and could tell that they were all moving, my second thought was airplanes or helicopters....UNTIL they began to do things, that were just not earthly possible, by any known aircraft made by man NOW let along then. The &#34;light&#34; on left moving oddly....but very slowly compared to the 3 on the right....I am not sure how to describe their movement? Like tadpoles in a pond?...or maybe sperm under a microscope?  Very abrupt movement....very darting, very fast, but as well would stop, and not appear to be moving at all....then even more quickly than they appeared &#34;they disappeared&#34; in the blink of an eye. It was as if you snapped your fingers, and before you even hear the sound....they &#34;the lights&#34; were gone.  I recall seeing a slight tracer, for a brief instant, heading away from the earth, not towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whole thing I doubted lasted much more than 3 mins, maybe even less...probably so, as distance of sighting only about a mile. I know there were 4 other eyewitnesses that I know of....one was my Mom, but unfortunately she does not recollect it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well when I got to ballgame, of course I told all my good buddies about it as soon as I got there...well as I was telling them about it, one of them piped up and said &#34;Me and my Mom saw those lights too!&#34; They very respected family at the time in Diamond (have since moved), and loved by all....so was happy to hear him say that...so no one thought I was making it up or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been telling people about this for over 20 years now....I am beginning to think &#34;now&#34; I am the only one that remembers the lights.  My friend, the last time I talked to him...seemed to have forgotten.  I sent him an e-mail after the &#34;Seeing is Believing&#34; episode...and asked him again, if could remember that....and as well to ask his mother if she remembered seeing them still yet today.  To me it was AMAZING, and I will never forget it so long as I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have another tale to tale, although &#34;not my own&#34; ....it is my mothers. When my Grandmother died....my Mom woke up and looked at the clock, it was the exact time of my Grandmothers passing. My mother has described to me a dream she had that night many times, before he waking, and looking at the clock. She said she was in a white room, with Grandma.....and others around but she could only sense them,  but not see them,  only my Grandma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She still describes yet today, what sounds to me like some sort of &#34;time travel&#34; or &#34;travel into another dimension?&#34; and travelling at a high rate of speed, when all of a sudden a voice came to her....and told her it was her time to go, and she said he final good-bye to her Mom...and she woke up, and looked at the clock.  She can tell you about that dream yet today....as if it happened yesterday. That would have been 1980  I have had other strange things happen in my life....but not sure if UFO related  I had what I understand to be a &#34;night-terror&#34; at maybe age of 13?   Woke up scared to death...screaming, but unable to scream...in a cold sweat, and unable to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I was only one at home in family&#39;s house...and woke up feeling as if &#34;someone is watching me&#34;  Like woke up for whatever reason, and trying to go back to sleep, and 1/2 asleep....then it &#34;hit me&#34; , that feeling...&#34;I am being watched&#34;  I rolled on my back, and made myself open my eyes....what I saw scared the Hell out of me!!!!  I would call it an &#34;apparition&#34; ...was no one I knew?  It seemed to be the Grim Reaper, without the sythe....was very shadowy, and appeared to be hooded...but very short, like alien descriptions.  I yelled at it, swang at it, and tried to get away from it....then in a brief second &#34;it&#34; was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well as it was there was a tree near the window, and I dismissed &#34;it&#34; as a shadow, or at least tried to. But honestly I have never seen a shadow make a figure standing above you, nor ever again, or before has a shadow woken me up...with the feeling as if I was being watched? As well in order to calm myself down after the incident, I got our faithful frind and Rottweiler to come in my room and sleep there with me. She was very hesitant to enter the room, and entered with head bowed down...very unlike her<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be interested in having a paranormal investigator contacting me.....too many weird unexplainable things I have seen and experienced....and I know others in same time frame that had weird encounters as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that dates of sightings are approximate.
