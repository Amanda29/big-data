Object led us in a circle then passed below us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four of us (3 pilots) just had landed at the Gogebic County Airport, and while taxing back toward the hanger noticed a flashing yellow light about 2 miles southwest of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took off again on runway 27 and headed straight at the object.  It continued to flash a yellowish white light in no particular sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached it, it headed east (our left).  We turned to follow it, but it kept staying off our left wingtip.  It led us in a complete 360 degree turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then headed east along a range of hills.  It entered the landing pattern for the airport at 800 ft above ground level.  We followed it.  It completed the downwind pattern, but after turning onto the dogleg, instead of entering final approach, it veered at a 45 degree angle and passed underneath us.  We were at 800 feet above the ground at the time, in the downwind leg of the landing pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we finally got turned around, the object had disappeared.  Witnesses on the ground with whom we were in !radio contact with claimed the object passed above us, then just zoomed upward at a steep angle and disappeared.  We knew the object passed beneath us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a yellowish-white light about 5 feet in diameter.  When it passed below us, it did not appear any larger and there was no sign that it may have possibly been larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us in the plane were licensed pilots, one a commercial airline pilot.  Witnesses on the ground included the airport manager, a local government official and two other pilots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This encounter was reported to the University of Colorado UFO study which was the offical reporting place at the time.  I received a letter from the project coordinator, Mr. Robert J. Low, on March 8, 1968.  He stated that the report would be included in the their active file.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was informed a few days later by the airport manager, that he had received a telephone call from the University of Colorado asking for more details about the sighting, which he pro!vided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was also asked about us, were we creditable witnesses, etc.  He stated that he told them that we all were good honest witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard anything more about this other than a small article in the local newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if you have ever had any reports similar to this one.  If you have, please advise me of them and where I can read them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you need any more information, please contact me.  I have the letter from the University of Colorado and several other items concerning the sighting.<n>

I was 13 at the time and we lived in a rural setting in Cotton County, Oklahoma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After supper I would be the one to wash dishes and look out the window.  Most nights I was entertained by watching the red lights in the sky.  I tried several times to get my mother to come in and look at them, but she simply didn’t find it as interesting as what was on TV.  She saw them but said it must be airplanes (Even though they didn’t move!).   I have asked her if she remembers this and she doesn’t.  It is very odd to me that everyone I have talked with doesn’t seem to remember seeing them. When we went to basketball games we would gather at the back of the bus and watch these lights follow us.  This went on for months and months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were red and perfectly round. They didn’t glare but were bright.  It is hard to say how big they were, but when I saw one next to a window at a neighboring house they appeared to be about two feet across, maybe less.  They never moved--they would appear, disappear and reappear somewhere else.  The number varied. Most times there was only about five, but I counted about 15 one night.  They would appear up in the sky in perfect geometric formation. If there were four they would appear in a square, evenly spaced. If a fifth light joined them it would appear at ninety degrees. Sometimes they would have a couple of different groups. If one would disappear from one group it would appear with the other one. There was a vacant house about 1/8 mile up the road that had a security light. A light would disappear from the group and appear at different places around the vacant house. It was like something was checking it out.  I never saw one around our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Often I would go to sleep in my bed by the window watching the lights.  I was totally amazed. What was more amazing was that nobody else thought it was worth noticing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They made no sound. Have you ever gotten any reports like this?  Surely I’m not just imagining this! I have a couple of other things to ask about as well if you are interested.  Like strange marks on the back of my hand, like a brand.   And a glowing globe of light, very large that hovered over my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would appreciate some feedback. Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
