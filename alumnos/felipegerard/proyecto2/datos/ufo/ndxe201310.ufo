All of a sudden i saw a green box shaped object moving in sky.  It was moving at a rapid speed.  Sky was cloudy and the object was flying beneath clouds n was clearly visible.  It was moving in straight direction(horizontal) and all of a sudden it changed its position towards upward(vertical) and dissappeard into clouds...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what exactly it was....<n> <n><n> <n><n> But sudden change in its direction n disappearence in split seconds made me strange...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident occured in erode,tamilnadu,india<n>

The object&#39;s flight path was very stable but halfway through the event it paused for approximately 6-10 seconds then proceeded on its way at roughly the same amount of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light started to fade momentarily, illuminated back to original brightness and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noticeable noise from the object at any point of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look to the south and see a commercial or military aircraft approaching.<n>

From the distance I was looking from, around 50-75 feet, they seemed to be around the size of small eggs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the majority of the lights converged in a spot on the ground in the treeline.  They seemed to form a circle, blinking occasionally.  Two or three of the lights remained separate two around 20 feet away and forward to the left, and one around half that distance and forward to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed on three separate occasions that the cluster of lights would dance around and flash in a recognizable pattern, followed almost immediately on one occasion of a wave of even tinier lights seeming to fall from nothing visible in the sky upon the cluster of egg shaped lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I both observed these lights from two ! separate rooms in which we had extinguished all the indoor lights.  We watched these lights, looking for explanation for well over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we hoped they were the reflecting eyes of several small mammals, such as rabbits of possums, searching for garbage.  Yet they did not move as animals normally do, stayed too consistently within the sphere of gathered lights and also did not alert the dog in the same manner.  They remain clustered upon the ground where we first noticed them even as I write this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other people saw these unexplained lights as well.  Both a separate sister, my mother and my 13 year old niece saw the lights as well and observed their strange movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our dog noticed the lights as well, barked for a very short period of time and investigated the separated lights.  He stayed well away from the cluster of tiny pulsating lights however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and niece at one time stated that the light seemed red on two separate occasions and blue once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to video tape this occurrence, but the screen remained too d ark.<n>
10/31/13 21:03|Arcanum|OH|Unknown|10-15 seconds|Loud stationary noise and lights.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103760.html|4|ndxe201310| Loud stationary noise and lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 31st, 2013 at approximately 21:03 hours, my wife and I were standing on the rear porch watching the weather.  It has been windy and overcast for the last two hours and the rain from earlier had stopped.  We were both facing to the north to keep the chilling winds at our backs.  Suddenly a loud noise came from the sky to the east-northeast.Along With the noise was steady flashes of bright white lights reflecting off the low, fast moving clouds. It was a loud noise and sounded like two distinct but simutainious notes. The lights and sound did not move...  The noise sounded like two simultaneous steady tones... If I had to guess what the tones sounded like, I would say a pair of jet turbines but very clean... meaning no low rumble of exhaust sounds, as a jet makes when flying.  Again, the lights and sound stayed in one area only.  The noise and lights stopped after about 10 seconds.  The event stopped as fast and as loud as it started the only difference is! that the tones dropped quickly in pitch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was completely strange because that kind of noise with lights did not belong in the sky.  In fact, I&#39;ve never heard anything like it before.  After the event, my wife and I just looked at each other. I ask her, &#34;DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?&#34;  She said, &#34;Yeah..&#34;  I then asked her if she saw the flashes of light too.  Again, she replied, &#34;Yeah!&#34;<n>

Whatever it was was of a pretty good size.  The light did not flicker/waver like the meteors I&#39;ve seen, it was definitely at the altitude I said.  It didn&#39;t have blinking light like a plane nor any wings that I could see.  I saw it flying for about 5 or 6 seconds before it seemed to accelerate and speed off into the distance and then it was gone.  It did not burn out, just sped out of sight...<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day or so later now, I&#39;ve heard reports of my girlfriend&#39;s parents seeing something similar too, and there&#39;s military helicopters all around Melba, ID, where they shouldn&#39;t be.  What I/they saw was no helicopter...<n>

The object was neutral in color, without any external lights and seemed to phase in and out while on a very straight but fast trajectory for about 10 seconds in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 1 hour prior to our sighting, one of my daughters and her friend had witnessed an object of like appearance in the same area and informed me of what she had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed her account until I went outside later and witnessed it for myself.  I live near Tinker AFB and I have seen B-2 bombers flying before.  This was distinctly different.

I looked out of the passenger window and saw a diamond/football shaped aircraft with bright orange lights around the entire perimeter.  I was lost for words.  I heard nothing.  It just appeared to be hovering.  I know what the lights of helicopters and planes look like and this was neither. I live on Fort Wainwright and this was nothing like I have ever seen before in my life.  Totally unexplainable.  I try to talk to people about it and they appear to think I am a little crazy sounding, but I know what I saw.  It was a UFO.<n>
10/31/13 20:17|Riverview/Brandon|FL|Circle|3 minutes|Riverview/Brandon FL, 1 strange light that changed direction and color from white to red and green.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103764.html|10|ndxe201310| Riverview/Brandon FL, 1 strange light that changed direction and color from white to red and green<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 31 Oct 2013 at approximately 20:17 hours in Riverview, FL, while handing out candy with my wife and 3 year old daughter, I witnessed what I thought to be a fly over of the International Space Station again (it passed over our area a couple of days ago).  It was a bright light moving from Northwest to Southeast just as fast as the space station did but then it started to slow down, stop, change from a bright white to a red and green light, back to dim white, slowly move east, then slowly move north again.  I thought this to be extremely odd and that’s when I called my wife over to witness it with me.  We stood at the end of our driveway looking north and watched it change color and patterns a couple of times.  I asked my wife to film it with her Samsung Galaxy S III phone but because of the distance and with the light coming from my house (to inform trick-or-treater’s that we are handing out candy) the strange light in the sky didn’t show up on her phone.  At approximately 20:20 is when my next door neighbor came out from her house to see if there were any more kids going to stop by.  I asked her to come out to the end of her driveway with us to see if she knew what it was.  She thought it was odd as well but didn’t want to think too much about it.  We stood at the end of her driveway for about a minute and that’s when the strange light moved slowly north and behind some thin clouds moving in.  Soon after that, the strange light moved past the horizon of our home and out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I had hoped that it would have been seen by other parents out with their kids during this night and perhaps it would have been reported to a local media station, but after thinking about it, who really wants to report anything like this on Halloween? My thought process was to report it on this website in hopes it would produce some intelligent feedback.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kinda odd, but don’t want to think about it too much.  Would like to see if there is any feedback though.<n>

I knew they weren&#39;t balloons though because 1) they glided sideways with ease, not erratically and 2) they never floated upwards, just sideways and 3) there were no strings attached, as there would be had a child lost their balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved slowly, and I only got a short glimpse of them as I was driving, but they were light grey and entirely unmarked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another interesting aspect was at first I only saw 2 of them, but then one of the spheres seemed to split in half, and a third craft became visible, and then a fourth which also appeared from the same area as the other craft.  It looked like a fifth was emerging when I lost sight of them.  I don&#39;t know if I was just at a strange angle and saw them simply moving out from behind another craft or if they actually merged out from one another.  I couldn&#39;t get an image, unfortunately, of anything as traffic was somewhat chaotic and my eyes had to be on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not entirely sure what I saw at all,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The party who submitted the report elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information, so we are unable to contact the witness.

There was mild cloud cover.  Cold and clear for the most part.  I noticed what I thought at first was a shooting star.  It was a small round white light slightly larger and a little more dull than the other stars visible.  After a few seconds, the other two lights came in to view.  From North to South, over the coastline.  They flew low just above the cloud ceiling, at a pace faster than a jet in the distance, and much slower than shooting stars.  They flew in an interesting almost chaotic pattern.  They were in a kind of formation that resembled birds, randomly moving about each other occasionally.  This lasted approximately 15 seconds before they flew south and out of sight.  They did not make any noise.  I pointed them out to my friend when as soon as I saw the first light, thinking it was a shooting star.  I followed them with my finger until they were out of view, but unfortunately she did not see them.  I was pretty speechless.<n>

When I noticed the first one I believed it was a helicopter but there was absolutely no noise and as it came closer I could see it was something I couldn&#39;t identify.  It just looked like a bright, orangish light high up in the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next 5 lights followed the same path and I could see four of them at a time until they faded out of view after passing overhead.  Again, there was no noise at all.  The bright orange objects seemed almost to be floating and flickering, and they were moving fairly rapidly, at about the pace of a helicopter but slower than an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event I witnessed took approximately 10-15 minutes.  I couldn&#39;t see the shape or size of the objects but each one of the 6 appeared to be identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they passed from my view overhead I couldn&#39;t see them for very long as they headed north. I wished someone else had been around to witness this event with me, but I was alone and didn&#39;t feel comfortable knocking on a neighbor&#39;s door at that time of night although I did call a friend on my cell as it was exciting to see these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog didn&#39;t appear to notice the lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The Lights are red, green,white and occasional blue.  It appears stationary.  I have seen this through astronomy binoculars and also very high up in the sky with a telescope.  Through the telescope view it appears to be spinning.  I have seen these lights in the north, west, east and southern sky I and several other family members have experienced this sighting no less then 10-15 times during the last month<n>

Within my peripheral vision, I caught a rather bright flash (approximate astronomical magnitude -5) of white light of less than 1 second duration.  I would estimate the size of the light to be slightly larger than the planet Venus, and was noted at the straight overhead position, 90 degrees above the horizon.  This white blinking light reoccured several times, at an interval of ~10-15 seconds, and for a total duration of less than 1 minute.  It then abruptly stopped.  The blinking light remained in the exact same position throughout that time.  My impression is that it had an altitude of at least 20,000 feet, but possibly greater.  No associated object/fuselage could be observed.  I would say that it had a very similar appearance to a bright, blinking white beacon light that one would observe atop a radio transmitter tower.  It was definitely not an aircraft navigational light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an experienced observer of the night sky.  I am familiar with the commercial aircraft on their approach pattern to SFO (that path is due south of my location), and all the visible planets and 1st magnitude stars.  This was also not the ISS, a satellite, meteor, nor an iridium flare.<n>

Color flowed across it from left to right - red, green, blue. I watched for about 30 seconds when it turned west and appeared to stop - the bands of color then became static and looked like a horizontal bar of color floating in the air.  I drove past and couldn&#39;t see it in my rear view mirror.  A drone?  Some sort of weird advertising float?  It was moving fairly quickly, so not sure.  Very strange.<n>

I spotted 3 red lights triangular that was in the sky and told my daughter to look at it.  Then one light disappeared and two lights moved closer that made us baffled!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter thought it was probably a chopper but the 3 lights didn&#39;t move like airplane and helicopter do.  So, we got out of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be honest, I am deaf and I can&#39;t hear so my daughter heard the sound like boom boom that almost like a firework.<n>

10/30/13 19:30|Mechanicsville|VA|Unknown|1 minute|Very loud craft with two vertical neon green circles.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103769.html|29|ndxe201310| Very loud craft with two vertical neon green circles<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting out of my car and heard what I thought was a plane landing, which is not unusual since I live so close to the Richmond Airport.  Then, the sound got louder and louder, like the “plane” was about to crash in my front yard.  The noise was very similar to the engine of a plane, but not the whistling sound planes make when they are in air.  I walked outside to see where the craft was and saw what definitely was not an airplane.  All I could see of the craft were two neon green circles on each side of whatever the body was.  I could not see the body because the green nights were too bright.  It appeared that the lights were spinning like propellers, but the lights made hollow rings, not full circles.  They were also spinning vertically, like wheels on a wheel chair.  What was also interesting is that even though it looked like the craft was moved by the propellers, they did not make the pulsing noise that helicopter propellers make, it was a very consistent, loud engine sound.  The craft also had a small blinking white and red light on the body, but it was flying way too low to have been anything legitimate.  The craft flew out of my sight probably in about 15 seconds, by the time I had my phone out to take a picture, it was gone.  I had never seen anything like it before, so I posted on facebook to see if anyone else had seen it, one person said that they had heard it and another said that they saw it too.<n>

The 4 lights were spinning fast in a big circle and were silent.  Then they would move to the center of the circle and back out.  When a cloud would pass by, you could tell the lights were above the clouds.  This continued for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the 4 lights moved back to the center of the circle and stopped.  Then 1 light disappeared at a time until they were all gone.  I seen the same thing 2 years ago but it was in the front yard and around Jan/Feb.

10/30/13 14:00|St. Paul|MN|Unknown||I actually got photos that i never seen with my naked eye but somehow captue with my camera.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103830.html|33|ndxe201310| i actually got photos that i never seen with my naked eye but somehow captue with my camera<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving a property in St.Paul Mn, i&#39;m a sub-contractor that inspects and do light maintenance on forclosed homes in the metro area of Minneapolis/St.Paul Mn, so daily i drive around inspecting properties and i have to take photos and have the camera set to where it shows the date and and time i was at the property,that way i get paid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this past Wednesday on Oct 30, 2013, around 2pm i was leaving close to downtown St.Paul it was a nice day clear skys everyone was out enjoying the weather the past few days has been pretty chilly so everyone was enjoying the afternoon sun.  Well i come to a stop light trying to beat the rush hour traffic and i look up and see two huge eagles gliding above, just going in a circle and flying to me kind of low,like they was about to swoop down on a prey.  My first thought was they was flying pretty low and i was concern maybe someone had a small pet out and that what they had there eyes on.  So i decided to take some photos, a friend of mine mention last week while we was talking on the phone i seen a eagle and he said that i always see eagles,  so i thought it be a good ideal to take a few photos to show him the next time i see him.  While i waiting for the light to change i took five photos trying to get the best angle caused the eagles are going in the same circle so i wanted to make sure i got a photo of them.  So i leave St. Paul head home and go to the library downloaded my work on my laptop of the properties i done for the day.  Once i completed downloading my photos i kind of went over the photos of the eagles i didn&#39;t think i got good photos.  I left the library went to the gym left the gym went to Caribou coffee so i took out my camera start deleting all the photos i took that day and when i got to the photos of the eagles i kept them and pulled them up to get a better view and i notice in one the photos with the eagles in it,there a object by the eagle a circle of lights my first raction was, what ((words deleted)) is that  i looked at it a few times and new it was something there so i remember i had the photos on my laptop and put in the back of my mind that when i had the time i was going to look at the photos again on my laptop that way i could enlarge the photos to see better what it was.On Thursday Oct 31,13 i moved into my new place get situated sitting down relaxing get my laptop out pulled up the photos and there it is but i got two good photos clear as day i got one photo of a object by itself and i got another photo with the eagles in it where one is flying high above close to these circle of lights and the other eagle is flying low and not quite sure what it is but next to the eagle flying low look like another ball of light but it so close to the eagle that can&#39;t distinquish if it part of the eagle or not.I get excited know i see something there and can&#39;t believe that i capture what ever it is on camera and the clarity of the photos it look like i was actually trying to capture this object when in truth with my naked eye the only thing i seen! was the eagles and that the only reason i took the photos to show my friend.I took my laptop down stairs i had to show someone,i showed my building manager i mention to him what i do for a living and explained to him why i took the photos he looked at them kind of startle another client walked in the office and he the manager mention to the client that i was trying to convince him that there are U.F.O. i said i&#39;m not trying to convince you of anything i&#39;m just showing you what my camera caught,i did&#39;nt see anything,i showed the photos to the other guy and he said he see it too and once again i said i&#39;m not saying its anything i&#39;m just as curious to know what it is too.I come back upstairs call my friend the one that was the reason i took the photos in the first place he live about five minutes from me.told him he come over we go over the photos and shock at what he see this doesn&#39;t look like no sauser or nothing we seen on television.  We talked about it looked at every possibility what could it be maybe we thought it could be my camera and th e angle off the reflection of the window but when it enhance it clearly a object there in the sky and it very detailed.I start refecting on when i first took the photos at the stop light and thinking why was the eagles flying so low and why was they together to grown eagles.I&#39;m not a expert on eagles and i&#39;m kind of use to seeing them in the area i live in but i never seen to huge ones together and also i remember thinking how unsual was it to see two big eagles flying low in a urban area near downtown on a busy afternoon and didn&#39;t anybody else see this and why was the eagles going in the same circle,that what i remember thinking at that time and now when i look at the photos in my mind it kind of make sense why the eagles was behaving like that.I figured they sensed something in the area and when you see the photos they kind of show that because in one photo both the eagles are exactly where the lights are,well from the angle that what it appear to be.I showned the photos ! to several people and everyone reaction is the same some say its a ufo a couple of guys at first said it was my camera lense and the way i was angling the camera to be honest i don&#39;t know what it is and the only way to be sure is first to take the photos to a expert where they have the technology to validate them.And let me say i surely wouldn&#39;t be wasting my time or yours if i didn&#39;t believe that by accident my camera capture something and it clearly shows a object in two photos to midday rush hour.I do have photos but is reluctant to turn them over to just anybody thinking about going to a local t.v station or newspaper to show them or even the authorities i&#39;m about 99% sure i capture a object and the more you look at it it very detail and i&#39;m sure i got actual rare photos of a un made man object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The party who submitted the report elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information, so we are unable to contact the witness.

It was still dark, and looking northward, towards the town of Meridian, was a bright greenish-white obect or objects moving at a high rate of speed in a roughly east to west direction.  The light seemed to be split in-two, as if it had a double flare-like appearance.  The object(s) appeared to be only several thousand feet above ground at this point as it would have been beneath the light cloud cover existing at the time.  We soon lost sight of object as it dissapeared behind a grove of trees, but seemed headed some where to the south of Ontario, OR.  There were no aircraft landing, amber or strobe lights associated with this, and I assumed this was probably a meteor which may have broken in two.  I did hear a slight roaring sound at the time; not sure if associated with this or other aircraft in the area.  If the FAA has radar data pertaining to this from the Boise airport or Mountain Home AFB, it may be possible to track a possible landing site of meteorite in western Idaho or eastern OR.<n>

It was too high to be a plane, and it was to low to be a Russian satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was intrigued by it, I have never seen such in my entire life, it reflected like a Diamond does, there is no way to explain this, it was just a beautiful sighting, it was much brighter than a star, but it also could have been there longer,  I just did not see it because it blended into the stars that were their earlier.  I thought I was going crazy so I had someone else look at it also, at first they did not see it I ! had to point where to look, the brightness of it was enough for them to also see it, but the brightness was faded a little, but still visible for them to see.

I assumed my brother was home from work, as she usually barks when she hears the front door open accompanied by the chime of our home alarm system.  I told her to be quiet it was just my brother coming home, but she continued to bark and got louder.  I listened to hear the usual sounds of him entering the house (door closing, walking around, etc.) but heard none as didn’t come home, and ended up spending the night at a friend’s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dog continued to bark as she does when someone is there, and she is unsure of who it is.  Again, I told the dog to stop barking.  I then heard the sound of what an airplane sounds like when it passes over our house, and thought maybe it was just the furnace turning on that startled her.  But the sound gradually got louder and closer to my home, sounding more like a plane landing.  It was as though the aircraft was right over our roof, and it felt like the whole house was shaking.  We don’t live near enough to Pearson Intl Airport for an aircraft to be flying that low in our area, and it did not have the distinct sound of a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of bed and looked out the window to see a long cylinder shaped aircraft flying just above tree level.  It did not have wings, propellers or visible landing gear.  For about 30 seconds I watched the slow moving object with two large circular lights fly over our subdivision.  The lights were bright red, and looked to each be 4ft in diameter (one in front of the other), flashing one after the other until it was too far me to continue to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I realized what I could potentially be witnessing, I tried to get a picture with my phone but the aircraft was then too far beyond trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have seen something questionable in our area.<n>

It was very bright and it was slowly cruising in the sky.  I&#39;m only 15 and I have never experienced something like this.  There were also a lot of stars out and I had to sit down for a moment as I was in shock.  The only way I could show someone would be to draw it.  This will be reported to a higher league of people and I will await their response.  This is no hoax as I don&#39;t believe in other life forms.  But now I am.   background was a dark night sky the craft was just hovering slowly then it drifted into the distance.  I can still see it and I will never forget it.  I think its coming back as I speak.  The craft is moving at a decent speed and I have no idea what its doing the craft is light up like a Christmas tree.  I have just shone a laser and I&#39;ve gotten a response.  The craft is turning and its coming for me.  The light display has changed dramatically.  This is incredible first contact with an extra terrestrial life form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve tried to encourage the craft to come near me. Of course it won&#39;t. At one point an aeroplane went past it and then it went mad and its just doing unnatural moves in the sky. I&#39;ve seen nothing since. I&#39;ve repeated the  laser experiment and it just gives me a light display. I believe this to be a sign of communication. All I can do know is go to my local air base and report it. Again I must add this is no hoax.<n>

Noticed no other activity in the sky during this time as there is always plane activity from many airports north and south of our location each night.  A thrilling sight to see.<n>

Dog sits up and is listening to something.  I turn down the tv and immediately hear a low steady hum.  I then am seeing 2 red lights right in front of my house in the air, yet low to the ground and moving slowing west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spring to the front door and stand on the steps and watch as this large object moves slowly right in front of me and starts turning south just yards, yards from my house.  The dog is barking like nuts, we run through the house to the back deck and watch as it continues south.  Moving slow and steadily with just a low hum.  One red light on the front and one blinking red light at the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed over a tree line on the edge of our property and then I cannot see it anymore.  Heading I thought toward our small airport...following M-22 toward US 31.  Low enough that after it had gotten past the trees, I lost sight of it.  I live in the country, no street lights, there was just a sliver of a moon, no stars--extremely dark of course.  I couldn&#39;t make out an exact shape, yet I had this feeling it was huge, possibly the size of a football field.  I couldn&#39;t really see the entire object straight on, making me think it was HUGE.  After talking about this all day on Facebook, many people have come forward and had seen the exact same thing.  From Onekama to Manistee to Ludington.  I was so transfixed and in shock and awe, I couldn&#39;t even believe what I was seeing with my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the hell was this???  So what is it???  I was unable to get a photo...too dark, too surprised!!!!<n>

They were all moving along the same path, on the same line, the 2 in front were approximately 5 degrees apart with the 3rd partially obscured by clouds, another 15 degrees behind, no navigation lights could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down at my iPhone to text a friend, when I looked back up with the intent of trying for a video, they were gone.  It could have been a meteor breaking up but they were moving very, very slowly.  The speed was about the same as an airliner at altitude but the lights were much brighter, and they disappeared in a clear area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total duration of sighting was 20-30 seconds.<n>

From my backyard I look up towards the Southwest direction (about 260 or 265 degrees)  Above the trees is a ball of light with an orange spike. I look at it with my binoculars but it still just looks like a ball of light with an orange spike.  My binoculars are not very strong.   On Friday, 25 Oct 13, I see the same light with spike and I have another person with me and he sees the same thing I see, but just dismisses it as “Venus”.  I would also but this light is sporadic.  It was there Friday, 25 Oct 13, but was not there on 26 or 27 Oct 13.  It was on 28 and 29 Oct 13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been seeing this ball of light off and on for about 2 or 3 months.  It has been seen in the same area each time except for 28 and 29 Oct 13.  It has moved more southerly (about 255 degrees).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It starts out each night just above the trees and then arcs westerly until it disappears below the horizon. It takes about an hour or so for it to arc and go below the horizon.  The movement is much faster than any of the stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I say above the trees I mean that it is about 40 degrees from the ground.  Without a more powerful scope I cannot get a greater amount of detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to take photos but my camera just recorded, on full zoom, a far distant light with on detail.<n>

We first saw the object around 6:30PM on October 29, 2013.  Location was on the northern tip of the Monterey Bay near Santa Cruz, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and this was the only object showing in the sky.  It was very bright and looked like it was slightly moving, but it never went anywhere.  It wasn’t an airplane of any sort.  The object was round.  I have a video I made of it with my Sony Camera 20X lens and it appears to be dancing slightly around, occasionally dipping.  I don’t understand this, because with the naked eye it doesn’t appear to be doing anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s the curious thing.  It’s now 8:00PM and the object is still in the same place, except it’s moved lower, and I have to assume it’s because the earth is moving, and not because the object has moved lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of this, I feel this is probably a satellite, but I’ve lived here in the same place for the past 14 years and have never noticed it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no background in this type of thing as do none of the other observers.<n>

Once I dropped off my friend to work (25 sec) I stopped in the Wells Farge parking lot across from the hospital to get a better look.  The whole plume of smoke was gone and there was just a very small puff of white smoke where the object was located.  I took aprox 6 photographs of the puff of smoke.  I looked at them via Photoshop and the puff of smoke was discolored yellow and orange.<n>

It caught my attention because of its size and how low it was over the roof top of the house.  I estimate its size to be bigger than a full moon and I liken its shape to be diamond like.  It had lights along the tips and partial perimeter.  I tried chasing it to get a picture but was obscured by tree line and street lights.  I chased it for about 10 min. but lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also mention that there was no engine noise.  I rolled my window down to see if it was an airplane but it was absolutely quiet.<n>

I live in a rural area (it’s very dark) and often gaze up at the sky and practice picking out constellations or stars.  I have done this almost all my life and I have never seen anything that I could not explain outright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday October 28th at approximately 08:17 PM PDT I was facing SW and at around 70 degrees above the horizon just above some tall fir trees I saw a bright light turn ON like a flashlight in the sky then turn off approximately 1 or 2 seconds later.  It was not moving.  It was approximately 7 to 10 times brighter than the stars around it and most certainly not an aircraft light.  It may have been 3 times the size of the closest star.  I waited and it occurred again approximately 2 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although a dull sighting, it was odd enough to me that I figured if someone else saw it and was hesitant to report it they might see my report and add a corroborating report.

I thought it was the landing lights of an approaching aircraft.  There was a second less intense light below it that moved with it as if suspended.  It did not appear to be approaching as fast as a jet would.  I made a right (northerly) turn and observed the light now to my left.  It seemed suspended in the sky at an altitude of perhaps 800-1000 meters.   A left turn kept the object on my left where it stayed for 15 minutes in much the same position, but moving slowly west away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon arriving home my wife and I went outside with binoculars and observed the object for 15 minutes.  It was definitely two lights vertically positioned.  It did not appear to be moving in the sky although it was now some distance further west.  It moved much too slowly for a plane and the intensity of the lights did not change.  A planet or star would not have changed position relative to my travel.  Perhaps it was a weather balloon drifting slowly.  At the closest point it seemed to less than a mile away and was very bright.  It may have receded to a distance of 10- 15 miles when stopped observing.<n>

A coworker and I were chatting as usual, on our break.  When, at 0:06, on October 28th 2013, we looked up and seen a fire orange colored glowing sphere come over the store, heading due north.  It was moving at twice the speed, if not more, than the typical aircraft seen in that area.  The size of the glowing sphere, to the naked eye, was about if you were looking at a dime you were holding up in your hand with your arm fully extended.  The first sphere was visible for roughly 20-30 seconds, before it moved far enough to be out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost at exactly the moment when the first sphere was out of sight, a second sphere appeared from the exact location as the first. It looked exactly like the first sphere, moving at the same speed, and following the same flight path.  I watched as it moved through the sky, and when it got nearly out of sight, I looked at the point in where it came from to see if there would be any others.  To my amazement, a third fire colored glowing sphere appeared from the exact location as the two before it.  Yet again, it was exactly identical in looks, traveling speed, and flight pattern as the previous two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My coworker and I stood there baffled as to what they could be.  Another coworker, who was out collecting carts, came and asked us if we had seen them too.  He had told us that he had noticed one of them hovering in one place, just minutes before we had come out for our break.  Though, he may be a bit of a strange fellow, he is an honest one, and I have no doubts that if he said he witnessed one hovering, then that is what he saw.  I have thought and thought of possible explanations as to what the spheres could of been, but there is nothing that seems logical.  The movements of the spheres were that of military precision.  This event is by far the strangest I have ever experienced.<n>
10/27/13 22:15|Pittsburgh|PA|Fireball|1-2 minutes|Saw "Fireballs" in the sky last night.  Same as many other UFO video and sightings.  Have pictures.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103596.html|74|ndxe201310| Saw &amp;quot;Fireballs&amp;quot; in the sky last night.  Same as many other UFO video and sightings. Have pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx. 9:15 P.M., I was on the phone with my mother and from behind the tall oak trees, I saw 3 very large fire ball looking objects in the sky.  They were flying relatively low, juxtaposed to the typical air traffic I see here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The balls were in a V formation, but were floating and flying at the same time... kind of swerving back and forth, but staying in somewhat of a V formation.  I could barely tell my mother I&#39;d call her back.  Tried to hang up and get my phone camera set up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I focused and clicked, all but one was gone.  Unfortunately, my camera picked up a dot.  They just &#34;went out.&#34;  They didn&#39;t fly away.  The sky was very clear and they definitely did not fly away.  They just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called mom back in a freaked out state and was on the phone with her...  Maybe 3-5 minutes and saw another one coming from the same direction.  This time I didn&#39;t take time to say goodbye.  Got the phone working and when I aimed to take the picture, there were 4 lights on my screen and only 1 in the sky.  I kept snapping pictures, despite my disbelief. There were 4 on the screen and 1 in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It too, just disappeared. All of them would sort of &#34;blink out.&#34;  Again, unfortunately my phone camera stinks, but I did get the fireball and when I expand the photos, the lights look round but the more they expand, they look almost like crescent moons, a fuzzy backwards &#34;C.&#34;   Upon further inspection, I realized that the 2 lights on the bottom of the screen, were house lights.  You can distinguish the other two, as they are much higher in the sky and have the exact same crescent shape upon expanding the photo.  I do not know if the second one appeared whilst I was focused on the other one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched and found a video of another sighting here in Pittsburgh from this past Aug. 2013. found on YouTube.  It&#39;s exactly what I saw.  Also found many videos from around the globe, with the exact thing I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not report it for fear of looking nuts and no one else (apparently) saw them or reported seeing anything.  I am a stay at home mother of 5 children and am the fourth generation on my mother&#39;s side, to live in our old farm house located on the outskirts of the City of Pittsburgh.  We have lots of land here, despite still being in the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that what I saw was not normal.  We have regular air traffic flying overhead, as the airport is relatively close by.  I saw airplanes, shortly after these sightings.  These were not airplanes.  When I saw the exact same things, littered all over UFO sighting websites and YouTube, my heart sank further.  This scared me enough to be up all night researching and to now be reporting this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason, I can&#39;t check the information below.  I would definitely like to be contacted.  I also have a story about my sister and I when we were kids.  Hesitant to share it online.<n>

I do this several times during the evening every night weather it&#39;s clear out or not.  I have these Binoculars that can see star&#39;s that the naked eye can&#39;t see with out them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just got done scanning the Western sky&#39;s when an airliner coming out of the South heading East caught my eye.  I followed the plane for a few seconds (now I&#39;m facing east) and I bent my head back while turning to the West and this huge bright light caught me, really by surprise.  It just wasn&#39;t there a few seconds ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live next to an airport and have flown myself a few times, so when I say that it was about 15,000 ft. that&#39;s a pretty good guess.  So any way I latch on to this light with these binoculars and I&#39;m watching it fly over my head for about a minute and all of a sudden the light goes out but I can still see the damn thing.  I&#39;m watching this for a good 30 seconds when it just cloaked out on me.  That&#39;s right, it just disappeared on me.  I saw what looked like heat waves first and it slowly just disappeared.  And it didn&#39;t make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a really good look at this ship, it was teardrop shape with2 the small end going forward. It looked to be black and gray in color with oval shape windows on the sides.  It looked like a large light with some sort of markings the on the bottom.  I am in the process of making a mechanical drawing of the ship.  I feel like Richard Dreyfus in Close Encounters of the Third Kind with all the sketches and drawings I have hanging around in my office. This is by far the coolest thing that I have ever seen.<n>

I do not believe it was an aircraft because of the size of the lights and the speed they were moving they were moving around each other and were larger than the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise and they were moving extremely fast.  I have seen rockets and all kinds of aircraft in this area but this did not resemble anything of the sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My kids came outside to look at the orbs and they also were very intrigued by the site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe they were landing lights of an aircraft but they were moving away from me for a very good distance and the appearance of the lights never changed it appeared that they were high in the sky and moving over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a police officer for several years and I have seen my share of strange things but this was unexplainable to me.<n>

The best analogy I can think of is moving Christmas ornaments!  A red top, perhaps round, not sure, with a long glowing downward tail, again, all red.  The first objects were four in number, not in rigid formation, but somewhat close together, followed by two more objects 10 seconds or so later, followed again by two more objects, about 20 seconds later.  Since I don&#39;t know how high up they really were, I cannot estimate their speed, BUT, sometimes one or two would slow down just a bit, and then so would the others.  It is a quiet night up here, little to no wind, clear sky with stars, not much traffic in my neighborhood 2 blocks from Lake Erie.<n>

It seemed to be traveling in small circles around the summit of the mountain when it was not hovering.  We took a seven minute video of the lights changing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the craft, it appeared to descend toward the ground.  As we were watching it, it appeared to have other flashing lights in the distance.  I would have to describe them as small explosions.<n>

Had been working at my computer until then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked over the Alberni Inlet, I noticed a large, slow moving light in the Western sky, somewhat to the South.  Approximately opposite the APD mill.   It was too big and not bright enough to be a planet or star, too slow moving to be a normal aircraft.  It slowly moved towards the tree line, looked like it was just above the trees.  I realized it was exceptionally unusual and I should get my camera.  I ran in and grabbed my camera and came out and shot about half a dozen pictures.  None are that clear, but by zooming in on the computer I could see a perfectly round object with raised markings on the bottom:  ridges and indentations going in a circle………….almost like a “copyright” seal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I phoned a friend who lived at the lake, somewhere on the other side of that mountain.   While I was telling her to look in the Eastern sky, back towards town, she said: “ I see it through the trees, a light in the sky”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her to try and get a photo but haven’t managed to connect with her yet to see if she did.

We have been keeping our eyes to the sky ever since our last sighting this past summer.  In the western sky we saw what appeared to be a very very bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a few minutes and noticed it starting to dim from a bright white to an orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving slowly but clearly moving. It was not stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to get binoculars and when seen up closer you could see that it was a cluster of 4-6 lights.  The object started to descend lower and the dogs in our neighborhood including our dog, started to bark and howl.  It was crazy!!  We decided to see if it reacted to our flashlight.  We flashed the object 3 quick flashes and to our amazement the street light repeated our exact flash pattern.   We repeated the flashes several times and it repeated the pattern with the street light closest to where we were standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of fear, we stopped and just watched the light get brighter and then blink out completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to go out and come back brighter each time. The light dropped below our line of site and we decided to go inside. We heard 2 jets traveling across the sky in the area of our sighting for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 20 minutes of activity it ended and we came in and decided to report what we saw. The skies over Cape Cod, MA are clearly full of activity. That is what we saw.<n>

This night happened to be a good night a recent cold front has came in and the sky&#39;s where fairly clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat on my patio and noticed a veeeery high altitude plane flying in the SSE direction of area (it blinked a light every about 15-30 secs and seemed to be in the same spot not moving) I called for my friend to check it out because I haven&#39;t seen anything like it before , I pointed it out to him and he also saw the blinking dot high in the sky ( don&#39;t know if it was a plane or what it might have been), but it was very unusual .... The next thing I know I start to see a faint star like object moving overhead of me from the direction of that blinking light.  The object that was moving was not flashing was not getting brighter or dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object move from one side of the sky to another side moving in all directions speeding up slowing down and even stopping right overhead of me.  I began to freak out asking my friend if he sees what I see and how the heck is it moving left and right stopping and freely flying across the sky like that I repeatedly said OMG a ufo OMG a ufo wtf wtf.  It seemed to move from star to star most times then it joined with 2-3 other dim objects made a boomerang like object flew for a few seconds and just disappeared.  I was speechless I don&#39;t know what I seen but what ever it was it will be stuck in my mind with me forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know my sky well I love spaceweather and I am very informed on space related news and objects ...  What I saw was noting close to a plane not a satellite not a comet or meteor or helicopter this was a dim star like object moving freely in any direction it wanted to in any speed it wanted to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 3 dim objects disappeared I was curious to see if that blinking light (plane or what ever it was ) was still there it was not anymore.<n>

(now I had already seen a &#34;UFO&#34; 2 other times in the last year but didn&#39;t really tell anyone about them cause they were not as significant.  my mom and sister were with me the first time and the second time I was with only my sister)  I looked where he pointed..  it was to the right side of the road and was slowly LANDING behind some buildings.  they looked pretty run down but it was dark and I don&#39;t remember too well..  it looked like a track discus and had bright blue lighting around the sides of it..  I plan on going back to the spot soon to take a look around.  maybe I mistook it for... cant imagine what..  I had my window down and started yelling at another person so they could see it too but they didn&#39;t hear me.  nobody believes me..  impossible to believe were alone in this universe and there aren&#39;t highly intelligent life forms capable of visiting other planets..  it drifted in slowly at a slight downward angle and slightly to my right.<n>

I looked away for a little bit talking to my husband and he kept watching it.  He told me it then moved slowly off to the left behind a house and just seemed to disappear.<n>

These lights flew right over us and I opened the sunroof on our car so I could get a good look at them.  Some of the orange lights seemed bigger than the others did almost like some were flying higher than others were.  We are in our 40&#39;s and neither of us have EVER seen anything like this.  It must be something the government is working on like a bunch of drones that follow the interstate until they get to their destinations or something?

At first glance I thought it was a plane.  As I looked more carefully I became alarmed that it may have been on fire.  But I grew up watching planes, satellites, space stations, comets and this was nothing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from a Northerly direction in a steady, straight line and traveled toward the South. It was not particularly high but just below the small amount of cloud cover.  It was a large glowing orange orb. It was absolutely silent, no noise at all.  It was just this mass of blazing orange.  As it traveled past me I could almost discern a type of shape or structure to it.  The color then changed to a whiter glow  and it got very small then just disappeared.  Not like a plane diminishing on the horizon, it just blinked out.  Moments later a small aircraft headed over and I could clearly discern the blinking lights and engine drone.  It headed East toward a small airport but I feel it had no relation to what it was I saw.<n>

I was looking due west from my front porch.  At first I thought they were airplanes.  One was traveling a little lower and behind the other.  Then suddenly the front object changed course and flew straight up.  Then turned and headed downward.  There were blinking lights coming from both of the objects.  One of them had green and red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran and got my iphone and I took a video, which I have posted on youtube.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happened to look to the west, and a moving light caught my eye.  It was approximately at a 75% angle from my position, moving ESE. I watched it for several seconds, arcing across the sky.  It was moving fairly quickly, but clearly wasn&#39;t a plane.  I thought it might be a satellite, but then I realized this was definitely much lower than others I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my friend, asking her what she thought it was. She suggested satellite as we watched the object continuing to cross the sky. Suddenly, the object zig-zagged several times. I said, &#34;Did that just zig-zag?&#34; My friend concurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued toward the east, it appeared to be descending enough so that we could now see a little detail (versus a bright white light).  The object was clearly triangular in shape.  We asked her daughter to join us on the deck and she observed the object with us until the end of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object zig-zagged again and then suddenly just stopped.  At that point, we were flabbergasted.  None of us have ever seen anything like this.  The object then appeared to shoot a beam of some kind toward the south - but it was short, seemed controlled.  As soon as it stopped emitting the light, it began moving east again, heading toward some cloud cover.  Before it ever got there, it just suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out several times after this to see if there was anything else out there, but have seen nothing.<n>

They resembled the lights of planes except their motions were entirely different and they were spread about in a way that was contrary to the structure of a plane.  The lights moved incredibly slowly and were hovering more than flying or moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first observer remained parked at the bottom of the driveway and called the second observer, a seventeen-year-old female, who was inside the house.  She turned off the porch lights and looked outside to see several of the red dots still hovering in the sky. By the time she saw them there were only three left.  As she looked, they grew dimmer and dimmer.  They looked like they were simply fading away instead of moving somewhere else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the event the second witness discovered that a friend who lives several miles away saw the same thing; the friend alleges that he, his cousin, and his father saw 26 &#34;bright yellow&#34; lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashes of light in question did not appear to be connected in any way.  They seemed entirely independent of each other, not like lights attached to something larger.  The first witness notes that they covered a large amount of area in the sky and that he initially mistook them for a mass of jets but realized they moved far too slowly.<n>

The light was much wider in diameter than a typical star (perhaps 5 times as wide) and much brighter.  The light appeared to be somewhat far from us as it was way out on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few moments of staring at the light trying to figure out what it was, both my girlfriend and I started to feel a strange energy in the air (that of a presence), and everything felt exceptionally quiet and still.  Within a few minutes, we started to notice an aircraft flying directly toward the light.  The aircraft was sleeker than a commercial aircraft so it was my guess that it was a military aircraft.  That hypothesis was reinforced when the aircraft slowed down to almost a complete stop as it was approaching the light, something that I think would be atypical of a commercial aircraft.  After that airplane arrived, we noticed helicopters approaching in the distance.  I have to admit that the energy that we felt coupled with the approaching aircrafts made my girlfriend and I pretty uneasy as it felt like something big was about to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole time the light did not move in any direction, but it did have a slight pulse to it with a period of a few seconds.  During that time the light went from bright to slightly brighter and slightly larger and then back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5-10 minutes of very still, tense energy, the white light disappeared.  The way in which it disappeared is kind of difficult to explain.  It appeared to get smaller and fade in brightness until it completely vanished.  It was almost as if it flew into the distance at an extremely fast rate.  For this to have been the case, it would have been flying further toward the horizon and the opposite direction of where we were.  The disappearance of the light took approximately two seconds.  After that the energy subsided and the aircraft left the area.<n>

Initially we thought it was ome sort of conventional aircraft located around 3/4 mile due North and over a calabasas residential community.  After 90 seconds of observation, it became evident by the two green lights and its unusual movement and lack of sound that it was neither a toy, blimp, airplane or helicoptor.  The object changed direction in 90 and 180 degree angles.  We couldn&#39;t tell if it was a very small object a few hundred yards North of us or a larger object several miles from us.  We only know that it was between us and the opposing mountain range which varies from 6 to 20 miles.  Except for noting that the object appear! ed to be South of the halfway line (I.e. nearer us) there&#39;s no way to determine its size or exact location. It eventually moved due West (down the valley) and just as it was moving &#34;out of sight&#34; being obscured by a wall on the edge of our property, it stopped &#34;on a dime&#34; and descended vertically like an elevator.  It covered that western movement in about 30 seconds.  However, where it descended was in the range on the other side.  So either as it moved horizontally due West, it did so with a slightly Northward direction, or it had been further away suggest it was quite large and moving far faster than the maximum allowed by the local Air Traffic Control of 250 mph.  Depending on its nearness to us that distance could have ranged from 1 to 20 miles, 120 mph to 2400 mph.<n>

When I wa directly behind it the wings looked huge like 70&#39; or so, and were barely visible, like they were 3 inches thick.  Strange sight can&#39;t explain!<n>

And I caught a glimpse of a blue light I thought it was just a chance I was seeing the power going through the lines in the powerlines. I told my buddy to look up and I looked also.  We seen 7 blue objects they would get in close and zoom off extremely fast.  And would go back and do the same every time they went away they would go further and further apart.  We stood and watched and we went and got my younger brother and my buddy&#39;s younger brother and told them to look.  They went back in we went to get my freinds dad and we took him to where we seen them and they weren&#39;t there no more.<n>

Looking Southwest from Waikiki, at about 19.5 degrees above the horizon, in hazy clouds, an extremely bright light would flash, and light up everything as if a full Moon were out.  This was briefly preceded by some dimmer, flickering that lightened the entire black sky to blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honolulu International Airport began service and the first airliner took off Southward along the shoreline then headed East as the lights continued their routine.  The next jet took off following the same flight path, but stopped short just before arriving to the cloud with the light, then circled back to the airport.  Then another jet took off, went to the cloud, and circled back to land, as well.  The lights continued, and finally three more planes took off, one of them a commercial airliner, the other two smaller, propeller planes, all headed on the same path East as the first plane.  The lights continued until the morning sky just turned from black to blue.<n>

The difference was there was a series of noise that affected the appliances making them flash on them off more than once.  I noticed that the aquarium light was the only light that remained on after the power supply was interrupted. The clocks on the microwave and oven were reset.  I was located in the kitchen/living room the whole time and saw this all. I walked outside for reason unknown, just felt compelled to. I saw a craft in the sky which moved across overhead until eye level, my head tilted slightly up.  The craft paused then dropped directly down at a higher rate of speed than the movement halfway across the sky. The craft had a white lights across the center and shaped like a cigar with middle thicker than ends. I am an open-minded person, yet needs facts,  mainly seeing or experiencing to truly accept and believe, whatever the case is. Th! at day seemed very long to me.  I set a mechanical Sturling watch at one point in the morning which now states a different time.<n>

It was cold outside and I went to go shut the window and looked out to see what he was looking at and saw a bright light at the top of the tree line not far away.  One of the lights was moving around pointing down toward the ground as if searching for something.  A few seconds later the lights disappeared.  I heard no sound at anytime.<n>

Early Saturday morning I was about to pack up the scope after enjoying very clear skies over L.A., when I noticed that a thick carpet of clouds had suddenly appeared from nowhere and was engulfing the sky.  The light from the moon highlighted some of the clouds as they sailed past it.  Through the telescope I observed what looked like a large rectangular white &#34;shelf&#34; moving up and down, in and out of a thick cloud.  It appeared to be billowing clouds out of itself. Creating them.  I watched it for roughly 10-15 seconds before it left the scopes field of vision and I could not locate it again, mainly because I have limited sky vision due to surrounding trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed many bizarre, creepy clouds over the past few years but have never witnessed anything mechanical in behavior until Saturday.

They flew faster than any plane I ever say.  They flew interwining paths.  Both had a red light at top and both appeared to be in the shape of a cross with the horizontal arms of the cross the widest.  The cross was all in light.  No sign of any metal craft.  They paused for a second when I waved hello from my porch which was lite up.  When I opened my jacket to pull out my strongest glasses they flew south toward the bird sanctuary which is all forest and deserted.  Both UFOs were silent yet only were about 500 feet off the group and barely 1 full city block away over the ocean.  I thought they were fighter jets because of the red light at top.  However, I realized later they were UFOs since planes do not appear as light in the shape of a cross.  They appeared at first as flying stars.  When I put on my strongest glasses for fine reading I could see the light had a red light on top with a cross shape of white light.  The arms of the cross of light were the widest.  40 years ago my mom and I would watch these UFOs fly high up in the sky.  We have not see any UFOs in the area ever since.  This is the first time they have returned and the first time they fly so low.  A MIG flew by years ago when the President of the USA permitted a MIG to flew across the country.  So my home is a flight path for civilian and military craft.  For this reason I thought the 2 UFOs were USA fighter planes until I realized the crafts were all light and nothing metal formed the crafts.  The red light on top of each craft told me that they must be USA or earth bound crafts so I did not call any authorities.<n>

The crafts must have been USA airplanes or from earth since both had a red light on top.  Odd thing is that they were totally silent even though 500 feet above ground and about the width of 2 city blocks away traveling fast.  Since they were heading toward me could explain that I could only see bright lights.  This could have been their head lights.  However, why would anyone trying to conceal their identity travel with all lights on and a red light on top ?  Also the next morning the beach coastline had fishermen and their SUVs all side by side in front of my house.  Fish run in August I thought even though some people have told me that the fish run in late October.  That night I saw a shooting star that headed in the direction of where those 2 UFOs came from.  So another ship may have joined them or was trying to hook up with them.  I read another report that someone else further down the Barrier Island where I saw this als! o saw a UFO 2 nights earlier.  I think someone should check Island Beach to see if any ships landed there.  Probably too difficult since it is all bush or brush and sand which the wind and ocean could easily cover the landing marks.  There is also many marsh areas to easily cover landing marks.  My hunch is that there crafts were from Earth,  However, the unanswered question is why them did the 2 crafts travel so fast so low and so silently ?  No sound at all and there was barely any breeze that night to prevent the sound from traveling to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were in no real formation however they did not break the formation they were in what was a scattered but still close to each other group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear but there are plenty of strip malls, hospitals, restaurants etc in the area so only the brightest stars illuminate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried desperately to catch it on a camera phone pic however it was unable to be captured.

Looking up toward downtown and Venus.  5 undulating oblong orange rectangular shapes appeared next to each other in almost a rhythmic dance.  They stayed clumped together moving back and forth and spinning.  We both observed them for the duration.  They were brighter than Venus, and larger in the sky than a star would appear.  They appeared substantial in size, and not like the blinking lights of an airplane would appear.  They had mass, and appeared as pulsating orange shapes with a glowing white center and white around the edges.  They spread out and contracted their distance from each other continuously.  At the end they swarmed together and almost combined into one point of light in one large mass, then they moved off in different directions and faded out into nothingness.<n>

The formation hung suspended in the air.   I could not tell if the lights were moving away to the northeast, or fading from view.  I drove to a safer vantage point at a church parking lot on Rt 103 but fewer lights were visible and they were gone from view within another two minutes.  The last of the lights were those at the extreme right side of the formation, the lights to the east.  At first glance I thought I was looking a fireworks, but the formation covered to large an area and did not fall through the ! sky or move the way fireworks would and they remained visible for minutes not seconds the way fireworks would.  Best guess would be some sort of flares, but very unusual.  Also way too many lights to be simple air traffic.  I&#39;ve lived here for the past 22 years and this was not air traffic.  Some such traffic was visible in the sky and the lights from those craft was much whiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About twelve more minutes went by and we watched the triangle turn to a straight line.  As we kept driving about two min more goes by and these crafts are now by us coming from the south side of the interstate over and heading northeast.  They were going so very slow and they were extremely low to the ground everyone on the interstate slowed to about 49 mph and some were pulling over.  I opened my sunroof as one went right over us and i could not make out a silhouette.  It was the scariest thing I have ever seen and I still have no idea what it was.  There was a big line of huge bright white lights and orange and red lights around the rest of it. no noise or blinking of the lights.<n>

I tried to take picture but the object didn&#39;t appear on my blackberry camera, tried other camera still the same.  My mother, sister and brother inlaw also saw it.  Many people at hospital yard saw me trying to photo the object on the sky.  I saw this same type of object already 3 times around the same time at sunset.  I really believe there must be something special about the area that they need to monitor or do.  It is important that this organization take this report seriously and do what it is necessary.  Thank you.<n>

You could see the lights circling really fast  and in the same circle formation for 10 minutes.  At first I thought it was strobe lights, but then realized you cannot see the lights hitting the bottom of the cloud nor the lights through the air.  Just small white lights circling above the clouds.  Creaped me out!<n>

Lights remained contained and cloud disappeared after 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near to our apartment building, we have a 3 kilometer cylindrical track which I frequent regularly.  It is also very close to the flight path for Dubai’s International Airports but the aircrafts do not fly over the track.  As I was walking round my second lap, I noticed a heavy cloud above one of the mosques.  The rest of the sky was quite clear, even though it was dark.  Excited at the prospect of rain, I continued to watch the cloud.  There were other people using the track but no one was taking any notice.  The cloud had yellow, red and purple lights flashing inside it, one after the other, but in no sequence at all.  At first, I thought it was fire-works – I thought that a few families may have had some left over from our Eid Al Adha celebrations which passed last week.   I also thought it was a plane passing through or even a helicopter hovering…but there was no sound and absolutely nothing came out of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought that it may have been a d! rone but to be honest, I am not familiar with drone activity in Dubai.  The lights kept flashing, one after the other but, as stated earlier, in no particular sequence.  The strange thing was that the light remained contained in the cloud.  As I was watching, something like a lightning bolt flashed just to the right part of the cloud…but the shape was not a typical forked lightning, more of a slight spiral.  The lights were flashing for a good 5 or 10 minutes, but the bolt struck only once.  I was waiting to hear thunder to accompany it, but nothing came.  I also thought it may have come from the chimneys of a sewage plant nearby (they have lights on to warn aircraft of their height).  My training program requires me to start running after 1000 m, which I did – I ran 500 m, with the cloud on my right hand side, then turned around to come back to see it again.  The cloud had vanished and the sky was clear.  It was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen.  I posted, jokingly,! about it on Facebook and two of my friends had reported seein! g the ab solute same thing yesterday, in two different parts of Dubai.<n>

Looked like a planets or star but def not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking from route 2-13 near Brantwood Golf Course (Bittersweet) in the direction towards Delaarea where Walmart is (I&#39;m estimating), I saw an object with blinking orange lights slowly float (like a kite does) out into the sky above to me looked like Walmart would be, and kinda just &#39;hang out&#39; up in the sky for at least over 20 minutes.  It seemed to be floating up and down but it was far away but close enough to see it going up &amp; down, just floating/hovering.  I noticed a number of planes (3-5) take paths directly at it or towards it, as if they were trying to identity what it was.  Two nights before last, a saw an object similar literally float on by at about the same height a bird would.  It again seemed like kite but was obviously not floating.  It was definitely propelling itself forward and made no sound at all.  It literally passed right above me again with flashing orange-ish lights.  It then headed out toward in direction of Walmart area where it again was! just &#39;hanging out&#39;.  The object I saw above me did not seem that large but the object above Walmart had to have been large for me to see from my house.  You&#39;d a thought it was a star if just glanced.  Definitely no meteor/kite/flare/balloon.  It never made any movements they I felt were &#39;outta this world&#39; but whatev it was, it was definitely different.<n>

As I watched it longer, I saw that there were red, blue and white lights flashing in a column.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first stepped outside, it was at about 30 degrees East from direct North.  45 minutes later, it&#39;s at about 60 degrees East from direct North.  It continues to hover there making no sound.

The object was the size of a dime held at arms length and was of a mottled bluish-green color.  I observed the object for just a few seconds.  I was moving from the northeast moving toward the southwest  and was nothing like the hundreds of shooting stars and satellites I have seen over the years.

It flew in the pattern of an &#34;L&#34; shape and started to descend in the distance in a wooded area.  We actually took a drive to try to find it but was unsuccessful.

It was so fast i couldnt film it since i was not anticipating seeing a ufo tonight :)  No lights, it must have been white.  it was very light colored against the night sky but not illuminated.  it looked like a giant bird (i thought it was a strand or flock of birds at first, but the shape moved in perfect unison) or a massive hang glider and was out of sight in 5 seconds.  It flew directly over my house heading south.<n>

It was spproximately the same color orange as the orange bar of a Seagate Free Agent external disk drive.  I am not positive on the date or the time, because I initially brushed it off as a drone, but listening to the other reports that Peter Davenport was talking about on Coast to Coast got me to rethink that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, Venus was still visible at the time- different color, so there was no chance of mistaking the light observed as Venus, but the object was comparable in magnitude. It had no other lights, and 2 small aircraft were in the area during the time of the observation as well, and they were audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used the roof peak of my chicken coop as a reference point to make sure the item was indeed in motion, and it was.  Over the course of time I observed the item, it only seemed to move about within an arc of about 5 to 10 degrees horizontally.  It did finally appear to descend below tree line quickly when the second small aircraft entered the area, which at the time seemed to suggest this was a drone, but at the angle I was observing it from, a horizontal flight of adequate velocity directly away from my vantage point would also appear as descent in a vertical direction as well.<n>

At first I thought it was perhaps the space station, as this is sometimes observed just after dark on a clear night.  However, this object had an irregular flight path and came to a complete stop and hovered.  When first sighted, the object appeared triangular with faint yellow-orange lights.  After hovering for a moment, the object suddenly and sharply began to move my direction in a descent and for a brief moment I could observe a large dark cylindrical object dotted with faint yellow-orange lights.  The object appeared to ascend, at which point it became faint again.  The object then moved in a SW direction and was barely visible after another 30 seconds.  The entire event lasted about 3 to 4 minutes and the object traveled about 15 miles in the final 30 seconds, not including elevation changes.  The object made no detectable soun! d.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I observed 2 orange objects hovering over a residential neighborhood. I thought they were Halloween Kites or remote control toys because it was Halloween and reasonable weather for kids/teens to be outside, although rare to see activity at this time of night in this part of the city.  I also thought they could be Street Lights within the neighborhood, but they were too high and orange...wrong color for street lights. I was on the phone with my son and told him I was going to pull into the neighborhood to verify what I was seeing.  I was astounded!  Absolutely no noise, no movement.  The objects change color only slightly from orange to orangish-red, then back to a orange/yellow mix as if to blend in with the street lights.  I stopped my car in the middle of the street, looked for my camcorder in the car and trunk.  Had kept it in my car for 2 weeks, but remembered I left it at home to charge the battery!  As I searche! d for it, I continued to peer up at the objects to insure I wasn&#39;t seeing things, all the while, discussing this with my son on the phone.  Not 1 car pulled into the neighborhood. I attempted to flag down a few cars on the main road but few were out and none responded.  I pointed to the sky and just as I decided to knock on a house door, the objects began moving.  There was no sound whatsoever.  They were approx. 150-200feet up and approximately 50-100ft.apart from each other.  They moved in unison laterally for about 100ft.,very slowly and methodically and then began an upward ascent in the same manner. Crossing over the main road heading south, southwest.  I didn&#39;t knock on anyone&#39;s door because this area is so quiet and didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me anyway.  Actually, was concerned they&#39;d call the police, which in hindsight would have been appropriate but as I leaned against my car, frustrated no witnesses, no one noticing them, nothing on the radio reporting this sight! , the objects had moved away to a point not real visible from ! my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They began to blend in with the night sky and I watched them fade away and blend in as if they were just another star in the sky!! I thought of calling the Airport or local News, but felt it was too late.  I listened for the next 2 months to Coast to Coast and now reports are coming in of these same type objects in various states. I also hear that Amazon has been testing Drones, so maybe that&#39;s what these were. I took my cousin back to the same area the next night at the same time thinking if it was kids an kites they&#39;d most likely be out again since it was a Friday night, with no school the next day.  Nothing, absolutely no sign of any activity, kids, kites, nor Drones.  I am a Retired Postal Service Clerk and my son has an MBA in Finance. I told others about this incident and it does not surprise anyone. Seems most have given up caring...just gonna live as well and peaceful and happy as they can while waiting for the End Times to Arrive. Not a bad philosophy, but I intend ! to fight on and for the side of Good, not ready to surrender to Evil just yet.  Not that UFO&#39;s are necessarily Evil, but possibly those behind these drones and/or technology may very well be operating from a Dark Side.  Thank-you for the opportunity to report this!<n>

It dropped altitude very rapidly and hovered just above a cloud that seemed suspended over the valley.  While it was close to the cloud, the cloud had kind of, dim rolling flashes inside the very top of it when the object would momentarily approach it.  It continued to bounce very quickly gaining and losing altitude, dipping vertically in and out of this cloud.  Every so often it would do a circular motion on the way up or down.

When we got to the base of hill area, we stopped the car, rolled down all the windows &amp; tried to figure out what it was.  It then slowly started moving across the sky.  Low enough that we could definitely see that it had a &#34;airplane&#34; shape with wing, and the bright orange light.  It made absolutely no sound at all, was completely silent.  It was low enough that we would have absolutely been able to hear it, if it was any type of normal aircraft.  No sound.  Moved pretty slowly over us and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Everybody said what is that?  Like it really caught our attention.  It wasn&#39;t no airplane it really spooked us out.  Even my son saw it and we was tripping.  I asked him what did he think of it he said Ma, I don&#39;t know but it was no airplane I think it was a UFO and I said me too because if watching the channels on tv about the research and looking at pictures taken over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my mind automatically thought it was a UFO.  But back to the story it was getting big as if it was getting closer and like came down as if it wanted to see who we was then it flew back upwards and stand still.  Then it started to move in a slow motion flying away and disappeared in the air.  And for the record watching reporting&#39;s on tv and UFO sightings and discover channel etc I have never seen a black African American report a sighting and I want to say I/WE are the 1st to report a sighting I th! ink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The lights would turn off on one craft and turn on another.  I drove 8 miles and watched the lights move west at approximately 70 to 80 mph.  I stopped at my destination and viewed the lights with a friend.  We counted four different craft that had red orange and white light; they would flash back and forth between each other.  The last lights we saw was at 8:30<n>

It looked like jet maybe getting ready to land at Memphis intl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the planes are on approach you can see their bright landing lights, but there was something a little different, it wasn&#39;t as bright and it made a HARD turn to the east (away from the direction of the airport) which is 30 miles  the opposite the direction it turned, and within maybe a second or two, faded to nothing.  I thought maybe they turned the landing lights off, but there were no strobe lights, nothing, it was gone, and satellites don&#39;t turn like that, at least not to my knowledge.<n>

They stayed in front of me for several minutes then eventually were on my left side (north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While changing angles I noticed no anti-collision lights on the object.  I did however notice what appear to be some type of military aircraft above the object flying steady with the lights (500+/- feet).  I was able to see 4 anti-collision lights on the aircraft above the object.  While returning to Holly Springs the object had circled back from the northwest and was heading southeast towards it original location.  Again it appeared a military aircraft was still flying near by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I returned home I noticed the inbound aircraft to RDU were in a holding pattern toward the north with several dark aircraft heading toward the direction of the lights.  We do have a military base to our south however these lights did not appear to have any normal aircraft landing or flying light pattern.  The lights appeared to be visible from 360 which struck me as odd as well as no anti-collision lights visible from any angle.<n>

10/24/13 19:15|Cedarville|CA|Light|45-60 minutes|Small red light followed by orange orbs that appeared, multiplied, and disappeared.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103590.html|181|ndxe201310| Small red light followed by orange orbs that appeared, multiplied, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My spouse and I were staying at a small resort in Cedarville, CA on October 23 and 24th 2013.  The morning of the 24th, two of the staff members at separate times told me the past few nights some strange lights were seen in the sky and we should come out that evening to watch.  They told us the lights usually showed up around 7pm or later, after the sun was down, so we made sure that we were ready to watch by that time that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7pm, my spouse and I went out into the fields around the resort to where it was dark and we could see the sky and stars clearly.  It was a very clear night.  We waited a while watching the stars, and sure enough around 7:15 we noticed a red light appear suddenly, far out to the North.  The red light was almost a pinpoint, but still quite bright, and it hovered low over the valley.  We were very perplexed at how erratically it moved, unlike anything you would normally see moving in the sky.  This red light would hover stationary, move right and left, rise and fall, and abruptly change speed, direction, or come to a stop for a few moments before moving again.  It stayed well below the usual altitude of regular aircraft while we watched it, but eventually after about 5-10 minutes, it steadily rose until we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the staff members who had told me about the lights earlier that day met up with us in the field right as the red light was gone.   He had said it usually started with the red light and soon after orange orbs would appear in the sky.  So we waited with him a few more minutes and sure enough, off to the Northeast over Nevada (we were very close to the border), these brilliant glowing orange lights began appearing out of nowhere, fairly low in the sky, just over the mountains.  At first they looked like some kind of flare, but there was something different about their behavior.   They left no trails, made no noise, did not ascend or descend, and there were no other aircraft or vehicles in their area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These glowing orbs would randomly appear, mostly one at a time, but sometimes a few at a time, and would just hang there stationary for anywhere from a few seconds to 10 or 20 seconds.  They would also divide and multiply horizontally into twos and threes, each one shooting out of the one before, stopping at equal distance from each other and hanging there some more before suddenly disappearing.  These orbs would appear and multiply randomly, in the same general area, but at different spots each time.  There were also breaks between each sighting that lasted for several minutes each.  We saw about 25 lights total before they stopped appearing.  By 8pm they had pretty much disappeared altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man who had been watching these lights the nights before said he saw up to 50-80 in one night, and the past few nights he had also heard a very low-frequency roar coming over the mountains from NV when the orbs appeared.  He said it would start low, crescendo over a few minutes then stop abruptly.  He heard it a few times, but we didn’t hear anything that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is absolutely nothing in the area in which we saw these lights, aside from Cedarville and empty desert and mountains on the NV/CA border.  No towns, no airports, no bases, no people, period.  What we saw was very unusual, the kind of event that makes your hair stand on end because of how wrong it was.  Either we saw some kind of extraterrestrial/supernatural occurrence, or our military has some very advanced technology they were testing because it was literally beyond comprehension!<n>

I had seen planes do this many times before.  However, it was still in the exact location when I returned from work five hours later. Once again, I watched for movement.  Approximately after five seconds of viewing the light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then watched the spot for a solid 3 minutes, looking for the light to return or at least what should be blinking attention lights [in case it made a turn].

The cigar craft was all silver no with  absolutely no wings.  The cigar shaped craft looked to be almost the same length as the commercial plane, maybe a little longer. It was very shiny do to the sunlight shinning off of it.  The sky at the time I noticed the two craft, the sky was completely clear.  I did not here any sound do to the height of these craft, i was about 100 yards away from a road at a busy time of day (too much noise from passing vehicles)  How does something fly with no wings??????<n>

Each light had about 15 foot beams trailing from each one it appeared to be some mechanism of propulsion; every time the it turned they leaned the opposite direction of the turn.  It made an air blowing like noise it came within 1/4 mile of me and my house.  I got a very good look at it once the beams were facing westward when it turned.  The object was flat it was sort of pentagon in shape but not equal lengths, the front where the lights were; was a very wide broad point the sides towards the back were at a much narrower angle and much shorte, then a straight line connecting those for the very back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was black except for on the back it was grey- silver like a vent type thing on that straight line back, it moved quite slow actually but in no way resembled a stealth bomber other then the nose of it and its flatness but had no defined wings and a very funky back end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing by my house it proceeded west for about another mile before completely vanishing into thin air.

10/23/13 22:30|Hermitage|TN|Light|3-4 minutes|Red pulsating light "bouncing" while ascending over Nashville area.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103550.html|195|ndxe201310| Red pulsating light &amp;quot;bouncing&amp;quot; while ascending over Nashville area<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of the 23rd of October, 2013, I had just parked my car in the parking lot of my apartment complex.  I was walking from my car to my first floor apartment.  While walking, tired from work and my thoughts strictly on getting home to catch the end of game 1 of the World Series, something else caught my attention.  While looking southwest (referenced by the interstate 40 West running parallel to the direction I was facing), I noticed a red light with a very unusual flashing pattern through the trees outlining the apartment complex.  As the light cleared the outline of the trees, ascending upwards and northeast towards where I was standing, the maneuvering alerted my attention.  The object was bouncing/sliding from left to right, while sometimes descending only to ascend again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called my girlfriend, who lives with me, to come outside and to bring her phone. I started recording a video on my iPhone 5 but still viewing the object visually, not through my phone.  The object was still continuing its unusual flight pattern while ascending and flying closer to my location, improving the visual of the object.  As my girlfriend was walking towards me, I notice the light starting to blur as to dissipate into the low-lying cloud cover.  As my girlfriend tries to locate the object, the objects light disappears, not fade like it would if flying into a cloud.  I immediately get frustrated due to my girlfriend&#39;s inability to locate the object, leaving me to be the only witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sleeping on the incident and replaying the video repeatedly on my phone, there are things that stand out to me personally that might validate the UFO title.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, after my girlfriend could not locate the object and I get frustrated while still recording the video on my phone, she states she sees a plane.  I remember viewing the plane immediately and the object was in surprisingly close distance to the plane from the point the object vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second, while I&#39;m a believer in the paranormal and I do watch the skies for anything unusual, I had already worked a lot of hours at work and my only focus was getting back into my apartment to finish watching the game.  My mind consciously wasn&#39;t looking for anything out of the ordinary.  The light just happened to catch my eye. Lastly, after the object vanished, I stood in the same spot for an additional 6-8 minutes looking for the object to clear out the other side of the cloud.  Judging from the angle and line of direction the ob! ject was traveling, it should have appeared out the end of the cloud if it was a plane. This never happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked inside and discussed it with my girlfriend, it became clear that what I described was not ordinary.  The fact that a plane flew by at a relatively low level was a good reference point for me to also conclude this object wasn&#39;t any plane I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living only an exit away from the Nashville airport, I&#39;ve seen hundreds of planes at almost every hour of the day.  I&#39;ve seen just about every light pattern that flashes from commercial planes and with my previous four year enlistment in the Air Force in Air Transportation, I have seen just about everything you can think when it comes to descriptions of planes and flight paths.  This doesn&#39;t fit anything I have ever encountered or seen.  I am hoping that someone else witnessed this so I have some kind of relevance to this event instead of a lonely encounter.<n>

It was a bright light, and it moved as if it were being controlled or operated.  It was then joined by two (2) other lights and they began weaving in and out of each other very rapidly as they were maneuvering around each other.  They then quickly made a triangle formation and shot off at a speed I have never seen before and vanished from my view.<n>

I am a USAF vet.  Worked as a crew chief on F-16 &amp; F-15 fighter aircraft.  I know the sound of helicopters, Osprey aircraft &amp; of course fighter jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this last week of October we had Osprey aircraft performing exercises one of those day during the afternoon perhaps 4-5 pm.  The sound we heard from within our house while watching TV was not US military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound startled us because of the low persistent humming.  We spent a good 5 to 10 minutes in the street trying to locate the origin of this hum/vibration.  I can not remember if it ended or we just went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry it is not too terribly exciting.  No visual confirmation of the event.  It was quite bizarre. I have lived here for twenty years.  The Osprey do have exercises here ever two months or so. This was not an Osprey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left us a bit unsettled to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDA (3X) FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  My wife is saying it was around the 23rd of October. Her recall is always better than mine.

There was a formation in the shape of an equilateral.  At each corners of the equilateral was a strobing light.  The formation flew across the night sky the same distance apart from horizon to horizon.  It flew over Mingus Mt. toward the Dewey/Prescott area. Shortly after the formation disappeared a plane at a seemingly higher altitude flew behind it.  The plane made it easy to compare that the formation was other than 4 planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband and I were talking about the stars: he had found the little dipper so we decided to look for the big dipper.  Just as we looked out of the front passenger window, we saw a shooting star.  It was round, blue, and the brightest one we had ever seen.  It seemed to be going a lot slower than a shooting star usually does.  Not super slow but noticeably slower and it seemed to be shooting down towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it started glowing orange like it had caught on fire, and there was an orange trail behind it.  I started to get scared, because I thought it was going to hit us, going that fast and traveling down toward us like that, but before it got any closer it was gone.  We didn&#39;t here a crash or see any bright lights.  It just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went online looking for anything about a meteor hitting but we never found anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted about 7 to 9 seconds.<n>

We then noticed these brite orange balls of light appear for bout 10 seconds at a time to the east.  They would be to the north east then appear and the south east, in twos or threes. When we got to camp they did not appear anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night we were around camp at about 9:00 pm they started to appear again.  Same thing southeast and northeast up high and then lower at first we thought they might be fighter jets hitting the afterburners but there was no noise and they were at the left and to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw five of them light up in a diagnal pattern and then two to the left of that.  We heard two other hunters say did you see that, and we talked to them. They appeared in twos for a few more minutes they they stopped.<n>

Again same brightness of light, and stationary in the sky.  They seem to dim then move then go very bright again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my husband and I both use our film cameras now to capture the images - on closer inspection these lights or craft - whatever they are, seem to be in constant motion, almost like they are pulsations of energy, it is very strange to observe.  I also managed to film the Moon - which was very orange, and two of these lights in the same part of the Sky.  We have seen another light tonight 25th of October - same time as always, I always take my camera, and I have filmed it.<n>

I went to get my camera and binoculars, still in the same spot, was round with red blue/green and white flashing lights, either blinking in succession or rotating.  It was far west of me.  Odd thing is there was an exact duplicate of it NE of me as well, same size, same lights, same floating appearance.  I went back out tonight (Thursday) same time, 20:00 and holy smokes there they are!  Same spots, lights behavior everything.  Observed and photographed them again &#39;til around 11 when it got foggy, amazing.  Others have to see these things they&#39;re quite obvious.<n>

It was a clear night and very quiet. these objects were moving towards outer space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was definitely  not any aircraft, nor was it any thing normal.  At this point they started to fade out and then disappear, there were about four that were still visiable for a short bit longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is truly something out of the ordnary..<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the craziest thing I have ever saw or experianced.<n>

The jets were in formation flying from north to south (my best guess).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the jets race by, in the foreground I saw an enormous chevron shaped craft with lights along the bottom silently drift by in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of this craft dwarfed the entire squadron of fighter jets flying in formation.  I pointed it out to a friend who also saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This closely resembled the chevron or delta shaped craft reportedly seen over AZ in the 1990&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This made no noise and disappeared in the tree line after a few minutes.<n>

Times vary between 10 to 25 minutes  They are bright glowing orange, appear to be spherical in shape, appear out of nowhere an disappear without warning.  No sound, very calm outside.  They have sat in a straight line, they move in ways I have never seen an aircraft move before light will dull down an can range in color then will move all over the place then stop hold positions an glow bright again and will continue this type of behavior for some time.  When they go, it&#39;s almost a streak across the sky like a shooting star will do but u have to b paying very close attention or u will not see this.<n>

I was soaking in the hot tub again at Mercey Hot Springs gazing at the blanket of stars when I saw two flashes of bright white light with no accompanying sound from a moving object flying from southwest to the northeast. It was in the same part of the sky as the last sighting.  I&#39;m wondering if these might be iridium flares?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I saw several shooting stars, a satellite, and numerous planes again to compare it with.<n>
10/23/13 19:30|Stilwell|KS|Sphere|30 minutes|Contact with intelligent UFO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD))|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103649.html|208|ndxe201310| Contact with intelligent UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were travelling west bound to go home and saw what we thought was a very bright star in the south west.  We then observed that the object was indeed moving and travelling north westwards.  The craft had no navigation lights and had one bright light on one side of the craft that seemed to be intelligently rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really gave us chills was when I flashed my bright lights on my car, the object seemed to rotate and the light was brighter than ever as if it had rotated and focused in our direction.  The craft had stopped Its forward motion when it seemed to become interested in our flashing lights.  We lost sight as we were driving westwards due to trees and turned around to see if we could observe the object longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled into a coldesac and could still see the object travelling slowly north westwards and the bright light would randomly dim and become bright again as if it were rotating.   The object seemed directly linked with me flashing my bright lights and brake lights which I did several times.  Each time the object would turn around and focus the beam north eastwards torward our direction.  At one time an airplane passed a long ways away behind the object and as the airplane passed the object seemed to turn and track the airplane and then returned the light torwards our direction when I flashed my brights again.  At this point we decided to return home and attempt to view the craft with binoculars in my backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we made it to the backyard the object had moved further westwards and the light was not as easily visible.  At this point I pulled out a flashlight and flashed it torwards the craft which immediately turned and focused in our direction.  This was apparent due to being able to see the light intelligently rotate torwards us.  We watched for several minutes, about twenty minutes after we first observed it on the road, and suddenly it seemed to all but disappear.  I began to signal the craft by flashing my light three times.  We were shocked to see the light appeafr again and flashed on and off three separate times.  I then flashed the craft twice after it had blacked out again and the craft resoonded with two flashes.  And again I flashed the craft three times and the craft responded with three flashes and went dark. I was observing the craft through binoculars and could see a distinct round shape and bright light with a small red light within the craft.  The craft was no longer m! oving only hovering in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so shocked I called my father to come observe it and by the time he got out there we thought it was all but gone.  But we flashed in its direction one more time and were responded with a faint flash and then it disappeared and we did not see it again.  The entire duration was about thirty minutes and the craft seemed to be moving with intelligence and seemed to have a distinct front to the craft.  This is the third time we have witnessed a UFO in this town which is why I finally decided to report it due to its being a long encounter where we believe the craft distinctly made contact with our flashing lights on the ground.<n>

When I came out I looked at it and said oh that is the moon and she said no look at it it is moving.  I stared at it for a few minutes and it seemed like it was but it was hard to tell because it was far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back in the house to get my camera (Nikon Coolpix P510).  I was able to zoom in on it and that &#39;s when I saw that it is moving in different directions left, right, up and down (not exactly in this order).  It was doing those moves in various speeds and sometimes it would just stand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back into my house to record it from my upstairs window I recorded it for about 6 minutes went downstairs to show my husband and when I went back it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the weirdest thing was when I looked at it at my computer you can see how the object was trying to change color or do something else I don&#39;t know how to explain it, it looked like waves going over it.  It reminde! d me of a tv when you try to fix the channel to find a clearer picture.  I was searching online to see if anybody saw or knew what it was but couldn&#39;t find anything, maybe you have an explanation for us.  I probably be able to send pictures or the video in the next couple days.<n>

10/23/13 19:00|Wickenburg|AZ|Fireball|45|10-15 Orange “Fireballs,” appearing and disappearing and moving about in the evening sky for the last 3 nights in a row…|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103536.html|213|ndxe201310| 10-15 Orange “Fireballs,” appearing and disappearing and moving about in the evening sky for the last 3 nights in a row…  I have seen this almost exact scene 9 evenings over the last two years.  Three of these sightings were the last three nights in a row.  I’m pretty certain I will see it again tomorrow.  I have managed to already show three other people, much to their surprise and to my sanity.  Everyone is completely stunned when it actually happens as I say it will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the way it seems to go:  Just after Sunset, and before moon rise (it happens to be a waning full moon the last 3 nights) I can look North–Northwest and 7 to 10 burning orange fireball like lights will appear in the sky as if turning on and reaching maximum brightness.   Tonight I noticed it seemed to start with one ball that, very rapidly, split into the whole group.  From there it seems to change a bit from encounter to encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the objects will remain completely horizontally stationary and usually begin a sequential pattern of blinking once or twice, from left to right.  Some of the other objects might line up exactly vertical and also fade in and out sequentially.  It’s not really a blink, but more like they start to “Slip,” as they pulse.  While this is happening, the stragglers seem to move around more randomly and either fade out alone or merge together before fading out.  This whole first “act” may last 10 – 15 seconds and then vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 20 seconds to a few minutes, they reappear almost due north and seem to repeat the first act again.  I’m guessing there is roughly 10-20 miles in between locations, but I can’t get a good fix on distance and size of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From there, it becomes more random with the dance, but always switching between the two spots. I haven’t been able to determine a pattern, if any, yet.  It seems to happen 3-4 more times in each location as the large group of separate fireballs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, the numbers seem to diminish and the time between appearances grows longer until just one “ball” appears every 10 min or so with a very short duration of just a second or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The show seems to end with a crescendo of just one fireball burning very, very brightly for one second and then the event seems to end as quietly as it all started; just as the moon begins to rise over the hill behind me about 45 minutes from the start.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been able to watch this show for the last 3 nights with such regularity, that I have risked looking totally nuts and invited friends to come witness this strangeness.  So far they have not let me down.  Everyone who has seen this is stunned and cannot believe what they are seeing with their own eyes.  It defies any explanation so far.  Everyone leaves stating, “Wow, people will think I’m nuts if I try to explain this!”  Luckily, I am 3 for 3 in the “not nuts,” department with those I have dragged out to witness this.  I will continue to invite others nightly, until it ceases to happen.  I figure that the more people I can show this too, the faster we can come up with a rational explanation of whatever this is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, I have tried to take pictures, as have my friends, but for the last few nights we all just have our phones and they just don’t do it justice.  Plus it all is so exciting that as we fumble to his the record button and get it into view, you really don’t want to take your own eyes off of the scene as you struggle to make sense of it all.  It&#39;s quite spectacular and, unfortunately, it all happens pretty rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tomorrow morning I am headed to Phoenix to buy 2 good quality video cameras and tripods with the hope that I will get at least one more good night of this amazing show to record in a couple different ways.  I’m hoping that night vision might reveal some shape other than just orange orbs / “fireballs.”  I live in a very rural area, but I am 60 miles from Luke Air force base.  My sensible head says that this must be some sort of secretive military project being tested in a rather remote location.  That said, it is still directly overhead, and quite blatant to those looking up in a rather populated area.  If this testing were shifted 3 miles to the west, it would all happen in a desolate 60 square mile area, separated by mountains and populated with maybe 100 inhabitants.<n>

A moment later a jet aircraft flew directly into the general path this ufo had taken, at a similarly low altitude.

I videoed the craft as it buzzed my position.  A row of lights were arrayed on what appeared to be the leading edge of the craft; those lights were colored , in the following order from left to right: light-green, white, orange, white, and orange.  As this craft was about to pass over my position, the center, orange light turned red, then back to orange, in a very short period of time, yet not what I would call blinking.  Above the center light were two, closely spaced, horizontal orange lights ; these lights also changed colors , changing from orange to red and green.  The shape was not discernable, but the first impression I got was that this was a propeller driven or turbo-prop airplane at full throttle, that was agressively buzzing quite low over my neighborhood.<n>

I am standing on the steps of my backyard and in the distance i see 3 or 4 lights in a Chevron or triangle shape.  It was low and below the clouds at first.  It was in a turn at a distance so it was tough to clearly see the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also it was hard to determine if this object made sound or not because of the distance.  It was traveling away from me and i see a single red light flashing as i believe a smaller plane/jet was following/tailing/chasing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i stated i live next to a municiple airport so i have seen many planes.  I only had this thing in view for about a minute or 2 because it was cloudy and at distance.  Unless my eyes played a trick on me these 3 or 4 lights appeared to be connected to a single object.  This was the largest object/plane I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime and it was many many miles off in the distance.  I can only imagine the size if it were much closer.<n>

10/22/13 23:30|Davenport|WA|Circle|10 minutes|Orange Glowing Object over Davenport, WA.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103593.html|225|ndxe201310| Orange Glowing Object over Davenpor,t WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurrence happened just outside of Davenport, Wa. on the evening of Tuesday, October 22, 2013, at approximately 11:30 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband could not sleep so he opened the blinds on the window to look at the stars outside.  After a few moments he noticed a round orange glowing object heading towards him from the northeast.  He was not sure of the speed but the object was getting bigger as it moved towards his location.  He decided to take a picture with his camera phone but each time he put the phone up he could not find it in his viewfinder.  He snapped one picture and a short video to see if he could bring them up later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then decided to go outside to try and get a better picture.  He got dressed and went outside, the orange glowing light was now solid white blinking lights and the direction the object had been traveling had changed.  He thought maybe it had been an aircraft since it seemed to come from the direction of the Air Force base, but he still could not pick it up on his camera.  He took another video to see if anything would show up later.  The last picture he took was of the moon just to make sure the camera was working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spoke about the object briefly the next day but did not look at the pictures or videos until Sunday, October 27, 2013.  The first picture was of course black and we could not find anything on it.  Then we looked at the short video, again there was no picture but the audio was what shocked us.  The audio was a short clip of my husband and son-in-law&#39;s conversation from previously in the evening, a conversation they had at about 7:30 pm. and no possible way for the phone to record their conversation.  The second video had the correct audio but we couldn&#39;t see anything captured in the video and the fourth picture of the moon you could clearly see the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other item that shocked us about these images and videos were the times.  The first picture and video with the wrong audio that were taken inside, showed they were taken and 7:29 and 7:31 pm.  They would have been taken closer to 11:30 pm.  The second video and picture of the moon, which were taken outside showed a time of 11:33 and 11:35 pm which would have been taken closer to the correct time.  It was showing a four hour time difference between what was taken inside and what was taken outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband says he does not remember any missing time for himself but at the time thought it was odd that the object had changed so fast from the few minutes it took him from seeing the initial object to going outside to get a better view.<n>

We were in my front yard.  One was by itself and 4 other ones were grouped together in a cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor called her husband out and he also witnessed the last 2 ovals as they flew away.  They all went south.  The first one left and one by one they all followed in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all were red in color, with a little bit of yellow in them and very bright.  Like a very bright light.  We were all stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to take a picture of them on my cell phone and my cell phone screen went blank.  In addition, when I entered my home my television could not get a picture and was full of static for about 5 minutes and then returned to normal.<n>

Bright Orange/Red spheres, whose formation changed predictively in relation to my perspective as they flew by.  My view of this sky segment is 25% blocked by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their size, apparent speed, and height reminded me of a formation of military helicopters, which most often travel down the I-30 corridor, as I see these several times a year, both day and night.  This flight appeared 2-3 miles South of I-30.  The two distinctions that differed these from a normal helicopter formation were a complete lack of noise, and their light output.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These aircraft were silent, and luckily during my viewing there was no competing airplane noise.  To extrapolate their apparent size and speed to a distance where a normal helicopter could not be heard, would place them near the border of believability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light output of these objects is, in my opinion, what sets them apart from anything in my experience.  They were not pin points, but were circular and by changing perspective, had volume.  Although orange/red, the brightness was only a little less than if a spotlight were pointed in my direction.  The intensity seen, varied only with distance, it was steady and uniform from all 6 objects.  They were too bright to make out helicopter rotors or tail booms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen two fireballs in the sky in the past, one red, the other yellow green, both lasted around 10 seconds and I read about them the following day.  Last night the objects I saw lasted much longer.<n>

The points of light were relatively tiny in comparison to planes or other celestial bodies. In addition, the glow from the points of light were cconstant with no recognizable blinking patterns or variations in luminosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the relatively small specs of a light, they seemed to be higher up in the atmosphere and traveling faster than any recognizable aircraft I’ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both lights were traveling from North to South at approximately the same speed with no change in distance between the two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of the two tiny lights, the one on the right trailing the one to the left disappeared abruptly. Shortly after the larger of the two disappeared as well. I told my friend I had just seen something strange. We quickly dismissed it and we went back to talking about our day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later, at about 9:45pm PST, I was alarmed to see series or formation of 4-5 bright lights slowly rise from behind the silhouette of the wooded hillside in the distance. The string of 4-5 lights hovered silently without movement for about 35-40 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the phenomenon from the corner of my residential suburban neighborhood. Confirming later with a compass, the horizontal string of lights was observed at approximately 240 degrees West/ Southwest and about 33 degrees above the horizon in relation to the zenith of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light on the right of the horizontal 4-5 light pattern was remarkably brighter than anything I’d ever seen in the sky at night before in my life! Ever!  It was a bright golden orb that did move and stayed locked in formation with the 4 other lights that were evenly spaced out in a horizontal pattern to the left. The lights did not blink, change shape, or alter in brightness. All four to five lights in the formation were larger than planets or starts appear in sky with the bight orange one being larger and brighter than anything I&#39;d ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow from the light on the right was remarkably bright and unique in color and shape. The horizon behind the glowing gold light was a faint blue – similar to the way the night sky appears behind sports stadium lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The arrangement first appeared to resemble the top-floor of a tall large city skyscraper at night - only with a gold “search light” on the right corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for a fact there are no buildings on the distant wooded hillside. I could clearly see empty faint blue night sky as negative space above and below the string of bizarre static lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the phenomenon from approximately 9:40pm to about 10:20pm PST. During this time the formation of lights did not move in direction, nor did they grow in size, change position, or alter their pattern in relation to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hung up the phone and took several photos with my iPhone 4G. I called several friends in the county to see if they could confirm the sighting but no one answered. I called my friend in Los Angeles back at which time I continued to discuss what I was witnessing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With my friend on the phone I stopped a woman walking her dog crossed on the side walk in front of my apartment and pointed to the four lights inquiring if they seemed strange to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She looked just in time to see the bright orange light suddenly disappear, while the other 3-4 lights remained exactly where they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe two seconds later, all three smaller light disappeared at once followed by a flash on the horizon. Suddenly and the whole sky went black as if someone had turned out the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so abrupt that that the woman was spooked and grabbed her dog and trotted off in the direction she was headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called the San Rafael police to report the sighting. They referred me to the local Sheriffs department who then gave me the contact number for the National UFO center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attached are the series of photos taken with my iPhone 4 with no flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later, two aircraft with blinking lights were seen flying over the hillside. Nothing has returned to the airspace since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am perplexed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was a meteor, but it did not “burn up and disappear” but just kept going very fast and low towards the west until it disappeared behind trees in the distance.  Also there was a blue tint to the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t describe the object in detail at all because I didn’t have on my glasses and lights at night appear to me stared and blurry in the distance.  So I wasn’t able to discern an exact shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn’t have been a plane as there was no sound at all, either before, during or after.  The blue tint to the lights seems to rule out a meteor.  I have no idea if there is any aircraft that flies so fast and soundless in the US.  But I felt I should report this.<n>

This particular evening I was looking at a couple of jetliners crossing the sky when, immediately over my head I observed two dim lights, next to each other, moving quite rapidly from North to South.  It was probably only five seconds or so until this thing was out of sight as it was moving extremely fast, unlike the planes that seemed to crawl across the sky.  This object made no sound whatsoever.  I went out an hour later and was lucky enough to observe the ISS flying over, but did not see the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was was VERY fast and was definitely a structured flying object.<n>

It would sweep back and forth like a pendulum, like it was looking for something.  Every time it got closer to the horizon, it would gradually turn from white/yellow to red as it got closer to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it got really close to the ground, it would turn pure white and blink out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it would shoot off North and gain several thousand feet of altitude in less than a second.  Going from red to bright yellow/white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On some pendulums, it would continue to the North or South &#39;wobbling&#39; up and down in elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it from 8:22pm to 8:48pm.  At 8:43 I called 911 to report it.  The 911 call did not connect to Payette County.  So I asked the operator to call over there and tell them to look up at the sky to see the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later (the amount of time it would probably take for this to happen), the UFO dropped, flashed, and went out.  Not to be seen again as we waited for it for a good 10 minutes.<n>
10/22/13 20:15|Dandridge|TN|Sphere|12 seconds|Large ball of yellow light making erratic movements, disappears.|10/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103480.html|234|ndxe201310| Large ball of yellow light making erratic movements, disappears<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on my porch and looking at English Mountain while talking on the phone.  I saw dull yellow object ascend rapidly into the skyline above the mountain.  It was in the distance (across the other side of the mountain) but it was larger than any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen. Steady light, no blinking and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately ceased my phone call to watch it because I was stunned by what I was seeing and very confused.  It hovered over the mountain in my line of sight but it was much lower than any normal flight paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it shot up and hovered for a few seconds, then it shot rapidly to the left in a straight line. It moved so quickly that the light left a small pattern in the sky behind it for a split second (probably just my eyes adjusting).  Then it stopped completely and was still for another second or two.  Then it shot again to the left just as fast as before in the same straight line across the horizon.  And then it zigzagged rapidly downward, angled to the right.  It stopped again.  Then it zigzagged rapidly downward, angled to the left again. In this last zigzag, it descended below my line of vision behind the mountain.  No noise. No leftover lights.  It just disappeared. About two minutes later, I noticed two aircraft (small blinking lights, normal looking) flying in that area and they also disappeared behind the mountain after another minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to describe the orb/ball I saw.  Again, it looked like a dull yellow but it was also very  bright at the same time (or, at least, very big).  It did not brighten up the sky around it from what I could see. It was across the mountain but from where I was positioned, it had risen just enough for me to see it over the tree-line of English Mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.

As I watched, a fifth one appeared almost directly above the house.  They looked like they were slowly descending, made no sound at all, and slowly faded and disappeared.  Each object was red with a bright yellow center that looked like a flame.  I originally posted this sighting on my Facebook page for 10/22/13 (it can still be seen along with other items from the same period.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent this report to you because I just read a report on your site from 10/22/13 describing objects very similar to the ones I saw.  That report came from Monroeville, PA, which is very close to McKeesport, and occurred about two hours after I had seen the objects.<n>

I don&#39;t think it was a plane.  It was a steady, red light, too big to be an airplane, but too high up to be anything else.  I saw it crossing the sky about 3 or 4 times faster than a satellite.  It then turned down towards the horizon, and diminished in size at a medium rate to the point of vanishing.  At that point, it was still above the horizon.  I was able to see it for less than a minute, I&#39;m guessing about 40 seconds but it may have been less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We left Glenallen Alaska at about 6:00 P.M.  On the passenger side of the car my boyfriend looked over and said to me, &#34;Oh, look, two planes flying together.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw two white lights one on top of the other.  Then one light disappeared and the second one also disappeared.  Thinking this was odd we tried to rationalize it thinking they actually were airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds later and during the span of about 5 minutes, we saw a dozen or more orb like balls of light coming and going over the treetops.  The terrain in that area had dipped enough that we could see right over the treetops from our vehicle.  Then a craft with 5 lights on it WHITE, RED, WHITE, YELLOW, WHITE bigger than a semi, and about 300 ft away, came down closer to the car but still above the trees, rotated once then left.  Some more balls of light came hovering and moving over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second large craft we saw lit up in front of a hill in! the distance.  VERY large.  Had 3 white lights on it the went off sequentially and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other cars on the road it wasn&#39;t that late at night.  If other people saw this we don&#39;t know it was pretty obvious what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car several times to freak out over what we were seeing and still saw balls of light in the distance.  There was a red light in the distance on one of these stops as well as a small star shaped object that went really fast toward the horizon, and then we saw two flashes as it got near the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that time, we took out our phones to get some kind of video but the camera on our phones couldn&#39;t pick very much up but we were clearly freaking out about what we saw.<n>

Prescott Valley, AZ 10/22 &amp; 10/23/13 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking North I saw 3 flashing lights.  Would appear far from each other then w/in a sec 4 to 5 to 6 lights would show up very close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call 12 News in Phoenix and spoke w/ a Paul Martinez, but he had said, &#34;sorry can&#39;t help u with what you&#39;re seeing, sorry, bye.&#34; (So I was very annoyed by that, cause who else would i contact at the news if not calling their main line, right?!?!) You would think he&#39;d ask for what I was seeing, the direction, etc, just like previous people have done in the past here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So anyways, after calling it did look like 3 jets scrambled to the direction east that I said it was going where we lived, (not knowing why and they were loud) but not moving as fast as I saw the first 3-6 very odd looking lights blinking, which the jets didn&#39;t have the same pulsing or blinking of the lights I had seen w/ the previous that just flown by moments earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then w/in an hour I saw again moving east to west this time the same white ! flashing lights moving erratically go from 3 lights, then to 4, 5, and then 6 flashing lights w/ no noise. They went as far West as I could see over the mountains towards Prescott, AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they&#39;d go north to south north to south for about 3 min but it looked like north to south was like 1-2 miles from where I was.  They weren&#39;t moving faster than I&#39;ve seen jets before move and would move around up down side to side.  Then back my way 15-20 miles, maybe even 30 miles from my balcony within a blink of an eye without any noises being heard.  I&#39;ve also have seen this same thing tonight, Wed, Oct 23, 2013, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please, if anyone has seen this as well, post something!<n>

He called me and told me there was something in the sky and when I looked it was in the west by the mountain range.  When I found it in the sky it was changing colors so I discounted it and told him it was a plane.  I sat on my porch and watched and it didn&#39;t move for almost 2 full hours.  I called a local news station and they said they had other reports and would check it out.  Right about 7pm as I was showing my wife and daughter it moved sharp to the west very fast and then really fast again disappeared behind the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second night when it appeared it was bright white and moving in a circle pattern.  I again called my friend and told him it was back in almost the same spot.  As he watched from his house and I watched from mine about 15 miles away we watched it change colors many times and move very fast in no particular pattern.  I again called the same station and they informed me again others have called but didn&#39;t have a chance to verify or confirm.  We all again watched it move erratically thru the sky and disappear behind the mountains.<n>

She looked up and saw a large, yellow, oval-shaped object which she described as &#34;appearing to be on fire.&#34;  She stated that the object was comparable to the size of the moon and was completely stationary.  No sounds could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was completely cloudless and the sun was just beginning to rise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she looked away for just a few seconds and turned back to look at the object, it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, she texted me to tell me she had just seen a UFO!  I called her and asked her to give details of the sighting, as I was heading out to take my daughter to school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, my daughter and I both saw an object above the hills in East Wenatchee.  My wife, who was on the phone with me, also saw the object,<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the object appeared white but definitely oval-like and about the size of a pea.  If it was indeed the same object that she had seen just moments before, then it would&#39;ve had to travel at a remarkable speed to move such a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, we noticed that three jets, flying very high, were heading toward the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would&#39;ve continued to monitor the object but had to go to work.<n>

I noticed this object, which I thought was a plane at first.  I was looking to see if it had moved.  Placing this object with another object to see if it was going farther away.  It just stayed in the same spot.  During the seventeen minutes of staring at this object I noticed bright green and white spots on the object and two bright lights, and what seemed to be moving up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to grab binoculars, when I came back the object had moved about three miles more to the North West and farther away.  I looked at it through the binoculars and it was a triangular shape.  The triangle was outlined in bright green and the center was white.  The triangular object was very bright, neon almost.  It kept rotating, but stayed the same shape.  The object appeared to be spinning every few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside to grab my phone, which took me about 30 seconds.  When I came outside the object was gone.  Nowhere in sight. I know what I saw, I can&#39;t grasp what I saw.

I could not tell how far away it was and it appeared to be about 350 feet above the ground.  It looked like a fireball (orange, red and white), but clearly there were no flames; it was illuminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a suburban neighborhood. I ran to the window to watch and at the treeline it plunged about 75-100 feet in a split second and continued out of sight.  I opened the window, but heard no motor or sound.  About 5 minutes later, it or another similar object crossed the same area in the sky and at the same rate of speed.  With the window opened I heard nothing.<n>

The time was approximately 7:45pm and dark.  Weather conditions were overcast cloud ceiling approximately 1500 to 2000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling eastward when I observed 3 rather large rose colored or strawberry colored lights in a tight formation with the center light slightly higher.  I thought the color most unusual and altitude very low.  I initially thought perhaps the Coast Guard was having an exercise over lake Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I than observed a 4th object in the sky, this object appeared to be closer and larger moving very slowly in a southeasterly direction.  I followed down the road until I came to the east river preventing me going any further.  It was large I thought it may have been a helicopter but I&#39;ve never seen a helicopter lit in such a manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not spotlights I&#39;m sure of that.  The entire object was emitting the color.  I did not observe any navigational lights.  I&#39;m guessing the object had to be 1/8 to  1/4 mile in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shut the truck off rolled my window down and was expecting to hear the sound of a helicopter but it was silent.  I remember saying this was messed up! The first three objects appeared to be over Lake Michigan further out.  I restarted my truck drove to my home 4 blocks to the south and stood in my back yard and watched the first 3 objects climb quickly in a upward direction away from me.  I entered my home told the wife what I saw and went directly to my computer and entered flight radar 24 and checked my airspace and there were no aircraft in my towns vicinity.  It is also unusual to have low flying aircraft around Two Rivers W.I. due to the proximity to the 2 Nuke power plants literally only 5 miles north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 50 and can&#39;t logically explain what I saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up next to 177th Fighter Group &amp; a Coast Guard Air Station and never saw anything like that.<n>

In the southwestern sky I saw what appeared to be a very bright, larger than normal yellow/orange &#34;star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a solid brightness, no flashes as one would see on a typical aircraft.  It seemed to hover in the distance moving only slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 7 minutes, a second &#34;star&#34; appeared; however, it dipped behind trees and I was not able to see it.  This second object appeared at least two more times in the course of 15 - 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before the object disappeared, it seemed to separate into 3 different orange-colored orbs and disappeared.<n>

Connected to a line of green laser dots?!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two circles in the air, far away.  When &#39;on&#39; the two, a red and a green circle made of colored spheres, were spinning through eachother. They were on for 10 seconds and off for 22 till 45 seconds.  When off, you see vaguely a white bend line with small white lights on the left and right side of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides this there was a line of green dots.  Looked like some kind of laser, it was always on but it didn&#39;t come from the earth.  It was from the object and stopped somewhere in the sky. The line was as seen from earth bending of in the direction of the plain away from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have made a video, but you can&#39;t see it very well.  Stupidly enough, the Chinese on the street, a lot, didn&#39;t see it or saw it but didn&#39;t care.  It moved slowly, I had to cross the street to see it again, and after 15 minutes, it was behind the buildings and i wasn&#39;t able to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very curious what it was.  It was very special although it looked just like a bunch of led-lights in the sky.  But i think it was way to high for LED lights..<n>

The object did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I got off Exit 12, I looked once more and noticed a second, object beyond, yet parallel to the first object.  This second object did have the same size as the first but appear to be less opaque.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After exiting to my nearby workplace I tried again to spot the object but they were not longer present.<n>

Prior to the sighting I watched the McCain corporate learjet take off and fly over me toward Toronto, so I know what I saw could not be the Learjet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For approximately 3-4 km of driving, before and after I passed under the Trans Canada overpass, I watched in the sky to the Northeast perhaps 2-3 km in the distance at a perceived altitude of approximately the same or slightly lower distance ( 30-40 degrees off the horizon ) a shiny or bright cigar thin object without any contrail or apparent trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not stop as I had no shoulder and traffic behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to look gradually further to my left as I  continued east, at the object to see if wings or the shape of a tailfin became apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am  farsighted with 20-10, 20-13 vision on a bad day.  I  could  not  discern wings, tail, exhaust contrail, nor direction of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was somewhat distant, but  did not appear high enough to be a commercial jet  If it was a passenger jet, judging from the length it could not have been more than 4-5 km away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be very interested to know if there might have been a jet, other than the McCain Learjet which at this time was 1/3 the way to Toronto, flying slowly and at a low altitude northeast of Florenceville, or other witnesses in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen small propeller planes hover into the wind, but not aircraft with long shiny fuselages.<n>

I drew a photo of it as I did not take a photo, just too stunned i guess. It was there a good 7 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Cottonwood AZ, it was towards Sedona area.  What caught my eye was the red, white and blue flashing lights in the sky at first, then I saw 3 lights in the middle that looked like stars but a perfect straight line right in the middle and in the front, or may back an amber light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed stationary the whole time then just faded, did not move sideways, forward or backwards, just gone!  It was a clear night.  This thing was huge.  About the size of 20 plane spans, hard to say, but huge.  My attachment is my terrible drawing of what I saw.  I would love to know if anybody else reported anything on 10/21/13, I don&#39;t know what time it was, around 12, 1:30 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for the phone call, it was about 7 minutes long and then just the lights just went out/vanished. I heard no noise but I am hard of hearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no stars in the sky but it was a full moon.  From tip of red blue red flashing lights to other tips of red, blue red flashing lights I would say you could fit 6 moons in that space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights themselves were small, red white and blue, were fingertip size.  The amber light was a little larger thumb size.  The 3 white lights, middle one bigger same size as amber light top and bottom not as bright.  At first I thought it was Orion, but I sit outside every night and there were no visible stars anywhere, also these lights were brighter.  All lights went out at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

After the object was gone I continued on my journey back home, only to notice a strange north star-like object that appeared to be blinking on and off.  I watched for 10 minutes then went back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day later, I was on my way to do some shopping when I noticed the same object in the sky, but now it was in different position - it was on south east and was much brighter.<n>

I looked over and saw a huge white light.  I looked at my husband and said hey look at that light in the sky.  We watched it for a while it did nothing.  Then we looked around and all the sudden saw like ten or more flashing red, purple, blue lights all circular.  Then they stopped we looked back at the huge white light a little while later and saw another huge white light coming towards that one.  I said look at that again now there is two.  We where looking at it and it started moving then we started following it in the sky in our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly hovered back down 28 and right over lomond drive to that seven eleven up the street from guapos.  As we where going down lomond drive we saw it horizontal in the sky.  Then we kept driving down the road and saw it hovering over the seven eleven probably about 200 feet in the air.  We saw a huge triangular craft in the sky with red white and green lights.  Circular and long lights on the under body of the craft.  It looked like a bunch of little fans there was no sound and we saw a little lump at the top.  Like where someone would be flying the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then i was yelling out the window and pointing at it and after i looked at it hovered to the right and then back and back and back we tried to follow it to see where it went but we could not find it.  I think it landed. I am not kidding.  I have never seen anything like this in my entire life my husband has not either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not far up in the sky i would say it was a close encounter.  Anyone else who has seen it that night at the seven eleven please post and tell us what you saw.<n>

First we saw a triangular object not moving but with white lights coming down in an angled line on each side.  It was also flashing or changing colored lights in the body of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hurried and got the camera but the object was so far away you can&#39;t really see anything.  As we we&#39;re watching we saw a similar object hover by slowly in the same area but the first one didn&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the first one start slowly moving but it was so slow.  When the lights flashed it was so triangular like shaped on both objects and not like a plane.  I have never seen anything like that before.  We got in the car to drive to see if we could get a better view. We did see lots of planes in the area as well but nothing like the objects.  These were spotted in the west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to the house the objects were gone.   There were no sounds coming from them either.<n>

The report stated that the object looked like a star with another light going around it, the report is from Chester, PA, on 2/15/2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This seems very similar to an object I have seen off and on over Philadelphia for many years.  I have shown this to others and have looked at it through binoculars, the object seems very stationary and does not move out of view from the sight of the binoculars as planets and other objects do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe it as a bright  blue white object with lights spinning around it.  The smaller lights I would say are ¼ the size of the central object and can be red, blue and yellow and spin rather quickly around the center object in multiple directions.  The object also can seem larger or smaller and appear in different parts of the sky.  The object does not seem to move as a planet does or any other object I have ever looked at in the sky.  We have many helicopters and planes over Philadelphia and the object does not move the same way as them either.  The object I would say is very still and at times moves but not when I am looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an interest in sky watching and have tracked planets across the sky and they move fairly quick past your view in a telescope or binoculars this object does not have any of those characteristics.  I have been seeing this since the late 80&#39;s and have seen it last year at times.<n>

It looked to be above the Kingston/Saugerties, NY area.  It was a steady light that just hung in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for 10-12 minutes and then saw smaller lights headed right to it.  There were 3 or 4 of these smaller moving lights (which I thought were small aircraft).  They were moving like regular airplanes with flashing red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 3 or 4 more minutes the huge light disappeared behind cloud cover (the clouds covered it).

At about 6:57 PDT, I saw two blinking lights zooming around.  It started with one very small and bright, blue-white light heading east, which appeared to be a satellite. I was about fifteen miles north of Spokane, WA and looking to the south.  A second one appeared slightly to the east of the first and heading west, toward the other one.  They were blinking randomly about one second each two to four seconds.  At this time I thought I was watching something taking place a thousand feet above I-90, in Spokane Valley.  They might have been a few miles north of Mica Peak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two small, intense, blinking lights interacted for thirty seconds or so, they changed speed and direction.  Because the lights were off more than they were on, it was hard to tell which one was which as they cirlcled.  Sometimes they may have been moving at about the speed of airplanes and sometimes much faster than any airplane.  I blinked my eyes and asked myself if I was really seeing it in the physical realm and the answer was yes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After twenty or thirty seconds, they separated and disappeared when they were about a mile apart, providing they were actually above I-90.  --  I can&#39;t rule out some sort of Laser light show, but it sure looked like an interdimensional light show to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -- Sincerely, J S<n>

Levittown Pa<n> <n><n> <n><n> To start I have been a sky watcher for 20 years, observed many meteor showers, fireball, satellite’s traversing post dusk and I am well versed in natural occurring phenomenon.  At 18:20 hrs. while pulling in to the supermarket parking lot at Edgely and New Fall Rd. in Levittown Pa.  I observed a bright burnt orange light in the SSE sky at roughly a 35-degree angle moving at a steady rate of speed from right to left in my field of view.  The color of the object and the fact that there were no navigation lights present caught me as strange.  The light observed appeared to have a slight haze around it.  Its size slowly decreased in size as if it was traveling away to the ENE then disappeared.  As the light vanished a new burnt orange light appeared in the SSE sky.  I took notice of the location as being in the area of a particular star in the sky.  When the second object/light appeared it was bright with a haze around it and took the exact same track at a 35-degree angle moving at a steady rate of speed from right to left in my field of view.  It also appeared to decrease in size as if it was traveling away to the ENE then it to disappeared.  I noted the location of the object/light disappearance by a star in the vicinity.  Again, as the second object/light vanished a third appeared in the exact same spot as the second object/light appeared as if I was watching a recording of the event.  This time I took out my camera phone and videoed the event.  The track was identical, the orientation identical, the color, shape, haze around the object identical, and it disappeared in the identical spot as the previous two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

However, after a few seconds and keeping an eye on the object, noticed that the flight pattern was not of a plane.  It would stop, move sideways, back and forth and it also kept flashing a powerful bright light, like a beacon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I thought it was the sun shining in the fuselage, but the sequence convinced me it was a light from the object. Then it started going up in a zig zag  motion until it reached a very high altitude, to the point that it looked like a star in the sky.  There it stopped moving and it could only be seen by the flashing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my wife, who is very skeptical of UFO&#39;S to witness with me what ! I was seeing.  We would see the bright light flashing as if they were observing us.  But the most impressive thing, is when out of nowhere another flashing light appeared next to the first one, and after 3 or 5 minutes they both disappeared at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 63 years old, well educated and also airplane enthusiast, so I can definitively say that what we so was a UFO.<n>

It caught my eye because of its shiny, bright reflection. It appeared smooth and without ridges or seams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really paid attention as it made a sharp left into my driveway and across my front yard.  At that point I could see that the object was not rolling as I had expected, but instead seemed to hover roughly 3 feet off the ground.  There was no waiver in its movement.  It was perfectly round and reflective so I was unsure if it was spinning or just travelling in a stationary position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere moved out of sight and I did not go outside to pursue it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I noticed some odd lights very high in the sky moving as if deciding where to go next.  There was one directly over us and two off in the distance circling one another as if the two of them were watching something on the ground.  You could tell they were moving in circles because of the pattern the lights were following as far as brightness and speeds of movement.  These two circled each other for a while and the other disappeared for a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then reappeared near the same spot as if the light went out then came back on a minute later. It moved forward, made a ninety degree turn, moved a bit farther then shot off in the direction of the other two at an unbelievable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it reached the other two it made a half circle around them at speed and moved on in that direction for a good distance.  We lost sight of it and as fast as it left sight it reappeared again behind us crossin! g the sky very very fast. It made no sound and left no trail.  It proceeded towards the other two again at speed and as it approached them it stopped on a dime just outside of the other two.  The two that were circling just sort of stopped and were suddenly gone.  The third again shot off at a speed that just seemed unbelievable to us.  This lasted about 8 – 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

10/19/13 23:00|Sisterdale/Sister Creek|TX|Formation|Unknown|Blue center lights with 3 orange lights on either side caught on a deer cam approximately 10/19-21/2013 in Sisterdale/Sister Creek, TX|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103742.html|292|ndxe201310| Blue center lights with 3 orange lights on either side caught on a deer cam approximately 10/19-21/2013 in Sisterdale/Sister Creek, TX<n> <n><n> <n><n> The image shows a segmented blue center light, that has 3 yellow/orange round lights on either side.  It is up and to the left of the full moon in a night time sky.  You can see the halo around the moon, but then there is a separate halo that the object is in, but is not centered in this second halo.  This image was caught on a deer cam, on ranch property (approx. 1000 acres) out in Sisterdale/Sister Creek, Texas, during the date range of approximately October 19-20, 2013 in the night time hours during the full, or nearly full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the disc was removed from the camera on 10/28/2013, this image was included in the files.  Images immediately preceeding this image were images of a buck staring into the camera, and then using his antlers to nudge the camera, which resulted in it being redirected up towards the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This camera takes low resolution photographs at approximately 20 second intervals, and this is the only image of its kind on the disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is not known if any aircraft was in the area at this time, if there is something on the lens, or any other details.  I am waiting for additional information at this time.  I&#39;ve spent hours looking at images and reading details of other reported sightings on and around this date/timeframe, but can&#39;t seem to find any images that appear even minutely similar, nor do I find images attached to descriptions that sound as if they are similar to this image.   There is a very thin/sheer drape that keeps the camera somewhat hidden from the deer and other wild life, but a buck managed to move it causing it to face into a different direction.  If anyone else saw this, I would love to know.  Since we weren&#39;t present when this image was captured, it&#39;s simply an unexplainable multi-colored object that appears up and to the left of the moon.  We don&#39;t know how long the object appeared, but logically it would be less than 20 seconds if there is no other image immediately following this o! ne.  Perplexed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister thinks it was the space station, but it obviously wouldn&#39;t appear this large in relation to the full moon.<n>

They appeared to be following one another.  As I drove, I noticed there were approximately 3-5 lights and due to their color and direction of travel, I knew immediately I was seeing something extraordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an airport nearby, and I am used to seeing planes in the area, but in my area, the planes travel north to south and vice versa.  Plus, jet liners have those red, green, blue LED lights and huge white spotlights in the front. What I was seeing was nothing like that.  These lights appeared to be flying bon-fires.  I’ve not seen anything like it before or since in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car just before the overpass in an open area, got out, and attempted to take video of the objects with my Blackberry cell phone.  I could tell by looking at my cell phone it wasn’t picking up all that I was seeing, but it was all I had on me, so I continued videoing anyway.  I didn’t want to miss anything, so I was watching the objects as I videoed; consequently, the video is pretty shaky at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as I stood there, I noticed the objects, while traveling in a straight line, were actually traveling in a long slope upwards, higher and higher in the sky.  One by one, the lights would climb until it was no longer visible. I would then pan to the next one and video it until it disappeared too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, they appeared to be reddish-orange, sort of like a bon-fire. Imagine not a raging bon-fire, but a smoldering fire that has nearly gone out with a flame more orange than red is what I can best describe it.  The object itself I could not see at all but rather the outline of the object due to the fire surrounding what I assumed to be the bottom of the craft/object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure they were not sparklers, flares, or lanterns because of their speed and consistency of travel, which was in a perfect line, gradually upwards in what I would approximate as a 30 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects made no sound that I could hear.  It was a quiet night and not particulary windy. I felt no breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could also see clouds in the sky because the moon was so bright. They were not disappearing into clouds.  I am sure of that.  They were moving so far upwards into the sky that they were no longer visible.  I am not sure how far that would be, but in a matter of minutes, they were approximately the height of where I would see jet liners approach for landing, and then 2-3 minutes later were out of the atmosphere where I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video a 1:50 video of the objects.  The video is 110mb but is a bit shaky.  Other than the lights themselves, not much else can be ascertained, but I can send it anyway if you like.<n>

When I left the house I noticed a light in the sky.  I thought it was an aircraft but looking again I did not see any of the anti collision lights aircraft have.  I was heading up to Beatties Ford Rd, keeping an eye on the light.  I made a right and saw there were two lights and also noticed that they were orange with a red hue at times.  I hurried up to the parking lot of Food Lion on Beatties Ford Rd, got out of the car noticed there were three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They ranged from 85 degrees to something like 60 degrees above the horizon.  Each object disappeared once they reached the 60 degree mark from horizon one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I needed a witness and pointed them out to a guy that was passing by.  He said he did not know what they were but he kept walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tried to take a picture with my phone camera, but that did not work since the moon&#39;s light was too bright and the objects were too high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched till they all disappeared.<n>

10/19/13 21:30|Silver Creek|GA|Triangle|~30 minutes|Triangle UFO, very large craft.  I have photographs of lights that were symmetrical to each other, can see the layout of the lights!|10/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103432.html|305|ndxe201310| Triangle UFO, very large craft.  I have photographs of lights that were symmetrical to each other, can see the layout of the lights!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Night was very clear sky and were were having my Mom/Dad annual Halloween event that includes hay ride / spook house for their church.  My wife had went back to our house which is a wrap around porch style house.  I went to look for her and as I walked up she casually said check out the UFO I have been watching.  Before I explain the details I will tell you this.  I live under the north west corridor flight path for hartsfield international airport in Atlanta.  I have witnessed these planes all of my life and you always here their jet engines as they pass by.  We also have dobbins air force base but 95% of the time these fly really low, not sure if its a requirement since commercial traffic is on approach through our area.  That being said I know visual distance of a plane and something higher.  It is very rare to see a plane at full altitude here because it would be random event and flight path would have to take it directly over our house.  I am also an en! gineer by trade.  Back to UFO.  There were 3 distinct lights in a triangle format.  I watched it move (was traveling north west to south east) for about 5 min.  I had just received my new note 3 phone from work, so pulled it out because it was the only photo device I had close at this time.  I zoomed in as far as I could get and took pictures.  The bad thing is, by the time I took the picture the leading light had disappeared.  It was not a cloud it simply turned off.  My pictures show the other 2 lights.  We saw another distant object that my wife had been monitoring for 30 min. It seemed to be far away about a foot above the tree line as far as our vision dimensions are concerned.  Trees were about 50 feet away and are about 35 feet tall.  It stayed stationary and I thought maybe it was a star or possibly something easily explainable.  It was very bright and after seeing it for 10 min it was gone.  The stationary one didn&#39;t excite me that much, it was the other one that f! lew over my house.  I would guess the distance of this object ! was 8-10 miles.  Well above typical jet flight path.  Lights were VERY bright.  It wasn&#39;t until I looked at the pictures about 15 min later that the hair stood up on my neck.  When you zoom into the picture to the lights, they have a very geometric pattern.  Like I said I got 2 of the lights in the photo as the 3rd had turned off but what is very exciting is the opposite light had the opposite layout.  I thought well maybe this was a pixelating thing where the new phone would allow you to zoom way way in, but this is not the case.  I tested by taking pictures of passing jet lights and of the moon which was very bright.  I cannot zoom into the pixel level at all.  The lights had a L shape as far as the brightest portions but then they curved back in some, if you can imagine a digital 8 that you see on a calculator.  It looked like that but the L portion was very bright and got progressively dimmer on the remainder of the 8.  Also again the other light was exactly opposite or symmetri! cally flipped.  I have never witnessed a UFO in my life so I am not one to jump at anything I see and would have simply passed it off as nothing had I not had this photographic evidence that shocked me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object usually appears to the south and west of St. Louis.  Driving down I-170 at the connection of I-64 I noticed the same object but this time it was west of Clayton and near I-64.  It seemed like a very slow moving or hovering bright light.  But this time it was close to the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The full moon was up it was 9:30 p.m. and I had my moon roof open on my car.  I actually drove under the object west of McKnight road and east of Clayton road exit.  It turned out to be a triangle shaped object like a flying wing hovering about 300-500 feet above the trees.  It made no sound.  It actually had 3 bright lights and one green light.  It looked a little like one of the military type of flying wings except it wasn&#39;t flying and this thing was very low and about the size of a small aircraft almost like the size of drone craft.<n>
10/19/13 21:11|Poolesville|MD|Sphere|1+ hours|2 large spheres of light moving quickly, followed by 4 silent orange lights in L formation an hour later.|10/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103402.html|307|ndxe201310| 2 large spheres of light moving quickly, followed by 4 silent orange lights in L formation an hour later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live and work on a horse farm.  I went out of my apartment  at approximately 8:10pm.  It was raining slightly, so the clouds were low.  Something caught my eye and I looked toward the river, which is west, and then I saw the shapes racing through the clouds on the horizon. Initially, I just stood there, shocked.  I went to my co-workers residence and made him come out. The spheres were moving very quickly, back and forth on the horizon. The higher sphere didn&#39;t move as much or as quickly as the lower sphere.  They must&#39;ve been quite large, but we never saw anything but the reflected light in the clouds.  The lower sphere was looping up and around under the higher sphere. The higher sphere stopped occasionally, but the lower one never stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard the truck then, at the end of the driveway, and we went to get the horses.  I drove to the road because I was afraid, and when the driver got out, he was shaken and said the spheres had been almost on top of his truck for the last 2 miles.  The driver said at one point, he had to lean forward and look up out of his windshield (he drove a tractor trailer) to see them.  The entire time we were talking, the spheres continued to move on the horizon.  We then noticed trails of light reaching from the objects to the ground, that moved from place to place.  My co-worker videotaped the spheres with his phone, and on the tape the spheres don&#39;t show, just tiny red and yellow twinkling lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The truck left;  we went to work, periodically checking on the spheres, which were still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:10pm I walked out of the barn and looked west, the spheres were still there, but the light they made in the clouds was dimmer, as of they were moving away.  Something else caught my eye just then coming from northwest in the sky.  Four bright orange lights moving in an &#34;L&#34; formation toward where I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out and my co-worker came out to look.  I thought they might be helicopters so I shut off the tractor and the aircrafts were completely silent.  As they came closer to our location, they broke formation and went up into the clouds, where they disappeared.<n>

It was shaped like a flattened sphere (or maybe a very thick disk) and looked like it was lit from within.  The light pulsed, brightening and dimming on a cycle that was a few seconds long.  It didn&#39;t make any sound.  I thought it might be a model blimp or balloon lit from within or something similar, but then it shot up into the clouds really fast.  It lit up the clouds (not a lot, but noticeable) briefly as it passed into them but quickly faded after it did.<n>

I was facing her reminding her to lock up when I turned to walk down the driveway to my car, I saw 2 boxes of orange/reddish light looking like fire coming toward me.  They were coming from the north east sky between the two homes across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be almost floating toward me with no sound, and no movement other than straight forward movement when the first object began heading south west and the second object appeared to reach the same point and follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was telling my mom what I saw, and when I turned to point out where I saw them first, there appeared another orange box coming from the same area with another seen following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both changed direction at the same place the first two did and moved south west.  I watched them until they got smaller and smaller and when I turned back to where they had come from, there was another headed toward me, with one behind it.  Again they moved to approximately the same area and turned toward the south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got into my car and moved to the end of the road and watched 2 more boxes of fire looking light moving across the sky towards the south west following the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw, in approximately 10-15 minutes of time, 4 groups of orange/red boxes in sets of 2... all originating from the same area and moving off to the south west toward the city of Orlando. To my naked eye, they appeared to be boxes of fire, they did not glow, but seemed to radiate color, almost iridescent looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought when I saw them was perhaps hot air balloons, but it was night, I saw nothing above the boxes, and they made no sound.  I then thought perhaps paper lanterns, but they each followed the first one, and appeared to move in the same pattern.  They also were in groups of two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I saw the first one come toward me, I could see another smaller following it, and when the first one headed in the south west direction, the following one was still coming forward and getting bigger until it headed south west and followed the first.  Then about 2-3 minutes later another group of 2 was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to this sighting at approx 7:30 PM, I had heard several deep booms like fireworks being set off somewhere.  I went out at that time and saw nothing, it was partially cloudy that night and I figured the cloud cover had accentuated the fireworks from the Disney area and that was what I heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure that this had anything to do with this sighting or not, but thought it should be mentioned.<n>

It alternately zipped and wobbled in a confined area almost horizontally, then made breathtaking dives only to suddenly recover and soar back up to level hundreds of feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove around hill a few minutes and saw it continue its antics, from a few locations.  this was absolutely no plane, jet, or helicopter!!!  Its speed, erratic eccentric stops starts wobbles...its flaring light fading and returning…  It was a mystery, but being in the direction of seemingly over the new north campus building area, perhaps it was new remote control technology.  The gforces and power source had to be incredible in order to dive amd rise so fast while shining dimming shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

We counted over fifty in the sky at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each was small in size and not connected to any others but traveling at the same speed and staying mostly within a formation.  The lights were singular, moving in the same direction and at the same speed with some minor movements and adjustments detectable, some singles, some doubles and some triples, but each appearing to move individually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took over two minutes to reach from where each light first came into view from the south before it left our line of site to the north.  All told, we watched for more than five minutes, first stopping on the Interstate and then driving ahead to the nearest exit and stopping again in a safer location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The altitude appeared to be greater than 2000 feet but less than 3500 feet, based solely upon our experiences living in close proximity to a small regional airport for many years and witnessing many small plane take-offs and landings as well as fly arounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound recognizable emanating from the white lights as could be detected over the sound of the vehicles on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We captured two short sections of video with an iPhone which clearly shows what we were witnessing.<n>

I counted around 5 people filming the phenomenon, but nobody has posted a video on the internet, maybe it appears as new on our local newspaper.<n>
10/19/13 18:00|Brownsville|OR|Disk|4-6 minutes|19-Oct-13 Brownsville Oregon on Kirk Ave. in a large clearcut.|1/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106380.html|324|ndxe201310| 19-Oct-13 Brownsville Oregon on Kirk Ave. in a large clearcut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the above date at 1810hrs., (give a min.or 2)  On a sunny warm evening with clear skies no smog smudging the sky North East of Brownsville, Or., on a road called Kirk Ave.  We were in a clear cut no overhead obstruction for line of sight.  We were hunting. Witness 1 asked me (W2) if he was looking at the &#34;evening star.&#34;  I replied no it is to early after I looked to the SW evening sky.  He stated &#34;no over here&#34; and pointed to the NE direction.  I looked and explained I was looking at a jet which was climbing to the south from Portland, Or.  I asked if he was stupid for asking about a jetliner and W1 responded no over there! I looked in the direction he was pointing and noticed another jet passing under a blinding bright evening star looking object.  I was stunned to see a jet descending directly under the object.  From where I was standing the UFO was directly on top of my position of observation.  The distance from myself and jetliners was I would! say 30k in feet give or take a few feet.  The UFO was higher than that and I can only guess the distance from the aircraft flying right below it.  I am saying all object had to be in the 60k feet range, guessing at best.  I told W1 to &#34;grab glass&#34; and as I glassed the object with my binos I could not dial in a clear sighting. I remembered my Bushnell spotting scope 16x32x50 and was able to dial in a fuzzy disk which I could tell why it was sparkling by the sun as it was wobbling. As I dialed the spotting scope in tighter I was able see an irregular geometric shape on the bottom of the disk as if it was an exhaust port.  I passed off the scope to W1 and he looked and confirmed my sighting, turned called out that&#39;s it I am calling it is a UFO and I responded with nope IFO.  I asked W1 to fire up his camera and by the time we did that the saucer was no where to be seen.  This the second time this year I have seen bright shiny stars in the late afternoon/early evening and ! the first sighting was March and I did not have a chance to id! entify t hat one.  This is the 3rd sighting for people residing in my home in 2013. Willamette Valley is hot this year!  What I am wondering is I know that if I was standing almost directly below and the airliners were right underneath as they passed the saucer could the pilots help but not see the craft.  There was no indication that they deviated off there flight path but flew right under the saucer both ways.  I am sure both jets were outbound and inbound Portland Or.  After listening to Ground Zero recently I decided I better check in and report.<n>

Went outside in my backyard again seems I seem them on the weekend when I am at home most of the day and I spotted a UFO hovering over LA again really high in the same spot as it was before the previous week when I reported it this time the time I spotted it was at 1:13pm.  I grabbed my binoculars and could see a disk shape and under it 4 red lights in a diamond shape that changed colors from red to white or yellow and the lights moved in different formations it started to moved slowly almost over my house going south then slowly back to the spot I first seen it which was north west.  It was right above the path of planes that leave LAX that usually fly in the path over my house I wondered if any of the planes spotted it but the UFO was very high that you can easily lose it in the blue sky.  It stood hovering for 26 minutes I went inside to grab my phone camera and came back to look at it but some clouds rolled in and I could not see it any! more.  I find it odd that I spotted it again hovering in the same position as before.<n>

We got off from I- 40 and went south on Hwy 89.  Halfway to Prescott in some hilly area and covered with small trees.  I had noticed a white disc object on the N. side of Granite Mt in the distance.  It looked like some smoke  that was coming out of the Mountain. Granite Mt still looked the same with rocks, it was light tan.  I also noticed that there was some flat areas in the valley, but to me it could have been gray smoke. I kept staring at the haze and Mts in the distance as we went around turns and up and down hills.  I then remembered that there are no mesa tops in Prescott and told Terrie to look at what I am seeing.  She confirmed that they are flat mesa&#39;s with protruding tops.  We saw two big ones and one small one very clear and square in the distance.  It also looked like some pointed poles below the tops, which were very pointed at each end.  They were all one med gray color and very large.! There was no shadows or land layers to see. As we drive about 67 mph, we see the left side of the middle mesa start to distort and change. The white disc is now vanished some how and the left areas are distorting and some things can be seen moving.  We lost view from trees and rock hill.  When we came out, we saw Granite Mt some other hills and Mts in the valley.  They had different shades of color and looked normal in the distance. They looked much smaller now with depth.  There is No white disc, No mesa&#39;s and No pointed poles any where to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/18/13 23:30|Noblesville|IN|Formation|15 minutes|I watched a line of strange lights (15-20) fly from the north horizon, pass almost directly over me, and move south out of sight.|10/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103405.html|336|ndxe201310| I watched a line of strange lights (15-20) fly from the north horizon, pass almost directly over me, and move south out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was standing in my driveway with my dog for the last time before bed I noticed a strange light in the sky.  I am on the flight path between Chicago and Atlanta and see planes all the time but this &#34;plane&#34; was very low and caught my attention as it moved silently across the sky over my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few moments of watching it I noticed that there was no red, white, or green light.  Nor was there any blinking of the light.  Also, as it moved from north to overhead and on south there was no change in the shape of the light I could see.  In other words there was no mass...like a wing, tail, body...moving between me and any of the light.  The circular flower-like shape of the light never changed in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided this was something unusual and that I needed to make a picture.  I ran, as fast as I could, into the house to grab my camera, a distance of about 20 feet and then back out.  By the time I returned to the driveway it had gone behind one small cloud.  I turned on my digital camera but kept getting a &#34;picture error&#34; code.  I had to turn it on and off several times before I could get it to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object came out where I could see it again it was far enough away--and the streetlight was between it and me--so I could not get a picture.  Then it was just gone.  I though, oh well...missed it, and turned to go back in the house when I noticed another one crossing the sky behind my home!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took off at a fast walk toward the back to get away from the streetlight and my front porch light to get a better picture.  As I walked back past the house I saw about three more.  The motion sensor triggered the back porch light so had to keep walking to the back corner of the house.  By the time I got there I could see five or six of these lights just a above the walnut trees...straight up!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could also hear police sirens from the time I began my walk from the front coming from the north-northeast.  I did not think anything about that as it is not uncommon with a main road running east/west just about a mile north of my house.  The sirens stopped shortly after I turned the corner of the house.  I have to wonder if they were seeing what I was about to see as it was coming from the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I turned the back corner of the house and looked to the north-northeast there was a whole line of them.  Not a straight line--but kind of like you would see helicopters in a war movie.  The first thought I had was &#34;invasion&#34;.  There must have been at least 15-20 of these things altogether and they passed right over me without one sound.  Absolute silence!  Not even the siren was blaring anymore.  Total and absolute silence!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved into the shadow behind my house and began making pictures. As many as I could get.  I was shaking and my heart was pounding so some are shaky but I propped the camera on a birdhouse attached to a tree and got a good one of the line coming toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed in the shadows until they were all gone because I was afraid they would see me...they were that close.  I was able to get about 20 pictures before they moved south out of sight behind trees.  It couldn&#39;t have taken more than 5 minutes for the last one to move from the northern horizon to the south far enough that I couldn&#39;t see them any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later I was on the phone with a friend who lives south telling him to look for them (he never saw them) when I saw the last one.  It was low on the horizon to the east and I could only see it as it passed the area at the end of the street at the intersection I was standing on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area I live in is on high ground between the White river and another river that feeds into it from Morse Reservoir Northeast of Indianapolis, IN.<n>

The first lead “vehicle” was more in the shape of a triangle or diamond with orange/red/white lights on the points.  Following on behind were orb shaped things that looked like balls of fire.  They were not meteors.  They were moving west to east in a distinct pattern and flying very low, just a bit above the treetops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I finally got my mind straight I started taking photos but when the flash of the camera went off several times they made a very sharp left, not a left that an aircraft could make and then disappeared from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the first group went disappeared another group came along behind it 30 to 40 seconds later and where in the very same pattern as the first with no jet or motor sounds at all – everything was totally quiet during the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all this happened we viewed the photos and the orbs showed up white on the photos although what we were looking at was very much reddish/orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my daughter left the subdivision she noticed others outside taking photos.

But, as I drove through my neighborhood, it changed positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I was at our house, the two lights had switched and were no longer one on top of the other, they were now one to the right and one to the left.  They&#39;d reversed their positions and were a good distance apart but barely moving or shifting.  They were bright red like super, super bright.  There was no sound, no blinking lights, just solid - brighter than the north star lights.  They suddenly started to fade out like a flashlight slowly dimming but the effect was like they were going farther away and suddenly - blip - they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was super weird. I&#39;ve never seen red lights like these and I&#39;m used to seeing passing planes, helicopters...all sorts of man made planes but they were absolutely silent and moving slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know about a minute after they vanished I saw what looked like a normal jet appear way up high because it actually had blinking lights.  The jet itself was the normal barely seen lights which gave me a good comparison.  These were shockingly red and solid.<n>

The weather at the time was low fog but not very thick at all as the stars were still clearly visible, just enough so that you could see it in the headlights of cars.  There was no wind that I noticed. It was still dusk, and most stars and planets were not very bright yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately I thought they were aircraft, as float planes and helicopters frequently fly low over the area, only the latter at night. There is also a naval base in the area and sea kings and search and rescue helicopters sometimes fly relatively low over my house. I then noticed however that there were no running or strobe lights of any kind and the lights were too orange to be landing lights.  They were too bright for stars or planets at that time of night, but not overly bright, like Venus or Jupiter in the middle of the night.  The lights moved at a moderate pace, certainly something that would be typical for an aircraft.  The two were fairly close together at the start, sort of in a diagonal top to bottom orientation. but then they proceeded to turn around each other so that they switched positions, and were then much closer together at the end of the process.  The bottom one then faded out and disappeared from view, followed by the top one 10 or so seconds later, as it desc! ended.  This whole sighting lasted approximately 40 seconds to just over a minute at most although its hard to say exactly.  During the time i tried to film with my phone camera but nothing would show up on my screen.  (My phone camera does not work well in low light and the lights were relatively faint compared to the streetlights on my street).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran inside to tell a family member what I saw.  They came outside with my and I pointed to the area where they appeared.  A short time later, another light, that looked exactly the same rose from the horizon over my house.  It was more shimmering than the first two, and was lower in the sky and slower.  It quickly flickered and went out, my relative commenting that it looked like a Chinese lantern.  I feel as though the third one could easily be that, but the first two were much stranger looking.  It may be worth mentioning that between the two sightings there were some flashes in the sky much higher up it seemed, like the strobe light of a high flying jet, but only 2 or 3 flashes and not at regular intervals like would be expected, they were much further apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited outside for another 5 min but saw nothing further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Ahead in the sky and through the trees I see three deep red glowing lights.  I look for green or blinking. No blinking and no green.  Just steady deep ruby red.  I pull over just beyond The Dam Store next to Lake Arrowhead as I see now 12 - 15 red lights.  They are coming from behind a large hill/mountain a couple miles away.  Another guy has pulled over and he is staring at them and I ask him what they are, and he says he has no idea but a few minutes prior another group of them appeared and then winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m watching I notice the wind against me is out of the East but these lights are moving Northeast kind of into the wind, at least crossing into the direction of the wind but all seem to be unaffected.  No noise, silent.  With the very bright moon I look for smoke, or for balloons, I can&#39;t make anything out.  They move relatively quickly across the sky moving maybe 1 mile in 2 minutes.   Again moving from right to left as I look south towards Milton Dam from Rt. 7.  The lights pass over Milton Dam, over Lake Arrowhead towards the wind turbines on Georgia Mountain.  With the cluster of 12-15 red lights they are spread out but still in a group if that makes sense.  They all wink out in the same general area, but not all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three more lights appear from behind the same hill/mountain and move in similar fashion, same direction and wink out of two minutes.<n>

I had noticed that there was a flock of seagulls above and they were being pretty loud.  It was dark outside but I still looked up anyways to see how many of them there were.  There was a tree in the center of my vision that covered most of my vision but in the corner of my left eye I saw what I thought to be a shooting star, so I immediately focused on it.  The moment I focused I noticed it was an orange dot pretty much, it went straight like a shooting star but then it did a really wide curve at a very fast speed.  Almost immediately after that it was gone.  I posted to Facebook asking if anyone else had seen it and it turned out someone I hold to their word had seen it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the night I have gone out and stared around the same spot and seen nothing.  But I know shooting stars, satellites, airplanes, and this wasn&#39;t one of them.  Planes follow a course and it&#39;s very unlikely you will see it turn suddenly or even come close to turning how fast that did.  Shooting stars burn bright and move quick and dissapear in a straight fashion.  Satellites are pretty tiny lit up dots that you watch move slowly and count for points against your brother when sleeping outside with no tent.

The lights were not part of any constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights formed a horizontal oval - the shape reminded me of an eye-socket.  There were about 12-16 or so separate white lights (I apologize for not counting them), all about as bright as Sirius or Venus normally are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I could tell, the lights remained stationary in the sky (part of the time, I was driving on freeways, so my perspective changed a bit)<n> <n><n> <n><n> My camera wouldn&#39;t take a picture - too dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was cold and the lights weren&#39;t doing anything, so I went inside and to bed.<n>

I see aircraft all the time, and an occasional shooting star.  One night, I clearly saw a meteor.  I know when I&#39;m looking at a planet.  I&#39;ve seen the ISS pass by before, and I&#39;ve seen satellites, as well.  That&#39;s my sky-watching background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight was the first time I could ever say without a doubt that I saw an object that I had absolutely no idea what I&#39;d just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was coming from the West.  At first, I thought it was a really bright star, but then I noticed it was moving to the East.  It grew bigger, and brighter, and headed right towards the moon.  I&#39;d say it moved from ~35 degrees up to a maximum of 60 or so.  The moon was at ~65-75.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it passed between me and the moon, appearing a few degrees below it, I saw the contrail.  Whatever it was, it was in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw that, I thought it might be a meteor or something else burning up, but it didn&#39;t look like it was on fire, or diminishing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly, I was expecting the trajectory to bend downward at any second and see it &#34;pop&#34; or &#34;fizzle.&#34;  But it just kept going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did look a little like one of those large airplane lights that are usually in the center of commercial airliners, but there were no accompanying flashing lights, or even steady smaller lights, which I always see on commercial airliners.  It was just a steady, yellowish ball of light with a con trail, and the trail didn&#39;t resemble any meteor trail I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There&#39;s an airport just North of the city, so I see a lot of low-flying jetliners going in for landings.  This was absolutely not one of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was much larger than any planet, shooting star, meteor or aircraft light I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued straight in the direction it was heading, I tried to get my phone&#39;s camera on it, but the light from the moon was too much.  I could only watch it as it kept a steady course towards the Eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was barely visible to me, I turned back to the West, looking where it had come from, and saw 3 aircraft crisscrossing the sky at low altitudes relative to what I usually see out there, and flying routes I don&#39;t usually see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like to post meteor sightings to see if anyone else saw what I saw.  I didn&#39;t believe it was a meteor, so I googled a short description of what I saw, and ufocenter.com was the first site returned.  So, I decided to post it here and hope someone else might have seen it too.<n>

I proceeded to ride my bike down the road to the church pasture and saw the light appear again in the north eastern sky it was lower in elevation about 1,000 ft and not as bright i watch the pulsing begin but noticed that the light released several smaller bright white lights the main pulsing red and white light then dimmed down and faded away.  As i turned around to leave the pasture i came to the side of the church facing southeast and the light reappeared it was half a mile away and about 1,000 it was very bright it flashed red and light very bright then simply f! aded away.  The duration of this event took place over 25 minutes and each time the lights appeared they lasted no more than a minute in duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note this is not the first time ive witnessed this and many people have been with me for these events on the average its almost a mightly occurance however when we have storms or lighting over the lake they dont appear. I go out everynight and watch for these lights ive been observing them since november 2011 in greater frequency than in past years groups of us have watched strange behaviour from these lights in the past.<n>

Gradually the first light faded out.  Then to the right appeared two more lights in the sky, very similar to the two we watched on the 15th of October.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we filmed we noticed a third light coming across very fast from the south, one of the two lights started to dim a little and move, then this one coming in from the south crossed right in front of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On closer inspection of the footage filmed it looks like it was chasing the other light.

There were no flashing lights associated with this ball of light and it was brilliant white.  He said it was the brightest white light he&#39;s ever seen and it had no tail.

However the light was moving North/East, it was not blinking but stayed the same blue/white color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the movement we watched the disk-shaped object for several seconds.  Then we saw an airplane with flashing lights moving to the South/West a distance from the disk.  The disk seemed to stop for a second or two and then started moving in a South/West direction as if following the airplane.  It didn’t seem to make a turn as an airplane would but just stopped and started in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It tracked the airplane behind and slightly to the right for quite a distance across the sky.  Then it started climbing, getting higher and higher, until disappearing out of sight.  It is hard to judge the size of the object, but from our perspective the blinking lights of the airplane would compare to the end of a pencil but the disk would compare to the eraser of a pencil, it was quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for approximately 5 minutes, heard no noise until the airplane moved overhead with the disk tracking it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don’t know what it was but thought it odd that it seemed to be tracking the airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Of the two smaller object one was towards the top and the other was at the bottom of the larger one.  The flash it made in the morning sky, made it look like these were either very close together or one object that had an odd shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed a very bright white light in the sky and when I looked up I saw a white steak, going right to left (so in the direction I was going, the object traveled from North/Northeast to South/Southwest).  The trail and object were the same color from what I could tell but you could see it was an odd shape or three separate objects (see above).  The object(s) was pretty big in size and the tail was fairly long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location where I noticed it was around the border of the cities San Jose, Los Gatos, Campbell.  On US Highway 85 I was traveling on the north bound side of 85 but was actually going from Southeast to Northwest.  I first noticed the light either above or just to the left of highway 85.  I watched for as long as I could, glancing at traffic (making sure I don&#39;t get in a wreck).  I lost it before it could travel over the hills in Los Gatos/Saratoga.  Total time I saw it was probably around 5 seconds, maybe less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was high enough in the sky/atmosphere that if it were to land it would have done so in the Pacific Ocean.<n>

The sun had not risen above the horizon yet and the sky was getting light.   There are two mountains directly east of there about 50 miles away with a “valley” in between.  I saw a spot in the sky that was as bright as the sun but was only “aspirin” size in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know what it was but knew it wasn&#39;t a star or plane as stars and planes are not that bright from that distance.  It was like a little piece of the sun in the early morning sky.  As I sat at the stoplight, I watched the light in the sky slowly move in a northerly direction by noticing how it moved with a stationary object, a tree, as my focal point.  Then all of a sudden a second and third light appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the lights was sort of elongated, almost like a shooting star with a tail but not.  It seemed kind of stationary, but I also got the feeling it was moving in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third light was a little bigger than the first light and appeared like it was moving in a northerly direction.  As traffic started moving, I tried to keep watch.  The lights stayed for a few moments and then all of them disappeared.  As I continued up the hill on 67 North, I saw one of the lights had come back.  I then traveled too far to see it anymore and don’t know how long it stayed there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived at work in Poway, I watched the area periodically from a second story window, but the sun had risen by then and it was too bright.  I didn&#39;t see them again.  As I drove to work the following morning, I looked for the lights but they were not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10/19/13, we went to dinner with our neighbors and I mentioned the incident to them.  My neighbor told me that on 10/17/13 she was stopped at the stoplight before getting on the freeway, and was giving some money to the panhandler standing there.  He told her that his wife had seen some bright lights in the eastern sky that morning.  From my neighbor’s description of the conversation, it was in the same direction and approximately the same time as the incident that I witnessed.<n>

The object had a center blue light with a pink outer ring and 3 yellow/orange lights on each side of the blue center light.  The blue center light was at the top with three orange lights dropping lower to each side to form an arc shape.  Each individual light had an oval shape resembling the shape of an eye turned vertically.  The lights only stayed on for approximately 3-4 seconds, then went out.  The same light sequence then repeated to the right, and then the left of the original light(s) location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following this middle, right, left sequence of light appearances, a group of six objects all lit up, each with the same pattern of 7 lights in an arc shape.  The 6 objects seemed to randomly oscillate up and down for about 3-4 seconds, and then disappeared.  About a minute passed, and the 6 objects all lit up again while still oscillating in an up and down motion.  About 15 seconds later, the objects all flew away to the east and over the horizon at extremely high speed, faster than any object/aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove about another mile up a hill, and as I came to the crest in the road I was overlooking a valley.  Hovering in the valley ahead of me were the 6 lighted objects at what seemed to be at my eye level (same altitude as the crest of the road, but out in the valley ahead).  The 6 objects seemed to be only a few hundred yards away or maybe about a quarter-mile.  I saw the objects for about 5-6 seconds, and then they all flew away in various directions at the same extremely high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the check engine light came on in my vehicle.  A few seconds later, my wife called and when I answered all I heard is a garbled/bubbling sound.  My wife hears the same sound on her end of the phone (I found out later).  This was an unusual sound I have never before heard on a phone.  It was different than the normal static/broken audio of weak cell signal, and I also had full cell service during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above events all happened in about a 5 minute time frame while I was driving along the road at approximately 60 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds after the phone call, 2 of the objects reappeared to the east about a mile away and I could see them for the next 15-20 minutes as I drove.  The objects disappeared for the last time when I was about 4 miles outside of Globe, AZ.  I did not see them again after arriving in Globe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects each looked to be approximately 50 yards in size, both horizontally and vertically.  However, a thing that was odd about the objects was that all I saw were the lights.  I was close enough to clearly see the lights, but there did not appear to be any structure attached to the lights.

Once it was dark we could see it was some sort of craft that was tubular and black.  It was completely soundless and very smooth in its movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was moving south it would slowly spin but kept moving in a straight line.  It stopped near the I-30 and I-820 interchange and hovered there for a few seconds and then flew west at a very high rate of speed and still made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to find it again, but we were unsuccessful.

No noise.  Each moved smoothly across the sky and no, what would be called running lights, could be seen on any of the objects.  They were very bright much more so than Venus would be.  Not all lights were visible at the same time.  That is, as lights disappeared in the SE, others would rise in the NW.  The last light to pass was far behind the others.<n>

10/15/13 20:35|Reseda|CA|Sphere||Green laser ball spontaneously appears at elevation of low-flying airplane, then almost zips away into black sky.|10/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103461.html|401|ndxe201310| Green laser ball spontaneously appears at elevation of low-flying airplane, then almost zips away into black sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my cousin&#39;s house and having a few last minutes in conversation with her on the porch.  I was looking at her face as we talked, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something that captured my attention.  I reflexively and immediately shifted my gaze towards it, and I saw a bluish-green sphere of intense laser-like light, which must have appeared out of nowhere (because it was so bright that, had it been there before, I definitely would have noticed).  It was at an elevation of a low-flying helicopter, or an airplane that hasn&#39;t completed even the initial leg of its post-takeoff ascent.  Its bluish-green was similar in color neither to that of any falling star nor that of any comet I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My knee-jerk reaction was to blurt out &#34;Whoa!&#34;, but it had disappeared even before I had finished the exclamation.  By &#34;it had disappeared,&#34; I mean I saw it zip away in a short streak of its intense bluish-green light, at a speed exponentially faster than any aircraft (commercial, recreational, military, or otherwise) I&#39;ve ever seen.  The laser light ball jetted from its stationary position like a Star Wars spaceship &#34;jumping to light speed&#34; or &#34;entering hyperspace;&#34; after an unbelievably quick (in time) and short (in distance) dart, it literally looked like it &#34;teleported&#34; into the blackness of the sky, but on a very straight trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, only I saw this and not my cousin, who was with me but facing the wrong way.  The next day at work, the industrial photocopy machine I have used daily for the past three years inexplicably shut itself off twice when I touched it, which I cannot recall it otherwise ever doing in the past three years I&#39;ve worked with it.  (The office tech guys denied remotely rebooting it, and I have no reason to disbelieve them, especially since they were unaware of my sighting the previous night, the knowledge of which may have made them prone to playing such a prank on me.)<n>

One of my friends noticed a bright light in the sky out of the rear of the vehicle.  This would make the object somewhere southeast of our location.  We were east of Interstate 77 on highway 421 in Yadkinville, North Carolina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to look at the light and watched it as we drove for about a mile or so eastbound.  It went from a dim light to a bright light.  The light was circular.  Then it became a straight white line measuring about four times the diameter of Venus in the night sky.  It was about half the diameter of the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it turned back into a circular light.  Then all of a sudden it moved across the sky from southwest of our location to south of our location.  It seemed like it was just above the horizon and the actual craft may have been miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled our car to the side of the road off the exit and parked.  Our driver got out and started watching as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a man pulled off the highway, thinking we were broken down and offered help.  We told him to look.  The man told us he was a pilot and that it was way too bright to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the light for about 3 more minutes as it shifted between the circular light and the saucer-like line and then back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it vanished.<n>

I have two graduate certificates, a degree in Environmental Science and am currently enrolled in a post graduate program in Geographic Information Systems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My UFO experienced happened over a year ago. I didn&#39;t write anything down after the event which I deeply regret.  I had a hard time believing what I had seen with my own eyes, but I know that I could not of imagined something that was so vivid and real, something that was so large and close.  I am an honest person. It frustrates me when I tell people my story, because they almost always doubt what I am saying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just left the school and was heading north on Albert Street South.  I was walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the road.  I had just passed the large empty lot located next to the College property.  The lot next to this has an old office building that has been empty for years.  Running parallel along the sidewalk is a row of large maple trees. On the left side of the road, there extends a small forested area and a large double parking lot. Next to it, running up to the intersection is a series of two-storey townhouses and a couple of trees that stand only marginally  taller.  The Albert Street/Mary Street intersection is brightly lit by street lights.  I was directly across from the townhouses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was starting to pass the first maple tree, when I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I looked up and right above the north end of the townhouses there was a black acute triangle.  I would estimate that it was about 25 meters in length.  It appeared to be hovering only slightly above the houses.  It made absolutely no noise. The air felt totally quiet.  I didn’t notice the craft before this point; I am not sure if it just appeared out of nowhere or if it just blended into the sky.  The spot where I noticed it, was being somewhat illuminated by the street lights.  My memory is a little fuzzy on the locations of what I perceived to be the lights.  Not because of the time that has past, I felt this way even immediately after the experience.  There was at least 3 lights on the bottom of the craft; one being at each point.  There may also have been a fourth light in the middle.  There was a few lights along the side, but I am unsure of the exact number.  I believe that what I have d! escribed were lights, but they were not lit, so I can not say this with 100% certainty.  The craft was heading approximately in the same direction as I.  It was moving extremely slow; it appeared almost as if it were drifting.  All of the sudden it made a quick leap forward, lingered for a millisecond, dodged left at an incredible speed, then shot forward and disappeared into the sky.  I did not see nor feel any means of propulsion.  I believe the entire experience probably lasted less than 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

There were also 3 commercial plains flying in the area.  I was able to take a photo of one of the objects before they disappeared.  Sadly, it is only a photo of the last light in the sky.<n>

I have a lake in the front of my house and after the lake there is mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I look at this object and notice that it was not blinking and I could also notice that there was an outline of the object.  And I got a little frightened because I knew it was not a plane.  And I watched this object fly towards the mountain behind my lake.  It was moving faster then a plane or a helicopter could, and it was moving straight.  So I was watching this object and it disappeared behind the mountain.  And I was basically done with my cigarette when the object reappeared from the mountain and I was startled because it was going completely straight when it did a right turn and I was really confused.  It then just disappeared.<n>

The craft seemed small, almost super advice fighter like, although it had the typical 3 angle lights, and was a triangle and was definitely in Zero gravity, and gliding very slow, the person who first saw it, said it was going up and down in a floating ( almost on sea ) look. although i myself didnt witness that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second  &#34;ufo&#34; seen in our local sky in a week, about 5 days ago 10/9/2013 me and another person saw a Very bright organgish glow. it was amazing, it was low and threw the trees, and it seems miles away although there was no way to tell how far it really was... didnt see a craft or anything like that, but it was easily bigger then full moon and had the same type of brightness (even threw the tree), as a perspective of how low it was, the trees were about 100-150 feet away, and were only at tops 20-30 feet tall. so it was very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a very rural area, although were more isolated we very open minded out here, if any other people in town talk about the light or ufo sighting ill try to get them to report it here seperately, because I know how multiple reports matter, and i understand in a rural area like this its very hard to fact check.<n>

It was amazing to us that no one else looked up!!! -- even though we were exclaiming over the sighting.  When we came back one hour later, there were no planes coming in for landing over the area in which the object/light was seen (an area which is usually a flight path for incoming planes to the SL International Airport).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking south towards Lake Ontario, I noticed approximately 8 very bright red orbs travelling in an upward motion.  I thought how weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have grown up around aircraft as my Cousin and my Uncle have been private pilots with their own planes.  Both of my cousins have worked for a huge airline for the past 18 and 35 years, respectively.  I knew planes don’t have red bright lights they have white lights, as I watch them all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So as I walked south getting as much of a better view as possible, I tried to come up with a logical explanation.  I thought, could it be the Snowbird’s practicing at night with weird red lights?  The formation was so close together, with 2 stranglers coming up from the rear, I knew it was not average pilots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I know the Snowbird’s are out in Western Canada, so scratch that.  I then thought, maybe they are some type of Rescue Helicopters in training.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now running south, down the hill with my bulldog dragging me, I am going so fast all the while watching the Red Orb Formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see a Gentleman out in front of a very exclusive Condo standing on the sidewalk staring at the Red Orbs.  I pull up beside the Man, and ask him if he thinks they are Rescue Helicopters.  The Man approximately 55 years old says, “So I am not crazy”?  I laughed and said no.  We watched together kind of dumb-founded.  All of a sudden a huge plane/jet with a white light (allowing us to see how big the jet was) flies so close and directly behind the Red Orbs, it completely blew us away.  I looked at the Gentleman, and we are clearly trying to process, so I say, “How insane was that Pilot”?  The Red lights remained on for a second or two more, and then in the snap of a finger ALL at the same time they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Man starts yelling, ``Where are they?  Where did they go”?  We both discussed the fact that any aircraft is not allowed to turn there lights off, and even though it was dark out the lights from the City would have allowed us to see the outline of an aircraft.  There was NOTHING there.  In the blink of an eye they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was then heartbroken as I did not video record it ! with my phone, and did not phone my son studying at home to look out t he window.  It was all too fast, too surreal, even though it probably lasted 15 to 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran home without even getting my neighbor`s name (we were not even thinking), with promises that we would run into each other soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my cousin this morning, Oct. 15th, 2013.  It just so happened, that she was coming into Toronto International Airport heading up an Overseas Crew, at the same time I saw the red orbs.  She landed at approximately 7:30pm, on Oct. 14th, 2013.  There were Emergency Ground Crews all over the runways.  This is highly unusual.  She had not been notified that there was any landing emergency, nor an aircraft needing assistance on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told me her flight would have been placed in a holding pattern or at the very least they would have been notified that there was a possible emergency.  She was not.  She has not noticed this in all her years of flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as she can, she will be speaking to a pilot about this, and will be looking for the pilots she worked with after hearing my story.<n>

As we approach the mountaintop, I reach for my binoculars in my duffle bag and  started to glance  North at the Las Vegas strip, as the sun started to set to the West , My friends and I we&#39;re enjoying the view until one of my friends noticed a small blackish line miles away into  the horizon with his bare-naked eye . I started to view this object in my binoculars, I had NO IDEA what it was BUT I knew it was a UFO , I gave the binoculars to my friend to clarify what I was viewing, he couldnt believe his own eyes.  The Ufo wasn&#39;t your typicall Disc/sosser, spinning rotating thing hovering in the sky.  What I seen through with these binoculars as clear as day look like a very scary black battleship cruiser hovering a few hundred feet over empty desert.  It didnt look friendly at all, the UfO was very sleek smooth an round! on top but the botton was really rigid and pointy . it looked like a seahorse on its side and not upright.  It was just very out of thisworld.  I drew a picture of the ufo looks nothing humane but after we seen it for a few minutes through the binoculars.  It just slowly disappeared Into the sunet.<n>

I live near an airport and could see other flight paths.  I have no idea what this object was, because I could not see a silhouette of the object, due to the dark background of the sky.<n>

It was difficult to tell how high up it was, or how large it might have been, but it was about half the size of the moon at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very slowly and purposely, as if on some kind of course.  I couldn’t make out any vehicle, which would have been illuminated by the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fire appeared to be in the shape of a ball.  All we could see were orange and yellow flames, as if a large candle was flickering.  It couldn’t have been a hot air balloon or Chinese lantern, since the entire object was in flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn’t move along with any wind current, but instead moved in the pattern that a plane would move.  Then I thought maybe a plane was on fire, but we still couldn’t make out any specific shape under the flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was totally silent – no sound of an engine of any kind.  We watched it for 2 to 3 minutes before it slowly disappeared into the night sky as a tiny speck.  It was moving from southeast to northwest and appeared to go higher in altitude the further away it got from us.<n>

I was driving home when I noticed what I thought must be the planets aligning.  Four lights in the sky that for all intents and purposes looked like stars, only their size and brightness was highly unusual.  Visual, they were the size of small basketballs as seen by the naked eye.  I&#39;m no astronomer, but I don&#39;t think 4 planets are that visibly big and so close to each other in the sky.  It seems like there&#39;d be an announcement of the event, anyways.  The lights were arranged almost like an upside-down Big Dipper, or a triangle composed of four lights.  What really convinced me that this was some special type of craft was the fact that when I stopped moving, I noticed that the lights did not move at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after they dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many planes in the sky for reference to the size of these objects as well, and they were like flies compared to birds.  I wonder if anyone saw this as well?  It was amazingly bright ! and I couldn&#39;t help but have my attention snared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, no pictures.  By the time I got my tablet out from the house, the scene vanished.<n>

After about 10 minutes, the light dimmed and stayed dim for approx. 2-3min, then came back to full brightness (as bright as the ISS would be in a clear night sky) - this behavior happened about 4 times total.  The light stayed in a constant position relative to the moon (during this time, the moon had risen approx. 70-80 degrees above the horizon).  As the object seemed to move with the rotation of the earth, it soon became harder to view due to the tree line (from which it initially rose above) and we could no longer locate/track the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the light disappeared behind the tree line, we noticed another seemly white light appear flying from the east toward this light.  When the two lights were close to each other, the original light quickly became dim-to-invisible, while the other light seemed to become two lights, flashed in an alternating pattern, became dim-to-invisible also.  We were initially aware of this because we live near a major airport; so flying craft from commercial aircraft to recreational aircraft are seen regularly.  This one was strange because it came from a place in the sky outside the flight path that aircraft would normally approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above is an observation of something we normally do not see over the skies of this part of New Jersey.  Its behavior was suspicious so we wanted to put it on record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening.<n>

I was in the passenger seat.  At approximately 6:58 pm, to my right in the western sky at about 40 degrees off the horizon, I noticed 3 very bright white/amber colored lights in a perfect triangle in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was it is too early to see planets or stars, what is that.  I continued to look at this perfect triangle in the sky for about 30 seconds.  As I looked back to the Northwest clearly saw a commercial aircraft with the vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft with the vapor trail was not as bright or the same color as the 3 lights forming the Triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at the lights forming the Triangle and the bottom right light began to move down and to my right creating a triangle with the right side being longer, there was no sign of movement or vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I said to my business partner who was driving, “What is that”?  She leaned over and looked out my window and one of us said, “We need to film this.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time and our conversation the lights have moved into a straight vertical line, again with no vapor trail.  As we were searching for a place to pull over, I began filming on my IPhone 5S while we were driving and the lights moved into a wide arch over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around mile marker 37 on I29 South we saw rest stop ahead pulled over it took a moment to get the lights to appear in frame on my phone screen.  However there is commentary on the video as to what we were seeing until I do finally get them in frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 5 minute video, the link is below.  Because I was facing the sun the lights don’t appear as bright as they were.    However you can see two of the lights during most of the video, and you can see the third briefly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end you can also see the air craft with the vapor trail that appeared to be heading toward the lights.  As the aircraft to the left (or South of the lights) enters the top left of the video the lights disappear.  (This is at the end of the video).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video is 378mb.  I uploaded the video as Unlisted to my YouTube account.  Here is the link:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/e1dlCXcvb88<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights come into frame well around 1:36.  We had been listening to a Comedy Channel on Sirius Radio so there is some colorful commentary in the beginning of the video.   During the video we are discussing what we are seeing.<n>

When we reached mile marker 36, the passenger in my car exclaimed “what is that?” I had to lean down to see the objects out the passenger window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked through the window into the Western sky, I saw three bright objects with an orange tint forming a triangle at about a 45-degree angle to the horizon.  The objects were not moving, but hovering in that position as you could see planes to the north with obvious jet trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to quickly pull over at a rest area (Southbound Pacific Junction Rest Area on I-29) and found a clear area where we could video the objects.  Within the first two minutes of seeing these objects they moved from a triangle to a straight line – the point of the triangle staying stationary while the other two rotated and moved to form the line.  As they were doing this, they only signs of motion were the changes in position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We filmed and watched them for a little more than five minutes after we pulled over.  They then moved from a straight line to a more arced line, again the top point never moving position as the other two moved into position.  The objects did get a bit fainter towards the end of the time we were watching them, but hovered steadily.  We then saw a plane approaching from the south.  As we watched this plane approach closer we were shocked as the instant the plane entered the video frame, the objects disappeared.  No flashing or fading, just completely disappearing like a switch was flipped.  We continued to watch the area for approximately five minutes and nothing reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  In the video, you will hear us discussing a fourth object that remained after the other three disappeared.  We did determine after the fact that this was a star; however we could find no celestial reason for the other three objects.<n>

The larger object then got dim, flashed, and disappeared.  Truly Awakening!<n>

Geometric  shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night my girlfriend and I witnessed several orange coloured &#34;fireball&#34; looking orbs above Lake Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a high rise apartment building on the lakeshore so when we saw the first orb we were so stunned We evacuated the building discreetly on our own.  The orb looked bright orange, was approx 6 times bigger than a star and appeared to be coming closer to us. It was so bright it lit up the water between the Toronto Island, the airport and the shoreline with a bright orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no chance this could have been a flare or a lantern of some kind, it was too bright.  The top of the orb appeared to be emitting a smoke trail.  This is why we exited the building, because I thought it was a meteor of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reaching the outdoors we could no longer see anything in the sky so we returned indoors after 20 minutes.  When we came back to the window, nothing was in the sky, so I began to research other similar sightings on the Internet, when all of the sudden, it flickered back on like a flashlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next hour we watched six different positions in the sky light up, burn quite bright and then turn off.  We couldn&#39;t tell if it was the same orb, extinguishing itself and reappearing, but the most we saw lit at the same time was 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend said she could hear some type of frequency, or sound.  When I opened the door to the balcony I could hear a faint noise but nothing certain.  The orbs appeared to be on fire and floated in 10-15 min intervals somewhat stationary, but moved slightly side to side and appeared to change shape or angle itself to appear to have geometric shapes.<n>

Our thoughts are that it might have been a meteor and we plan to investigate the location of where we think the sound came from which was near the mouth of Emigration Canyon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

They were scattered in formation but grouped in the same general area.  I had a previous sighting Aug 2012 of a dozen orange orbs flying in formation north over 35w.  Past right over my car.  I&#39;m surprised nothing has been on the news!  What are these orbs and what do they want?  Military or other?

There was 8 orange ball shaped lights in the sky about 1200ft in the air hovering over us.  When one would move they all followed pursuit four on top and four on the bottom.  It was something we had never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It scared us and we ran back in the house and shut the door. I then called my friends that live a 1/2 mile away and I told them to go outside to look.  They called back saying they seen nothing.  I then called my mother got her answering machine and left her a message about this.  The time was about 11:40 pm.  After that I went outside to look and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I woke up and called my mom. She then told me that it was 9:00 pm when I called according to her answering machine.  About 2 weeks has gone by and I went to visit some friends that live about 40 minutes away.  I didn’t mention anything about these lights to them.  My friend then asked me if her boyfriend told me about the lights they had seen in my neighborhood and that they had used there cell phone to video them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was weird is they say they had just left our house from visiting with us but we had just got home and had been gone for hours.  But they couldn’t have visited us because we didn’t get home until 11:30pm.  We both had seen the same lights and they said that 3 other cars had pulled over to look, their video is timed at 11:28 pm.  Weird.  They said they they looked like they were coming toward them one by one then each one disappeared one by one.<n>

Three other cars had also stopped to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were  5 to 6 bright orange round lights in sky, west of Peoria, stationary in a descending arc.  They were unusually bright.  They began going out, or disappearing, in twos.  The last two went out more slowly, it seemed as if they were traveling away at a high rate of speed, we could see them growing fainter as they got further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We u-turned again and continued north, there was a jeep and a few people standing outside the trailer park and we stopped to ask what they thought this was.  They then pointed out that there were three more orange lights north of where we saw the original lights.   These also disappeared quickly.<n>

It was approximately 9 pm, the store was closing and we were walking to the car.  I noticed a yellowish light in the sky that was brighter and bigger then any star or plane lights that I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed to it immediately and ask my fiancé if he saw it and if it was moving.  We stopped walking so we could be sure, and it was definitely moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was strangely shaped, kind of a longer shape, positioned vertically.  It was at about a 40-degree angle in the sky to the north, but it was rising slowly and moving around, kind of back and forth.  As we were watching it, it split into 4 different equally sized lights; it seemed to me that three of them were flying erratically around the fourth.  They didn’t move far away from each other.  It seemed like it lasted about 10-15 seconds before the lights all came back together as one and then blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing as how we had never seen anything like this before, we were in shock and didn’t take our eyes from the sky.  It’s a good thing we didn’t because what seemed like maybe 10 seconds later it reappeared again, a single light, just about in what seemed to be the same place and size as before.  As we watched it this time it split into 3 lights and they flew around each other again.  But this time it didn’t seem that there was one in the center that they all flew around, but again, they didn’t get far from each other.  It didn’t seem to last as long as the first time they split apart.  Like the first time, they merged back into one, hovered for a moment and then kind of blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a few minutes, and then decided to drive away from the parking lot lights towards it to try and see it again, but no luck.  Also we tried to get video with my phones camera, but unfortunately the parking lot lights in IKEA were too bright, and you couldn’t even see it on my phone at all.<n>

I looked around to see if anyone else had noticed and leaned over to point it out to a stranger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both had no explanation.  The lights were in a &#34;D&#34; triangular formation, probably 15 degrees in distance - the first light to the next - and were moving inward together at more than just a slow gradual pace.  They were orange in color and glowing.  My first thought to attempt to explain it away was that &#34;maybe someone had suddenly let 3 balloons aloft with candles or lights in the area&#34;, but they stayed in perfect synchronization without any change in proportional shape, aside from shrinking closer together in a matter of seconds.  The formation, or triangle, then receded into the fog and/or clouds.  The position in the sky was approximately 45 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One person from the audience had been aiming a green laser upward to point the sighting out. Two friends of mine elsewhere in the crowd also witnessed the event, as did most likely hundreds as the group was a popular closing act and the surrounding was area packed. One witnessed appears to have captured video and reported the incident with MUFON (case #51502).<n>

EST I was watching tv with my wife when I happened to glace out side.  I saw what appeared to be an object orange in color flying past the window.  I then proceeded to get my camera and went out to the back yard where I picked it up again in the night sky.  I attempted to photograph this object at first I thought I had failed but on closer inspection I believe I was successful.  The object was round in nature orange in color and moving from south to north at what seemed to be a good speed.  However, there is no way to tell if the object was large and far away or close and smaller.  As far as I can tell it had a somewhat fuzzy appearance, also with regards to the photo I think there may be two of them in it, one further away and higher in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did report this to NAV Canada and talked to a Corporal ((name deleted)).

It then slowly started to dim and fly off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gone for about 30 seconds and then came back really bright.  It stayed for about 20 more minutes and did the same thing.

It faded and then flew away like a plane and disappeared up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of it was a dull white light.

The object would stay in one spot for a few seconds, then slowly move a short distance in random directions (up, down, left, right).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my adult son outside to see it because he had mentioned clearly seeing the same thing several nights in a row this week on his way back from work on a bicycle at 4 or 5 a.m. He confirmed that this was the same thing he had been sighting, but he had seen it in the southern part of the city near Kirtland AFB and the Albuquerque airport in the wee hours of the a.m.  His sightings also included purple as one of the colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was directly west in the sky.  Our home is close to the exact center of the city near the crossing of I-25 and I-40.  Other events going on this week were the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta, and fireworks the same night as my sighting.  However, the balloon events are held in the far north part of the city, nowhere close to where I clearly viewed this object. It had to be a distance of approximately 10 miles.<n>

I have seen the exact thing before almost a year ago but in a different location in my town.  We drove to find a strobe light and there was no evidence of one.  With this sighting being our second this year I looked it up online and found others reported same phenomenon in Virginia last month.  Any idea of what this is would be appreciated as it is very alarming. It was dark out and you could still see the clouds through the lights.<n>

And no extra lights to signify to other planes helicopters, etc.  And their was no like light going out infront of it to see where it was going in the night sky.  I then thought maybe i can here if it has a noise and i rolled down the window as my friend slowed down and stopped the car i looked up and listened carefully, no noise what so ever!!  When i look back infront of me the other 3 lights are completely gone like they werent even their.  When i look behind me at the one i was checking out it came to a complete stop right next to another oarnge glowing ball as they sat right next to each other and hovered for about 10 seconds and then flew away very fast then dissapeared!

We saw what looked like 3 to 5 dark orange hovering orbs still and silent.  Position was N to Ne just above tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, as we turned canoe to get a better look the large low hovering orbs began to float up and away glowing like Chinese lanterns.  However, we knew they were not.  At first they looked like large oval glowing jellyfish then appeared to shift into a more lantern like shape as they floated upwards silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third phase was when they appeared smaller and more brightly colored but were still much bigger and lower than stars.  They locked into a formation at about fifty degrees above the horizon and floated in that formation more directly north.  This formation looked like the top of Orion the Hunter, or possibly a circular form with a shape inside it much like an arrow or cross.  Unfortunately part of this formation was hidden behind a building on the end of the lake so we couldn&#39;t fully make it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next phase of this encounter was 8 to 10 stars looking like they were blinking in multi colored lights much like Christmas lights.  Their appearance in size was at least 10 to 20 times larger than an actual star would appear.  It would be comparable to holding a dime about a foot in front of your eye, but a little more cylindrical.  They resembled radio stars in they way they flashed multiple colors blue, white , red , yellow, green.  They danced around each other like bees over flowers in silent circles somewhat erratic in this pattern as if they were swirling around each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally they organized once again and formed a perfect hatchet shape with the rectangular piece facing west at the top and a long handle on the right or east side each dot representing a light bright type of design of perfect angles to create a clear shape.  They flashed a couple of times as though to show off their display, or the final act of this show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly they filed slowly out of the hatchet type of shape drifting off to the Northwest sky, up and away.  They almost seemed to puff out one by one like a burnt out firework.  We were so transfixed at this point we didn&#39;t want the experience to end.  They seemed to possess an intelligence.  They seemed to know we were watching.  One final light lingered as we focused on it, then disappeared into the NW along with the others.<n>

My boyfriend&#39;s family and I were preparing to leave a local school after a soccer game, when one of his relatives pointed out these weird balloons in the sky.  As we watched closer, we noticed that unlike helium balloons, these objects were not gaining altitude.  They appeared to be hovering and slightly moving southward in the sky.  I would estimate that there were at least 50 small silver spherical objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stared at them, they faded in and out as if the sun was reflecting off and on.  The sky was clear, so there was no obvious reason for this discrepancy in reflection.  As they faded in and out, they seemed to make new formations.  To me, the fading in and out was like a star that you can only see through peripheral vision, but not when looking straight at it.  This incident occurred for 10 or 15 minutes.  They were still in the sky as we were leaving the school.  Numerous others saw the objects in the sky.  One person commented that it was behaving like a school of fish in the sky.<n>

There are no lights out that way, so it is very dark since we are tucked into a dense ranch.  Being that my window is on the top floor of a 3rd story apartment, I can see above the tree lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the wee hours the morning of the 12th, I peeked out the window to check my van and weather before I went to sleep.  I was startled by a bright amber light about 1/2 a block away - maybe closer.  I opened the window to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was still and silent.  I even waved at it, and then I went to get my cell phone to video it.  When I returned, it was still there, and that shocked me.  I had half expected it to have left. I fumbled to see how to operate my new device, and eventually took a short video, but I was not sure if it was working.  I forgot about the light and the video till today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had I seen what the video showed, I would have camped out to see &#34;them&#34; leave!  In the video, it shows several amber lights with white tinier ones behind the main one.  Off to the left - there were more, and I cannot help but think I was so concerned as to whether the cell was taking video, I did not see the entire picture of the outside sky.  I recall turning the camera right to left to pan, as my window is rather narrow, but it lasted only 17 seconds.  Now that I can see it, it appeared to be above and beyond my building hovering!  It sure looks like there is a hazy bright gold figure (full of light) just left of center of the &#34;main amber light&#34; in gold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I would like to upload it if I can figure how to do that too.  I took a second video tonight for a perspective as to how dark it is out there!)<n>

I looked over to the south i think and I saw a bright orange light in the sky.  I thought it was just a firework so i watched it.  It soon broke into 4 individual hovering lights. They were lined up in a vertical position and they did not move for a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, one by one, they started to move horizontally back and fourth, fading in and out.   They seemed to stay at the same altitude through this phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching and they soon stopped moving back and fourth and they rejoined the vertical line.  They then went back into one and the bright orange light dimmed until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t the only one that saw it and since the lights stayed at the same altitude for almost the entire duration of this event, I don&#39;t believe it could be a hoax of any kind.<n>

Four other adult sitting with me saw this at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this was a meteor at a high altitude it was very large.  The size, as I said, looked like a burning piece of paper about 40 ft off the ground.  It appeared to have two buring spots near the center almost touching and light orange in color.  These two spheres were ejecting what I would describe as a coronal mass ejection in a blue green color.  This seemed to surround each sphere and trail off behind it, but not like a long tailed meteor.  Probably a 3 to 1 ratio of width to length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling from the south to the north.  We were only able to see it for a couple of seconds because of our looking up between two trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We jumped up to try to see if it was going to crash but buy the time we ran around the trees it was out of sight.  It made no sound what so ever.  There were several planes in the air in our view at this same time after realizing that it wasn&#39;t burning paper thought that maybe a plane was going to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, no sound following its disappearance:  This was no plane and not a normal meteor like I have had many occasions to view.<n>

Upon looking in the sky toward the moon we noticed 4 to 5 odd balls of light, moving quite fast very high in the sky.  They were not air planes as they did not have flashing lights which an airplane had we saw shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staring at these moving lights for almost 3 minutes, more appeared.  I counted a total of 12 but there may have been more.  I physically watched the remaining UFOs appear out of nowhere.  They did not all appear at the same time, it seemed to be one to two at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights seemed to be traveling in an unorganized cluster type fashion.  I know they were not air planes as at times some lights flew very close to each other.  One seemed to fly into the other and almost passed through as they continued to travel.  I caught only one on video but it is not of the highest quality.  Please let me know if any other reports were made.<n>

I was happy to discover that another group of eyewitnesses from the Cincinnati area submitted a video account of this occurrence on the NUFORC site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some time around 8PM, sitting in the stands at Turpin&#39;s football field, facing west, I noticed what appeared as one bright single orange light/ball of fire, that seemed to hang in the sky for a few minutes before breaking into two, then three glowing orange balls of light.  People around me were witnessing it as well.  A few kids were pointing and laughing say, &#34;Ohhh, look at the UFOs.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was amazed as these balls of light would slowly drop downward, and at first I wondered if they were some kind of night time military exercise, or maybe skydivers, or luminary sky lanterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to me to be nearby Lunken Airport (which is due west from Turpin, about 4 miles away), which led me to believe it was possibly a night time parachute jump with the parachutists wearing flares.  But I ruled that out as these glowing balls of fire seemed to hang in the sky far too long to be parachutes.  So I wondered if maybe they were hot air balloons, as they would float downward, but them rise back up in the sky.  But I counted that out as the glowing lights would fade in and out of view--and this was on a perfectly clear night.  They appeared to be maybe 2-3 miles in distance from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was about to conclude they were parachutists on a night jump, suddenly they moved upward at least a thousand feet and orbited around each other a bit, then appeared to be floating in a triangle shape, then appeared to go back into one ball of fire.  Very strange.  At one point when they first broke off from one ball of light to two, it appeared that two of them were linked by a long shaft of light...honestly it appeared to me by the color of it that they were connected by a rope of fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you watch the video:<n> <n><n> <n><n> [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4ouLci9bNN_dzJIY2NPQnlSLVE/edit?usp=drive_web]<n> <n><n> <n><n> just after the two minute mark, a streak of light appearing much like a shooting star, shoots off to the right from these balls of light (watch from the lower part of your screen.  I witnessed this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pretty freaked out, and had pointed it out to a few of my family members after watching it for a good 3-5 minutes, saying, &#34;Please tell me what we are looking at?&#34;  Finally they faded into darkness--just totally disappeared.  Naturally, I would glance around the sky from time to time the rest of the night, wondering what we had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they faded out of view, one lady nearby was quite unnerved and started exclaiming, &#34;Did anyone just see that??&#34;  A lot of people did, but I thought it was odd that most everyone just glanced at it, then shrugged it off and kept watching the game, which by the way was boring and untypically quiet for a Friday night football game.  The reason I bring this up, I was listening for aircraft engines, but it was very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where it gets weirder.  By this time, it was half time, and naturally, I was glancing around in the night sky to see if there was going to be any more of this phenomena.  I turned around and behind me, facing an easterly direction, appears a ball of light, in what I estimate to be 1,500 - 2,000 feet in the air.  It&#39;s bright, moving slowly toward me, and so I&#39;m wondering if my mind is playing tricks on me and if I&#39;m just being paranoid.  So I rationalized, surely it&#39;s a plane in a landing pattern heading towards CVG airport.  However, it looked like an orange ball of light, not a landing light.  Also, I was looking for the flashing wing tip lights as it appeared to be getting closer.  Never saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man I had never seen before was standing directly behind me.  I asked him, &#34;Do you see what I&#39;m seeing?  Is that an aircraft, or what the heck is that light behind us?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> This guy NEVER looked back behind us to see what I was pointing at but instead looked me dead in the eye and said, &#34;You&#39;re not supposed to see that.&#34;  WHAT THE FREAK!!  I said to him, &#34;Do you even know what I&#39;m talking about?&#34;  So he casually glanced back and said something like, &#34;Yeah, have you ever heard of Area 51?  You&#39;re not supposed to see this.  Just pretend it never happened.&#34;  Now, THAT was weird.  VERY. WEIRD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my wife, who was busy chatting away with someone, wanting someone to tell me I wasn&#39;t crazy and said, &#34;LOOK!  Tell me what you see.  Is that an airplane?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the orange ball of light which was slowly moving toward us seemed to break off into TWO BALLS of glowing orange light.  It was as if the second ball of orange light came out from behind the first ball.  But they were heading right towards us, at this point it seemed less than 1/2 mile away.  I wondered if they were going to pass right over us hoping I could get a good look at what they were, but suddenly they faded out.  It was as if a passing cloud blocked them out, but then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were they planes in a landing pattern line up, or was this the same lights we saw some 30 minutes before?  The mystery guy?  I never had seen him before, and I never saw him after I pointed it out to my wife.  He may have simply been a dad of one of the students attending the game but his response was very strange. And where did he go?  I think it was interesting to observe how most everyone just chose to ignore these strange lights as something they just didn&#39;t recognize and went about business as usual, watching the game.  Only the two kids initially pointing, laughing and acting silly and scared about seeing UFOs, and then the one lady who was vocal about what she had witnessed, besides myself asking her what she thought they were.  Everyone else just shrugged, and I think were afraid to admit they had just seen something they couldn&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning while surfing the web, I came upon this site and looked up the date of the game, wondering if anyone had reported the sighting.  I was glad to find a confirming video of it.<n>

The lights were level to each other like a pair of eyes watching my boyfriend and I on the porch at about 8:00p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the two lights moved to our right (east) behind a large tree.  The tree was about twenty or thirty feet near us.  At this point, only I had seen the two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Calling my boyfriend&#39;s attention to it, the blue light beamed from between the tree&#39;s leaves, then dimmed to original brightness.  It moved perfectly backward, out from the tree, blue light still on the left side/white light on the right, to where it was in our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in total awe as the white light grew blinding and the blue light changed into a powerful green and the (object, craft) seemed to come directly AT us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After glowing at a spotlight brightness, the craft backed away from us, dimming,and quickly hovered to the west behind another tree.  The lights magically turned softer and red.  The sound of an airplane filled the air, as it was totally silent the entire time, and it flew off.. into the east as this &#39;air plane&#39;..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am told a description of the observers is useful, but unless I am speaking directly to Peter, I will not leave any personal information.  However, I am a completely sane and honest person, and witnessed this event within the hour of this report.  I am reporting on this as a sign of my own awareness and concern for the questions we all have on our minds as witnesses...  What DID I just see? Am I ok?  Did anyone else in my city observe what we did? Should I worry? Did it see me too?  this will have been my first report, but most certainly not the first time I&#39;ve seen objects in the sky.  This experience itself, however, was the most intense by far, and the energy in our bodies afterwards has been like static.  Please email.<n>

My sympathies to the people who have to go through these things.  And now for my report...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside at around 8:35pm on 10/11/13 and immediately noticed several red/orange glowing dots in the sky.  I heard a plane flying, so thought nothing of it for a moment but it quickly became apparent that the lights were not planes or helicopters or anything of the sort.  My thoughts went to balloons, either large basket types or the now popular lanterns or whatever.. no, these were flying in formation and moving at a steady rate from WSW to ENE (I&#39;m guessing. They weren&#39;t flying exactly W to E, and I&#39;m no pilot sooo...)  What I thought were half a dozen lights turned into dozens and dozens if not a hundred or more as they continued to travel in the same direction in formations of 2 or 3 to as many as 5 or 6.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There appeared to be two different types at least based on the size of the glowing orbs in relation to each other.  Too, a couple times I noticed smaller glowing balls of fire &#34;shoot out&#34; or zoom away from the larger orbs.  The slow moving herd of glowing balls of red/orange light may have had escorts of some kind, because I noticed two or three orbs moving faster than the others by themselves, not part of any of the larger formations.  I don&#39;t know for sure when they actually started flying by as I feel I walked in to the halfway point of a massive caravan, but it lasted until nearly 8:43pm.  Tried for pictures and video, but my phone wasn&#39;t up to the task.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family also witnessed the event, as did one coworker I texted to make sure he saw the stuff Im always yammering about.  I would be surprised if you weren&#39;t flooded with reports of this event and expect it to make the local news.  I feel the sheer volume of &#34;craft&#34; lumps it in with some of the larger sightings you hear about in Mexico or Arizona.  Dozens and dozens if not a hundred or more.  Intense.<n>

I am not a big believer in UFO&#39;s but I can not explain this.  The photos I took visually confirm the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work when I looked up through my windshield and saw the strangest vapour trails I had ever seen.  I work in Aerospace, I have travelled around the world over 12 times...I have seen a lot of vapour trails and they are not uncommon on this part of my drive home.  But these vapour trails were like nothing I have ever seen.  They were so strange it made someone like me get out of the car and shoot them with my phone camera. I thought they looked that strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were multiple trails, they were dashed and dotted almost like Morse code and they were moving in multiple different directions as if produced by multiple craft moving in multiple different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I was shooting into the sun so I took many shots hoping one of them would show these vapour trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was several days later before I even looked at my photos, I could barely make out a few streaks because of the sun glare but my camera caught a floating, glowing blue object in 5 of the 8 photos I took.  I did not see this glowing blue object, I was trying to shoot the vapour trails so I was stunned to find it in the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PHOTO 1: Glowing blue sphere hiding behind a tree behind intersection. (4:01 pm) PHOTO 2: Photo of my car to prove I was there and not making this up. (4:01 pm) PHOTO 3: Glowing blue object in front of intersection 5 or so feet off ground beside a pick-up truck. (4:02 pm) PHOTO 4: Object not visible. (4:02 pm) PHOTO 5: Object appears 50-60 feet above intersection (4:02 pm) PHOTO 6: Object appears 80-100 feet above and behind intersection (4:02 pm) PHOTO 7: Object very bright 10 or so feet above intersection (4:02 pm) PHOTO 8: I was back in my car and moving again and took one last shot of the vapour trails through my windshield yet camera records an explosion in the trees on far side of the intersection. (4:06 pm) None of the other drivers in the photos stopped, none of them swerved or showed any signs of seeing something unusual. I didn&#39;t see anything myself other then the strange vapour trails in the sky, yet my phone camera definitely caught a glowing blue sphere moving in all three axis (X,Y,Z) right in front of many people and yet no one seemed to see it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought is it a defect of my camera or lens? Yet no other photo I have taken with it shows anything like this. The camera was a Nokia 920. None of the photos have been altered in anyway.<n>

I go outside frequently just to stare at the stars. I’ve done this since I was a kid. When I walked outside this evening there was movement in the dark sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane since I live near the airport but on closer examination I notice there were 5 objects that were moving synchronistically as if they were controlled by one pilot.  I heard no sound.  The flying objects were glowing a soft orange color and were moving in the south easterly direction..  The objects were flying in a “V” formation and slowly straightened out.  They did not behave like conventional aircrafts.  Their movement was more fluid, smoother.  The whole sighting lasted a few seconds and then they just vanished.<n>

I was stargazing, admiring Orion standing brightly in the sky.  Suddenly, I saw an object that looked like a star moving through the constellation at a very fast speed, about fighter jet speed, but much higher in the sky and it was a very clear, non-flashing, constant light, about the same luminosity as the stars in Orion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I assumed it was a satellite, but then to my amazement I saw another star moving at the same speed in the same direction, but several seconds behind the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment I went to get my telescope, but I couldn&#39;t get it focused on the objects in the sky. I looked back up with my naked eyes, and I just managed to catch  in time the second object accelerate at a massive speed towards the east, from Orion towards Jupiter. It might have been two satellites flying over rural Iowa followed by a shooting star originating from the exact same position in the sky,  But I&#39;ll be damned of it didn&#39;t look like a spaceship cruising across orbit lazily before blasting into light speed towards Jupiter.  I hope it was just a coincidence of satellites and a shooting star, but after I saw the acceleration streak I was unable to relocate either of the satellite-looking objects.<n>

It was hovering in the south east sky at an approximate angle of approx. 25 degrees above  the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered for a while in on spot emitting  pulsating red,white,pinkgreen/white  purple/blue, and reddish white pulsating lights.

Sky was really clear not a single cloud in sight.  My attention was caught by what at first out of my peripherals looked like a cloud of smoke moving high over my head from the rear to the front of me.  Then when my vision focused in on the object I noticed it was about 10 or so dimly lit white lights shaped in almost like an arrow formation.  There was a water tower in which the draft flew right over that I was able to use to compare the size of the craft.  The craft seemed to be significantly higher than the water tower but was still much larger in size.  At first it did not hit me how fast the object was moving but after realizing how quickly it moved from over top of me to the horizon I come to the conclusion that it was most definitely moving faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact that I would take the time out of my day to fill this report speaks for itself of how confident I am that I just witnessed something extremely odd flying in the night sky.  In my opinion the only explanation is either some military aircraft that is larger than anything the public has been told about or it was an, I feel crazy saying this, alien spaceship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Both the Moon and Venus are bright in the sky, and I was aware of them both, so I did not confuse the additional lights with planets, satellites or stars.  There were 3 bright lights in a straight, vertical line.  They were not moving.  They were not flashing.  I kept a close eye on them during my drive home, they slowly dimmed and disappeared over the 20 mins that I was watching them.  I am certain they were not airplanes or helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no flashing lights, nor did they change position at all during the time I viewed them.  I am not ready to believe they were aliens, but they were certainly up in the sky, maintaining a constant altitude, and they all left within 1 minute of one another.  It was one of the strangest things I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To finish up, I do not use a smartphone or else I would&#39;ve taken photos and/or video.  My wife called me during my drive home to ask if I saw the lights.  She saw them as well, independently of myself.  I am submitting this in hopes that it can be cross-referenced with other sightings in the area.  There IS an airport in near-by Flint, MI, and I did see 2 airplanes flying in the vicinity.

I&#39;m sure it was not an aircraft.  It was going way too slow to be an aircraft.  The weird about, as it went across the night sky, it suddenly dissapeared, no cloud in sight to hide it from.  It just vanished, planes usually have the bright blinking lights, this yellow/orange sphere/circle did not.  It also had a constant glow as it flew across the sky.  The other 2 aircraft were airplanes.  I&#39;d bet the pilots were wondering what that was too in sky.  My sheep ran towards there pen right after the glowing yellow/orange sphere appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was hovering in front of a cloud above the Rideau canal directly in back of parliament hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched the bright light slowly fade to nothing.  It was difficult to tell if it was fading out or disappearing into the distance.  We both knew we had just witnessed something very out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SON: My name is ((name deleted)).  At approximately 5:10 PM, in Ottawa Ontario, my father and I spotted a UFO above the parliament buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw is an object that looked like a large star, but in a couple seconds faded away slowly.  Which eventually disappeared completely.  The objects was very shiny, and reflective.  It looked metallic.  I know for sure it was not a satellite, because the UFO was in front of a dull cloud.<n>
10/10/13 17:00|St. Louis County|MO|Light|2-3 hours|Hovering bright object moving slowly around St. Louis.|10/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103298.html|561|ndxe201310| Howering bright object moving slowly around St. Louis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have noticed a large stationary light hovering in and around St. Louis County.  I first observed the object driving south on interstate 170 towards interstate 64/40.  The Object appeared over the municipality of Brentwood.  It was not an aircraft and it was a solid large white light.  It was not a satellite and was too low in the sky to be a planet. It was however bright like a planet.  I checked astronomical charts and there does not appear to be a planet in this location.  If you are driving due south it would be at the 11:oo O&#39;clock position.  I observed this object for a number of days in this general vicinity.  Sometimes the object is in the same relative spot and at other times it is nearby but in a very different location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a number of occasions I observed the object moving very slowly to the west.  Again it appeared bright, it had no flashing lights.  At times the object seemed to blink out and then reappear.  This was not due to clouds as I observed it on clear evenings. On one occasion during this same week I observed the object moving to the west as I proceeded west on I-64 heading towards chesterfield, MO.  I noticed the object hovering over Chesterfield Mall and moving very slowly west.  I was able to keep a visual on the object until I reached my home in Chesterfield.  I tried to observe the object with binoculars.  That really did not help clarify what it was. It stayed more or less stationary over chesterfield for a couple of hours. It eventually disappeared.  Once again I thought maybe it was a bright planet but it did not seem to set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to hazard a guess, I heard about NSA spy drones or stationary objects that are collecting data and it is possible it could be one of those.  It did not dart off or make any erratic movements. I have noticed it in early evening for several weeks.  It does move to the naked eye so that is why I am discounting that it might be a planet.  When I tried to look at it with binoculars I also had my wife and kids look at it as well.  They had no idea what it was.  I am a native St. Louisian and have lived in this region my whole life.  I am familiar with the flight patterns around Lambert and Spirit of St. Louis airports.  It is not an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have noticed a lot of high altitude spraying early in the mornings and in early evenings.  I have noticed these bright slow moving lights in various other locations around St. Louis.  They stick out because they are way too bright to be stars and do move.<n>

We live in a 2 family home, second floor.  Our bedroom is located on the backyard side of the house, away from the street.  We had all of our home lights turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in bed and talking about our weekend plans when all of a sudden there was this incredibly bright yellow light that appeared out of no where.  It was our window bright as can be disregarding the fact that there were blinds and open curtains.  Sure our curtains were open but  this light was just an unexplainable bright yellow color, it filled me with much fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately my husband was given his back to window but he also noticed how bright our room appeared and of course noticed my petrified expression.  Out of fear, I closed my eyes and hugged my husband as hard as I could of course, this did not allow him to go see out the window  When I opened my e! yes again the light was gone.  My husband and I were in disbelief to what had just occurred.  I asked him if he saw the light and his comment was &#34;how can you even miss it.&#34;  Now we went over ideas maybe it was the moon but we know that is not the case we had cloudy skies last night and our moon was definitely not in its full state.  We thought maybe a car?  But that was debunked given that we are in the second floor and heard no cars also as soon as the lights went away my husband checked outside the window and there was nothing!  Everything was silent,  No noise, no people, no airplanes.  My husband and I always have our curtains open and not once have we seen anything like we saw last night.<n>

I happened to notice a light underneath the tree line, kind of looked like the setting or rising sun glowing under the tree line, to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, a bright red light moved upward from the tree line and went towards and through the Square of Pegasus. It was flying very low, but with no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on towards my left and curved upward.  It appeared to slow down and &#34;drop&#34; what looked like small black packages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then sped up a little and kept on its path until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a little freaked out, and went in the garage to get a cigarette and came right back outside and sat down in the same place.  Not 5 minutes later, I looked to my right again because I saw a similar light beneath the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute later, a bright orange light emerged from beneath the tree line and followed the same path as the red light.  It even slowed down and dropped the same black packages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then followed the same course as the red light, until it disappeared where the red one had disappeared at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each light, both the red and orange ones, took about 5 minutes to complete their path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, the sky was quiet and no other mysterious things were seen.<n>

As i drove closer i noticed it moving, almost in a weaving pattern.  I noted that when it would lean and my view shifted from seeing only the bottom to partially the top, the top of the craft completely disappeared into the sky.  The lights on the bottom here spherical in shape and appeared to have no notable color, but would shift in an ambient way similar to the way a light show would.  It varied in speed and was the shape of a sting ray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The movement caught my eye.   Hard to estimate size, since I would first have to estimate the altitude....but I&#39;d say it was lower then air plane I&#39;ve ever seen fly.  Maybe a few hundred feet.  The angle I saw was side to belly of the craft.  I viewed it for about 10-15 seconds before I lost sight of it due to trees/ line of sight.  It looked like it had a wing span, likely V shaped.  No lights what so ever.  It looked dark grey in color (very very clear night here in St. Louis tonight).  No sound. It was graceful...it glided utterly silently in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This will wound even crazier, but it left behind a sort of very subtle blurry end trail as went by.  The trail it left looked sort of distorted, wavy....like the street on a hot hot summer day.  I don&#39;t know who to report this to.  Should I call the police?  It&#39;s been almost 2 hours now, and I haven&#39;t heard anything about it on the radio, news or internet.  It was so discreet that I now find myself thinking these things could be out here every night, and no one might see them unless they got lucky like I did. Creepy.

Approximately above the Mt. Comfort airport. (believe it was recently renamed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was daylight outside and I looked up and saw an object that was stationary in the sky but it seemed to be flashing on and off.  My mom and sister both saw the object and were wondering what the light was.  It couldn&#39;t have been a star because like I said previously, it was still daylight, around 5:00 or 6:00 pm.  I went and grabbed my binoculars to get a better look of the object and surprisingly it was still there for the time it took me to find them.  The object was still disappearing and reappearing as if it was blending in with the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was finally able to get a look at it with my binoculars and I saw two dark circular objects that were in a formation (one was above and the other was below).  I lost track of them through the binoculars and looked back up into the sky without them and it was gone.<n>

There are some red flashing lights that are radio towers that i see all the time.  It was above those in the horizon, but still lower than most aircrafts that fly by.  The light intensity would change all the time, brighter and then duller.  If it was moving, it was moving slowly.  The light would go out, then come back on intensely.  It did this for about a minute, then it just disappeared out of the sky completely.  I watched for a while and didn&#39;t see anything else after staring in the sky for another 20 mins.  Never seen anything like it.<n>

When I got to Carefree Hwy exit I noticed a stationary flashing light hovering above central Phoenix.  It never changed position as I conntinued toward Phoenix.  I noticed jet airliners coming in to the area as I see a couple of them every morning as I come to work.  This object was higher in altitude than the airplanes on their landing approaches.  Phoenix&#39;s Sky Harbor is on the south side of the city and I was on the far north side of the city.  This light flashed like the airplanes but it never changed position.  I was too high to be a helicopter and stayed in the same position for the 15 more minutes it took me to travel to work.  When I got to work it was still in the same position as I walked into the building at 4:30 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I travel this way 5 times a week and never have seen this before.

We were all in a mesh tent so we could see clearly through it. at about 12:45 in the morning everyone had fallen asleep I was still awake at the time because i kept hearing strange noises.  I finally decide to roll over and look up through the tent and I saw a large object directly above us It was emitting a slight shrieking sound and it had blue lights arranged to look like a X, it also had a blue haze around it.  At first i thought it was a meteor, but after watching it for about five minutes it had not moved, in fact it was rotating slowly. after about twenty more minutes some smaller objects appeared to have come out of the larger craft and joined into a delta formation there were about four objects on each side of the formation.  They wee circling the larger craft as if they were protecting or escorting it.I would have woken up the others but I was too shocked to move.  There were some dogs outsi! de with us, they were howling frequently, there was also a donkey in a nearby field giving out loud yelps.  The objects could not have been more than 1000 feet above me they sat there as if studying the landscape.  These craft sat in the sky for hours until i finally decided to try and sleep. the next morning the dogs that had been out with us were visibly shaken.  I have mostly kept this to my-self and told only the friend hosting the party i was at and select family members. I had no way to photograph these ships.  There were airplanes in the area but i don&#39;t know if they spotted it.<n>

I live just off of the loop 202 and scotsdale road about a half mile north of the freeway.  My front door faces southeast and I am directly in the planes landing path to sky harbor in Phoenix.  I can sit on my front patio and watch planes decend all day. In my two years I have never seen a plane traveling east at the altitude and direction of the object I saw tonight.  The object was traveling east and hand a series of lights on the rear that would flash in an ascending order from left to right.  It caught my eye because, like I said, I have never witnessed a plane traveling that direction in that location before.  I quickly called my 17 year old cousin outside to look.  He was just as fascinated as me.  The lights were clearly visible and bright. I quickly hopped in my car with him and started driving east.  We followed the object for about 10 minutes and then turned around.  I have never experienced something like this in my life.<n>

10/8/13 22:00|Weston|CT|Light|20-30 minutes|A single orange light hovers 20 ft above treeline before exiting view to the South.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103734.html|596|ndxe201310| A single orange light hovers 20 ft above treeline before exiting view to the South<n> <n><n> <n><n> FOR A MULTIMEDIA VERSION OF THIS REPORT, VISIT chrisburnswriting.wordpress.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of Oct. 8, three friends and I traveled to the Saugatuck Reservoir in Redding, Conn. to watch the Draconid Meteor shower. While we didn’t see any meteors, what we saw will probably stick with us for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:15 that night, one of us noticed a very bright, very low-flying orange “thing” just above the tree line of the eastern shore of the reservoir (see above). Beyond the reservoir to the east is a state park called “Devil’s Den.” It is named as such, according to the Darien Times, because charcoal makers in the hilly, rocky area would say that a hoof-like mark made in a boulder was the footprint of the Devil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took about 20 minutes for us to become convinced that this was something that we should take pictures of. Once the camera was up and running, the lights remained hovering for about 10 minutes, according to time stamps taken from the camera that took the pictures below. The orange light hovered above the trees moving in an erratic, “jerky” fashion. Near the end of its visibility, it began moving purposefully towards the south, where it disappeared beyond a grove of pine trees that blocked our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ——— This is not the first time these lights have been reported by observers. ———<n> <n><n> <n><n> (For the record, I am a newspaper reporter who works for a chain of newspapers that includes the newspapers that have covered Redding, Easton, and Weston for a long, long time. No one working at these papers, including the publisher, had ever heard of anything like that which I show below. However, research like this is my job, and I stand behind the information I present to you. But, I cannot guarantee the veracity of the reports listed below. In my opinion, the chances of this many separate reports of similar incidents in one small part of Connecticut over a vast period of time is more than a coincidence.)  As far back as 1966, a Doctor from Darien, Conn. driving past the reservoir noticed lights that seem to match the description of what we had seen.  His report was chronicled by the Spartanburg, SC Herald-Journal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are also multiple matches for what we saw recorded in the National UFO Reporting Center.  Below I partially quote one entry from Feb. 22, 2011:  “Last night at 8pm I looked out my living room window and noticed a flashing bright red light low on the horizon a mile or so away over the Devil’s Den area on the Weston/Redding border.  It was low in the sky and unusually bright, much brighter than any airplane lights, flashing and drifting very slowly.”  And another partial quote from Sept. 28, 2010 in Redding:  “I saw a bright light that slowly moved through the sky and seemed to have striations that looked like lightning bolts eminating from it.”  And another partial from Weston in Feb. of 2003:  “Bright light in sky. Not an airplane because it didn’t move.  Not a star because it was twinkling white, green and red lights. To the left was another star-like light that seemed to blink a few times then stop…blink again a few time then stop, etc.  After 5 mins. or so both lights grew dimmer and more distant until they were gone.”  And another from Norwalk in August of 2007:  “Blinking Bright Star/object, at lower altitude than normal at stand still/ moving very subtully through the night sky.  The UFO appeared to be a a blinking star or a plan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I laid down in the bed it was descending in a weird fashion.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> ——— Our Location ———   Below are three maps which show our location, our line of site, and the location of the floating object.  The blue lines represent the opening through which we viewed the orange light.  We were only able to witness the light’s movement between the island you see to the left of our line of site (respective to the observer) and the tall pine trees which cover the peninsula to our right. You can find the same maps at:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zwGJfJDQECZY.k7Uby7nJpcsQ<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visibility maps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visibility maps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ——— The images ———  That night, I was lucky enough to have my Canon Rebel T3i in the car that brought us to the reservoir. I had taken some 30&amp;#8243; exposure shots before the light appeared. All of the images taken that night were in RAW, CR2 format, which can be provided to anyone who might assume they have been “photoshopped.”  When the light first appeared, we believed we were seeing a plane coming from the east, rising very slowly.  However, compared to other planes that very regularly fly over the reservoir at night, it was moving far too slowly, and too erratically.  To give the lights some context, I took a picture of a plane traveling above the reservoir just after the orange lights disappeared. It is pictured below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-presentation-plane-wp.jpg?w=660&amp;h=440<n> <n><n> <n><n> An image of a plane captured above the Saugatuck Reservoir after the orange lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An image of a plane captured above the Saugatuck Reservoir after the orange lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As one can see, the lights recorded when taking a picture of a plane were regular, and tightly delineated. I was not taking these pictures with a tripod. Any camera shake is negligible, and the lights of the plane are clearly defined. EXIF data and zoom views are included above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contrarily, the pictures taken of the odd orange lights were not clear or well-defined. The following picture was taken with the exact same EXIF settings, from the exact same point on the reservoir as the plane lights above. Yet, it depicts something much less defined, with varying colors. It almost looks like a hieroglyph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-1-presentation.jpg?w=660&amp;h=440<n> <n><n> <n><n> (An image taken of the orange lights seen on Oct. 8 at the Saugatuck Reservoir.)   The next image of the orange lights give a much better perspective of how unbelievably low these lights were hovering above the tree line.  The brightness and contrast have been edited to show a clearer look at the tree line.  Also of note are the green lights which seem to be the source of the orange, glowing lights.  This image is also taken at about half the shutter-speed as the above two images, and appears to show the eratic nature of the light’s movement across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-presentation-2.jpg?w=660&amp;h=989<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third image of the lights again shows the clear difference between the green and orange lights in the sky, though the human eye could only pick up the green.  When we saw it without a camera lens, the light appeared to be an orange circle floating across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-3-presentation.jpg?w=660&amp;h=440<n> <n><n> <n><n> An image that shows the orange lights in the sky   ——— Conclusion ———  I cannot even pretend to guess what on earth I took a picture of that night.  Maybe its a lighted kite for all I know.  All I can do is give you the information I have seen and found, and let you make your own conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m the furthest thing from a skeptic when it comes to this sort of thing, so I urge you to debunk anything I say as harshly as you can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fellow observers and I are excited to see what you all may think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to contact us at [Email removed/cms/tg]<n>

It was completely silent and blacked out. No lights on whatsoever.  It was erie seeing this thing fly over silently and quickly.  It was maybe only 150 feet up because the trees in my backyard are around 100 feet tall.  Sky is totally clear tonight and I work in aerospace so I&#39;m familiar with known aircraft and regulations. And no big hills for hang gliding around this area.  Possibly a totally silent  drone?  It was too fast and dark to get a picture.  Flew in a NW to SE direction, almost the exact same flight path I have witnessed a red fireball silently fly over a month or so ago.<n>

It appeared directly above us out of nowhere very bright somewhere in the flying zones of planes. It moved very slowly and made its way going south and within a minute it changed direction 60 degrees and continue to travel in a not so straight line until eventually it faded away behind the very little clouds that were in the sky.  Being that there was also a satellite making its way across the sky as well as witnessing the meteors, it was easy to tell it was not like anything that could have some reason.  Eliminating all possible options left both us questioning what we saw and although we cannot just claim it was an alien or entity, it was definitely an unknown bright orb that appeared in the sky and traveled in a fashion unlike anything found in today&#39;s society. With no noise whatsoever and the sudden appearance, even being skeptical we accepted that what we witness was out of the norm.<n>

Last night my family and I were out looking for the Draconid meteor shower.  While we were unsuccessful in seeing meteors, we did spot a few satellites and were, therefore, tuned to objects orbiting the Earth.  I noticed what appeared to be a satellite traveling south to north.  There were no visible flashing lights on the object and it was slightly reddish-orange in color which may have been a reflection of the sun because the other satellites showed a similar hue.  I pointed it out to my family and then it started to travel in an odd manner.  It first took a turn east-northeast and started moving in a zig-zag pattern in relation to the stars.  It then turned south and traveled for some distance before turning once again toward the west.  It then stopped and turned back toward the east-northeast and kept traveling in that direction until we stopped looking at it.  The entire incident last! ed about three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft traffic pattern for O&#39;Hare airport was clearly visible and well below this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then the moon moved across the width of the sky (NO SOUND).  I was amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my 15 year old daughter came out I asked her to look up and she sad&#34; whats that?&#34;  I was not drinking or under the influence of any legal or otherwise substances.  When I looked more closely I could tell it was large as the moon but a little oval like an egg.  The moon was behind grey clouds.  Then a plane flew underneath the object which gave me better perspective of its size.  The plane was like a pen pin point next to a person.  Also the plane looked like it was flying at turtle pace compared to speed of object  Huge.  I was driving towards North and I could see it move from one size of the sky to the other no zig zags just straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the county non-emergency # to ask if the local Army was doing drills, they said no.  I asked if there was a promotional spotlight in town (it didn&#39;t look like a spotlight but I wanted to make sure), they said no.<n>
10/8/13 19:30|Indianapolis|IN|Light|6-8 minutes|Spherical orange lights seen in western sky by family of 3 in Indianapolis.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103088.html|608|ndxe201310| Spherical orange lights seen in western sky by family of 3 in Indianapolis<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2013 7:30 p.m. ET  My husband, son and I were traveling south in our car on Keystone Avenue in Indianapolis, Indiana. The sky was perfectly clear and very light, as the sun was just setting. We turned west onto 38th Street, a six-lane-wide street with a clear view of the sky nearly down to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we were on 38th Street, we saw four lights in the western sky in front of us. Each light was round, orange, and approximately four to five times the size of Venus, which was also visible in the western sky.  Their position in the sky appeared to be approximately 15 to 20 degrees to the right of Venus.  The lights were arranged in a straight vertical line, like a column.  The lights were the same distance from each other, and as we continued to watch them, the two bottom lights moved laterally to the left away from the two upper lights while still holding their position relative to each other, one on top of the other.  Then the two bottom lights moved back beneath the top lights, still keeping the same distance between each other.  Then the bottom lights seemed to sink toward the horizon while the top lights seemed to move upwards in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to drive west on 38th Street while my son and I took photos with our phone cameras.  Suddenly, all four lights seemed to flatten out, changing in an instant from round, star-like orbs to flat, horizontal streaks.  This happened so quickly that there was no discernible process of change--the forms just appeared different, though the new shapes were the same orangish color and retained their positions relative to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove off 38th Street into the 100 Acre Arts Park of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and stopped the car in an effort to see better, but by then the sky had darkened and the flat, horizontal streaks faded rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we scanned the sky for the shapes, we then saw two streaks of white moving rapidly across the sky in the same path as the shapes.  As the white streaks continued moving, we saw that they were contrails from airplanes.  We could see the dark forms and the blinking red and white lights of the planes as they flew overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Googled &#34;UFO reporting&#34; on my phone and found the number for the National UFO Reporting Center.  I called and reported what we had seen and am submitting our separate reports of the sighting as instructed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, son and I all witnessed this sight together, and we agreed that it was unlike anything any of us had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Submitted by L.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday October 8, 2013, my wife, stepson, and I were traveling west on 38th street in Indianapolis, Indiana.  When we approached 38th and Fall Creek, I looked in the clear Western Sky. It was approximately 7:30 p.m. and that&#39;s when I noticed four lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a vertical formation, with what I would guess from the ground looked like they had about 100 to 200 yards between them.  We began following these lights.  Two of these lights smoothly and suddenly began to float in a horizontal pattern and headed southwest.  As the sun set, the lights became more difficult to see, almost as if they were cloaked by the sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed the lights to the 100 Acre grounds of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.  It was there that my wife called the National UFO Center, and we were told that a similar phone call had been made only moments before from Pennsylvania, and the caller had reported seeing these lights in the Western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Submitted by K.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all started as my mom, stepdad, and I were driving home from my grandmother’s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all having a jolly old time in the car, discussing various subjects like school, politics, and dreams.  As we were heading close to the road that leads to my stepdad’s house, my mom suddenly jumped up and shouted “LOOK, UP IN THE SKY!” I thought she was crazy until I put my glasses on and saw four orange-ish lights floating in unison.  After I saw them, my stepdad finally noticed them as well.  Right after we acknowledged their existence, two of the bottom-most lights began to fly left horizontally.  It was then that we realized that these HAD to have been UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started following the lights but to no avail.  The closer we drove to the lights, the darker the sky became, and eventually the two remaining lights disappeared on the horizon.  We stopped near the Indianapolis Museum of Art to look up, but still nothing could be seen.  It was then that my mom called in the UFO hotline and reported our findings.  What intrigued me the most is how the operator mentioned someone in Pennsylvania reporting the exact same sighting as us mere minutes before we called in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Submitted by A.<n>
10/8/13 19:14|Fort Myers|FL|Changing|60 minutes|Recurring sighting in WSW sky, NOT Venus.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103070.html|609|ndxe201310| Recurring sighting in WSW sky, NOT Venus<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object has appeared on multiple nights, always between 7:15 PM and 8:30 PM, always in the WSW sky, and remains visible for approximately one hour.  It does not deviate in altitude. It changes between two forms, seemingly as it slowly rotates.  It is either a triple light or a single orb, always white, and changes in intensity.  I have watched it through binoculars and when it disappears, it quickly dims and just &#34;goes out&#34;.  It does not set. It does not fly away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First the outer lights begin to dim, followed quickly by the center light until it is no longer visible.  I have never seen it reappear the same night.  There have been three adult witnesses to this and we all agree on the description.  First, we believed it to be Spica, then Venus.  But planets do not &#34;dim away&#34; nor do they have three distinct lights.  We first observed this in September and filed a report here at that time.  I have contacted our local control tower as we are a few miles from an airport, but they could offer no explanation.  After so many subsequent sightings I have decided to file an updated/new report for tonight&#39;s sighting.  Tonight&#39;s pictures are the best representation I have been able to capture, to date.  All three witnesses are responsible, non-drinking adults who would really love to know what it is that keeps appearing in our sky!<n>

Remained in sky for approx 45 min before graying out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 08 October 2013, at approximately 1730, I was on way to attend a state representive forum in Tillmans Corners which is WSW and just outside of Mobile, AL.  I had stopped at an intersection waiting for a red light facing north when my attention was captured by a white oval/roundish object.  This object was about a little over 3 fists above the horizon with luminosity equal to or a bit brighter than the moon.  The size was about ¼” to 1/3” comparatively speaking.  What fascinated me most at the time was that it remained stationary.  I didn’t take a photo at the time because my impression was that it was a blimp even though it was rounder than that.  I figured it maybe it was the angle disguising such an obvious shape.  Besides I was driving in a new area looking for the building where the forum was to take place so I dismissed it from my mind.  I found the building a few minutes later and decided I had time to get a bite to eat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After eating, I was returning via the same route 30-40 minutes later. At the same intersection I glanced up to the spot where I had seen this anomaly and it was still there! Making a left and arriving at my destination a few blocks over, I parked and got out my car. I stayed outside for another five or so minutes continually watching this object. I wanted to take a picture, but thought it would be unimpressive and when I decided to take one anyway, it turned a bluish gray and disappeared!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again thinking maybe it was blimp, I thought I should at least see something slighter darker the clear sky color to indicate a shadow or something but there was nothing.  I waited a few minutes more but nothing further other the than the clear sky. It ended about 1925.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry about that, it would be October 08, 2013. So used to military expressions of date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was larger than Venus and smaller than a full moon.  I would say the size of an eraser end of a pencil would be about right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

Relatively few cars were on the winding mountain road and the sky was very overcast.  While driving on a fairly straight portion of the road, a glowing white light caught my eye.  The spherical object was approximately the size of a cantaloupe or basketball and was hovering stationary near the top of a large tree.  The object seemed to shimmer white light yet did not blink lights and did not change light color.  It was a glowing ball of white transparent light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly braked and grabbed my iphone (which was in camera mode as I had been stopping periodically to take pictures of the autumn leaves) and snapped a picture of the glowing orb.  Mere seconds later, the orb appeared on the opposite side of the 2-lane road at approximately the same height off the ground, yet I did not witness the orb move from one location to the other. It was simply as if it &#34;disappeared&#34; as it moved between locations within seconds. I quickly snapped a second picture before the object simply was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No longer seeing the object, I proceeding in driving toward my destination. Once in SLC, I stopped to look at the two pictures of the object I had taken.  I was surprised to see that the object (which had appeared bright white to my eyes at the time I observed and photographed the object) appeared glowing GREEN, not white, in the two photographs!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lighted object I witnessed and photographed was not a reflection from another vehicle or street sign, nor was it a malfunction of my iphone camera (inasmuch as I have taken literally hundreds of photos of this season&#39;s autumn leaves on the iphone at varying times of the day and early evening and have never seen a reflective green spherical object inadvertently appear in any of them)!   The green orbs shown in the attached photographs are what ap! peared to the naked eye as white glowing orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what it was I witnessed and photographed; I do however know I successfully captured whatever it was in two valid photos.<n>

We observed this for several minutes,awe struck, without thinking that we all had cameras on our cell phones.  I was able to snap seven pictures of the object before it disappeared behind the trees.  The pictures are of poor quality and do not do justice to what we witnessed.<n>

I went out on my balcony which is on the 3rd floor and is about 2 miles east of Redondo Beach.  I can see Palos Verdes Penninsula from my balcony.  I opened the sliding glass door and went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what appeared to be a large blimp like object.  But, the object moved faster than a blimp and slower than a plane.  It was multi colored and continuously blinking red blue and white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lots of black clouds coming in off the ocean.  So, before the object moved behind these clouds I quickly ran and got my camera.  I snapped four pics.  But the 2 here were the only ones that came out before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 that came out I just blew it up so you can see the lights more clearly.  The first set of lights were 2 red lights.  The 2nd pic, I caught the red and blue as the blue light was blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this to MUFON who subsequently did a phone interview with me.  They said it was unidentifiable.  I&#39;ll let ! you be the judge.  This isn&#39;t the 1st time I saw a UFO around my area.<n>

I have heard of other people reporting these v shaped flying wings and was very excited that I got to see one.  I tracked it for about 5 seconds then it was gone, they make no noise so it&#39;s very hard to pick up on them you have to only look with your eyes, I believe that is how they go undetected as they are completely quiet and move very fast but graceful through the night sky&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It came from the same area that the space station came from and was moving much faster then a satellite could move and was a bit brighter then a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then under a clear sky it went dark then illuminated a bit kind of like a blink an then disappeared.  No aircraft I know of can move so fast.  Then amazed by this I started looking around and saw a shooting star.  Shortly after I witnessed a satellite.  Then while watching the satellite I noticed what I thought was a star blink or glew brighter then took off and was gone in a flash.   My mom witnessed both and her friend on the phone saw the first UFO as it was visible longer and the reason her friend also saw the first UFO was because we were watching the space station together.<n>

We noticed a bright light above the tree line.  It looked like a star but we thought maybe a planet.  It couldn&#39;t have been a planet since it was too close, usually planets are located further up in the sky.  The light didn&#39;t move for about five minutes, then it started to fade in and out.  Then it faded out all together and was gone.  We called out for someone else to see what we were seeing.  We tried to view the light with binoculars but was unable to make out a form.  A total of three people viewed this light.  One person was a pilot, they stated it wasn&#39;t a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We sat and waited, and soon another orb flew into view and seemed to fly behind us.  After a few minutes, another appeared from that direction and flew quickly in a wavy way, up and down, back over the houses, and a light in the center seemed to get brighter.  This orb was soon followed by three more, one at a time.  They almost looked like they were racing one another.  When I saw the first one, I thought it was only an object in the wind, but the others that followed were being guided by more than the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m unsure of how many there were because they could have doubled back.  There were at least four. They were white-grey, possibly silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These moved faster and in formations that I have never seen a plane or helicopter do.

I think a short explanation would be good first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you know when there is a bright light like a flash from a camera, your eyes react by seeing a black dot as you blink.  On that Monday as I looking into the western sky in Troy, Michigan.  I did not see anything unusual in the sky, but all of a sudden as I blinked I saw 5 black images that were left on my retina.  As I blinked repeatedly the image gradually faded after perhaps 30 to 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 5 images were saucer shaped with a dome in the middle.  There were 3 on the left one above the other and 2 on the right higher and appeared a little larger then the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not determine speed or direction because they were imprinted on my retina.  As I turned my head the images would follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before I did not see anything but the black retinal images.  Almost as if they were so bright that I could not see them, or they were emitting a frequency just out of the visible light spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very strange and has not occurred again, but I will keep watching.<n>

It was a beautiful and perfectly clear night sky just before sunrise and I took notice of the familiar constellations above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds, I noticed that a few of the lights were extra bright looking and even looked a bit orange in color.  I focused on the brightest one directly above me and I could see that it was moving very slowly and steadily across the sky.  I got my Girlfriend&#39;s attention and she started watching with me.  At this point I thought it could be a an airplane at high altitude or a satellite but I continued to follow it with my eyes.  Not a second later, it accelerated to at least ten times it&#39;s speed and shot across the sky.  Without slowing down, it then took a seemingly impossible right angle turn.  The glowing orange object then slowed down and returned back in the direction it came from and then took off! at vertical angle directly out into outer space.  We followed it for twenty seconds or so until its light faded completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then scanned the sky for other bright star-like lights and found that there were at least three more visible that were behaving in the same way.  They were moving about the sky in ways that were not possible by regular known aircraft and were moving at incredible speeds.  They were also accelerating and changing direction in ways that I have never seen. It was quite clear that they were guided by intelligence.  This went on for about twenty minutes until the Sun started rising and the lights faded into the blue morning sky.  All four of the observed UFOs were at seemingly high altitudes and were witnessed very clearly by both myself and my Girlfriend.<n>

I had just passed the East Alabama Medical Center, ( a hospital). I was in front of the fire station located next to the hospital and along US Highway 431, when to my immediate front and slightly to my left, there appeared in the sky, almost 1/4 way up on the horizon, a very large, round flash of light.  It appeared no longer than 2 seconds. I looked to the clock in my Jeep Cherokee and it was 11:11 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no communication tower in that location. I had my window down and heard no explosion. I continued going north on Hwy 431 going home.  It had rained all day, but now there was only a light drizzle.  I saw nothing else until I was completely out of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling north I now noticed a large white glow behind the clouds looking back in the direction where I had earlier seen the flash.  This was to my left and to the west.  The position of the glow would have been over Opleika where I saw the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly to my front, again the north, a very large &#39;V&#39; shape flashed in the sky just over the tree tops, again about 1/4 way up from the horizon.  It was a very wide and yellow-white flash that lasted about 2-3 seconds. It was very plain!  It seemed to be less than a mile in front of me.  The shape of the &#39;V&#39; reminded me of Texas Long Horn cow horns.  The ends of the &#39;v&#39; curved slightly upward. It was perfect shaped on both sides, I mean both sides were identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the clock and it was 11:28.  I began looking for a mile marker sign and the first one I saw was mile marker 148.<n>

Approximately the size of a 747 with no navigation lights. There was a low hum as it went by and was too close and too low to be an airplane.  It disappeared past where we could see for about two minutes, then returned from the opposite side as though it had circled us.  It was much closer now and the light lit up part of our room.  It flashed a bright white light a couple times and we could see that there were three lights on the back of the craft and only one on the front.  We weren&#39;t sure where the flashing white light was coming from.  The low hum was there again and it was moving very slowly in a smooth path.  I traveled out of view again and did not return.  We did not see where it eventually went to but airplanes went by 15 minutes later and confirmed that the craft was both too low and too close to be one, as well as looking nothing like them.<n>
10/6/13 21:56|Canyonville|OR|Unknown|1 hour|3 lighted spacecrafts that formed Triangular shape & ascended straight up into the sky, moving at unbelievable speed.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103028.html|639|ndxe201310| 3 lighted spacecrafts that formed Triangular shape &amp; ascended straight up into the sky, moving at unbelievable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On around 10/02/2013 at about 3AM I went outside to go smoke after suddenly waking up with a strange feeling/disturbance to my sleep.  I&#39;m not sure if the noise was in my dream or if I was half asleep and imagined it  But I woke up startled to a noise like medal on medal rubbing. It sounded like it was coming from either outside my window, but over my head, or up in my attic or over my roof.  I Immediately called my friend Madison and as I&#39;m going outside &amp; on the phone with her I saw a star in the sky oddly brighter than the rest, As I observed it for awhile I realized it couldn’t be a star,  Maybe an airplane?  It had 2 flashing colors which are why I originally thought it to be a plane and it was moving.  But the more I watched it the more I realized it was NOT a plane and it was NOT the only one there.  The first one I saw I call “the bright one” it was on the left hand side of the sky.  It kind of sat there for about 10 minutes just hovering then I notice 2 other ones on the right hand complete opposite side of the sky they were brighter than stars but not as bright as the first “bright one.”  They were far away so it was hard to tell of their shape, But they appeared to be an oval shape as I could see after all this, because “The bright one” all of a sudden SPEEDED across the sky at a speed Impossible by aircraft to man. It freaked me out really bad because then the “bright one” went across the sky and then straight up to above the two on the right I seen before. The 3 of them formed a triangle shape, with the bright one being in lead. Once they were all aligned PERFECTLY, They went DEAD STRAIGHT up into the sky and disappeared after awhile of ascending! As they went upwards I also saw what appeared to be several more of them trailing behind the first 3 (what I’ve been referring to as LEADERS) But weren’t as distinct for whatever reason as the first 3. They ALL however did ascend straight up and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called several people explaining what I had seen in a panic. It really scared me I went inside, locked the doors. THEN last night a similar thing happened, only this time I had an eye witness. My sister was staying for the weekend THANK GOD. Same scenario. We went outside to go smoke, The exact time we came back inside from watching the “ufo’s” this time was at 9:56 PM and the date was 10/06/2013. I live near Days Creek Oregon in Canyonville, Right next to the Canyonville YMCA. This time I saw the same “bright one” it was AGAIN on the left hand side of the sky and there were AGAIN other ones This time more spread out. This time however they all sat rather still for about 20 minutes. I wish I had timed it but I hadn’t so the duration is a guess. They all (as last time) were flashing 2 different colors. A couple of them at first zigzagged across the sky in FAST speeds like the last time after sitting still for quite awhile. I pointed the “stars” out to my sister getting extr! emely excited. “LOOK! THIS IS WHAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT, THEIR THERE AGAIN!” My sister DID see them too and was pretty scared &amp; nervous. She kept saying it was really weird and she didn’t know what they were. Appearing to her as planes as well at first, she also considered maybe there was just a large amount of satellites. Until they began moving at rapid speeds then ASCENDING, MOST OF THEM, Straight up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both times I was sitting on my porch there are a bunch of trees behind my house, But I could see them all clearly UP above them in CLEAR sky just a street past my house is what i believe to be a logging company? there is a big empty lot right there, sometimes semi trucks but none that I seemed to notice on those nights, Tho I wasn&#39;t paying attention to anything but these UFOS<n>

The light then stopped and began hovering over Bremerton, I called my wife&#39;s attention to the light; approximately 1 minute after my wife started watching, a second light appeared out of thin air.  The two lights had the shape of a crescent moon.  After a few seconds, the first light dimmed and went off in to the horizon while the other light remained hovering over Bremerton.  My wife says she saw green, red and blue lights but all I saw were white lights.  Eventually the second light went into the horizons well.  The whole encounter lasted between 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
10/6/13 21:00|Steamboat Springs|CO|Rectangle|3 minutes|Green and red craft that dropped a smaller white light.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103029.html|641|ndxe201310| Green and red craft that dropped a smaller white light<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday evening, Oct. 6 at 9:00pm, my daughter and I were traveling west  on Highway 40 over Rabbit Ears Pass on my way home to Steamboat Springs area from Denver.  I had just rounded a corner into a straight-away near Buffalo Park Trail Road (there is a small dirt parking lot there that was empty) when I noticed two white lights straight ahead in the distance that I initially thought were Venus and another dimmer star to the lower left.  All of a sudden the lower white light began to descend and disappeared behind a stand of tall pine trees.  It had an erratic path of descent and seemed to wave back and forth rather than just fall straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the smaller white light disappeared, I saw the larger light that I thought was Venus begin to grow as it approached rather quickly.  At this point I told my daughter to look up and she immediately saw the object as it sped towards us.  The growing round white light developed a red border that transitioned in to a solid red red light.  As the object approached, I noticed that there was also a blinking light behind it but am not sure if this blinking light was white or red.  A very short bright green line had also appeared just below and to the immediate left of the solid red light.  The object then slowed and swerved to the right (north) towards our truck.  When the object was positioned just to the left in front of us, it dropped in elevation and began to slowly pass overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object slowly moved above us, we could see that the short green line was actually a long flat bright rectangular strip. From the new overhead perspective, this strip extended just a bit in front of the solid red light and stretched quite a bit behind it.  My daughter and I both remarked about how crisp and clear the green box angles were and how there was no glow given how bright the green light was.  I have previously worked with low powered lasers (&amp;lt;100mW), and would say the green color was exactly at 532nm.  There seemed to be some glow from the red light and flashing light in the rear, but we were unable to see any reflections on a craft body or wing/propeller parts--all we could see were the lights.  Not sure if there was a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I was unsure of the object&#39;s size.  As the object was flying towards us, I thought it might be something small like a drone or RC airplane/helicopter because it arrived so fast and its flight path had such quick but smooth directional changes.  However, once it was above us, the object slowed considerably--almost to a hover, and we were able to see it clearly before passing underneath.  I was traveling between 70-65 mph, so anything small should have zipped right over us.  Once the object passed out of view above our windshield, we were unable to see it again out the back window or rearview mirrors.  My daughter did not want to stop and get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know what your group might think this was, because I have never seen a solid object emit such a bright green light<n>

The sun had just crept behind the mountain 20-30 min. prior.  There were no other stars in the sky, it wasnt quite dark enough yet. then there it is, this huge glowing &#34;star?&#34;.  But no it cant be because it is moving!!! it seemed as if it was hovering, moving slightly from side to side.  I ran inside and got my friend to make sure i was actually seeing this! (she saw it too) after another 1-2 min. it slowly sank out of site on the other side of the mountain.  Planes are not that bright, and they dont move like that. plus they have red and blue blinky lights.  This this was alll bright light.  I swear if it turned a certain way it looked almost like a perfect star, the kind you draw.<n>

Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed two different UFO’s on two consecutive days in Katy, Texas. The first was on Sunday, October 6, 2013, at 7:45 P.M. then again on Monday, October 07, 2013, in the same part of the sky.  The first one I saw was oval shaped and nearly blended in with the sky behind it.  The sky at that time was a deep blue color and not completely night.  The object that I observed was slightly lighter than the sky.  It was a blue, grayish color.  It did not have wings or lights of any kind. It moved from North to South.  The object caught my eye after I looked up at an airplane moving from East to West.  The object crossed paths with the airplane at least a football field below it.  The object I observed did not make any sound.  I could not hear the airplane either.  I lost sight of the oval shaped object as it flew further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Monday, October 07, 2013 I observed a second UFO.  It was around the same time of day as the first sighting.  I had just stepped out to walk the dogs, when I looked in the same general direction as the previous object and saw a light flash on and then off.  It did not occur to me that it was a light in the sky flashing on and off until I saw it flash on and off again.  I thought it was a star at first because of the white color.  It sat in the sky right below a star for about 10 seconds.  Then the object moved from East to West at a fast pace.  It was faster than an airplane moves across the sky. It would slowly flash on and off as it moved.  It looked as if it were pulsing on and off slowly.  I lost sight of it as it flew further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t see anything other than that. I guess it could have been a plane on both occasions, but it didn’t look like any aircraft I have seen in person or on TV. There was no sound and the second one was stationary in the sky for about 10 seconds.  I do believe there could be Aliens out there, and I know the Air Force has some pretty cool Top Secret stuff as well.  I just wish I could have flown myself up there and looked at whatever it was close up.  Both objects were the size of your thumbnail if you held it out towards the sky.  As far a size goes, I don’t know any other way to explain it other than the first object looked about the size of a pellet if you held it out to the sky with an extended hand.  The second object just looked like a light.  I could not see shape to it.<n>

Again I was at my home but in my back yard being curious from the last time I spotted the 2 UFO&#39;s I now have a habit of looking into the sky during the day time to see if there are anymore. At 5:35 pm I spotted an oval metallic object floating very high and very still in the North-West direction in the sky I would say in the direction of El Sereno area.  I couldn&#39;t believe how perfectly still this object was. This object was different from the last sighting this object was metallic in nature. I ran and grabbed my camera hoping it would still be there and snapped a few shots as best I could.   Then I seen a 2nd object fly slowly just below and past the 1st object heading North-East.  This object was round and appeared to be like one glowing red light.  It was traveling East very slowly I tried to keep an eye on both objects looking back at the metallic oval object which was still hovering in the same position.  I snapped a few photos of the glowing red light object then watched it fly slowly and then lost sighting of it after 10 minutes.  When I looked back to look for the metallic oval object it was gone.  A few minutes later a jet flew by from the south direction going north I would say it was almost as high as the two unidentified objects.  I snapped a photo of the jet so I can make comparisons of how high the jet was to the unidentified objects.  The metallic oval object stood hovering for 15 minutes and the glowing red light object slowly for about 10 minutes.<n>

The biplane was making an unusual sound that wasn&#39;t familiar to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching that biplane, to the right I noticed a very bright silver metallic craft.  My co-worker said what is that?  I replied, I had no idea.  It was moving in a circular motion towards the clouds.  It had some sort of wings/blades on the craft, but I never have seen anything so bright or shiny silver in the sky, and I never saw anything move that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then moved off into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My co-worker and I work with mentally handicapped people, and we have no experience with aircraft.  We were just looking at the sky.  There was no sound from the craft.<n>

I saw what appeared to me to be two rather large model aircraft (I say model, as they had a wingspan of maybe 10’±).  The lead aircraft was flying along the west shoreline, with the second behind and to the left.  Both were dark-colored, had no floats/pontoons attached, but were flying an estimated 20’ off the water.  High-wing configuration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They disappeared around a change in the shoreline, and by the time I turned the car around to stay in sight of them, they had left my ability to see them further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time, about 3:20pm, Sunday, October 6.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked with the Orcas Radio-Control Aircraft Society, and none of them were aware of anyone flying overwater that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first report to this website.  Generally, I have good estimation abilities on this sort of thing; I’ve been the airport manager for the Orcas Island Airport for 10+ years and have seen a lot of aircraft in all attitudes and altitudes, and this one is a mystery to me.<n>

It appeared to the northeast of our position in the Aptos hills of Santa Cruz County and we would estimate it was perhaps 3 to 7 miles away at approximately 30 degrees over the hill beyond our home.  It appeared to be positioned in the area over the San Andreas Fault.  When viewed through binoculars it was producing a changing multi-colored light array on what appeared to be the bottom of the object.  My wife could make out a dome or disc shape above the light array.  I thought I could also.  The array stayed essentially horizontal most of the time. At one point my wife said a ray of light come out of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to rock slightly from side to side and at one time seemed to be completely sideways with the light array going into a vertical position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening was dark except for the stars and some ambient light from San Jose, Watsonville and Monterey.  No moon was in evidence.  During the hour that we checked in on the object it remained in the same approximate position except for its slight wavering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stars continued their upward movement during that time.  In particular I noted the Pleiades rising about 20 degrees to the right of the object while it remained essentially in the same location.  If the cloud cover doesn’t interfere, we will be checking again tonight to see if it returns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Capella, but the witness insists it was not Capella.

We were busy looking at the Andromeda Galaxy at the moment.  The night was getting cold and one member of the group asked if I had a spare jacket.  So she and I started back towards my car to grab it.  We were about 100 feet from the observing sight when the rest of the group started calling &amp; shouting out for us to look up!!  There it was, at about 9:20pm pacific time around 30 degrees up in the southwestern sky; a deep orange glowing/pulsating light.  At first I thought it was a meteor burning up but then it changed directions! We ran back to the observing sight all the while this object was zig-zagging in the sky.  I loosened the grips of the telescope and tried to view the object more closely.  I managed to see it in the finder scope.  I couldn’t tell the shape of the actual “ship” but there was a dark spot surrounded by a deep orange light and it was indeed moving around left, right, up &amp; down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had chills running though my body!  The rest of the group was equally stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total time it was there was probably close to 2 minutes before it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very creepy!  It certainly is the strangest thing I have seen in the night sky in all my stargazing!<n>
10/5/13 21:15|Rexburg|ID|Formation|3 seconds|My daughter and I saw 5-7 white lights in a shifting formation travel quickly across the Idaho night sky in a southwesterly direction.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102994.html|668|ndxe201310| My daughter and I saw 5-7 white lights in a shifting formation travel quickly across the Idaho night sky in a southwesterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 9-year-old daughter and I went for a quick evening stroll, leaving the home we own a little after 9:00 pm Mountain Time.  It was dark, except for artificial lights and stars—we never noticed the moon.  We walked due south, up a street that climbs a hill, and discussed balance in life.  We looked at the stars as we walked, pointing out the big and little dippers and the North Star.  We soon headed back down the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one third of the way home, I noticed that the stars of the big dipper were brighter—there was not as much light pollution.  So, we stopped at around 9:15. I pointed out the dippers again.  The handle of the big dipper was visible through some power lines.  The stars of the little dipper were all visible now.  The north star was directly in front of us over the sidewalk we were on, since Harvard runs north to south.  We estimate that we were about 100 feet northeast from an 18-plex apartment complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we gazed into the sky towards the big dipper, my daughter suddenly asked, “What is that?”  I didn’t even have to look down at her to see where she was pointing, because something moving in the sky caught my eye.  It was higher in the sky than the dippers.  It was about 75 degrees above the horizon in a west-north-west direction from us.  I almost said, “It’s a satellite,” but before I could say that, I noticed there were many (5 to 7) of these objects clustered in what appeared to be a tight v-shaped formation that probably could have barely fit behind a quarter held at arm’s length, and they were moving much faster than a satellite.  Within, I think, about two to three seconds, maybe even less than two, they had moved quickly across the sky to a point about 40 degrees above the horizon and approximately west-south-west from where we were standing.  If I extend one arm completely and point to the approximate starting place, and extend my other arm and point to the approximate vanishing place, the tips of my pointing fingers are approximately 22-23 inches apart, and they are approximately 30 inches from my eyes.  I stand 5’8”.  The objects traveled much faster than an airplane in a southwest direction, parallel to the Milky Way, which we could dimly make out directly overhead, running from the southwest to the northwest.  The objects felt close and far away at the same time, but they made no noise, despite their incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were all white, and they changed position relative to each other, but I could not describe exactly how.  They started in a v shape, but one light from the back of the formation flew towards the front of it, and they may have even straightened out into a straight line by the time they disappeared from view.  I cannot honestly remember what formation they had when I last saw them, but I know they started v-shaped, and they changed formation.  There was no other color but white.  There was no flashing; the six round objects were each a solid, if fuzzy, white light.  They were dim, not as brilliant as the stars in the sky, but they were much larger—probably ten times the size of the brightest star we could see (at about 80 degrees in the western sky). I am not sure how they vanished, but as quickly as I realized I was seeing them, they were gone again.  They may have disappeared into the light pollution coming from the apartment complex, because they were not very bright, they may have vanished behind the complex, they may have gone beyond the horizon, or they may have simply vanished.  We later identified several jet airplanes flying high in the sky, and these unidentified objects were much larger, much less brilliant, much whiter—with a very uniform whiteness—much faster, and, we felt, much closer than the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about the same moment the objects were vanishing from view, I finally answered my daughter’s question. “I think that’s a UFO!” I said.  Just two nights earlier, I had been reading to my children about UFOs. We read the “Mysteries of the Sky” chapter from Mysteries and Fantasies, a children’s encyclopedia volume by World Book, published in 1986.  The balanced discussion of UFOs that we read convinced me that unidentified objects exist, but that most things people see are probably explainable—like meteors, ball lightning, weather balloons, airplanes, spotlights, etc.  I was amazed at the sheer number of people claiming to see unidentified things, and I marveled that these were intelligent, educated people.  Although I do not personally believe in monstrous aliens traveling between worlds to destroy us (if they are out there and intelligent enough to travel undetected, they are probably less violent than we are), I do believe in the spiritual and supernatural, and I wondered if ! I would ever get to see anything like the UFOs we read about.  However, as we stargazed tonight, I was not thinking about UFOs until after we saw what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the National UFO Reporting Center about 2 minutes after returning home, at about 9:24 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I teach accounting at a university.  I am an entrepreneur and a CPA with a Masters degree in taxation.  My 9-year-old daughter (in 4th grade) reads about two novels a week and loves to write.  She dictated her own version of the story to me (only because I can type faster). I did not have her read my version first.  Her version is completely independent of my version.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Daughter’s Version:  We were taking a late-night stroll.  We looked up into the sky and looked at all the constellations.  We saw the W-shape of Cassiopeia and the little dipper and the big dipper.  We were heading back home, and we were getting close when Dad said, “Oh, we have a more clear view of the big dipper right here; the lights aren’t as bright.” We were looking out at it, and then we started looking for the other constellations to see if they were brighter.  We saw the little dipper, and as we were looking at it, these big circle lights came on right in the middle of the Milky Way.  They were kind of in a v-formation, like wild geese fly in migration.  They were flying along in that v-shape, and then they shifted.  They kind of went into a circle, and then the circle straightened out into a two-inch long line.  They started flying out of our sight behind the corner of the 18-plex. When I first saw them, I thought they were just a really low plane.  It wasn’t really a sharp V.  The corner was sha! rp, but it was kind of close to a straight line; it wasn’t really acute, it was kind of oblique.  I thought it was just a wide-winged plane.  But then I remembered what planes look like in the sky; they just look light little flashing lights that are tiny, with green and red and white, like Christmas colors.  And, it’s like, what the heck?  That’s a weird plane.  And it went flying over and started shifting, and that was weird.  Like I said, it shifted into an O and then a straight line.  And they were kind of bright, but they weren’t as shining as the stars.  They were big, and the stars are small.  The stars have kind of a sharp circle in the middle and the rest of it is just a shine.  Well, these things were a lot bigger than the stars, and they kind of didn’t just break out into shine like stars do, they were kind of just made out of one shine; kind of they were more shiny in the middle than on the sides.  They kind of just appeared right out of the little dipper, and then they st! arted soaring across the sky southwest, and they just disappea! red near the corner of the 18-plex.  They looked near at first, like a really close plane.  But they also looked far; they weren’t as far away as a jet plane, and they weren’t as close as a streetlamp, and they weren’t that big, either.  They were kind of the size of the head of an average nail.  They didn’t make any noise at all.  They just soared across the sky and shifted shapes.  And they never twinkled or blinked like stars do.  They were big and constant, except that they were moving around, and they had just appeared in the sky, and they disappeared in the sky.  I couldn’t tell if they were near, or if they were far.  All I was hearing was the rustling of the leaves and some people talking in the distance.<n>

No sound. Most moved at the same speed, but a few sped-up considerably and moved to another spot un the formation, then slowed to the same speed as the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shot a video with my iPhone, posted it to Youtube and Facebook.

They flew in the same direction at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They made no sound and had no other signs of being some sort of an aircraft.<n>
10/5/13 21:00|Spokane|WA|Sphere|5 minutes|Multiple orange orbs over downtown Spokane.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102993.html|671|ndxe201310| Multiple orange orbs over downtown Spokane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving south through downtown Spokane- passing Spokane Club on the right.  I looked out of the drivers window while stopped at traffic light.  I noticed a steady orange light between the tree branches to my left.  The light was some distance above the trees, at about a 60 degree angle relative to my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed out the object to my wife and opened the moon roof of the car so she could see.  My son in the back seat just behind me also saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I noticed two other bright orange objects but lower and seemed to be following the first object spotted yet the tree were in a line from west to east.  The traffic light had changed so I needed to move and briefly thought they might have been military aircraft.  These lights did not make a sound I could hear, were not common aircraft light colors, and did not strobe so I dismissed that idea.  The lights were moving east-to-west against the prevailing winds which would exclude luminaria.  I thought the lights were very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceeded south to the freeway onramp since we were headed home to the east in Spokane Valley.  I told my wife and son the keep an eye out for the objects we had just seen since I had to drive.  The highway is elevated above the city so we had a better view above the buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced several times over my shoulder to the left toward the objects.  I was able to get a good estimate of the altitude.  There were three objects I could clearly make out, but possibly four or five, since I was driving I was only able to focus on the first three objects.  Object furthest to the west (which I believe was the first object) was at about 1250 feet, the second two were at about 450 feet (above ground level).  They were about evenly spaced about 500 feet apart horizontally.  From I-90 the first object was roughly over Masonic Temple with the last object being over River Park Square.  I could clearly triangulate from the first sighting, the freeway sightings, and using size of the buildings in downtown Spokane for a reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting home I dropped off my wife, son and car at the house, this was about 2110.  I got in my truck and headed back downtown to investigate the objects, while driving to roof of parking garage at Sacred Heart Medical Center there was a brief flash of light in the pickup,  I think this was a mercury vapor streetlamp flashing or a surge to the truck cab lamp so not concerned.  Only stopped briefly to observe on the top level of west parking garage at SHMC.  No objects visible over Spokane at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Returned home at 2130.<n>

Over 10 Witnesses on the scene<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a ((job description deleted)) at the ((deletd)) here in Spokane, Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night upon entering our ((deleted--work area)) on my 1st round at 8:45 pm; immediately I could see a number of highly luminous glowing orange spherical objects (orb like) through the trees as I looked west over the roof of our ((deleted)) toward the Convention Center of the Downtown area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having witnessed 3 of these objects 4 months ago and since having heard the sweeping reports from all over the country, I knew this was going to be a big event that I wanted as many people as possible to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I immediately ran into our ((deleted--area))  and summoned as many interested witnesses as I could by asking everyone if they wanted to witness some UFO’s.  First thing; I had our ((deleted)) attendant accompany me as he along with many of his neighbors had personally witnessed over thirty of these same objects traveling through a couple weeks before I had over 4 months ago.  When we and the some 10 to 12 guests arrived on the scene, we were all amazed and perplexed at the show the near dozen of these firey orange objects were putting on as they floated around drifting upward and slowly gliding around from north to south with their distinctive luminous orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I was trying to acquire as many witnesses as possible, I was unable to closely examine the movements and activity of the objects for very long.  However, from what I did witness, they appeared and acted exactly the same as those I had witnessed some months back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 7 minutes had passed, and I was scrambling to get more witnesses to observe the phenomena and get it recorded, suddenly all but a few ((deleted)) came back in side and said they all just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then worked my way back out and there remained one mother and her daughter who showed me the one orange ufo remaining.  They told me that after all the ufos vanished and everyone left, this one object suddenly lit up and remained as it was hovering with its’ distinct orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched on for a few minutes as this object stayed hovering only to lose its luminosity and vanish in thin air like the others…<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mother then showed me the multiple pictures she took with her smart phone and I gave her my email address and she got my name and insisted that her and her daughter would email me the pictures as well as a detailed account of what they witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I write this report, I am still waiting and hoping she delivers on her words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was an extraordinary event witnessed by over 10 people who were all mesmerized by the show these objects put on.  In fact a couple ((deleted)) came to me afterwards and thanked me very much for alerting them so they could witness the extraordinary phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In hindsight, however it was very disconcerting to me that 2 of the teenagers who caught the whole incident on video went right back into the ((deleted)) showed just a few people and then went right back to watching a football game like nothing even happened.  When I asked them if they could put the footage on youtube they just kind of blew me off like they didn’t care.  I wish I had given them some money in exchange for the footage as it was the type of ufo event that many people hope to see their lifetime…<n>

It was bigger &amp; brighter than a star, planet, or satelite.  It disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately noticed another white bright light to the south of the first light, however this one stayed stationary for some time.  We continued watching it until it lowered slowly, and was then behind Tillamook Head and out of our view.  I live about 2 mi from the beach at about 600ft and have seen lights in the same location a number of times.<n>

It had been an overcast and rainy and stars were not visible.  We were East bound going into town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought the lights were radio towers that I had never noticed before and I asked my passenger about them.  At the same time she had noticed them as well and then we noticed the lights were moving.  From a distance they were three times the height of a radio tower and about 2.5 football fields in length from the first light to the last light.  They were all moving at a very slow speed and the spacing between the lights never changed.  This leads me to believe they were all part of one object (huge) or they were able to stay in sync perfectly.  We pulled over to observe them and watched as the lights slowly dissipated one by one.  The whole event lasted about one minute from the time we noticed them coming up on a very busy intersection of Hwy 60 and the Seymour exit by Casey&#39;s Gas Station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were no navigational beacons blinking.  It was moving too slow, suddenly another appeared, then another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually there were 12 of them, all in close proximity at different altitudes and appeared to be stationary. Then they moved around again and started moving due North toward North Korea.  Nothing flies North here, and we were North of Seoul, not in any flight patterns for approaching or departing aircraft, so I was very puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then stopped again and half of them disappeared.  6 of them remained stationary for 6 minutes, not moving then shot off north very fast and disappeared.<n>

No other signs that they may be aircraft or satellites.  There were other standard aircraft in the area - likely commercial flights so it was easy to tell the difference of these lights.  Just big bright white lights.  No glowing.  They simply moved off at a consistent speed (not too fast, but steady) in parallel until out of sight.  At first I thought they were part of a constellation - that&#39;s how much like a bright star they appeared.

It was travelling in the same direction as my truck, but much faster.  It immediately appeared to be something unusual as it was an orange flickering orb, flying at about the speed of a small plane, and probably a little lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to get a better look, while not causing an accident, and finally had to pull into a small parking lot as I was now sure that this was not a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After stopping, I got out of my truck and noticed there was another one behind the first.  I watched them going by for a few seconds before getting out my cell phone and taking a video.  Just as I started the video, the second one turned 90 degrees and headed east (it can be seen in the video doing this).  There was no sound whatsoever emanating from them. Only road noise is heard in the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking to my left (North), I suddenly noticed that there was another one, then immediately after, three more behind the first three, in a straight line formation, all heading south except the one that broke off to the East.  The line appeared to stretch almost to the horizon.  As the line progressed south, another one headed east from the same spot that the first did.  I am not sure, but I think it was the 4th in line.  Seeing how far the line went, I kept wondering how many more would show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I was trying to watch and describe what I was seeing on the video at the same time, I lost count.  The total was 6 or 7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it was impossible to see any real shape to them because I couldn&#39;t see any defined edges.  It was almost as though it was &#34;approximately round&#34;, with the edges constantly fluxuating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because they were orange, and flickering, I thought that they could be Chinese Lanterns, however they were travelling at a fairly high rate of speed, and when I got home I immediately checked the current wind speed on the Internet, which happened to be zero.  I took a screen shot of this, however it doesn’t show the date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have the video which is 2:42 and 291 MB, MP4 format.<n>

I stepped out to get a smoke, and coming out of the west was a white cylinder shaped object rotating or spinning as it passed headed due east.  As in other sightings like these, the object seemed to be in two sections, the forward section being smaller than the back one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a narrow black band in the middle and wasn&#39;t that high up. Maybe 6 or 7 hundred feet.  There was no sound and no contrail.  The object clearly had no wings or tail as it was easily seen.  The object also moved in a way that planes just don&#39;t.  It was very smooth flying and seemed to be on an invisible line being pulled along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve talked with three people that have seen the same objects and have encouraged them to make reports.  These cylinder shaped objects are becoming more prevalent and I&#39;m wondering if they could be some sort of drone.<n>

I was near Clark’s Fork Canyon in Clark, WY.  When I saw 4 con trails flying together above me then 2 more came up from behind them 6 total heading S.W..  I have a Canon Power Shot SX40 HS camera with 35 optical zoom  I figured military jets so I zoomed in and took a few photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I zoomed in I could not see any type of a plane.  When I got home I put them on my computer to clear up the images and again zoom and there is nothing there no object at all well at best maybe a shadow.  Okay maybe its just planes but I check out every strange thing I see flying around here and I can always see something in front of a contrail but not this time so I thought I would let someone know about it.  I have photos if you care to see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS.

I am a very big believer in UFO&#39;s because I have seen plenty of things in the sky I can&#39;t quite say what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well anyways on this particular night It&#39;s hot inside so we step outside for a minute. We sit down on the front porch, and just look up at the sky.  Well about 3 minutes after we sit down a strange noise appears.  It sounded like something hovering over the treeline in front of us.  We couldn&#39;t see anything though so we thought it may have been a helicopter.  Well seconds later another REALLY strange noise appears.  In the field in front of us it sounds like a laser beam off of a tv sci-fi show, and the neighbors dogs were barking constantly..  Then we hear something sound like it&#39;s running across the field.. as well as a big thud like something hit the dog house.  I still can&#39;t figure out to this day what it was.  The next day her brother said he woke up because of his dog barking! at 4 a.m. and when he walked outside he heard that hovering noise as well.<n>

In short, given the height and speed, it did not seem like an &#34;average&#34; phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was a light overcast of clouds in the sky.  Suddenly I looked up and witnessed three bright lights.  They were about the size of a standard room, and had mass.  They seemed to be just above the clouds.  My friends and I watched with amazement and fear as they circled each other, in sort of sporadic movements.  It was almost as if they were giving us a show.  Then two of proceeded to attach to one another, it was almost as if there was a pole connecting them.  They then pivoted around and around, and then detached.  They then kept &#34;dancing&#34;. Then they all flew off at high speed into the distance, and them flew toward us, almost above is.  They did that about three times.  This went on for almost ten minutes, and as mysteriously as they appeared, they vanished.  Government aircraft?  Or visitors from another planet...<n>

10/4/13 23:15|Gresham|OR|Fireball|20 minutes|My wife and I witnessed 16 - 20 orange orb-shaped objects that passed over us either solo or sets of two!|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103017.html|697|ndxe201310| My wife and I witnessed 16 - 20 orange orb-shaped objects that passed over us either solo or sets of two!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is a TRUE account based on an unusual phenomenon that was seen by myself and my wife!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On October 4th 2013 at 11:15PM in Gresham, Oregon, my wife and I witnessed something that we have never seen before… something that is not of this world as we know it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing a movie at our local theater, we headed back toward home on 242nd Avenue in Gresham, Oregon.  As we slowed down to stop at an intersection by Grace Community Church, my wife saw something frightening in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is our personal account:  K - “I looked up as we approached the stop sign to see an orange object in the sky that appeared to have a flame or light flickering underneath it.  My mind tried to make it a plane…but I couldn’t.  I said to my husband ‘What is that!’  And again, I repeated louder, ‘What is that that I’m looking at?’  I kept repeating it over and over until my husband pulled over to take a look. I said to my husband, ‘shouldn’t we be calling somebody?  This is scary!’  I thought, ‘I‘II call my Mom and Dad because it was about 11:15PM and I  knew they would be watching the news.  Surely there would be something about this!  But, No… they knew nothing about it and nothing was said about it on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after I talked to my mother, I looked over through the passenger window and noticed an airplane descending toward the airport in the distance.  These orbs were higher and yet not much smaller than the plane.   I was scared and knew that this wasn’t good…MORE were coming!” “The first sighting was just (1)…then two more came and they continued to come in either sets of two or one…completely silent, no wind, hovering above us and then they suddenly would vanish, one by one right before our eyes, as though they were never there!”  M – “When my wife began to frantically ask me “What is that?  I looked up only to see (3) orange objects in the sky.  They were flying southbound and so we began to follow them until I could pull over and get out of the car to view them.  When I got out of the car I thought that maybe they were Chinese Lanterns but then quickly realized that they were much larger and they seemed to be moving in a very definite and defined manner.  I asked my wife if we had our good phone in order to take a picture but she told me we only had our old phone. So, I was not able to document this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although these objects appeared to be “aflame” they had a defined orb-like shape and they didn’t make a sound.  It was hard to gain perspective of exactly how big and how high they were but it appeared that they were going about 30 miles an hour as they were hovering above us… and what’s more, they kept coming!  It didn’t stop at three!  By the time the last one passed above us we estimate that we witnessed 16 to 20 of these unidentified flying objects.  And then, one by one, they disappeared as if the lights went out on these objects and then the night sky went back to its normal celestial condition…Moon, Stars and the glow of city lights!”  This experience left my wife frightened and me (the skeptic) wondering what this could have been?  We spent the following two days trying to come to grips with what we witnessed.  Something that we’ve only seen in Sci-Fi movies was now a reality…a reality we will live with the rest of our lives!  With that said, my wife and I are intelligent and respected people who wonder why we were there to witness this phenomenon?  But as we have learned to trust God in ALL things, we know that He will show us the truth of what we experienced!<n>

I could only see one when he called me. I was on our deck; he was outside the house.  The objects were near the big deeper, north from our house in North Magnolia (Our house has a deck with views of an inlet to the Locks on the east and Puget Sound on the North.  The sighting was towards the north, towards Puget Sound.  When ((male name deleted)) started seeing the objects, they were almost still, they just moved a little towards the east.  They were flickering and then the lights turned off and then they reappeared.  I saw one very bright orange red object sparkling with rays, but it seemed to me it looked like an almost triangular shape.  I saw it more towards the east of the big deeper, first flashing behind a huge pine tree, then it moved west and I could see the object better.  Then I saw it moving east; same as ((male name deleted)), it was flickering and it would turn the lights off and then reappeared.  It was interesting to see similar reports in your site after we saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take care, ((female name deleted))<n>

At the Time I was walking to my house to the car I seen the GIANT light coming from the South SouthWest Sky heading rapidly fast towards the North Northeast.  This was taking place so fast and only lasted around 30-45 seconds before fainting North Northeast,  However I did manage to snap a quick photo of the giant ball of fire.  The light was brighter then a Stop Sign color Red.  Very Large and, Very Bright!, I started to think about the size was about the size of a forth of the Moon, but in other terms I compared it to a airplane flying 30,000 miles above land,  An airplane to me in the sky way up there looks small, if this however was a meteor it probably was way farther up and to still be that Large in Size tells you just how large t! his object was in Size.

She was with her friend and friends family a few miles north from our location.  Our address is Amsterdam Pl, Madison, AL.  Number of witnesses at the other location were around 4.  They witnessed approx. 30 lights in the sky.  The location of the UFOs were North to North West of our location.  The angle of the objects were moving right to left from the horizon (north to north west in straight movement upward).  No erratic movement was witnessed.  The lights were red to orange and in a circular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights finally moved, what appeared to be out of the atmosphere.  At the same time of the sighting a plane was coming in to land at Huntsville Intl airport, from the North.  The airport is situated to the south of our location.

It was a clear, cloudless, starry night perfect for observing the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out front to the driveway which is facing south, and began looking at the stars when my husband noticed a small bluish-white star-like light moving slowly and noiselessly SE.  He alerted me to it and my mind automatically thought “it’s a plane,” but also that it was strange that it was flying so low, close to the dark outline of treetops behind the neighbor’s field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved behind a tall tree and we couldn’t see it anymore, so we moved a small distance west up the street to try and see it but still was not able, so we walked east back down the street.  It slowly came out to a clearing to the west of the tall tree making short, jumpy movements, like stop, go, stop, go, heading towards another outline of clustered trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It, still moving west, went behind those trees where we could not see, so again, we moved west trying to follow and a few seconds later, it flashed a bluish-white light through the trees at us and started moving back eastward past the trees and over the clearing (by this time we were running back east to follow it) toward the tall tree again, still making short, jumpy movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went behind the tall tree again (we are now facing the tall tree) and that’s when I saw it flash its bluish-white light even brighter (almost flashlight-like) right through the tree at us!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved east of the tree slowly, staying really low to the treetops of the line of trees next to it.  It stopped suddenly and hovered for a few seconds right over the treetops.  Then, all of a sudden I see it drop straight downward below the treetops where I could not see.  It disappeared for what seemed like a few minuets but every once in a while, I could see the bluish-white light peeking up around and through the treetops almost as if it was trying to play “peek-a-boo” with my husband and I, moving left a! nd right , up to the treetops and back down again, in a slow fashion.  As it was doing this, I also noticed a small red light on the object’s left/east side that would sporadically blink, not in any fashion similar to our commercial aircraft.  It then rose straight up over the treetops and began to change shape and colors changing from its original bluish-white light to blue to red and back to bluish-white light, its little left/east side red light flashing, it moved up, down, east, west in such unpredictable movements, going back westward toward the tall tree.  It went behind the tall tree still changing color and shape and came out to the west of it into the clearing, and right next to the west of the tree made a diamond-like shape pattern going east, down, west, up, and back to its eastern starting point slowly turning into a big yellow-golden glowing triangular shaped star-like light object that slowly moved into the middle of the clearing growing bigger and brighter, hovering there right in front of us.  While hovering, we got to better observe the object.  Overall, it had a yellow-gold light.  The shape of the object was triangular (point up) with a glowing golden light in the center.  There were three golden triangular shaped lights shining from the two sides and bottom of the object.  On the left/east side of the object, right underneath the glowing light, was the erratically flashing red light I saw from earlier. But its shape and size changed also.  This time I saw that it had a big red light and right underneath that light was a smaller red light.  Hovering there in the clearing, it glowed big and bright and constantly flashed its red lights at us.  We were directly in front of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hovering in the clearing for what seemed like minutes upon minuets, the object slightly turned facing its red lights right at us, and started moving westward again at a leisurely pace toward a large tree that it disappeared behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I ran westward back up! the street to see if we could see it again, but it was gone.  It was 1 0:05pm (22:05) when the object left, making the duration of our experience around 15 minuets total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time my husband and I were exclaiming things like “Whoa!?!”, “What?!?”, “Wow!?!”, “Oh my gosh!?!” when it was star-like and making unpredictable movements and changing colors and speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it changed its shape and color to a triangular golden light object we still were exclaiming as described above, but then I heard my husband say (almost in a trance-like but still fully aware state) “It’s so beautiful!” to which I responded in a similar fashion “It’s angelic”.  But when I heard my husband say that and after I responded to him, a feeling of emptiness and despair came over me.  I felt like the object was something malicious trying to trick our minds.  My husband seemed to experience a bodily reaction at the time of the sighting.  He started shaking and breathing heavily and exclaiming.  I was in such bewilderment and shock at what I was seeing (trying to keep myself together), but it was most definitely like NOTHING I have EVER seen in the sky before and it was UNMISTAKABLY, UNDOUBTEDLY, something that is not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be unusuall eloquent, sincere, and sober-minded.

10/4/13 21:50|Salem|OR|Triangle|15 minutes|Brilliant star-like object hovers above trees and shines bright lights before changing into golden triangle.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103107.html|707|ndxe201310| Brilliant star-like object hovers above trees and shines bright lights before changing into golden triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of October 4, 2013 around 9:50pm, my wife and I decided to go look at the stars. We were in front of my parents house in Salem, Oregon facing south.  The sky was very clear that night and, after a minute or two I spotted something that at first I thought might have been a far off plane.  It came out from behind a group of trees that was SW of us flying at a very low altitude (the object was parallel with the tops of the trees), and heading East at a very slow pace.  I was confused because it was low flying, slow and noiseless, so I alerted my wife to it and she immediately noticed it also.  We were observing what appeared to be a small bluish-white light with the occasional blink of red light that seemed to be too off tempo to be a planes.  After a minute or so, it finally went behind a larger tree that is taller than the others around it.  Interestingly, I noticed that before it reached the tree it changed direction  going slightly up.  Then, as it wa! s behind the tree, it changed course completely and was now going West with jumpy, erratic movements.  Almost like it was caught on a fishing line and was getting reeled in, at first fast then slow, then almost motionless all the while with an occasional blink of red. This startled me and I exclaimed out loud to my wife and myself.  Ending up behind the same group of trees that I originally first saw it fly out of, it then changed course again coming back out of the trees going east.  At that moment, it was Very bright and shone through the trees whitish light.  Coming into the clearing, it was clearly visible with a star-like shining white-blue light that was glinting off of a dark shape.  The light was brightest on the right side and on the left is where the red blinking light was located.  Finally, with the same unpredictable skip-like movements, it flew behind the tall tree and at that time shone a very bright white light right through the tree at us that illuminated the area.  This made us booth exclaim aloud and as we watched it, it smoothly came out of the other side of the tree, hovering east parallel to the smaller treetops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly moved east then seemed to stop and descend behind the trees where we lost sight of it for a minute. We knew it was there and shortly later we caught sight of it moving just below the tree tops, kind of going up and down. It was like it was playing hide and seek with us and it made awkward movements right above the trees, going side to side and up and down. Ascending slowly into the sky, it made all sorts of movements, going in all directions. At this time it was clearly visible and I tried desperately to make out what it looked like. It was like a blue-white arrowhead shaped light that was very radiant and star-like. The light it produce seemed to be bouncing off of its own shape on all sides, especially on the right which was clearly arch-like, and the bottom. Now it started slowly moving west, growing in brightness and gaining a clearly defined central triangular light. Going b! ehind the tall tree, it moved in an unexplainable pattern and then slowed dramatically. At this point, I was very shaken up and when I saw it moving around I was like a frightened animal shaking in fear. It was just beyond the tall tree and what amazed me is that it changed from the white light I was seeing to an incredible golden radiance. It stood almost motionless and seemed to be growing much more radiant than before. The shape looked exactly like an angel. Continually moving west, it seemed to turn slightly and stop. That is when we saw something extraordinary. It now had a translucent golden arrow-head shape encompassing the central light and two constant red lights on its left side, one atop the other. The central light was brilliant golden with the same arrowhead shape and light coming from all sides. Then moving west at a quicker pace, I noticed that the central light could have been three lights grouping together in a triad formation right before it disappeared be! hind a large group of trees and we lost sight of it for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object the entire time it was in view, never taking my eyes from it. In the beginning of the encounter, I had thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me but as I continued to watch, I knew my eyes were fine and I was witnessing something incredible. I was amazed and astounded at what I had seen and exclaimed a lot during the event. Its magnificent star-like radiance left me awestruck. By the time it was leaving, it was large, bright and obvious in the sky, and the golden triangle that surrounded it was very clearly defined. The way this object moved is absolutely unexplainable and confirmed to me that it was definitely not one of our typical aircraft. The event lasted about 15 minutes.<n>

The three lights quickly and seamlessly made a straight line.  I estimated these lights were roughly a mile to a mile and a half away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly followed these lights as best we could.  it seemed they were sped up and slowed down at random.  While stopped watching we heard and saw a helicopter behind us going in towards them.  But the lights were different colored and being military i know the shape and out line of helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as we followed one of these lights we managed to get under one.  I would say it was maybe 600 feet overheard with absolutely no noise except other cars moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to get a solid look under neath the craft.  it was all light. and there was not shadowed body. its body was the light.  i squinted, and also used my hands to block the light but the light was the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we parked about 2 miles down the road after losing nine objects (that were a dark orange almost brownish color) in the middle of the dark sky.  Watched them change direction literately out of no where after about one min of searching because all of them disappeared.  I managed to only see 3 more.  They seemed to be at the same height, but seemed to kind of fade out behind some clouds.  We waited another 5 mins and everyone that faded out behind what looked like clouds..  And nothing appeared.<n>

They were flying from north to south.  They didn&#39;t make any noise and there were no trails behind them and they weren&#39;t blinking.

It is an advertisement for a dance club in Long island City Queens. They use a type of L.E.D. spotlight which illuminates the clouds causing an illusion that the light is coming from behind the clouds.  They also put off very little, if any beam.  L.E.D. lights have a very long range, so they can appear to be moving several miles very quickly.  These particular lights can be seen on most Friday and Saturday nights when it is cloudy.  They are visable anywhere from Brooklyn to almost the South Bronx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry!  I was quite perplexed myself at first.  I was a little Bummed when I found out.  They are weird though!<n>

Very Bright, Very close.  I am not exaggerating when I say that there was one in every direction that I was looking at.  Some were the white slowly blinking lights, others were tiny ones off in the distance moving at a rapid speed, and others were flashing red, purple, blue, and white lights, and moving slowly.  I’m talking 10, 20 UFO’s in the sky ALL AT ONCE. I kept thinking, at first, that they were planes, but it’s impossible that so many planes were in the sky all at once, and each plane having different light patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most intriguing ones were the red, purple, blue, and white lights because they were flashing horizontally and the lights were flashing one after the other, so it wasn’t just one big flash.  This was going on everywhere! Everywhere in the sky I then noticed what looked like military aircraft in the sky.  My theory is that if these were in fact alien aircraft the military were trying to divert them and basically “shoo” them away.  OR they were trying to disguise the UFO so that people wouldn’t panic.  This was surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t believe what I and so many people in the city of Manassas witnessed. The only reason I am afraid is because I feel that maybe if it was Alien aircraft they were trying to warn us or tell us something OR they were planning an attack.  Either or, Idk, these are just all the thoughts running through my head. I think telling others around would be a bad idea, because they panic so I’ve decided that I would not.  But reporting it here is best, in case someone is trying to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, one aircraft was right on top of the other. I think the one below was military aircraft that was trying to ‘shoo’ away the other UFO right above it.  I know it’s hard to believe, but I’m honestly having a hard time making sense of what happened a few hours ago.

Impressed by how vivid this fireball was, I shortly put it out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 20:00 I had stepped outside of my westside Albuquerque home to have a cigarette and load items into the car for a weekend trip to Canjilon, NM.  Catching motion out of the corner of my eye, I glanced at the western sky and observed numerous shimmering balls of light crossing rapidly from northwest to southeast.  I promptly ran inside and called for my fiancee to step out as well in order that she could verify what I was observing.  I also retrieved my 60 power spotting scope.  She stepped out with me and we watched in amazement as these objects continued to stream across the sky.  Using my spotting scope, I was able to track one of these objects and was surprised to discover that the scope did not magnify it nearly as much as I would have expected.  I take this to mean that the objects were further away than my initial estimate.  The object I observed with the scope was circular, and while it appeared a bluish white to the naked eye, it seemed to be like a disco ba! ll-shimmering in many different colors.  I put the scope down and continued to observe with the naked eye until all of them had passed.  There was little if any noise from these objects aside from a faint &#34;muttering&#34; rumble.  Their movement was erratic and uncoordinated, with some of them traveling faster, and taking wavering paths, but all generally to the southeast.    They traveled very quickly-seemingly three times as fast as I would expect an aircraft to move at the same distance.  They  passed in three groups, with the majority of the objects comprising the lead group-almost reminiscent of the way race cars move about on a track.  I considered taking photographs or video, but considering the apparent size of the objects, their velocity, and the state of darkness at that time of night, video would have been inconclusive and photographs would have been nearly impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

10/4/13 02:59|Lexington|SC|Triangle|7 minutes|Weird Unexplained events.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102932.html|727|ndxe201310| Weird Unexplained  events<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me start by saying that these events have accrued over a period of months; I’ll start from the beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days after May 31, the release of the movie “After Earth”.  My friend, His Mother, and I were heading back from a local movie theater when we traveled down a back road, we hadn’t been on the road too long before we noticed something catching our eye off to the right of the vehicle, passing the object we paid no mind till breaking in the middle of the lane and reversing  (Please note we were the only ones in the lane or on that certain road)  The driver of the vehicle put it in park before exiting the driver’s side (My friend) His mother and I watch from the passenger seat and the back.  What we saw all of three of describe as;  a bright blinding chrome orb that was sitting stilly at tree top level before moving slowly to the right further across the sky leaving a trail behind it before dissipating into the night.  We had no clue what we had just seen but we all agreed it was not a normal aircraft or an aircraft at all.  We decided to call the local police department to report what we had seen earlier in the evening before feuding to keep it a secret.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over a various of months we had seen the orbs multiple more times it began to scare both my friend and I to the point we didn’t know what to do;  It would do what the first night did. It would move lightly leave a trail and vanish,  Still the same blinding chrome orb, but the freakiness had just began.  My friend and his mother have always lived in the woods, now he’s seen the orbs out there more than twice, but with added affects.  He knows what the sounds of the forest should sound like and look like.  When he steps out of his home late at night he begins to experience strange sounds unlike any he has heard before and has seen figures described as Humanoid, but not quite so.  I on the other hand have not had the “pleasure” of meeting or hearing such creatures, but I have, like him, seen the orbs on multiple occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don’t personally know how to describe the next experience, but I’ll try to.  We don’t know whether to take this a ironic and unrelated dream, but my friend tents to stay with me in my home every now and again because I mostly live alone, one night whilst I was asleep,  He had said he woke up to the light from a street lamp we have in our front yard he moved my curtains to peer out into the yard seeing a sleek, slender, tall man standing motionlessly in the front yard by the lamp,  He said he closed the curtains before returning to peer again the creature closer than before,  He repeated the process till the creature was peering in back at him, he said he tried to wake me to no avail. Ironically he said it stared till day light which is when he “woke up”.  The creature’s facial features where described as boney thin very pale and solid black eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most recent and most creepy and most disturbing one Friday, October 4, 2013 at 3:30am my friend had went outside by our pool to smoke before rushing back in calling my name and calling me outside I casually walk outside to seem him shaking almost dropping his cigarette and pale as a ghost he said he was looking to the stars before seeing a formation over the home that he had not noticed before he was shocked to see that he recognized the “stars” to be the orbs we’ve seen before but in a triangular formation and not emitting a trail as before.  He told me that it had hovered over the home for a few minutes before moving over our pond silently (At tree level) before disappearing and as this was happing he heard nothing it was completely silent till it disappeared.  Not long after dogs began to bark, then multiple whines and whimpers.  Strange sounds fallowed after words such as loud knocking and weird sounds indescribable.  He then went on to add that at the end of a small gate that leads to the dam of my pond he said he once again saw a Humanoid, but this one looked more human than creature despite the fact it was for only split second.<n>

The object was either extremely low, extremely large, or both.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved in a straight line.  The aircraft made no sound and moved at least 4 times faster than I’ve ever seen a plane fly.  The object was out of my line of sight within 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see planes all the time when I&#39;m on my back deck and I&#39;ve never seen anything even close to the shape and speed of this aircraft.<n>

Eleven different nights.  Usuallaaround ten pm.  They always came from the east and went to the north or south.  Never west.  They were silent and below cloud cover.  Some would just vanish and others would go straight up or down until we couldnt see them anymore.  They were orange, round and kind of plasma looking.  A firey look to them.  It&#39;s been a year and we havnt seen them.  But now all kinds of reports have been made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There were 11 people sitting around the campfire with some looking up at the stars looking for shooting stars.  It was around 10PM and a few of us noticed a bright light flashing in the sky moving at a steady rate.  It was really high up - too high to be a plane but it seemed too bright to be a satellite.  The light stopped moving although kept flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it did what appeared to be a series of loops and then disappeared.<n>
10/3/13 21:23|Harrington|WA|Light|2-4 seconds|Adult male witnesses two peculiar lights moving "in train," both of which flare up; not Iridium satellites.|10/14/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102927.html|735|ndxe201310| Adult male witnesses two peculiar lights moving &#34;in train&#34; not Iridium satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just witnessed a very peculiar event in the nighttime sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 21:23 hrs. (Pacific Daylight Time) on Thursday, October 3, 2013, I was standing outside my home in Harrington, Washington, admiring the stars in a beautifully clear sky, and watching for satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Facing generally northeast, I was searching for the Andromeda galaxy, which was located just to the right of Cassiopeia, hoping to be able to discern it without binoculars.  As I was scanning that portion of the sky to the right of the Cassiopeia constellation, my peripheral vision suddenly “alerted” me to the fact that something was taking place above, and to the left of, Cassiopeia, and I quickly focused my attention to that area of the sky.  After shifting my attention, I estimate that I was looking at an azimuth of approximately 25 degrees (true), and approximately 75-80 degrees angle of elevation above the horizontal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately noted two very bright lights, each about the size/magnitude of the star, Vega, (located just west of the Cygnus constellation), that were moving slowly from south to north, and were located just “above” the top-most stars of Cassiopeia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given that I am generally familiar with that area of the sky, I immediately realized that the two objects were not normal celestial bodies.  Moreover, within a second or two of my first noticing the two lights, I quickly realized that the two lights, separated by approximately one half degree of arc (i.e. the diameter of a full moon), were moving slowly; that they were moving “in train”; and that their level of illumination was increasing noticeably, and rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a second or two of my first noticing the two objects, the level of illumination of both of them began to diminish noticeably, suggesting to me that the objects might be Iridium satellites.  However, within 2-3 seconds, the illumination of both lights diminished to the degree that neither of them was visible, which was my first hint that the objects probably were not Iridium satellites.  My experience with viewing the “flares” caused by the reflective antenna panels on Iridium satellites is that an Iridium satellite can still be seen, even after its “flare” has diminished to a minimum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately looked at the time on my cell telephone, and noted that it was 21:23 hours (Pacific Daylight Time).  (I later checked the time shown on the cell phone against computer time, and the times were within two seconds of one another.  Consequently, I suspect that the indicated time was accurate.)  Also, within an estimated two minutes of my sighting, I accessed the www.Heavens-Above.com website, in order to determine whether the two objects might have been Iridium satellites.  That website indicated that no Iridium “flares” would have been visible on the date, and at the time of, my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am baffled by what I have just witnessed.  My suspicion is that the objects were reflective satellites, but I cannot find any reference to visible satellites, in close proximity to one another, for the time and date of the sighting.  I am open to suggestions from anyone who reads this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will check with a local astronomy society, in attempt to determine whether any of their members may have been out viewing on this date, and may have been witness to the event.<n>

I saw a very bright white light with a contrail moving north to south at a very high speed.  The object was round, and the contrail had no fragments falling from it just a straight contrail, which was very bright white light also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted 3 seconds from the time it caught my eye.  The object was the size of a sweet pea. I am ex-Coast Guard, and we were taught to distinguish between lights.  I have seen falling space debris streak across the sky with contrails that had fragments falling from the tail.  This was not falling space debris.  The sky was clear with no clouds, and the object emitted no sound.<n>

This sighting occurred on Oct. 3, 2013, at 19:40 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way traveling East on NE Prescott ave in Portland,Or.  I was on my way to a friend’s place on NE 104th. While I was driving I looked towards the east at about a 75 degree angle from Earth.  What I saw at first struck my curiosity due to the shape of these craft and how they seemed to hover slowly above with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent 6 years in the US Navy.  I was trained in the field of Electronics Warfare.  In that field I had to be able to identify Air, Sea, Subsurface vessels by silhouette only.  So when I saw what looked like a string of lights hanging down from the sky but they appeared to float slowly over the sky.  What struck me as odd was first the lights how they went down vertical instead of aircraft lights going horizontal across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I at first only saw one that was in front of my vehicle off in the horizon at like I said 75 degree angle from the earth’s surface.  Then to the SE I noticed two more floating about 5000 meters apart.  From my vantage point.  Then they began to move in a counterclockwise movement through the sky like they were surveying the surface because one of them came as low as the Hard deck of 2000 ft. Altitude.  Then I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed another in the West behind me.  Then off to the North was two more for a total of five making what seemed like a continuous motion still lights vertical.  In a counterclockwise movement, one I noticed began to hover over the Airport of Portland or near the I-205 bridge going into Washington state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights draped down vertical with first row of lights going down being white, then a second row was red, then a third row was white with a fourth row that was green. What made me question that they couldn’t be planes is how the lights that seemed to be to the front of the vessel.  Would in unison begin with the first row of lights going down then going up while the Red ones went up while the next row of white lights went up as the row of green lights went down as they illuminated.  I saw one as it seemed to begin a turn and the vessel was shaped on the front where the lights were with a sem-circle front that shaped downward with flat like sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really was odd about them was how they would move almost like floating then do a maneuver of 180 degree turnaround and head back the opposite direction.  So I called the Police they told me to call UFO Center and the Airport Air Traffic.  So I called the Center first.  Was asked if I had a camera to capture on video?  I had my Windows Phone with a great camera on it for a phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I got off the phone and began taping the incident.  I was able to capture almost 5 minutes of video.  I did not think I was getting it but I did.  So later as I arrived home I called the FAA and they told me that the Police had Cesna 172’s up chasing bad guys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I looked them up to see the fuselage shape and lighting.  There is no way these were Cessna 172s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure after viewing my video coverage you will see what I mean.

Fog wasn&#39;t present.  It was rather dry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another person in my household (my father) has told me about these two bright objects he saw the same night, so I can confirm there was something there out of the norm.<n>

This is a nightly routine for me as I enjoy observing satellites and shooting stars.  Several civilian and military airports are in the region as well, so I understand the energy and the sound associated to these aircraft. So that is why I find what I have observed in the above mentioned evening very peculiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So like I said, I was looking up at the stars facing west, nothing in the s.ky.  Not even any aircraft the neighbors cat sort of distracted me so I briefly looked away from the sky.  As I looked back up I noticed what I thought were headlights to a passenger jet (above 35,000 ft.)  Traveling south to north..  No sound associated to this craft what so ever.  Also moving extremely slow for any aircraft I have ever seen from t any era.  As I was thinking to myself how it was funny how I did not notice this craft approach; the light suddenly dimmed to what looked like a satellite or a star for about ten seconds.. Then fading away into into the nights sky.<n>

I figured it was an airplane or something, but as we got closer it stopped moving entirely.  So when we got alongside it, I pulled into the parking lot where K-Mart used to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer, it seemed no bigger than a go-kart, with 3 bright blue-white lights forming a triangle.  I pulled underneath it, and it was up, maybe 150 ft. in the air, but the instant we got under it, the object started to move north.  At this point, we assumed it must be some kind of remote-controlled aircraft (with lights?) and looked for someone operating it as we drove.  We saw no one.  It began to move faster and I continued through the long strip mall drive following behind it.  We lost sight of it when it went over the Jittery Joe&#39;s, but by the time I got on the other side, it was completely gone.<n>

From the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of a bright orange/gold color light in the northeastern sky near South Mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked over to the window to get a better visual, the light/object moved across the sky slowly from the southeast to northwest direction, and appeared to get closer to my home.  The object finally came to a rest at what appeared to be 800-1000 feet off the ground, and perhaps 1/4 mile from my house.  (It was difficult to ascertain the actual distance)  After looking at the object, it appeared to have an ovular shape with a slight “top hat” look to it.  I watched the object for approximately 3-4 minutes before leaving the room and going to another room which was closer to the northeastern side of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the object for another minute or two, I called my wife to take a look at what I was seeing.  The very instant she turned her head to look in the objects direction, the object quickly “shut” from top to bottom almost like two doors sliding shut and meeting to close in the middle.  As it was shutting, the light grew dimmer till it was not visible.  However, I was still able to briefly see the outline of an ovular object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon the objects disappearance, there appeared to be two airplanes approaching from the southeast, with one of them splitting off heading southwest, and the other making a sharp turn directly to the north, heading towards the area of Blue Ridge Summit Pa.   I watched the airplane for a few minutes and notice it was circling the area at a high altitude, almost as though it was looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, this is the second occurrence I have seen a similar object in nearly the same location in the last 15-16 years, although I did not report the first sighting when it happened.<n>

It was silent.  I would estimate it was a little smaller than a 727 in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flipped (rotated right-to-left) at least a full turn over, did a instant 90 degree right turn, then vanished.

I was about to cross the street, but i looked up and noticed a soft white light heading northeast.  Helicopters and planes fly over my area all the time and I can plainly state that this was neither.  It was completely silent and moved very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so taken back by this &#34; light&#34; that I leaned against a brick wall to watch its movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as it was almost over my street, it slowly turned right and began to head east towards the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt really happy and aloof during and after I witnessed it.  I noticed that it kept getting brighter and dimmer and at one point saw a flicker if and orange light either on the right side or the underbelly of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to be circular, but mainly just a slow moving light.  Since I was already feeling crazy, I asked the light to turn on and off so I knew it was really there and I wasn&#39;t imagining things, but instead it slowed down directly overtop and in front of me and dropped a smaller white light that flickered down and immediately disappeared, at which point the larger light sped up, turned and orangey- red color, and sped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also mention that the street went from being filled to nothing during about a 5 minute time frame, and I believe I was the only witness on my street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light passed and I crossed the street, cars and people started showing up again.

It looked like it was a large object, even though it was probably 5-6 miles away.

The object was white but it could’ve been silver, it was very high in the sky, way higher than altitudes that regular passenger jets usually fly in this area.  It was flying at a slow speed from my perspective and it was not doing any erratic movements.  At one particular point, it sharply turned east positioning itself right above my head and then it stopped moving and just hovered there for a while, which clearly indicated that this thing was under intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed semi-stationary, doing side to side and up &amp; down small movements (again from my perspective), and at one point I felt that the object intentionally wanted me to see it...  After about 10 minutes, the object started moving and after another minute or so I lost eye contact with it as it moved away to the southeast, it was very very high up in the sky.  The best part of this sighting was that I was able to capture a 1:36 s video of the object while it was above my head executing side to side up &amp; down small maneuvers.  The white/silver object although small is pretty clear in the video if you know what you’re looking for.  I was filming it with my iphone camera which does not have a zoom feature (which sucks).  I was tempted to go grab my digital camera which has good zoom but I was afraid I was going to lose contact  with the object if I ran inside the house to retrieved the digital cam (which the batteries turned out to be dead I found out later, so it was the right decision).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The convincing part of this sighting is that there were absolutely no clouds whatsoever in the clear skies that day and you can clearly see the round shaped object in the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another interesting side of this experience was that, a few minutes before, I was contemplating the sky in a meditative state of mind sending out thoughts of harmony, joy, love and eagerness for knowledge, I made a request that if there were anybody out there intercepting my thoughts at that moment to please manifest itself somehow, then this object appeared out of nowhere flying from the northwest.  It almost looked like it turned off its cloak device to show itself to me. I was amazed, undoubtedly this sighting was real, it wasn’t an airplane (they don’t stop in mid-air), it wasn’t a weather balloon, and it wasn’t an optical illusion either.  This was a metalic/whitish colored structured flying pretty high in the sky under intelligent control.<n>

It was moving extremely fast and there was no noise whatsoever.  The object looked like it was at low altitude and as soon as I looked at it it diss appeared.  I only saw it for about 3 seconds and it was gone.  I&#39;ve never seen anything move so fast. A bout 10 minutes later there were helicopters in the area.  I live very close to Andrews AFB and planes and helicopters every day but this was unusual.  Again I only saw this thing for a split second but that was the fastest thing I&#39;ve ever seen and it just disappeared (no clouds).<n>

It reminded me of a glowing jump rope.  Our sky here is crystal clear tonight no clouds or haze what so ever and this thing glided across the sky out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was nothing I have ever seen before.  It was not a craft, it appeared to be almost a form of energy.  Made me think of the northern lights but there was no long lasting glow or aura around it, just a thin glowing u shaped line moving across the sky. It was not exceptionaly large but very striking visually.<n>
10/1/13 23:30|Arlington|WI|Unknown|10 minutes|Strange Green/Purple and Orange Dancing Lights Above Farm Field.|10/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/102/S102901.html|773|ndxe201310| Strange Green/Purple and Orange Dancing Lights Above Farm Field<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10/2/13  On the night of 10/02/2013 at around 23:30 I took my dog outside for his last break before bed.  When we walked onto our deck (looking due north)- I could clearly see unusual lights coming from the farm fields located directly behind our rural property.  We live on a hill with clear visibility for at least ½ to ¾ mile to the north.  I noticed that my small dog would not leave my side.  Normally he would be off sniffing in the darkness for  ocal small wild animals etc…  It was quite unusual for him to stick close to me- in fact he kept walking right back to the door like he wanted to go inside instead of have his last late night romp.  I guess you would say he was acting out of character.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a bit shaken by what I witnessed in the night sky.  First of all- the night sky was very clear with awesome visibility of the stars.  However- I witnessed something I have never witnessed before.  It looked to me quite a bit like the aurora borealis directly behind by property.  There was what appeared to be a misty quality to the area from the ground and up for approx 100 feet or so- but ONLY in the due north direction.  There were also beams of straight light that appeared to be coming from the sky down (or from the ground up) into this misty green and purple hazy lit up area (the color was green closer to the ground- and had a tint of purple the higher it went- also it seemed to have a bit of a sparkly aspect to it as well).   What was very odd about this is that directly above where these lights were- and where the spotlights stopped up in the air- I could not make out what was above that.  It was a clear black out.  Normally I would see stars in this area of the s! ky- but it was solid black!  I could not see a shape or form of anything in the sky- it was like it was blacked out on purpose!  I could hear no sound.  I could not hear any sounds from the nearby highway- I could hear no local animals (horses-dogs-crickets etc…) there was literally NO NOISE- even the naturally occurring country noises outside.  It was still as ever!  The beams of light would rapidly change position- following no obvious pattern.  I walked the entire distance of my deck (60 feet) back and forth trying to make sense of what I was seeing- and to try and figure out what I was looking at.  I was home alone with the dog and did not have the courage to walk down onto my property and out into the field directly behind my home.  I unfortunately did not have my phone or a camera with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the lights- I tried to make out whether they were coming from above or from the ground- and to be perfectly honest- I couldn’t really tell.  I just noticed that the lights were very strong and vivid and much like a spotlight that you would see in the sky for a Hollywood premier- the lights had a bit of an orange and hazy sort of sparkly  tint to them- and were sometimes moving so rapidly that I couldn’t tell where they were stopping and starting.  From what I could tell- there were no farmers out doing any crop work- as there was no machinery noise like you would hear during harvest time- plus they rarely harvest in the dark of night.  There are no homes due north of my house- only farming fields.  There are no trials for   hiking or four wheelers back there.  There should have been nothing there at all! I watched this light show for approx ten minutes and then became scared and went indoors.  After about ten more minutes I looked out my back window and all of the lights were gone!  There was also no more mist or fog in the air.  It was just clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw what looked like a round, orange fireball.  Considering the distance, it looked as though it might be quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered for about 30 seconds, and then just completely vanished, evaporated.  There were faint traces of it left afterward, as though it may have exploded, or just left tiny fragments of itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in the UK for just a few months.  I have also noticed what seems to have been a heavy spraying of what appeared to be chemtrails over this area, if they are in fact doing this.

I immediately new this was not an ordinary aircraft and ran in the house and called for my children to hurry outside.  While watching the 1st object another followed in the same flight path a few minutes later, quickly followed by another.  There was no sound!  No flashing lights!  Moved to smooth and fast for a plane or helicopter.  They looked like orange fiery balls of light!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ended up seeing a total of 5 over a 20 minute period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have photos and some video. I (we) have never seen anything like this.  I am skeptical usually and am not someone who WANTS to find or see something but this has me really wondering what I saw.<n>

I called my girlfriend to come outside so she could see it as well. She came outside and we watched as it seemed to change direction towards us and then stop.  My girlfriend went inside to get a camera.  The bright light stayed there until she got back.  Once she pointed the camera at the light, it began to change colors and then dim.  Eventually, it just became a blinking white light and then disappeared.<n>

I didnt think much of it and at first thought ok im just tired its a close stars or somthing.  Put him to bed came back and it was poof gone&amp;gt; then I thought more about it, planes dont do that, helicoptors dont do that. And stars dont turn off an on like that an then poof. So I thought it couldnt hurt to report it. Who knows might help in the future.<n>

Sparks and flames were clearly visible.  This was not the speed of a meteor by any means.  Once the object reached the other side of the horizon, it appeared that the &#34;flames&#34; went out - at which point our group though the fire on the &#34;plane&#34; had been extinguished.  Lo and behold, a second fiery object came from the same side of the sky that the first object rose from, and it did virtually the same thing the first object did and culminated in the same spot.  Then, a third - but more red - flaming object started in the same spot that the first two started, and then flamed out in the same spot where the first two ended.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watch carefully. I got on to I-275 Southbound and it remained there in the sky all the way home.  IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT!  No stars visible and planes do not fly this high up...planes were flying in the sky at the same time as for a good scale.  When I got home in south Tampa, it was just getting dark and it was still there, really bright like as if a flashlight was pointing at my face (it wasn&#39;t not a flashlight, just to be clear!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited outside until my girlfriend got home and I made her look at it.  She said &#34;WOW!&#34; She then pulled out her &#34;Google stars and sky map&#34;  (The one that shows you stars, planets, and constellations), she thought it was the planet Venus.  However, I doubt that. I thought maybe the International space station, but doubt that too because of how bright it was.  I then went inside for the night.<n>

Not an airplane!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Exited rear door of my house.  Observed brilliant white light in SW sky.  Initially thought was a heavy Jet but was stationary.  I positioned myself placing the object directly over a roof peak on a out building.  The object was not moving.  I observed it about 5 minutes.  I called my wife and children out to look.  I sent my wife into the garage to get a telescope to have a closer look.  As I was calibrating the scope, my wife said it simply vanished.  It was visible about 5-7 minutes but I am not sure how long it was there before I saw it.  We did notice very slight movement down toward the horizon.  Object was about 20 degrees elevation and SW direction moving very slightly SW.  The magnitude was 100x the brightness of the brightest star or planet.  A brilliant white like a halogen bulb.  There were colors like the rainbow shining downward at 8 and 4 o&#39;clock positions. It was impossible to judge the distance but I would guess it was below any orbit and 50! + miles away.   I am an Airline Pilot for a major Airline.  I know what civil and military aircraft look like.  This was nothing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound at all, moving from SW to NE. Just a constant stream of these balls moving in the same direction and same speed, if I had to guess, probably a little faster than an airplane. 500-600 mph??   There was zero wind tonight too. They were flying low it looked like, maybe 5,000 feet. I would say 100-200 of these objects flew across the sky over a half hour time frame.  Also when they were flying over dogs were barking, which is out of the ordinary for my neighborhood at night. Also heard many owls and birds too. Me and my GF were freaked out!!<n>

On my way to meet a buddy at Olde Stonewall.  That&#39;s near Zelionople.  I leave from near Pitt International.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know my aircraft.  Former Navy Analyst.

It was at 12:30 as I traveled north on 79 to Zeli.  It was less than a minute.  I was going 75mph over a mile long bridge.  I saw this thing going straight over Pittsburgh.  Seven miles by air away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please find a confirm  Or then  tell me I&#39;m right or don&#39;t contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also something in Amsterdam, NY.  Me and a friend were outside late at night.  He was smoking and I was having a chew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft, very high altitude, came over.  But every time it &#34;glowed&#34; it accelerated like crazy.  Much faster than regular commercial craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both just looked at each other, and said to each other we&#39;d never seen such a thing.  There is an old AF base near there.  So don&#39;t rule that out.  In fact the A12/SR71 used to to have service there after twelve hour trips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This wasn&#39;t that.  No 16.  No 15.  No 22.  And no Hornet, whatever it was defied explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise. No goofiness.  Just a couple guys watching the sky.

Too slow to be a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after, two jets that were too high to describe came from two different direction but headed the same way the UFO went.<n>

She is guessing at the shape, they were so blindingly bright as to obscure the shape.  The objects were south of our house, 2 were to her left near the horizon.She observed a 737 sized aircraft flying west to east just above our garage but further away, maybe a mile.  The other 2 diamonds were in the area of this aircraft.  My wife then said one of the diamonds started to follow the aircraft moving in an up and down flight pattern as it followed this aircraft.  Sunrise was at 7:30am that day.<n>
