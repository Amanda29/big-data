11/27/91 20:15|Brighton|MI|Circle|1-2 minutes|Large object with two bright lights, passed overhead silently. Half-circles connected by rectangle.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42370.html|1|ndxe199111| Large object with two bright lights, passed overhead silently. Half-circles connected by rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximate Location: Lat: 42.50 Long: -83.76  UFO approximately  300 - 500  ft in width  minimum. Altitude 800  to  1000  feet  minimum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft  is  best  described  as two semi-circles connected  together with a single  beam. The rounded edges of the semi-circles were on  the outside edge of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The  craft  moved  in  a  perpendicular  direction  to  the  beam connecting the  semi-circles. The craft was  totally silent. Only two  small white  lights were present at  the semi-circle edges, which neither changed  in color, or intensity. The  under body of the  craft is  thought to  be a  light grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The velocity of the craft was  anywhere from 50 to  100 mph. The direction  of travel was S-SW to  N-NE. The duration of the  event was approximately 1 minute,  thirty  seconds. Nothing of an extraordinary nature occurred except the appearance of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It  was about  a quarter  after eight  o&#39;clock, myself and a friend were leaving my home. It was  a clear night, and as we was walking to my car, I was gazing at the stars. Not many stars were present,  as  there  was  a  slight  haze  present  in  the upper atmosphere. A small  group of stars caught my  attention and were approx.  30 degrees  above the  horizon and  directly South of my home. Not seeing anything unusual, I proceeded to walk to my car, I put the key  in the door, then glanced back  at the small group are stars again. I then noticed  that two tiny lights were moving together and at a fixed  distance from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to move  in our direction. I immediately pointed the lights out to my  friend. The lights appeared to be a great distant apart, not something you would expect to see in the night sky.  I assumed at  first that there  must be two  objects, flying  together.  The  object  appeared  to  be  very low to the ground, not more than a couple  of hundred feet. Thinking I could get a good  look at the object with my  spotlight which I keep in the trunk of my car, I  quickly unlocked the trunk, and proceeded to retrieve my spotlight. As I proceeded to get the spotlight, my friend  continued to  watch the  lights. After a few seconds I had I plugged the spotlight into  the cigarette lighter, and pointed the light at the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was not able to illuminate any part of the object. I  panned the light between the lights, hoping I could see something.  At this point I realized  that the object had to  be at least  800 to 1000  feet high, and  that the lights were  about  300  -  500  ft  across.  I  deduced  this simply by estimating the  distance away that  the object was. It was flying at a low altitude and it was huge. The object flew directly over our heads, and passed over my home. I continued to shine the light at the object, but saw nothing. I considered the lights belonging to a single object is  because they moved toward us,  and did not vary in position with respect to one another, I therefore assumed that they were connected to a single object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights passed directly over us, and no sound was emitted by  the object.  I specifically   asked my  friend to  listen for anything.  We heard  absolutely nothing.  The object  traveled at what seemed to be a  constant altitude, with a constant velocity. The lights did  not change in intensity or  color. The object did not rotate  or maneuver in  any unusual respect.  It glided over, not making a sound as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We attempted to chase the object in an automobile. We drove several miles north along the service drive of U.S. 23. A heavy cloud front was approaching in from the north, and we gave up hope of following the object. We stopped and stood outside of the vehicle looking up at the approaching cloud front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While standing outside of our vehicle, a craft  emerged from  a the clouds. The craft  which appeared was fully lit with running flashing running  lights, and landing lights.  The landing lights had  illuminated  the  clouds  just  before  it  emerged. Looking carefully at the  craft, we noticed about 20-30  red lights which appeared  to be  mounted to  the front  of the  craft. They  were brilliant  red,  like  heat  lamps  used  at  restaurants.  There appeared to be  no pattern to the way the  lights were mounted on the aircraft&#39;s  front, it did  seem that there  was some type  of surface  area   to  whatever  was  holding   the  lights. I have never seen anything similar before or since that was mounted to the front of the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after the aircraft appeared  from the cloud, the roar of jet engines was very loud. Was  stuck me as odd was the amount of noise  generated by this  aircraft, and it&#39;s  low velocity. We thought immediately that it must be a helicopter because it was moving  very  slow.  The  craft  traveled West to East,  crossed  over the expressway (U.S. 23),  and  headed  in  the  general  direction  of Detroit Michigan. I would estimate that  the craft was about one thousand feet  from the  ground, and  traveled less  that one  hundred and fifty miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After waiting  around for about a  minute for something else to happen,  we left the area and proceeded South to my home. We could  still see aircraft that emerged  from the clouds, it stayed  on course, and  was disappearing into  the horizon. We did not see that aircraft again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned home and discussed what had happened, my friend stated that she saw the shape of the object as it passed overhead. The shape she drew was basically a circle cut in half and separated, then a rectangular bar connecting the halves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As stated above, I could only see the lights mounted on the edges which seemed to shine toward the center of the object, but I could not make out any shape. I believe my vision was impaired because I was holding a bright spotlight that I was using to illuminate the object. I believe my friend was being sincere about what she had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say with a high confidence that whatever this object was, it was a single object, it was traveling at a very low altitude, and there was absolutely no sound generated by this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following Monday, I called the FAA at Willow Run Airport and reported the incident to a  FAA investigator. He said that he would  look into  it, and  call me  back. I  did not remember his name, and I am not sure that he gave it to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday  of that week, I  called again to the  FAA, and talked to  a Mr. ((name deleted)) (sounds  like - ((deleted))),  he said he had heard nothing of  the report.  He asked  around the  office, and found no  one who remembered the  report. He then asked  me about the  incident, and  I told   him everything,  with of  course the exception of the actual visual sighting  of the craft (shape as described by my friend). I told him it must have been a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following Friday, I  called the  FAA back,  and asked what the about  progress of  the investigation.  Mr. ((name deleted)),  then told me that  he passed  the report  the Mr.  ((name deleted)),  and that he would contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About  an hour  later, Mr. ((deleted)) called.  We had  a long discussion  about  the  event.  He  told  me  he  personally  had contacted all major airports in  the area, which was an extensive list I must say, and they had  no reports of a blimp in the area. He  then  contacted  Goodyear  and  asked  them. According to Mr. ((deleted)), no blimps were operational in Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He went on  to tell me what happens when  a craft appears on radar. When a  craft has a transponder, it  relays the aircraft&#39;s ID code back to the control  tower. No aircraft were operating in the  vicinity  at  anywhere  near  the  altitude  given.  Then we discussed the possibility of large aircraft without a transponder. The  control  technicians  are   responsible  for  recording  all incidents  of  these  so  called  &#34;primary  targets&#34;, none of the airports reported any primary targets  in this area. He contacted all the airports in the  surrounding area, and nothing was found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say that Mr. ((deleted)) went far beyond my expectations of a  FAA investigator. He  was very frank  and honest about  the entire situation, and  had gone far beyond his duties to attempt to identify this aircraft.  At the end of our conversation, he told me that this report is not closed,  and will remain open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My hope is that one day someone will be able to review historical radar data to determine whether the object that we had seen did actually show up on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing is for certain, it was not a figment of our imagination, a meteor,  or swamp gas.<n>

Lowed itself infront of a house and began to eccelerate, dodging in and out of trees and finally disappearing over the horizone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin and I were going home from my girlfriend house at 10:00PM driving down highway &#34;H&#34; going East.  I was driving and my cousin was commenting on the sky in which he noticed an object coming Northeast toward us.  At first glance we thought it was a plane because there was a small airport for personal prop planes to the southwest of us.  I then told my cousin that it was nothing to worry about.  The plane looked as if it was coming in at a slow rate of speed.  It then began to speed up keeping the same distance from the ground.  So I told my cousin that it looked to me like it was getting ready to crash.  We were about a 1/4th of a mile from the object and as we watched it in fear thinking it was going to crash into a field on the southwest side of us.  I decided to speed up to an  approximately 70-80 miles per hour to get a closer look at it.  As it came over the highway it slowed down to a complete stop, where it sat motionless.  By this time we were about 20 yards and came to a screaching hault about 10 yards from it, in which the car engined stauled.  The object was about 30 feet in the air and the white lights were so bright that we could not make out a complete description of it. We could hear no jet engines or propellors.  So we automaticly assumed that it was nothing that we had ever seen before.  After three to five minutes of absolutley no noise and no movement, the object slowly began to move southwest across the highway. It then turned on its side and hovered closer to the ground.  It began to move away from us, carefully manuvering between trees and eccelorating to an approximate speed of 40-50 miles per hour.  We then left the area and headed for home.  When at the junction of &#34;H&#34; and &#34;72&#34; Highway we watched as a state patrol and at least 4 police cars headed down &#34;32&#34; Highway (which is ajacent to &#34;H&#34; highway) going southwest toward the area the object was moving. I now work at an Airline company and have many friends who have been in the Airforce and Navy and none of which who have even heard of an object that can do the things that this one did. If you have heard of such an object, I would like to know what it is to put my questions to rest.<n>

11/20/91 21:00|Winnipeg (Canada)|MB|Light|unsure|Beautiful ball of light instills awe|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14844.html|4|ndxe199111| Beautiful ball of light instills awe<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was nine years old, sharing a room with my sister. It was about nine or so at night, November of 1991, we had been sent to bed for the evening and couldn&#39;t sleep. I have always been a &#39;skywatcher&#39; and had the venetian blinds pulled up. We were on the second story of an apartment duplex, overlooking a man-made &#39;lake&#39;. About thirty minutes after nine or so (it&#39;s hard to be sure of the exact time as I didn&#39;t have a watch and there were no clocks in the room) I saw what I at first assumed was a very bright &#39;star&#39; over the lake. As I watched, it began to speed at an incredible rate toward me. I woke my sister up, and we watched as it came closer and closer. It finally stopped at about five feet from our bedroom window, and was quite small. About the size of a VW beetle, at most. It made no noise as it hung there, and I remember saying over and over again &#34;Wow...wow...wow...&#34; neither me or my sister could believe what we were seeing. It might&#39;ve been saucer-like in shape, but was covered in many bright lights, which made it difficult to ascertain it&#39;s real shape. It had two &#34;appendages&#34; coming off the sides, which ended in two, very bright, bluish-indigo lights. Along the front it had the brightest yellow-white lights I&#39;ve ever seen in my life, but it did not hurt to look into them. It also filled me with a sense of incredible joy and awe, and I feel now as if I could&#39;ve spent the rest of my life just staring at this craft. There was no fear or apprehension whatsoever. About three hours later (by my best estimate) the thing left just as it had appeared- very quickly and suddenly. I felt numbed by the experience, but also deeply content. The reason I assume it was there for three hours was that, shortly after it&#39;s departure, my Mother entered our bedroom to check on my sister and I, and was irritated to find us still awake. It felt to have only &#39;visited&#39; us a few seconds, though, or at the most, minutes. Even though I was an incredibly skeptical child before this incident (and still am, for most things) thi! s event instilled in me a definite belief in the existence of ETs and an insatiable thirst for knowledge pertaining to UFOlogy. I have never reported this event officially before.<n>

It was a clear sunny day on a pretty empty stretch of highway.  My friend pointed out a triangular, silver object hovering in the sky just above the trees on the passenger side of the car, maybe a couple hundred yards out.  As I drove on we watched it for several minutes, just hovering there and then suddenly it flew, unbelievably fast to be right in front of us, about a mile ahead, hovering over the highway.  It stayed there a couple minutes and then split into two equal parts and they both flew (again super fast) in opposite directions and then disappeared into the horizon.  It made no sound and there were no lights on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were hanging near the zenith, forming something like a letter C. The height was large enough for them to apparently remain at the same place relatively to observers who walking for a third of a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We with my mother noticed the disks when we were at the Krupsky Park near the Belaya River. There were two more people who also watched the disks. The snow in the park was very unusual that day, or it was covered with something strange. It seemed like all snow became something like balls made of plastic or hot ice with variable radii of about one inch. I took one such ball home. It did not melt for months, then I have lost it or it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People say that such sightings are frequent near the Belaya River, some of them are talking of nearby military bases. But what I saw did not look like anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/15/91 19:30|Pasadena|TX|Unknown|5-10 minutes|UFO sighting in Pasadena TX in November 1991.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68496.html|8|ndxe199111| UFO sighting in Pasadena TX in November 1991.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this UFO sometime in November 1991. I don&#39;t remember the exact day. I decided to go get a hair cut. So I borrowed my Mom&#39;s car and headed out. It was between 7-8 in the evening. It was dark too. The first thing I noticed as I was driving along was the unusual amount of lights in the sky. There were a number of planes or helicopters all over, but not close enough for me to hear or identify them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I traveled west on Sycamore in Pasadena, TX, I came to T interesection and stop sign at Beltway 8. I believe its called E Sam Houston Parkway now. Back then it was not a toll road. I looked to my left and saw the traffic was stopped down at the Spencer Hwy intersection. I turned right and headed north. Almost immediately I looked over to my left and saw something that grabbed my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a hundred yards across Beltway 8 from my location (I measured it on Google Earth) there is a field with 2 bill boards on the north and south side. Hovering above the field was a large black shape. It was between the bill boards (at least appeared to be so). It had no lights on it. I slowed down to almost a complete stop, turned off the radio, and rolled down the window. There was no sound coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should have stopped the car and gotten out so I could get a really good look, but I was so surprised I didn&#39;t really think about it. Within a minute from me sighting the &#34;craft&#34; it began to slowly ascend into the sky. It was quite large, but I could not see any detail because it was blacked out. I am not sure if it was a &#34;saucer&#34; shape or not since I was looking at it from the side. But it was not very thick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I circled around at the U-Turn on Pine as it slowly moved upward. When I was under it on the opposite side from where I started I could tell it was quite wide. I circled around back at Spencer and watched it float high and higher, and I ended up at a light down by Pasadena Blvd/Red Bluff intersections. At some point the dark shape lit up into a ball of light. I&#39;m not sure how else to describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly it flashed northward toward me. When I say it flashed I actually mean it flashed. It moved so fast that it left a trail of light behind it. As it came toward my location it did a 180 degree change in flight and flashed southward toward the Gulf of Mexico and did a zig zag. Again, it moved so fast that it left a light trail behind it. It looked to have slightly ascended in its trajectory as it took off.<n>

There is a series of short bridges in this area so I traveled past the bridges (and the object) and pulled off to the right side of the road to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to hover approximately 25&#39; above the ground/water  (it was actually right over this fish camp that had boat launches, etc, right at the edge of the water).  The object made no sound whatsoever. It did have lights, but it happened so long ago I can&#39;t accurately recall what colors other than red, which were rotating. I would estimate the size of the disc to be about 30&#39; wide by about 15&#39; high. It seemed to have a metallic finish, if memory serves me correctly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I leaned on the back of my car watching the object for around 20 minutes if not longer. Eventually, it slowly moved off at a slow rate of speed to the southeast toward Pensacola. I watched it till it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very close to the object the whole time, approximately a couple hundred yards. There were no other witnesses that I&#39;m aware of. Actually, that&#39;s how I ended up here. I was curious as to whether anyone else had reported anything similar. I told very few people about it at the time out of fear of being laughed at. Not to mention, I really had trouble accepting it. The moment I got back in my car, my mind started disproving it. It was a very unnerving experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I had not been drinking. I have never reported this anywhere else. Just wanted it documented somewhere. Now, maybe I can forget about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

To my amazement I did after thinking about it for several nights I decided to investigate ....At about the same time a week or so later....While looking out the window, with binoculars in hand, I chose a good background of stars to pass the time when suddenly an object came into view...to my amazement this object floated carelessly toward me. At first I didnt know what to think and I started to get nervous,..... as I waited my heart began to race in anticipation to what this could be. As it drew closer I knew that this was something not of this earth ,because of the strange glow it had and how perfectly its color matched the stars, triangular in shape bigger than a C-5 military cargo plane and no sound.. It was very inconspicuous and frightening to say the least because of the way it so effortlessly moved, ever so slowy through the sky..as if to say to the observer here i am and there is nothing you can do to stop me! thats when I dropped the binoculars and looked at it as it passed over head ...Immediately i focused on the door knob to see if this thing was coming to get me as i could no longer see it overhead.....I immediatly woke my wife and called my brother who was at home but works at NORAD as a sergent in the airforce..further more I am an aircraft mechanic, FAA certified...and I know it was not ours ...Nor was it a STEALTH aircraft but i must say now i know where we got part of this technology.....more sightings to be continued .......<n>

We were on a military exercise out in the mountains in Sweden. I stood looking up at the stars while fetching some water out of a lake. Suddenly i saw what i first thought was a falling star. Then came another one. My friends saw it too but they said it must be a satelite (they can be seen this time of year when they pass the skies). But, the next moment i saw two moore, and they started to &#34;chase&#34; each other... They looked like stars (same size, same bright light) but they were moving so fast! It was very strange to see the &#34;stars&#34; first flying at this speed, and then stop(!!?) and change direction and start again with same speed instantly. The &#34;stars&#34; were also flying in circles, continuing chasing each other. They must have been flying at a very high altitude since they were so small. No human vessle och aircraft can fly so fast, so high and change directions like that! That is for sure!!! The experience lasted for at least 4 minutes before they suddenly dissapeared. I can not find any theoretical explanation on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had just crossed the one- lane bridge that resides approximately 5 miles out of town on H highway, and made our way up and over the hill just ¼ of a mile past DD intersection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon topping over the hill, my cousin notices what he believes is an airplane to our far left in the cattle ranchers’ field and this object is traveling south.  Upon further notice, we both realized that not only was this airplane descending, but it made absolutely NO SOUND as it made its way across the field and toward H highway in which we were traveling on.  Believing that it was an airplane, we accelerated to approximately 90 miles per hour so as to pass under the plane as it crossed the highway.  The object reached H highway before our car had the chance to pass under it or even get close to it, and much to our dismay the object came to a complete stop above H highway.  As our car came to a screeching halt, it slid up under the object and stalled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting in the middle of the highway, my cousin and I stared up at the object, still believing that it was some sort of a helicopter, when we both noticed that the object was making no sound, it was not moving, and the unknown object hovered silently not 30 to 40 feet above us.  In fear, my cousin rolled up his window and we sat silently staring up at the craft.  He turned to me and asked “what do you think it is?”  To which by this time I realized that neither of us knew the answer to his question.  The object had three circular lights on its underside that were extremely bright.  These lights formed a triangular shape and the light source did not waver in energy, in fact, the lights were so bright that the whole highway was illuminated as though it was daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After sitting motionless above the highway for what I believe was approximately two or three minutes, the craft began to slowly move diagonal from its original route and hovered to a clearing in the open field that lay ! to the right of my car.  The object hovered just above the tree tops, almost brushing them as it passed over them, until it had reached an opening in the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stops again and then, much to our dismay, starts to turn onto its side and then slowly lower itself to the ground.  So close to the ground in fact, that I could see the silhouette of the field grass as the light from the lower of the two back lights shined through them.  After sitting at ground level for no longer than one minute, the object slowly left our side and made its way down the forest that rested to its immediate right.  The object then leveled back out flat to the ground as it traveled and after flying about 300 yards, it ascended at a 30 degree angle.  It flew up into the night sky, never to be seen again by my cousin or myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After much deliberation, my cousin and I agreed that we had not experienced any lost time nor have we ever found any explanation for what we witnessed.  However, after attending a recent UFO conference an investigator told me that he has studied triangular-shaped UFOs for some time and with my experience, I had come closer to one th! an anyone that he had ever heard of.  During that same conference I spoke to a psychologist who has studied the phenomena, and he listened to my story and was surprised to find that I had not experienced any lost time.  He began to ask me a lot of questions concerning my childhood and after that evening I began to question many events in my childhood that have followed me even into my adult life.  I have had many strange events in my life, and my children seem to also be affected by some of these phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After many years of not speaking about the event, I contacted my cousin and asked him to tell me his version of the events, only to find that everything lined-up with my story except the ending where he told me that the object followed outside the car as we drove off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

11/1/91 21:00|Bremen|GA|Disk|2-3 minutes|My TV went off and I felt that something or someone was "fooling" with me and watching me|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59305.html|15|ndxe199111| My TV went off and I felt that something or someone was &#34;fooling&#34; with me and watching me<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the fall of 1991, as a teenager, I had stayed home from school by telling my parents that I was sick.  I stayed in bed most of the day watching TV.  My mother came home from work at the ordinary time and cooked dinner.  We all ate and then I went back to my room and continued to watch the TV, that had not been turned off all day.  As it began to get later and dark outside, my parents went to bed and I continued to watch TV.  Here is where my encounter began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember what show was on, but I do remember that I was beginning to doze off while watching TV around 11PM or so.  All of the sudden, my television turned off.  I immediately assumed that I had rolled over on the remote and accidentally turned it off.  I grabbed the remote and hit the power button, but nothing happened.  I then thought that either the tube was shot from being on all day or that after I rolled over on the remote and turned off the TV that the battery must have gone dead in the remote.  I then got up out of bed and walked over to the TV.  I reached down and pressed the power button on the TV and nothing happened.  I then figured that the tube was gone and reached over to my stereo, which was in the same entertainment center, and pressed the power button.  Again, nothing happened.  I thought, it could have been a power outage but the only problem with that is that both my TV and stereo had a “standby” light which was red and signified that the units were receiving power.  Both lights were lit.  At this time I started to get a feeling that someone or something was “fooling” with me and I had a feeling that I was being watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had two windows in my room.  One was facing the front yard and street, and the other was facing our next door neighbor’s house which was probably 50 to 60 feet from our house.  Something inside me told me to look out of the window that was facing my next door neighbor.  Both of my windows had blinds and both blinds were closed.  I stepped over the window facing my neighbor and began to roll open the blinds.  As soon as the blinds opened just enough for me to get a glimpse of the yard, I saw a disc-shaped object hovering over the ground right outside my window!  Although I didn’t get to see this object long, I will never forget what I saw.  There were blinking lights of all colors around the rim of the disc and I couldn’t hear a sound that it was making.  As soon as I got a glimpse of this object, it took off flying straight up in the air.  It took off so quick that it startled me even further, but my interest was on high alert and I wanted to know what this was.  I then pulled the string down so that the blinds would open completely.  When the blinds were open, I looked up to the sky and I saw this object, now just a speck in the night sky, suddenly disappear!  I stood there for a few moments trying to make sense of what had just happened.  After I regained my senses, I reached over and pressed the power button on the TV and it came on!  I immediately thought to myself that I must be dreaming, so I went into the dining room which was adjacent to my bedroom and wrote a note to my mother that said, “wake me up if you get this note, I saw a UFO”.  I then went to bed and figured if I had dreamed this, she would never get the note.  She did get the note, and woke me up in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a football player, a very smart student.  Although I had drank alcohol maybe once or twice on an experimental basis with my friends, I had NEVER used any kind of drugs, nor had I EVER experienced any episode of hallucination.  This really happened and I would sware to it!  When I told my mother what had happened, she didn’t tell me that she did not believe me but I could tell that she probably didn’t want me to tell anyone else this story.  I really didn’t want to tell anyone anyway because the story sounded so “crazy” and I didn’t want people to think that I was delusional.  I did tell a couple of select people over the next year or so, and got the reaction that I thought that I would get, so I kind of forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I joined the Army a few years later, and when I was in training in Colorado, I told a friend of mine this story and he proceeded to tell me a similar story from when he was a teenager in Utah.  It involved his truck stalling out in the middle of nowhere and he then witnessed a UFO hovering over his truck.  It took off just as quickly as the one I saw did and then his truck became operable again.  After he told me this, I became a little more comfortable telling this story and began telling more people.  I attempted to tell my story on one of these websites once before a few years ago, but it was not as user friendly as your site and I don’t think it went through.  Just about an hour ago, I saw a show on the history channel about USO’s, which led me to google “UFO sitings”, which led me to your site and I decided to go ahead and put my story on here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a sales manager for a Toyota dealership.  I am a very intelligent person and my family and friends often look to me for advice on lots of things.  I come from a family that taught me to tell the truth, even when it hurts.  I come from a middle-class family which is a very conventional, church-going, don’t make any waves type of family.  I don’t want to overstate this, but this is the TRUTH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It had strobing or flashing colored lights around the bottom of it.  It was located just to the north side of M-50 about 1/4 mile west of Britton, right near the Grace United Methodist Church.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off to the side of the road and rolled down my window to look at it.  I sat there for about 5 minutes watching it and nothing happened except the lights kept flashing.  I believe fear made me drive away - and I never mentioned it to anyone for about 10 years.  I thought people would think I was crazy.  A few years ago I started to hear about some similar reports and I finally started to mention to people that I had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

11/1/91 03:00|Niles|MI|Triangle|2 hours|Triangle zigzagged.  Another shined light on us. Others jetted to horizon.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45195.html|17|ndxe199111| Triangle zigzagged.  Another shined light on us. Others jetted to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was almost home, driving thru a 1000 acre corn field after harvest on a dirt road between Indiana and Michigan 3 a.m. 1991. The sky was very clear. Out of the corner of my eye I saw an orange light descending from the sky. As I turned my head it came to a stop behind a leafless tree line on the other side of the field about 1/2 mile away. The light seemed large for aircraft maybe 2 feet in diameter. More like a small orb, yet small from the distance. It was quite peculiar, it’s color, the way it descended, and the way it came to a stop without slowing. I pulled the van over and said to my friend &#34;hey, watch that light over there. I could swear I just saw it come down out of the sky&#34;. So we sat there talking, not really paying attention. It had not moved for 10..maybe 15 minutes when I looked and it was rising up and slightly toward us. At about 60-75 ft. the orange light turned into 3 dazzling lights in a triangle pattern...Holy crap!!! Surprised the hell out of us! We looked at each other then back at the lights which were strobing in a rainbow of color so fast they seemed bright white. Then it started to zigzag 1500 feet back and forth several times like a bug without stopping or slowing. I can only guess the speed seemed to be more than 300 mph. It seemed to stay parallel to the ground at the same altitude. Needless to say by this time we were freakin out, both of us tapping each other on the shoulder, looking back and forth at each other and the &#34;alien ship&#34;, saying &#34;are you seeing what I’m seeing&#34; over and over. That’s all we could do. I was astonished. That went on for a little less than a minute. Then it headed east at a steady speed, gaining altitude. Two or three times, before it became too distant, it seemed to disappear and reappear in the same line of flight 2 or three times more distant than it should have been at the same speed almost instantly. An extreme jump in speed or should I say place because when it reappeared it was traveling at the same speed. We tried to chase it to see if we could spot it again but figured it moved on. So we headed back. As we drove back down the dirt road something drew my attention to the field on the other side of the road. So we stopped again backing up into a driveway so we could see if there was really something out there. We sat there a few minutes. It was like a dim, bluish spotlight waving back and forth. The beam seemed to extend only about 20 ft. I asked my friend if he wanted to go out there to get a closer look. He said no, and I was relived. Just put that out of mind. Now I wish I had, I always wonder what I would have seen. But I was more afraid of what might happen. I should have drove through the field. Maybe I could have run my truck into it or run down some helpless alien. Anyway, it waved 2 or 3 times with interrupts between passes. I asked my friend, wondering if it would be such a good idea, if I should flash the headlights at it, which I did. About ten seconds later directly after making another pass to the sky the light shined right on us. I have never seen a light so eerie. It seemed to be more luminescent or dissipated, fractured as though shining through a fog. It stayed on us for about 2 seconds then went about what it was doing without skipping a beat. I wondered if it was signaling some other craft. So, I got out and looked up. There were others that appeared like moving stars. I didn’t get a count but there were more than three because I remember 3 that came together in a large triangle formation then jetted away from each other almost to the extent of the horizon within 5 or six seconds. At the altitude they were at, I’m assuming space, the speed had to be tremendous. Then they flew back to form the same formation just as fast. There were others but they seemed to be stopped then would move shorter distances. I wasn’t taking much note of them though. They were hard to keep track of, they blended in with the stars and my neck got really tired after more than 15 minutes or so looking almost straight up. It had been a long night, the object in the field had stopped signaling and I’m not sure what happened to the ones in the sky. Dawn was approaching so we went home talking about it all morning. Hours later we went out into the field. The dirt was very hard. There were no signs of any activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
