My boyfriend and I parked at a rest area off at I-75 in Lansing, Michigan.  We stopped there to make out, talk, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After being there for about 5 minutes, we suddenly noticed hundreds of iridescent free flying circular clear orbs that came closer and closer to our car.  They seemed to be observing us.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  They came as close as only 10 to 20 feet away from the car.  At that time, I became very afraid and we left the rest area.  As we drove off, we could see them flying back up into the sky as we got back on I-75.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been driving me crazy for years now, as I am a very logical and scientific person.  I haven&#39;t told very many people of this event because I know most people won&#39;t believe me, but still after all these years I think about it at least once a week.  I am glad to finally share my extremely bizarre event that ha! ppened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I can&#39;t find anything on the internet that can relate to my happenings.  Over the years, I have wondered if this could have been a paranormal event rather than an alien experience.  If anyone out there had this happen, please let me know.  I feel so alone with this and will take it to my grave wondering.  I just want to know what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Looking towards the downtown area, in the Northeast sky, I saw an object the had a triangle shape border with an amber light in the lower right corner. The body was transparent.   It slowly drifted eastward in the sky a little more than the pace of a hot air balloon.  It then stopped and began turning counter-clockwise and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It made no noise and just seemed to hover.  Cannot judge accurately how far up it was, but it was close enough so I could stick my head out of the passenger side of our semi and see it in detail.  I was just learning to drive a big truck at the time, and was in the bunk sleeping.  My trainer was so excited that she woke me up to validate this object and had me get a closer look.  There was no haze or aura at all around the object, it was just a solid black with the lights at each point of the triangle.  Do not recall seeing any lifeforms at all either. Ever since this experience, I have had eerie feelings sometimes that I am not alone.  I dont know if this is just imagination or what, but it gives me the creeps!!<n>

Resembled a flare.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36542.html|27|ndxe199504| Bright red fireball in the sky.  Seen two seperate occasions.  Resembled a flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In April of 1995, I was in my house typing when I noticed a bright red fireball in the sky slowly heading north above the tree line above Hicks Rd.  My vantage point was from the east side of Hicks in my neighborhood, Reseda.  I initially thought it was a flare or a firework but I dismissed that notion quickly due to the fact that from my point of view, it was about the size of a marble and it was traveling in a straight horizontal line.  Although it looked exactly like a flare, the middle of the object clearly had a large amount of mass, which looked to be slightly ovular.  There was no discernable texture on the object, just bright red light.  After about eight seconds it disappeared behind the trees.  Later that year in October, I saw the object again traveling roughly the same speed at an altitude of about 200 ft.  It was heading west over Reseda.  This time I was outside on my friend&#39;s driveway waiting for my buddy to come out of the house and I got a good fifteen-second glimpse of it.  For a while, I believed it may have been ball lightning, but based on the altitude of the object and the size from my view it should have been about the size of a car or a truck, traveling at about 40 MPH.  Both times, the object appeared to be slowly hovering in a direct horizontal trajectory.  The object never appeared to be flaming nor did it leave a trail.  The object made no sound.  Incidentally, I have no witnesses to back me up on either of the accounts.  Though I can back it up with maps, drawings and similar pictures.  I&#39;ve experienced some weird things in my life, but this is probably the weirdest so far.  I do apologize for the long and detailed explanation of this incident, but I&#39;m hoping someone else may have seen the same thing as I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I&#39;ve copied these experiences from a past journal.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I took abother day trip out to the mountains just 10 minutes from the Canadian border...this time we&#39;d brought along a video camera, tho it was running low on juice. Leter that afternoon, we ended up crossing the beautiful and scenic Lake Sullivan to Pend Orielle motel,  ~ a two floor building with maybe 8 to 10 rooms per floor, possibly a couple more. It&#39;s a small place tho. He went and got a room for us and we went in to relax and chill out for the night. Our room had been on the upstairs end, facing the water. Other homes surrounded its banks around the left side. We ate, had showers, then relaxed zoning on tv. Somewhere around 10:30 (the news had just ended), I glanced outside thru the balcony doors and noticed a big bright light in the sky. I thought little of it and absently assumed it had been a jet heading our way and would soon fly over. I didn&#39;t consider Venus or anything because it was entirely too big and too low, and had definite cloud cover behind it. (After Moses Lake, that was something I learned to look for!) Awhile later, closer to midnight, I happened to glance out again and noticed the light was still there. It hadn&#39;t moved. Curious, I went outside onto the balcony to have a better look. It was low in the sky and hovered soundlessly over the water. It was a bright white light and round, did not move. It was too high to have been a shore light, which were all a yellowish color, and too big and low for a planet. It clearly wasn&#39;t a plane, jet, or chopper. It hadn&#39;t moved in several hours. Almost 6 in all that I&#39;d watched it. It came to me to videotape it so I grabbed the camera and was able to capture it on film for maybe 60-70 seconds before the battery died. I kept an eye on it until nearly 4am before I finally slept. I didn&#39;t see it the next morning when we left. Later that evening when we were home and I checked the tape, it zipped thru pretty fast and it was hard to make out what  it might have been. Fortunately I was able to capture the shoreline and lights for reference as I panned upward to the light in the sky. On the tape the light is white...dark skies, cloudy, and faint star points vague in the background. Because it zipped thru too quickly, I decided to run it on slow mo and was pretty stunned at the discovery. I&#39;m no expert on lights so can&#39;t say for certain if lights do this...however NONE of the house and shore lights did this at all; they remained steady. The light in the sky would completely disappear off the screen for several frames and return for several, disappear again...and return, for the duration of the segment. At regular speed it&#39;s steady and &#34;on&#34;, as are the shore and house lights. At slow mo speed, only the light in the sky disappears for several frames, &#34;off&#34;, and on again. Also, the stars vague in the background do not disappear either. I have no idea. I still have the tape. I&#39;ve wanted to have it analized for awhile but was afraid to make a copy in case it didn&#39;t do it on a copy, but was also unwilling to let go of the original because I might never see it again. Anyone with suggestions please contact me. *** I have posted the other events here also. Look for: 1. MOSES LAKE  WASHINGTON  MARCH 23, 1995 2.

Because it was so clear we looked up into the sky and saw 6 to 7 small white objects going at extremely high speed, doing moves that no known aircraft could make.  We observed them for approx. 1/2 hour.  I then went back inside and upstairs.  My friend then screamed out to me, &#34;Maureen!, Maureen! come here!  What is this?  I ran outside and looked up and saw a huge craft, with pulsating multi-colored lights underneath it.  It was beginning to slowly descend, and was circling the area.  About one block.  I ran inside and up the stairs to look out, then downstairs, outside in the front yard.  I could not understand why no one else was outside, and the streets were deserted.  I stayed out front by myself for about 15 min.  Then I ran inside to call the police.  The police said that they did not know what I was talking about, &#34;There isn&#39;t anything up there&#34;.  After I hung up I called to my own home which is about 10 min. away.  I had my husband, and 24 yr old son go outside and look.  They said also that they could not see anything.  I hung up and ran back out to the back yard and my friend and I observed the objects for about another 1/2 hr.  Finally it shot up and disappeared.  We were totally disoriented and we were nonchalant about the happening, almost robotic, and we both checked our watches and went back to what we were previously doing.  Several days later, I commented to my friend how strangely we acted, why were we so calm, why didn&#39;t we speak about it?  At that time my friend glossed over my comments. She did not want to talk about it, because she could not logically explain it, and it perplexed her as she is a mathematician from Poland. Our experience did not make sense to her.  Also, her husband was very ill at the time. Her husband has since passed on.  In June of 1998 she watched by accident a show about UFO&#39;s and it reminded her of our incident. When I stopped by for visit several days after the show she mentioned to me about our sighting, and was very curious about what it was that we saw. She had not thought about it since it happened.  Si! nce our sighting in 1995 I have had several other sightings.<n>

We saw a light flickering way up north towards Bowers or Slaughters beach, it was tiny in one spot then every now and again there would be a line across from on side or the other of this center light. I figured out it was spinning and the lights were reflections from lights on the ground,as I explained this to my friend we were both looking at it when it cought the light perfectly and the whole side was revealed to us .It seemed to be rotating very fast and not perfectly smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke in the morning got a pen and scribbled a picture that was the exact size the object appeared to us.

Previous to it, I dismissed all claims of sightings of UFO’s as explainable.  However, I saw the object in such broad daylight, in such clear sight, for a period of time, that it was totally inexplicable to me.  I even had time to go inside and get another person as a witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I did not think to scramble for a camera or a video recorder.  Although, I do have another witness who saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried for some time to find out whether there were any reports of activity at the air traffic control tower, or any reports by any other civilians; however I was unsuccessful in doing so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I will also say that I did not think of the sighting as a “UFO” at the time, but rather just something to think about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably 1-2 years later, when watching TV and seeing recorded footage of the same object sighted and recorded by many in Mexico, which according to the program made Mexican News, that I was struck by the fact that I had seen exactly the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it was Easter or around Easter in probably mid 1990’s.  (I believe it was 1995.  Might be able to reconstruct better timeframe with effort).  I was in my early 20’s, and was visiting my family.  It was probably between 10am and Noon, it was sunny with a few clouds and was pretty still.  We lived just below the airport,  as it is situated on a prairie rim.  From there I could see the air control tower, as well as some buildings, and of course commercial and military jets taking of and landing.  I was very used to seeing weather balloons, which I could also see very plainly when they went up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a shiny object, mostly metallic-chrome-like, not completely round, oblong-round, just hovering in the sky approximately in vicinity of the air traffic control tower.  I never saw it move.  It seemed small, much smaller than even the F-16 jets that would take off.  I do remember turning away and returning minutes later, and it was gone.  Then later it was there again.  There was no movement ever witnessed, and it just appeared to maintain its position perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed it for minutes.  I went inside and got another person to come out and look at it.  I asked, “do you see that?”.  “Yes,” they confirmed.  “What would you say that it is?” I asked.  “I don’t know,” they said.  “How would you describe it?”, I asked.  “Like a metallic object, just floating there,” they said.  We then returned inside.  Soon we came out again, and it was never seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the years I had had at the same residence, looking at the same buildings, same air traffic tower, same sky, planes, weather balloons, etc., I am totally convinced of what I saw.  I do not profess to know anything of what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I have really wanted to know how to investigate weather air traffic control (FAA) reported anything, whether the Air National Guard also at same site reported anything, and whether there have been any other civilian sightings fitting that timeframe, date, time, location, etc.<n>

(Kilgore)..after a long hot day my ex wanted to go and get a case of beer in Kilgore (since Tyler, Tx) is &#34;dry&#34;.  The drive on the outskirts of town is about 1hour coming and going, after driving several min on long dark road w/thick trees and forest we saw pulsing light..got brighter so bright we had to shield our eyes..spouse said it was light from drilling for oil..then the light slowly rose from ground and glided toward us..we were scared shitless.  The object fell into line with us along roadside and glided thru tree branches, trees and kept steady pace with our car which was moving as fast as possible..we made it to Kilgore in record time and spouse went into store to get beer.  I was crying and he was shook up.  We were apprehensive about the return trip back to Tyler on the dark road but we started our journey back..once we were about 2 min. into drive the object was waiting for us and &#34;escorted&#34;???? us all the way back to Kilgore keeping constant pace with our car and moving thru the tree limbs and brush without disturbing them.  We were the only pp on the road I seemed to have the impression that we were being &#34;studied&#34;???  Husband said he never wanted to talk about it again.  Since our divorce, approximately 6 years later, I saw the same thing in Dallas, Tx.  My girlfriend and I were on our way out that evening and I was sitting next to her and saw the light again.  I did not say anything to her, (as I recognized it from before)...I was amazed and comforted when she commented to me as she drove...I don&#39;t know what ((deleted)) that thing is but I hope it stays where it is&#34;...I never said a word as the feeling I had was so erie.  The object seemed to &#34;escort&#34; us along a major road?????  Going through about a 7 minute strecth of dense forest and trees before we came to the major intersections.  I have witnessed sightings on 2-3 other occassions with witnesses.  I have also had other supernatural ! experien ces that have involved loved ones that have passed away.  Those experiences were pleasant and I had no fear at all.  Am concerned about the bright ball of light that follows me sometimes while I am in my car.  FORGOT TO ADD THAT OBJECT HAS FOLLOWED ME AGAIN TO ESCORT ME HOME ON ISOLATED ROAD (IN 2001).  WAS WAITING FOR ME ABOUT 50 YARDS ABOVE INTERSTATE.  WAS SCARED AND TURNED AROUND TO HEAD BACK TO TOWN WHERE TRAFFIC AND PEOPLE WERE...CALLED MY SISTER TO TELL HER ON PAY PHONE (SHE HAS WITNESSED UFO&#39;S WITH ME...SHE CALMED ME DOWN ENOUGH FOR ME TO ATTEMPT THE DRIVE BACK INTO THE COUNTRY TO GO HOME.  OBJECT WAS NOT THERE WHEN I MADE THE DRIVE BACK HOME THE SECOND TIME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sky was full of stars but I wasn&#39;t seeing much in the way of shooting stars, so after a few minutes I was ready to give up and go inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I noticed a star moving very fast from east to west across the sky. By my estimation it could have crossed the entire sky in 5 or 10 seconds. At first I thought maybe it was a satellite.  I&#39;ve never seen one before but it just popped into my head that must be what this is, and I remember feeling a bit proud of myself for figuring it out.  At least that seemed like a pretty good guess until it got about 75% across the sky moving due west when it suddenly turned north and just took off so fast it was across the sky in a couple of seconds and gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know much about space but I don&#39;t think satellites can turn or move like that, so for me - this was a UFO.  It was flying and I couldn&#39;t identify it, put it that way.  Like probably millions of people, I never told anyone about it.  It&#39;s not dramatic or exciting but sometimes I wonder how different the world view would be if everyone who&#39;s seen a UFO would submit a report and I couldn&#39;t keep refusing to report my sighting with that thought in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date and time are approximate, sorry but it was over 10 years ago now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I saw two sets of lights in triangular patterns, each set had two red lights and one white light.The lights were steady and very bright, they did not blink or vary in intensity. The lights were hovering, motionless and very low, seemingly less than 50 feet above the treetops. At first I thought the two sets of lights might have both been connected to the same structure, but I then saw one set slowly drift a few feet , while the other set remained in place. I rolled down my window and slowed down to about 5 miles per hour, trying to hear anything, but there was no sound. My first thought was they may have been helicopters, but I&#39;m sure I would have heard the chopper blades, as low as they were. In the darkness, I could  make out the outlines of dark-colored structures above the lights. I&#39;ve always wished I would have waited to see what happened next, but not wanting to be late, I drove on. The next morning I thought about calling the local paper or police to see if anyone else had reported seeing this, since it happened in a residential area with houses all around, but was too embarrased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It looked to be about half a mile away and moving slowly at a speed of 20 to 30 mph. It was only about 50 feet off the ground so I know that others must have seen it as well. The top and bottom pie plate-shaped portions of the craft were orange and the center cylindrical portion was yellow. I don&#39;t think it was metallic because I couldn&#39;t see any kind of a shine (and the sun was very bright at the time with no cloud cover at all). I blinked a few times to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things and then turned to one of my classmates to see if I could get another witness. When I turned back to look out the window 2 seconds later the object had completely vanished.<n>

Please accept my apologies for the delay in contacting you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting lasted only moments but it was an unforgettable occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was 10.15 pm in London, the conditions were excellent, the sky was crystal clear. Stars of every magnitude could be seen, it was literally a picture of heavenly beauty. It was a mild night and the temperature was comfortable. I was in my ground level kitchen washing some dinner plates, my kitchen window is situated above my sink so i had a view of the night sky where i stood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the garden to throw some scraps for the birds to feed on the following morning and saw what a beautiful night sky it was. i thought to enjoy it for a few moments and realised after a moment or two that there was a fairly low star with a piercing white light in a position that was unusual for a star even for a planet. It was small enough to be mistook for a star but, the glow was not a natural starlit glow, it was also bobbing about slightly, like a top that has been spun and cannot stay completely, still but has slight movement. Of course this movement is easily detectable because all the stars in the sky are perfectly still and anything that moves is easily detected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember audibly saying to myself ,&#34;Is that star moving.&#34; I concentrated on this &#39;star&#39; to try to detect movement and sure enough it was definately hovering. I watched it for at least 10 further seconds  as it humg in the sky emitting its very unusually brilliant white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;star&#39; was about pea-sized, if you held an outstretched hand and brought your thumb and index finger together without touching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably at about 55 degrees.  The object then glowed brightly and moved foreward in a straight line very slowly for about 5 seconds then stopped I staggered backwards in disbelief. Then the object stood stationary and continued glowing for about another 5 seconds. Can you imagine my surprise. Then the object glowed really bright this time, imagine looking directly into a lightbulb. Then as if someone had lit a firework the object pitched directly upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I say directly upwards, it was as if someone had used a ruler and drawn a straight line in the sky and asked this object to run along it as if on rails. But the glow disappeared almost immediately as it took off upwards at the most incredibly awesome speed i cannot find the superlatives to describe the speed, nothing that we know of here on Earth. The object then became a complete circle like a coin of light with a pinkish hue getting smaller and smaller as it disappeared DIRECTLY and vertically upwards. It was then that I realised that we were visited by a craft from outside our understanding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought of running into the house for my binoculars and then realised that the speed of the object would foil my attempt to observe it closer and I was pleased that i did not. I just watched it as it went higher and higher and became a tiny speck of light. If the sky was not so clear i would have lost it, thanks to a crystal clear night.The object (speck) made a slight change in direction as it got way up, I would say about 10 times past the moon&#39;s distance as we know it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object now a pinhole of light headed towards a reddish star way way up. This may not be significant but it did, it finally disappeared from view but kept on travelling I&#39;m sure. I felt that whatever it was, it certainly had no intention of returning to earth that night. But who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feelings as the object moved forward in a straight line before pitching upwards, was that it was looking at something on the ground. I may be wrong but it&#39;s mannerisms were that of a bird of prey hovering over and stalking a slow moving prey on the ground. I have no choice but to use my imagination in this instance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say how far the object was from my vantage point, I had no point of reference,  the moon was not in view, even so the whole incident lasted only about 1.5 minutes maximum from start to finish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lucky to see what I saw. I believe it was a probe of some sort, nothing alive could survive the G-forces in the escape from our space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost every year I stand at the same spot in my garden, at 10.15pm and run the whole thing through my mind. I remember the stars that were in that area of sky at the time, thats easy because the same stars are there every year in April.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a change in my attitude after this. I felt as if I knew what millions af people did not. I felt that all we are doing here on earth don&#39;t mean one damn thing, because if they came to stay or showed themselves seriously we would be shocked into submission. We have no chance against the demonstration of raw power that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told a few friends and my girlfriend at the time, but I only told people who knew my character and would not treat me like a looney.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I hardly mention it. I believe more people would have sightings of their own, but it&#39;s amazing how many people never look up in the sky especially at night. By the way with all the raw power and energy expelled in that instance, there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day which was bright and sunny I went to the garden and saw an airliner about ten times higher than the object the previous night and I still heard it&#39;s engines&#39; noise as it dragged across the sky. We do not have the technology to do what was done on that night.<n>

We drove down to the river and saw a large craft with many outer lights(different colored) hovering underneath the bridge but not touching the water. It was very large, taking up almost all the space between the bottom of the bridge and the top of the water.  After observing the craft for approx. 25-30 minutes we left. I did not tell anyone of this and almost seemed to forget it even happened until many years later. This object had to be witnessed by others! It did not seem to emit any sound at all and was like nothing I had or have ever seen since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I commented on a greenish glow in the horizon, but the other two friends thought I was being funny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t say anything more about it, but after about 1 minute, I noticed that the horizon had become substantially greener.  The neon green glow stretched from one end of the horizon, to the other.  This was a very large phenomenon.  I told the two I was with to look again, and they were very surprised by what we were now looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very soon after the horizon had taken on what was now a very green glow, objects began to materialize then dematerialize, and move in an &#34;S&#34; shape for about half an hour.  This is a description of the objects that materialized:  First, let me tell you that the night was perfectly clear.  The initial object appeared and had a cloud like texture, which literally materialized right before our eyes, but then began to expand outward in the a diamond shape, with the center being empty, yet it was aligned with the outer diamond shape.  After reaching a certain size of expansion, the object would dissipate, or dematerialize.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, more of the same object began to occur, and began occurring simultaneously in different areas of the horizon.  Very soon after, another object appeared, but this one was circular and would move in an &#34;S&#34; shape downward toward the earth, leaving an &#34;S&#34; trail, and then dissipating as well.  This also had a cloud like texture to it.  Several of both kinds of objects kept appearing and either expanding as a diamond shape until dissipating, or growing into a circular shape and moving in an &#34;S&#34; pattern, downward toward earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky remained a very strong glow of green, and then in what seemed to be the climax of the entire event, two objects, both about the shape and size of a full moon, seemed to materialize out of nothing, a single object in between them appeared and shot down toward earth, and then shot right back up again.  After this, the entire phenomenon began to slowly go away.  It took another 15 minutes for it all to stop, each of the objects I described, except for the final moon like objects, began to appear less and less, and the sky slowly turned back to normal, and then it was all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me note, this phenomenon made no sounds.  Also, I ran in the house and called the Sheriff’s department to ask if anyone had reported any strange phenomenon in the Northern part of the sky.  They said no, so I did not want to talk any further as they would have thought I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also called my sister who lived about 25 miles north of where I was and she said she saw nothing in the sky either.  So, I just ran back outside to continue watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were in shock at what we just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I decided to go home, but I did notice every here and there, people were pulled over onto the side of the road watching the sky.  I have to think that they saw the same thing I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day, my friend who was with me, and attended the University of Michigan, asked a science professor if the northern lights were visible from where we were and he said they were not.  Besides, the northern lights don&#39;t do all that!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

While waiting for one of the lights to change a ship, possibbly just a strange amatuer plane flew over head, only 60 or so feet above the ground. Object pass over the road, almost following it before dissappearing out of view. The craft itself seemed like something out of Star Trek. We both expected to hear about it on the local news but there was no report of it. I&#39;m suprised no one else has ever reported it before, seeing there must have been over 50 people on the street who saw it, and I KNOW others did look up at it. It seriously looked like a Klingon Bird of Prey(Thats why I thought at first it was someone who had built a really cool airplane, but then I asked myself &#34;Wheres the Engines?&#34;) Maybe it was just my mind and my mothers mind playing tricks on us, but I thought I should report it so that maybe someone else might have seen it too. Email if you have seen anything like it before, a drawing would be much Help. ((name and e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The only possible explanation we can come up with for this incident is that there may be a model airplane or glider that looks like the object the witness describes.

I was sitting in my patrol unit when I observed over the tree lines a very large object the size of a military cargo plane (wing span) moving at a slow rate of speed.  The object was not a thin disc, but appeared to be 2-3 stories in height.  It made no sound and its speed was too slow to be an airplane.  It moved about 5 mph.  From the position I was in it was moving in a North East direction toward the college.  The object had blue, red, and white lights across it flashing and rotating.  I can remember watching them mesmerized at the fact that it was coming towards me.  I never lost eye contact with it, but I did lose time.  While I was watching it move closer, I did not notice that a tow truck driver had pulled up next to my unit.  He banged on his driver side door to get my attention.  He wanted to know a certain apartment complex.  After answering his question, which only took a minute, I looked back at the tree lines and saw that the object had disappeared.     At its speed it should have moved over the college.  I drove around the college and down the bypass looking for the object.  I went in a North and Southern direction.  There was nothing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Higher in the sky, one could see the usual collection of airplanes that were on approach towards the Nashville Airport that is several miles on the other side of Old Hickory Lake, but these particular lights were moving slowly, were very low, a dull red in color, and were losing altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think much about it as I continued on towards my exit, but noticed that the lights continued to drop even lower and moved slower over the top of the suburban homes that lay to the right of the bypass.  Becoming concerned, thinking that perhaps an airplane was in trouble, and at the time being a Certified Nurse Technician, I slowed down and kept checking on these lights as I finally reached my exit, thinking that I might have to grab my phone and dial 911 if there was a plane crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I exited on New Shackle Island Road, the lights were now coming right towards me, as I exited to the right, and at this point, I realized that this was not an airplane. I pulled off onto the shoulder of the road and got out of my car, my son still asleep in the back seat, and I was absolutely overwhelmed by what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was triangular in shape on the bottom, with a dull red light at each corner on the bottom, and one in the center.  I had the sensation of a huge mass, that it was very large, more of a pyramid in shape, and that there was a sort of grid that lined it, rather reminiscent of a rocket gantry, some sort of support structure. It was totally black, so black, in fact, that it seemed to absorb light, giving off no reflection of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound from this craft, no engine sound, no whine of turbines, nothing.  But I could feel an extremely low level vibration and hum as it approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be just drifting at this point, right over my head, so close that I would swear it seemed I could have thrown a rock at it and hit it. I stood there for several minutes as this thing went right over my head, then it headed slowly down the bypass, and suddenly just completely disappeared.  I got in my car, did a Uturn across the street, trying to see it, but it was gone.  And during this whole time, no traffic passed, which was a fact that didn&#39;t register with me until I was headed towards Springfield on the back roads. It felt as though somehow time itself had stood still as this craft passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw this craft, I would be very interested in hearing about it. I did not report it at the time, because I frankly did not know who to turn to, without being laughed at or not taken seriously, but with the increasing number of reports that sound so much like what I saw, I decided to go ahead and report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This did not have the appearance of being terrestrial in nature, and I would gladly submit to hypnosis if needed to verify this report and perhaps dig out other details that I may have forgotten. I am that positive of what I experienced.<n>

Then it went straight up, flat side then as it got to another cloud higher than the one that it came out of.  Then it turned in its edge to go into the cloud, I presume  so it wouldn&#39;t destroy the cloud of which it would have done, it was so big.

I was told that several Park Rangers  at the National Forest witnessed the crash of what appeared to be an aircraft. they immediately set off to take a look at the objet fearing it was an aircraft that crashed. when they arrive, they found a UFO burning and aliens lying on the ground. (can&#39;t tell how many). the Park Rangers pick up the alien body(S) and took then to their station. there, one of the rangers found a camera and took several pictures of the alien while it was lying on a strecher. (this is how they prove to me the story was real, i saw the picture which i describe below). i saw a picture of a alien body lying on a strecher in what looks like an infirmary. the body was lying supine on the strecher. i guess it has to be something like 4 1/2 or 5 foot tall. his skin looked something like grayish with a rose tone. he only have 4 fingers and toes on each extremity.  his upper extremities reached as far down as what looked to be their knees. his head was huge, having maximum enlargement at the inferior quadrant of his head. he had eyes that looked to be big and round(even do you can only see little thru a horizontal line defining what might looks like eyelids. his mouth and nose were in proportion to the proper anatomical positions just like on us humans. apart from that, body showed signs of first and second degree burns mainly to the left side of his body. (remember, the body was lying supine and cannot see the right side.) i was told that the military came and pick up the alien as well as the UFO and took then the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in the town of Ceiba wich is only 10-20 miles from the incident site. as for the Park Rangers, they were send back to the United States something early after the incident took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.  We, too, are aware of the allegations surrounding this incident.  Our understanding is that this alleged event, and many others in Puerto Rico, have been investigated by Jorge Martin, MUFON SD and Investigator for PR, and there may well be merit to the claims.  The most intriguing report, which we feel deserves follow-up investigation, is the alleged destruction of possibly two U.S. Navy F-14 &#34;Tomcats&#34; by a disc off the south shore of PR.  PD))<n>

It was in the spring, I believe in late April.  When we got close to a rest stop that overlooks Holyoke Ma, we noticed a bright star like white light over the city. At first it looked like a helicopter, and we only noticed it because we kids were in the back seat and looking out the window over the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;white star&#34; then suddenly turned purple and began to do zigzag maneuvers we had never seen an aircraft do. It changed colors from red to blue to purple to green and back to white. There was only one light, and no other lights on it to suggest an aircraft. (No blinking lights etc). Just the steady star-like light that coninued to change color every few minutes.  My father pulled over at the rest stop (this was the one where the old Mt Tom sign used to be years ago) and all 5 of us jumped out of the mini van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not the only ones who saw it. Several carloads of people stopped. There might have been as many as 20 folks. We watched it moved in these zigzags, several times appearing to even move against the wind very quickly. It then vanished in an odd way. It almost appeared that the sky slid over it, as if a reflective cover was moved over the light that reflected the sky back at us. No sooner had it vanished than one of the viewers (a young woman) who had turned to go back to her car cried, &#34;There it is!&#34;  We all turned to see that it had in the span of about three seconds, appeared behind Mount Tom with no noise that we could hear. It then shot straight up into the sky above the clouds and vanished for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to report this because this report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76260.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appears to have been seen in the exact same area over 10 years later, and I’m wondering if there is a regular sighting of odd things in the sky.  I’ve not heard myself of much (and I live the in the area.) but I would be interested to know if this is a hotspot for this kind of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
