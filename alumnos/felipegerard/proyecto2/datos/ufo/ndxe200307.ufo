A husband a wife were out finishing up their farm chores when they both witnessed a bright white light moving quickly towards the northeast. They reported that the light was very low and flying over the town of Houston. I talked with the husband and he said the whole event lasted no more than a few seconds, but what caught them off guard was the fact that the light zig zagged low across the sky. He said it was the strangest thing, meaning they never witnessed anything like this due to the fact that the light moved so erratically and low in the sky. (HBCC UFO Note: I believe the two reports are certainly connected due to the explanation that was given in both reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be talking more to both witnesses and gathering additional information on this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the folks for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station had passed over at approximately 23:20 hrs. on this date, but it would have been to the south of the witnesses, not to the northeast.

7/31/03 23:30|Edmonds|WA|Unknown|4 minutes|Strange satelite(s)?|8/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30471.html|2|ndxe200307| Strange satelite(s)?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out talking to my family on our back deck about 11:30pm last night when my eye caught a satelite flying overhead.  It was nothing unusual but I was entertained for a brief second and started looking for more.  There really is a lot of stuff flying around up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate after a couple of minutes my eyes caught a very faint light that appeared to be a satelite traveling NW-SE at the speed any typical satelite would.  At first I thought nothing of it but then my eye caught 2 more lights, just as faint as the first, forming a triangle.  The lights (I presume a satelite or group of satelites) appeared to be flying in formation at the same speed and altitute or outlined a very large craft.  How I saw this with all the light pollution around Seattle was pure luck.  Two others also saw it after I pointed it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe what I saw definitely originated right here on planet earth but what exactly it was is a mystery.  It could have been something very unique.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before and I&#39;d love to know what it was...  3 unrelated satelites that by chance ended up in a triangle formation?  3 related satelites flying in formation?  Some sort or communications array?  A secret spy/weapons/science platform?  Who knows?  I definitely consider these objects (or the object) I saw last night &#34;Unidentified.&#34;  It was pretty cool and I&#39;ll be looking to the northwest at around 11:30 again tonight to see if I can find it...  This time a little bit north of Seattle in Bellingham.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the report!  I suspect you witnessed the three satellites which are seen to fly in formation, and which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy &#34;N.O.S.S.&#34; satellite surveillance system.  We have received reports of them since 1996.  They are visible for several weeks, and then they disappear for a while.  Then, months later, they, or something identical, will appear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are in an orbit that is approximately 90 minutes long, so you can plan when, and where, they will pass overhead, or within sighting distance, and watch them on the next orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, again, for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,   Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hey,<n> <n><n> That&#39;s interesting.  I figured it probably was something military.  There sure is a lot of stuff flying around up there...  It&#39;s really amazing that more space flight accidents (such as Columbia) haven&#39;t occured considering the amount of debris smaller than a satelite we can&#39;t see in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I like your web site...  It&#39;s interesting to see what is reported an where.  Alien or not I think it&#39;s all interesting.  There is plenty of technology that is made right here on planet earth that borders on science fiction.  At any rate, nice work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

The witness had jumped into bed ready for a night&#39;s sleep when something caught her attention, her bedroom window faced the northeastern portion of the sky. She saw a extremely bright white light flying at a low altitude and it shot across the sky. When she first noticed it, the light/object was traveling in a straight line, but then before she lost sight of it the object it zig zagged and disappeared. (The witness is going to give me a sketch of what the event looked like).<n> <n><n> <n><n> No tail was observed trailing the object, no sound was heard as the witness said she had her window open due to it being very warm out. The witness said the object was approx: the size of her finger nail. Another interesting thing about this sighting was that the light/object had a number of lights running around the outside of it, and all white in color. The event lasted approx: 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting scared the witness enough that she had a hard time getting to sleep that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the person who made the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing the report with NUFORC.

7/31/03 22:45|Redmond|WA|Other|2-4 minutes|I looked out my bedroom window and saw a ferris wheel type shaped object hovering and glowing red, yellow and green.|8/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30472.html|4|ndxe200307| I looked out my bedroom window and saw a ferris wheel type shaped object hovering and glowing red, yellow and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting into bed and just happened to look out the window and I caught a glimpse of a glowing object in between the trees. I just thought that it was another airplane and was waiting for it to clear the trees so that I could get a better look at it.  When it finally did clear the trees, I saw this extra large glowing object that was round.  It had greenish, reddish, and yellowish glowing lights.  The only way I can really describe it is that it looked like a ferris wheel with the lights glowing and pulsing.  At first I didn&#39;t have my glasses on and I thought it was blurry so I put my glasses on and it was the same.  It looked like it was just hovering in the air, or moving very slowly in the north western direction.  Then all of a sudden it sped up and quickly took off to the west and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  It was making a sound that I could hear and it sounded kind of like a humming sound and it sounded like it was low to the ground.  My son was in the other room and when I went into the room to ask him if he saw or heard it, he said that he heard it and that it sounded like it was really low to the ground.  I was just amazed at the shape and the glowing lights of this thing in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/31/03 22:40|Seattle|WA|Light|2-3 seconds|It was about 10:40 pm. a light moving slowly north, seemed like a plane but suddenly moved very fast in an arc and dissappeared.|8/1/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30464.html|5|ndxe200307| It was about 10:40 pm. a light moving slowly north, seemed like a plane but suddenly moved very fast in an arc and dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a light moving slowly north that seemed like a plane but it suddenly zipped ectremely fast in a shallow arc and vanished. The sky was dark all around but clear enough to see any planes and many stars. I didn&#39;t hear any sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/31/03 14:00|Des Moines|IA|Cigar|5-10 Seconds|Cloaking Cigar...|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50486.html|6|ndxe200307| Cloaking Cigar...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember the exact date, but I was driving along route 65/69 on a sunny afternoon.  I checked my driver side mirror to change lanes when I saw a silver colored object in the sky.  The object was easily noticed since the sun was reflecting off of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a blimp, but I found it peculiar that it did not move.  Even more surprising, the object moved away at incredibly high speed and accelerated faster than anything I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was &#34;cigar&#34; shaped and looked very similar to a silver blimp.  The most unusual thing about this object is that as it flew away in the opposite direction, I noticed that the object became &#34;transparent&#34; and eventually it dissapeared completely.  I could see clouds through the object like it was a semi-transparent mirror.  The effect was similar to the stuff you see in &#34;Star Trek&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw it a few seconds in my driver side mirror, but it was definitely &#34;not of this world&#34;.  If it is technology invented by man, then I am most impressed.  I know the military has been experimenting with different types of camo technology, but as far as I know, the technology does not work this fast or effectively.  I suspect the object is of unknown origin...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considering the time of day and the number of people on the road I was traveling, I couldn&#39;t have been the only person who saw it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/31/03 13:20|Lansing|MI|Rectangle|15 seconds|long object over Lansing, MI|8/1/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30460.html|7|ndxe200307| long object over Lansing, MI<n> <n><n> <n><n> traveling eastbound on Saginaw , I was west of downtown Lansing about 1.5 miles or so.  I saw something traveling southbound over the trees and I would estimate that it was just east of downtown lansing.  I looked very long and short like a rectangle but could have been any shape as I was viewing it from the side.  Lansing has an airport here and I see small and large commercial planes but this had no features like they do, just rectangular with a sort of structure to it, like a triangular framework like steel beams or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it was on a downward angle but going away from the airport and it traveled very flat and quickly for its size.  The 747&#39;s that I see seem to float along and this was moving probably 4 or 5 times faster than that.  It appeared closer to the ground than commercial aircraft too.  I was driving my car and couldnt get much more than that, I didnt want to cause an accident.  It disappeared behind the treeline and the GM plant there.  Perhaps I could go there and take a picture and then illustrate where it was in the sky and how long it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess thats about it for what I can say about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness at some length, and we found him to be quite eloquent, sincere, and seemingly quite credible.  We would welcome reports from other witnesses.  PD))<n>
7/31/03 03:00|Tulsa|OK|Light|1 minute|I saw a super-bright light standing still for 30 seconds and a minute later it was moving|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30616.html|8|ndxe200307| I saw a super-bright light standing still for 30 seconds and a minute later it was moving<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok I listed above that this happened on July 31st 2003 but I&#39;m not sure that is the right date. But I know this happened between July 25 and August 5th. It was approximately 0300 hours. I walked onto my porch and sat down on. I looked up at the sky and I saw an unusually bright light. I gazed at it for about 30 seconds and wondered what it could be. At first I thought it must be a satellite. But I have never seen a satellite this bright. Then I thought maybe its a planet, but I have never seen a planet this bright either. Well I dismissed it (by the way I wasn&#39;t drinking) and I dont use drugs. Well about a minute later I looked back up and it was moving about as fast as an airplane in a straight line for about 10 seconds until the trees obscured it. It was west of me moving westward. It had no flashing lights, no colored lights. Now I am a skeptic. When this happened I thought it must have been a helicopter, but it looked as high as a star and had no flashing. I thought maybe I should call an agency and report it but I am pretty skeptical about UFO&#39;s and I thought what are the chances that I, someone who doesnt believe in UFO&#39;s, is going to see one. So I figured I would get online and see if anyone else reported a UFO that night. No one did. I haven&#39;t told anyone except my friend because people would think I&#39;m crazy the same way I do about other people who report seeing UFO&#39;s. I was talking to my friend tonight and he is into UFO&#39;s and told me I should at least report it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect Mars may be the cause of the sighting.  PD))<n>

She explained that a friend had cut out an article which ran in the Kelowna Capital Newspaper about a UFO Investigator Seeking Witnesses To A UFO Sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady told me she saw an unusual object in the night sky on July 31, 2003. She also told me she has a habit of glancing up into the sky as she has a beautiful view of the stars and it is very dark in her area. On this night the woman had already turned in, but couldn&#39;t sleep due to how warm it was in her home. The lady got up out of bed and went outside for some weird reason and when outside the lady looked towards the south. As the witness sat out looking around she spotted something, her thoughts were there shouldn&#39;t be any airplanes out here at this time of night, but there was something very strange. She watched an object traveling from east to west and described the object as being almond in shape and a luminas green in color. The witness also reports only seeing one green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady reports that from their location, which was not at all far away from the two ladies who experienced the missing time, something very strange took place. She brought out her camera to take some pictures, but as she tried to take her photos, the camera would not work. It went dead! Also she reports that the evening was warm, and she could hear coyotes cutting up. But soon they became silent, and so did everything else around them including the crickets which were making some noise. She said it was if someone had clicked off a switch. The air went from a nice sweet smelling night to a musty cold in this dead silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also this witness said that two nights ago a person telephoned the radio station (CKOV) on an open line call in program and reported seeing a streak of light, and at the front of this streak a round ball was noted and the caller reported &#34;it&#34; had landed somewhere in South East Kelowna in the exact area where the green object had been witnessed, also where the two ladies had their missing time event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: This sighting is very, very important due to the date of this sighting, the time it was witnessed, the color which was green and the shape, which is reported here to be almond in shape. Also what has me all excited over it, is due to the location where the object was observed, which was where the two ladies watched the beings on the side of the highway and the green lights, then experienced the missing time. There will be more coming on this case, also I have interviewed the second witness who had the missing time on July 31, 2003 and will be writing up the report really quick. Before I forget, I will be contacting CKOV in hopes of getting some information, and if not maybe I may get lucky and have them request that this witness to the streak of light get a hold of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

The lady was very upset and had a time speaking of the event that took place with her and a close female friend of hers. She told me today that a friend had brought over a newspaper article which was run in the Kelowna Capital Newspaper. The headline read &#34;Seeking Witnesses to UFO.&#34; which showed up on August 15, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is her story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She tells that her and her friend are having a very hard time dealing with what took place. Also another couple who live in the area watched an aerial craft hovering close to the location where the two ladies had parked there car at the side of the highway and gave confirmation to the incident, or at least witnessed an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx: 12:05 a.m., July 31, 2003 the two ladies were playing around on the computer when Linda said, we haven&#39;t done any star gazing in a long time....so Pat the lady who contacted me said, you&#39;re right, lets go out and do some star gazing. They left home at 12:05 a.m. heading out to an area where they would get a look at the clear night sky without having lights to obscure their view. Pat drove to Glenmore which is north from where she lives and is on the back road heading to Winfield from Kelowna, B.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were driving along and Pat reported that there was quite a bit of traffic for that time of the night but after they decided to stop just off to the side of the road to see what they might notice, the traffic stopped coming. There was not a light from any vehicles, not anything other than a very dark stretch of road. Pat grabbed her flashlight and shone it into the sky as she has done this in the past. Her friend Linda has the binoculars on the other side of the car scanning the starry night sky. They were there only a minute out of the car when her Linda said, this is really strange. There are three stars up in the sky and formed into a triangle shape. All three lights at this time were solid white. Both ladies watched as the three white lights started moving, but moving together. The witness with the binoculars said stars don&#39;t do that, and Pat replies, of course not..... as she thought it may have been a plane or something. Linda replies, no this is not a plane as the lights were changing color to a neon green and the object had stopped and hovered just ahead of their car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pat turned the headlights off, and shone her flashlight down the road in front of her car. They were worrying about animals such as a bear, cougars, etc.. being around in this isolated area. As she shone the light up the road both of the women spotted something which frightened them a lot. Five sets of eyes staring at approx: 40 feet away from them. As frightened as they were, their first thoughts were of coyotes or some other wild animal, but she said once you really look your brain takes it in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pat describes the creatures as being roughly four feet tall, dark gray shoulders and coming towards the women. Pat said &#34;I was so scared I could hardly talk and could hardly breathe&#34;. She yelled to her friend Linda, &#34;get in the car, get in the car&#34;. Pat said they both scrambled to get back into the vehicle but she said it was like moving through quicksand and it felt horrible. Being so terrified and trying to move as fast as they possibly could, it felt as if everything was slowing down around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they were both back in the car, Pat tried to turn the ignition on so she could get the power windows up. But all the electrics on the car was failing. The dome light, headlights were going off and on, on their own and as she said. &#34;Everything was going nuts&#34; !  Finally the car started and they turned around in the middle of the road and sped off towards home and as they traveled along they noticed a fair bit of traffic coming in their direction. (Pat commented to me, where was all the traffic when all this was happening?) As they drove along the road, Pat said to Linda, &#34;this is the weirdest thing. &#34;She said I feel like electricity, my whole body is tingling just like I was zapped by a charge from a battery&#34;. When Linda heard this, she said, &#34;I didn&#39;t want to say anything to you as you might think I was nuts, but I am feeling the same. As if I was hit by an electrical charge.&#34; As Linda was explaining how she felt, and facing Pat she glanced at the clock in car and said, &#34;Jesus Pat, look at the time&#34; ! Pat said what are you talking about ? Linda said we were only stopped and out of the car for a few minutes at the most, and the time of the car&#39;s clock reads an extra 25 minutes of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they drove along and close to home they both discussed it and wondered if they had imagined it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they were just about home, they turned onto Baker Street which is covered in darkness next to a field. All of a sudden they saw this bright, glowing neon green ball low in the sky. The object started moving to the right, &#34;stop&#34;, left, &#34;stop&#34;, right, &#34;stop&#34;, left, &#34;stop&#34; and then it started to move away until the ladies car came to a halt, and so did the object. Before they knew it, the ball of green light started heading towards them at a high rate of speed and hovered  high above their car. At this point they just wanted to get to their home and be as far away from whatever it was as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver sped off quickly again and they headed into an orchard which was very close by. They thought they would not be seen hiding amongst the trees, plus there was no lighting in this area to reveal their position. Pat looked at her friend and said, &#34;they will never find us here&#34;. Both women are sitting in the car trying to get themselves together as the driver said she was losing it at this point. Only after a very short time after arriving in the orchard Linda said, Pat you better look out the front windscreen and look up slightly. We don&#39;t have just one green ball of light, there are now three, glowing green objects. The way the green lights were in the sky, it looked as if the they formed a triangle formation and all moving now together. After a short period of time each of the green lights moved away in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (HBCC UFO asked if the witness could give some idea of how large the green lights were. The witness told me each of the lights were approx: half the size of a full moon). After seeing the lights flying off into different directions the ladies raced home as quickly as they possibly could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once safe at home, both ladies shaken, they tried to come up with some reasonable explanation for what just happened. They tried to put it out of their minds but that was impossible !!!!  Later on both ladies turned in for the night and when they woke up in the morning, Pat discovered a large bruise on her left breast and another on the bottom of her foot.  She did not know how they got there but she did know they were extremly painful.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she sat drinking a cup of coffee Linda finally got up and was walking down the hall towards the kitchen when she said, &#34;god, good morning - do I feel rough this morning&#34;. After Linda finished saying that ....Pat watched as blood came pouring from Linda&#39;s nose. Pat jumped up, ran and grabbed a towel. Linda also commented that she was having a lot of pain in her lower back area. She asked Pat to have a look to see if there was anything that could be seen. So she looked and gasped, there was a large circle burned into her skin and was located in the middle, lower back area (tail bone). Also bruises were found on Linda&#39;s body as well, some of them appeared to look like finger marks and there were three of them on each thigh. Both women at this point were shocked, upset and very frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Linda, who was up visiting from the Abbotsford ended her holiday and headed back home. Two days after being home in Abbotsford, B.C. she went to consult her family doctor due to still experiencing the terrible pain which was originating from her lower back, plus it was not getting any better. Her doctor examined her, and her injury to her back, the doctor said if I didn&#39;t know any better I would say you have a radiation burn. He was of course referring to the burn mark on Linda&#39;s back. The doctor is still trying to heal this mark on her back, as something had burned right through the outer layer of this ladies skin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (HBCC UFO Note:I will be keeping in contact with the witness to this event and hope I may be able to help in some small way).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Update to this Story:  On the night this frightening experience took place, another couple who couldn&#39;t sleep decided to go out for a walk on the warm evening. They looked up at times into the night sky, and all of a sudden they noticed a bright glowing neon colored light. The couple also added that the light was moving in the strangest way, by coming to a complete stop, moving again, stopping and then moved off very quickly. The light was seen in the same vicinity where the ladies had been stopped at the side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sounds like it gives confirmation to what the ladies saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Research Foot note: I would recommend to anyone finding such marks as described here in this report, that they consult a professional, such as their family doctor. One has to remember that they do not have to walk in to the doctor&#39;s office and make claims of missing time, or possible abduction. Let you doctor come up with the answers. Also there are some very good people who carry out work in the abduction field, and I will be very happy to put you in contact with such folks if you would like.

I also witnessed a strange event that night.  I was in bed, still awake, looking out my bedroom window which faces West.  I was looking at what I thought was star, but it seemed oddly out of place.  It flashed as bright as a flash of lightening.  The brightness and oddity of this flash made me jump out of bed, awakening my wife and asking her if she had just seen what I had.  She was asleep and did not witness what I did.  I went outside to gain a better look but it was gone.  The time of this occurrence, to the best of my knowledge was somewhere between 12:00 and 2:00 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.

As I was preparing to go to bed , I noticed a bright blue object in the NW sky around 11:50 at night. The object was pulsating a bright blue white light and moved very slowly then stopped for about 10 seconds and then it vanished like the lights went out!! I lived in this area for the last 10 years and never had seen anything so strange. &#34;the unusual thing about this, the night before I saw something similar but I though I was seeing a plane and was over tired. I find this to be quiet unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thought I should report this to somebody  Thanks  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing the report with NUFORC.

It had patches of clouds but i was focused on a clear spot in between two houses. The event was very fast. A very bright light took off in a vertical path(up)from the bottom of sky to a little bit over the houses. It was bright during the whole duration till it went out suddenly. The reason i thought this was strange because it was going faster then i have ever seen anything go in the sky and it was going straight up instead of horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Heading South on I-65 approximately 15 miles below Birmingham, I saw what I first presumed to be a short contrail at 2&#39;o-clock [it was still daylight]. I looked again and noticed it was a perfect rectangle shape, like a flat non-reflective white 2-by-4, and seemed suspended in air - - no movement. It seemed huge. If it was a single-level passenger craft, it was designed for an average passinger height around 12 feet tall. As my friend was on his cell phone, I decided not to call him to verify, but when we returned from the trip I asked if he had noticed the bogey at 2-o-clock. Athough I have seen several different objects since childhood, it was important to verify what he thought because he is a Marine Sgt. and he has a knowledge of military - civilian craft. He noted that although he knew of an airport close by, he had noticed the object and that it was certainly not moving, nor was it a contrail. He had a rear glass window large enough to notice it still motionless a minute or so later.<n>

Shortly before I reached the interection with Foothill Boulevard, I saw through my windshield to my left a silvery, oval-shaped object tilted in midair and hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was tilted from left to right and had a series of rings on the object with a dome-like structure on top. Suddenly, it kind of pitched and shot off to the west and was gone!  The whole episode seemed to last no more than 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw something very unusual. I was traveling east on Sahara Blvd at approximatly 07:40 when I looked up and saw 20-30 flying black objects . These  objects were just under the cloud layer and were traveling NNW perpendicular to the wind. I at first thought they might be birds or balloons . However, I watched them move in  a loose but excact formation for approximatly 5 minutes then they all simply took off in different dirrections at tremendous speed. It was highly unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And, as I lay in bed, I became aware of what at first appeared to be a very bright star, shining through my venetian blinds, which were not fully closed due to fact they are old and won&#39;t close all the way!  As I watched the light it seemed to be dancing about and moving in an erratic pattern.  It was at an indeterminate distance because of the oblique angle of the window to the object and the height of the object appeared to change rapidly as it bobbed and weaved in a random pattern.  I would guess the object, whatever it was, was hovering out over West of 315 a 2 lane highway West of my location.  I was groggy and wanted to sleep, although it kind of fascinated me and frightened me at the same time.  It seemed to move down behind the tree line on the property further West of my building, and I can&#39;t remember falling asleep, but woke up again about 3 hours later and no light, star, or any other object was detectable in that part of the sky.  In fact, a fog had rolled in and daylight was very murky and didn&#39;t allow good visibility that morning, and it rained hard later on that day as I remember with thunder and lightning in abundance.  I also remember thinking about the sighting that next day and night and had some difficulty going to sleep for several nights since!  Thank you!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The planet, Mars, might have been in the western sky at the time indicated.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perfect Triangular Formation of Silent Star-Like Lights Heading South Lasting About 1 1/2 Minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night...7/29/03...it was very clear...so...about 11:30 PM...I got my lounge chair...binoculars...and flashlight...and went out on the Deck to lay back and look up.  I&#39;m in a Wooded Rural Area...there are No City or Street Lights to intefere with the view.  I was hoping to see Meteors or Satellites, along with just studying the Milky Way and Star formations in general.  I saw a few fast Meteors...didn&#39;t see any satellites going by...which I usually do.  I was just enjoying looking with my naked eye and then looking through the binoculars at the same spot to see SO MANY more Stars...It was Fun.  At 12:05 AM, I noticed what I thought was a Satellite almost straight up in the sky...a little off to the right...and heading South...Southeast.  Then...through the binoculars...I noticed that there were 2 Stars that were Side By Side !!!  Identical pace and direction.  Then as I followed them I noticed that there was another &#34;lead&#34; Star about 2 1/2 times the distance between the 2 rear stars.  All 3 in a Perfect Triangle !  The Formation was perfect with No Deviation.  They were not planes...there was no sound.  They appeared to be in Deep Space...just like a Satelite moves.  I checked to see if the sky was blacked out within the triangle ?  Meaning that it was a Solid Object.  But NO...I could see Stars between them...so each was and individual light.  I have seen Satellites many times...but they travel alone.  Sometimes I&#39;ve seen 2 Satellites traveling in different directions at the same time.  But NEVER have I seen 3 Satellites travel in formation ?!!!  PERFECT formation I might add !  I followed them as they headed South towards Orien&#39;s Belt...then as they moved on they started to fade...and then I lost them.  The sighting lasted about 1 minute or more.  Were these Satellites ?  Do Satellites travel in Perfect Triangular Formation ?  Did anyone else see these lights?  I have an Art Background and a Keen Eye for Shapes and Measures and Good Observation Skills...These Light did not deviate ! from the formation at all...never saw anything like this! I would like to know if this Formation was seen by others ?<n>

I was looking to it and looking for the road , and suddently another red light lighted in the right corner. it was strange. i look back to the road to make shure i wasent going against any other car, and look back to it. as i look i had a clear view of the all image, the triangle and the 2 lights, and then suddently it went like up.. a fast zapp and disapear. from the beggining the object was moving very slow for a diagonal trajectory, from righ to left up. i thought it was a plane...but no planes have they full body colored and the lights are red in one side and green in the other. i now this may sound strange, even i dont know what it its. i know one thing...the internet is full of lies...but believe if you want.. i just needed to report this. stay well all!<n>

At first we thought it was a plane, but it was not. It hovered in the distance slightly  moving or shifting position.  It was not a helicopter either. It was just one light that seemed to spin or rotate while changing colors from white to blue and red, often changing shape as well.  Or pulsing, and blinking. Then we went outside to watch it and I measured it&#39;s shifting against the buildings.  We followed it further until about 1:45 AM, it was still hovering above the city but by now far in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  May have been a celestial body, perhaps Mars, in the western sky.

But what made us curious was that when you see fireworks, they go up explode, and then eventually burn out. Whatever this was went up, down, back up again, then back down again, with no discernable pattern, and changing colors and brilliance the whole time. We were on our way back to Bellingham, WA from Seattle after watching The Seattle Mariners. I am pretty confident about the date but the time could be off by an hour(later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling on Interstate 5 and were just north of Marysville when we first noticed it. We watched in amazement for about 5 minutes before it went behind some trees, as we were traveling about 65 m.p.h. When we got to where we thought it would be visible again, we saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were not shooting stars. One kept disappearing then reappearing. As I watched, one went behind the other then their distance doubled. They were steady lights, white in color. Except for the one that continued to disappear and re-appear. The were as though one chasing the other. I lost sight as they went past the building. They looked the size of the stars visible in the sky but moved faster than an airplane does. I later saw an airplane and realized that they flew much higher and that a plane has blinking and solid lights. This was definately an anomali I have never witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed satellites moving across the night sky.

I was on my way to a friends house, and the sky was clear.  So I was suprised to see a bright object in the sky (not the sun).  At first i thought it was a planet but it seemed too big and it also seemed that it was getting bigger.  I&#39;m not sure though.  Also it wasn&#39;t white, it was silver.  I watched it while going down a sidewalk, so i was constantly looking at it and watching where i was going.  I went over a bump and the next time i looked up it was gone.  I stopped and looked for it for a couple minutes but i didn&#39;t see it.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright yellow object in southern sky moved around constantly for 35 minutes while maintaining its position above the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed what appeared to be a star at first, but it was bright yellow, which seemed odd. Object was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon, and in a southerly direction from my vantage point. I saw it move and assumed it must be an airplane or helicopter, but after ten minutes of observation, its location did not appear to have changed, although it seemed to be moving from side to side. In fact, it was bobbing all over the place, although it never moved more than approximately 4 to 5 times its own diameter. I observed it for at least twenty minutes, and it was moving almost the entire time, i.e., it would remain stationary for five or ten seconds at a time, and then resume motion. At first I thought I might be imagining it, or that some atmospheric condition was creating the illusion of motion, but it&#39;s a very clear night here, and cool, and I&#39;m now convinced that the object was moving, although in general it appears to be stationary relative to the earth. It&#39;s now 5:11 am EST. I&#39;m going outside to see if it&#39;s still there. It&#39;s now 5:15 am. It&#39;s still there, and in the same position. If it&#39;s a star, it seems that it should be in a different position by now, 36 minutes after I first observed it. Also, I noticed that while there are a few stars visible in the northern sky, there are no stars visible in the southern sky where this object is located. I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s overcast to the south - too much glare from the lights around the apartment complex. But whatever it is, it&#39;s still there and it&#39;s still bouncing around. That&#39;s about all I can tell you. It may be of interest to you that I live very close to Selfridge Air National Guard Base and there was an air show at the base from Friday through Sunday. I&#39;ve lived here for 25 years and there have been persistent rumors about UFO activity around the base.<n>

We watched it for a minute and they could see the same thing that i was....this object was moving. My sister and her friend then joined in watching this object. This object moved up and down, from left to right &amp; right to left and in zigzagging moves. I have seen satellites and planets in the night sky before and I know what they look like.  This &#34;star&#34; is not either of those.  It is now 131 am and i have been watching this object since 1220am.  This &#34;star&#34; is still moving same patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object was a celestial body, either a star or planet.  The perceived motion of the bright object against a dark background is often reported by witnesses, and it is the result of movement of the eye, not the object being observed.  It is called nystagmic movement of the eye, we believe.  PD))<n>

One of the stars looked out of place, it was brighter and slightly bigger then the rest of the stars. Shortly after the star-like object moved slightly north and stopped. Then it moved slightly north again and stopped. Then finally it made a sharp arc back south and up into space.

It was difficult to judge the size, speed, and the alltitude of the craft. I then quickly ran upstairs tripping at the last step shouting to my mom and sister,&#34;A UFO!A UFO!&#34;. I then ran back outside by then my brother had waken up and went outside(my dad was away on business). I then spotted the craft moving at the same speed and in the same direction. The rest of my family was able to pick it out of the starry sky. Near the end of the siting I could actually see a small, faint outline beetween the three points of lights. We followed it until it was 3/4 of the way across the sky it then started to vanish. This was one truly AMAZING siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have observed the three satellites that often are seen to orbit in unwavering formation.

Some stop completely and then get very bright, and then the light goes down abit, and it moves on.  One night I counted at least 10 and I had witnesses, one was my husband and the other, a friend.

However, with the aid of binoculars and telescope we did not see any flashing strob lights nor was there any sound like with the two planes and one jet we observed afterwards.  The object was brighter than any star or planet in the sky, flying horizontally at approximatly 30 degrees above the horizon.

It was about 10:20 PM and me and my girlfriend were out in the backroads of town driving towards home, when I saw 3 lights in the sky, all next to each other. They were amber in color, and appeared to be moving slowly. We then spotted another orange/red light was traveling across the sky towards it. This was traveling pretty fast, and approaching the group of 3. It got in very close proximity to the 3, and all the sudden fell straight out of the sky and turned bright white. It sent chills straight down my spine. I slammed on the gas and tried to get closer for a look at the 3, got one last glimpse of it in a break in some trees, and then did not see it again. This was not very high up, it was lower than most small airplanes fly to the ground.<n>

My wife was driving and I was riding shotgun, with our 2 kids in the back.  Just North of Nacogdoches my wife said look at that!  Directly in front of us was a greenish object falling from the sky.  What I saw was a very bright green fireball type thing with a short tail.  It only lasted 3 to 5 seconds.  My wife thought someone had shot a bottle rocket or some other type of firework over US 59, the road we were driving South on.  I thought it was a meteor or possibly some sort of space trash falling back through the atmosphere(I had the raren privilege of seeing a Russian booster fall back to Earth in the 1980&#39;s as it entered the atmosphere over Ohio, and I could see this very clearly and brightly in Houston, hundreds of miles away-in fact I thought that was fireworks only a mile or two away and I was shocked and thrilled when I read the next day what I really saw!) I am not 100% sure of the time we saw the fireball, or the county or zip code as we were just passing through the area.  It did appear to be very low in the sky, right in front of the car (toward the South) a very bright firework looking object.  We thought it was very close to us.  We have seen many shooting stars and this was much brighter than those, and also larger looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a rather large bright orange fireball with bright green surrounding it with a long green trail streaking across the sky from east to west.  No noise at all.  Very fast, but seemed to be low in the sky - large object.  My sister was with me and by the time I yelled at her to look up, it was gone.  Within the minute, we saw a large plane (didn&#39;t look like a passenger jet plane at all) with more lights than &#39;normal&#39; travel in the same direction as the object.  Then the plane circled back as if in search (?).  Very strange - I have never seen anything like this.  I have seen meteor showers - (small, white streaks, high up), and the space shuttle entering the atmosphere....comets....but nothing EVER like this!  I am a college graduate (BS in CS) and now own my own business.  I hope someone will report this!  Other people in Houston had to have seen it.

I would not have given it much though except that it was so large and bright.  I watched it as I drove looking for some type of support like a pole underneath it or perhaps an aircraft above it.  I reached a point where there were no trees in the way of my view and I saw for the first time that it was hanging in midair completely independent.  Intrigued I pulled my car over to the side of the road, got out, and tried to make sense of what I was seeing.  It was a ball of light, about the color of an florescent light bulb only a bit whiter and much brighter; and when I say ball I mean a 3 dimensional object in the form of a sphere, and it was as far as I could tell a perfect ball shape, no flaws apparent, very vivid, very well focused, sharp edged sphere. The color was uniform through out its surface except for a small patch of orange on the bottom. You know how when you look at an incandescent light bulb you can see the filament burning inside of the clear or frosted glass? Well it was nothing like that.  The light was even through out, almost as though it WAS light.  The object made no sound, it did not change in intensity, there were no sparks, no fumes, no smoke, no windows, no antenna, no landing gear.  I could not tell it&#39;s size but I know it was big.I could hold my hand out in font of me at arms length and cover about 90% of the object. I didn&#39;t have the slightest bit of fear, I was to busy taking it all in.  Every fiber of my being told me that what I was witnessing COULD NOT BE HAPPENING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent the entire time determining what it was not, and believe me  I wanted it to be something I could identify, but it was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. it was NOT an airplane 2. it was NOT a balloon 3. it was NOT a helicopter a) if it was a helicopter with a spotlight pointed at me, then they would have had to be pointing the light directly at me and continued to point it at me until it went out of sight because the light never became an ellipse.  It maintained its circular (actually spherical) shape for the entire observation; plus I never heard a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. it was Not burning swamp gas a) it would seem to me that if it were a gas then it would have been some irregular ever changing shape as it would be unconfined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. it was NOT Venus, a meteor, or a re-entry / launch 6. It was NOT the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7. I don&#39;t think it was &#34;Balled Lightning&#34; what ever that is. I don&#39;t know if it can exist on a clear, and calm summer night; but it just seems as if it could not have been so large and so steady then move slowly away without a perceivable change in color or intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8. It was NOT a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> a) it was not viewable the next night same time/place; b) it filled a full four inches of my field of view, c) it did NOT appear to &#34;move along&#34; with me as I traveled south. I started out looking forward towards the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then saw it through a break in the tree line and it was right beside me.

Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t wearing my watch but feel quite certain it started before midnight, on the 27th. Something about hearing it was 11:30 as I left the Grey Creek hall to lay on the beach and star gaze. Grey Creek is north of Creston on highway 3A. It started in the northwest looking like northern lights. No color, just white light glowing in sort of horizontal bands. One and then a second a bit higher. Then the bands merged into one and sank lower on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a few small vertical slashes forming above and to the north of the white glow. Then it got interesting when a fatter vertical beam began to rise out of the glow, low over the horizon, but it was no longer perfectly vertical it was leaning over to the south. Sort of about 15 degrees leaning to the left. I thought that was unusual. It looked a little weird too as it got brighter and more defined. And then expanded right across the sky, in only a few seconds! At arms length it was about two fingers wide. Perfectly straight and exactly the same intensity from one horizon to the next, and at an angle from the northwest to the southeast. I guess it could have looked cylindrical as some witnesses claimed. I didn&#39;t look two dimensional at all. More like a big fat nasty chemtrail with a light on inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I will guess that it lasted for about 15 minutes without any changes until it got a bit fatter and duller and the sharp edges began to dissolve somewhat and become blurry with little shards of light coming off it almost like it was spinning glowing particulate off of itself. Then it bent! It curved into a graceful arc to the north and stayed like that for a few minutes before snapping back to a straight line, then continuing to become duller until it faded out completely leaving absolutely no sign of itself or the northern lights it seemed to grow from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 43 yrs and have been a sky watcher my whole life and have never seen anything like this before, and I&#39;ve seen some strange things believe me. I&#39;ve seen lots of weird lights flying about, something in the daytime that looked like a giant pair of broken scissors and lots of really unbelievably strange clouds. Oh yes and the chemtrails with little white orbs traveling through them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I&#39;ve been some help. I live in Nelson and your welcome to phone me if you like at:  Thanks Brian and good luck with your work,  Another Report:  Hello,  I was just reading Rense.com and ran across the article about the sightings on July 27, 2003. That night I was doing sound tech work at a festival 20 min. east of Kamloops. At about 2:00 am I looked up in the sky and saw a green beam from horizon to horizon. At first I thought it was the aurora borealis but it barely moved and kept it&#39;s orientation for the two hours I observed it. My friend who was also there thought it might be some sort of chemtrail activity, or maybe a Harrp test from up in Alaska. It is the strangest thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks  Another Report:  Hi there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just read your letter to the editor in the August 15th edition of the Capital News of the Okanagan, Seeking Witnesses to UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t be sure of the exact date, but July 27th sounds about right. I live on the Westside shore of Okanagan Lake, in Kelowna. Around the time of night you describe, I took my dog out for his walk before bed, nothing different than most nights. But as I was standing outside our fence, I noticed up in the sky, a pale horizontal beam of light, extending from the west to the east, and sort of fading beyond my sight. I live close to the hillside, so it appeared to originate from the other side of the hill, maybe in Westbank. It caught my attention because it reminded me of how years ago when they opened a grocery store up in Westbank, they had rented one of those Hollywood style spotlights, and we had seen those shining all the way over where we live. But what I saw this night wasn&#39;t as bright, nor was it panning around as one of those Hollywood ones does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was actually going to go inside and e-mail my friend who lives on the other side of the hill and ask him if any place on his side was having a celebration that he knew of, but I dismissed it because it seemed so pale. My other thought I decided it might be a contrail showing up vaguely from a jet that had passed in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now reading your description, I&#39;m wondering if it was the last bits of the same beam of light seen by people in Houston. It was definitely stationary, but not prominent enough that I was able to view any rotation or black shadow within it. I&#39;d certainly like to know if anyone else in this area saw the same thing, and I&#39;m wishing I had told my friend about it that night!  Another Report:  I read your newspaper article about unexplained sightings on July 27/28. We have lake property at Lake Koocanusa and we are located just 5 miles from Jaffray. Between about midnight and 1:30 a.m. July 28 my daughter, son-in-law, son, daughter-in-law and myself were star gazing. We get our lounge chairs out each night and just enjoy the night sky. We first spotted a bright light in the north western sky moving in a zig zag motion. It then just disappeared like it went out. Then we saw a very large beam of light. At first we thought it was northern lights but it wasn’t in the right area. This large beam of light was still there at 1:30 when we went to bed. ( We are always joking that the UFO&#39;s are going to land because I have 28 solar lights along a 500’ beach frontage.)  Another Report:  Dear Brian Vike  I live in Vernon BC. I live in an apartment facing west to the airport in Vernon, Davis Farm is on my right and the army camp is on my left. I was reading the statements about the strange light over Kimberly. ON that night I was on my balcony watching the one ray of Northern light touch on the hill behind Davis Farm. It did not behave like a northern light. It did not oscillate, nor dance or drape like a curtain. It seemed to just slightly waver on the top of the hill and remained in one form. The direction it came was from behind and the left which is southeast. Again not a northern light. It remained the same intensity of light which reminds me of concentrated moon light. It broke and one piece remained straight and the long line started to curl up and back around like a three quarter figure eight. I am a born skywatcher and I am glad now to have a place to record these unexplainable events. There is allot of activity around Vernon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

This object was stationary, S.SE of her home which is just south of Granite Falls. It was about the size of a quarter held at arms length and approx.60 degrees above the horizen.  In her words it looked like a semi-circle of lights with beams or legs of white light, there was an egg shape obove the lights that was unlit but could be seen in the reflection of the semicircle of light. She observed this shape for approx. ten minutes, the shape then changed to a red egg or capsule of light, it then changed to a verticle column of golden light which she described as looking like a golden chain bracelet, it then changed  back to a red capsule or egg shaped light, she then went to sleep so did not see it leave, I am sending along a sketch that she drew the next morning, she drew it to approximate scale of what she saw<n>
7/28/03 01:00|Kamloops to Kimberley (Canada)|BC|Unknown|1 hour|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  UFOs, Beam of Light, Puzzled And Frightened Residents.|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31068.html|54|ndxe200307| UFOs, Beam of Light, Puzzled And Frightened Residents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> by Brian Vike HBCC UFO Research hbccufo@telus.net  One Hundred and Fifty Seven Witnesses Speak Out - We Want To Know!   What can cause so many residents in various communities from Kamloops through to the Okanagan and the Kootenays in British Columbia left scratching their heads, wondering what it was they all witnessed. Also many people became very frightened and ran into their homes. The answers to the questions I have been asked have been hard to come by, but we certainly know something extraordinary did take place on July 28, 2003 in the early morning hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story begins with a family who was camping at St. Marys Lake, which is located approximately 12 miles east of Kimberley, British Columbia, Canada. Around 12:45 a.m. the husband and wife decided to do some star gazing as the children were asleep and the night was warm and the sky clear and full of stars. As the couple stood looking into the night sky they observed a very bright, white light heading in a southeasterly direction. The moon sized light was witnessed flying low over top Bootleg Mountain and across the lake and at times it&#39;s speed did vary. As it slowed, then picking up speed once again the witnesses watched the light zig zag slightly and at times it seemed to wobble until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they arrived back home from their camping trip they contacted the Kimberley RCMP detachment and spoke to a Cpl. Rod Carbonneau to enquire if others had reported seeing the object. Cpl. Rod Carbonneau said the detachment received no calls over this matter. The Cranbrook Airport was also contacted and asked if there were any aircraft in the area of the sighting .... but none were reported in the vicinity the object was observed. For the couple who watched this amazing sight on July 28, 2003 not many answers were fourth coming. A couple of area residents did telephone the folks who watched the event telling them what they also saw that night, and another did make a report to the local newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From A Few Witnesses To a Flood Of Calls:  A report was made to Peter Davenport at the NUFORC in Seattle, Washington and then the sighting report was forwarded on to me here at HBCC UFO Research (Houston, British Columbia) for a follow-up investigation. What I did not realize at this time was just how large this one case was going to be. From a handful of witnesses the case exploded  into a major event  where I currently have 157 eye witnesses to something very mysterious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two things happened in the early morning hours that Sunday, a large moon sized object was seen by many area residents, and what followed left many folks in communities such as Kamloops, Vernon, Kelowna, Kimberley, Cranbrook and as far as Jaffray, British Columbia scratching their heads wondering what it was they saw. A beam, or ray of white light was observed from Kamloops as far southeast as Jaffray, British Columbia. People who watched the strange and puzzling event said the white light looked as bright as a florescent tube and was arced from horizon to horizon as if one was viewing a rainbow. The beam of light sat almost stationary in this position for approximately an hour before dissipating. Almost everyone  who witnessed the beam of white light said they had never seen anything like this before. All said they have watched the northern lights many times, but they commented this was certainly not the northern lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Few Of The Eye Witness Accounts - The Light/Object (July 28, 2003)  A gentleman from Cranbrook, B.C. telephoned me and reported that he and his family were sitting outside and were discussing how bad the forest fires are throughout the southern interior when one of the family members spotted what they thought was a airplane with it&#39;s landing lights on and heading in their direction. As the bright white light drew closer to them, the size was growing rapidly and so was the brightness of the light. Before they knew it, the light/object was upon them. The family was so frightened due to the immense size of the light/object being almost at the edge of their property that the children ran into the house screaming. The mother followed closely behind. The father followed his wife and kids into the home, but stopped to take one last glance at whatever it was, and watched it make a 90 degree turn to the south. When I spoke to the dad he told me that they heard not a sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another report came from a lady who was with a group of people on their holiday at their cabin on one of the local Kimberley, B.C. lakes. She told me they were sitting outside on the deck when one of the guests pointed towards the northwest. Low over one of the mountains came a huge, extremely bright white light traveling slowly in a zig zag pattern heading to the southeast. As it got closer to the resort area, many people became uncomfortable due to how strange the object/light was acting. As it passed straight overhead not a sound was heard. Some of the folks who were there said it was like looking at a full moon on a clear night. It was that big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two men in a pick-up truck traveling north along the highway just south of Wycliffe spotted the large bright object flying south. As they watched the large light/object close in on their location they pulled the truck over to the side of the highway,  and jumped out of the vehicle to get a better look. Due to it being so low, so bright, and passing directly over top of them the light from the object lit up the highway and surrounding area. Both men stood frozen in their tracks and speechless. Both fellows said it moved quickly in a straight line and made no unusual maneuvers. Again no sound was heard which is remarkable due to how close it was to these men, and all the other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above is a small example of what folks saw that night. There are many more reports here of area residents reporting seeing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Few Of The Eye Witness Accounts - Beam Of Light (July 28, 2003)  One lady said what she saw was very strange, it didn&#39;t behave like the northern lights as she noted that the lights danced across the sky, or looked like a curtain of shimmering light. She wondered if the long dry hot weather may have something to do with what she was seeing. But her thoughts changed quickly as she watched the beam of light come from the northwest horizon and impaled itself on one of the local hills and that is where it ended, according to this witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A party of four witnesses were out for a few days on one of the areas lakes just outside of Kimberley, B.C. Everyone was having a good time talking and having a few spirits. One of the men who was sitting on a camping chair had just poured himself a drink, when he looked up and said to the rest of the people he was with, &#34;do you see what I am seeing&#34;? Everyone replied, &#34;yes&#34;! The man who asked the question was so surprised at what he was looking at, he poured his drink onto the ground and thought he&#39;d had one to many that evening!   They all watched a beam of narrow bright white light run in an arc from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First they wondered if it might have been a search light as it was so brigh but they soon ruled this out due to the miles and miles the light covered. Again all these witnesses said this event lasted for approximately one hour before it dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some three weeks after people saw the beam of light on July 28, 2003, I had calls from Kelowna and Kimberley British Columbia reporting that the beam of light was back in the night sky. Two Kelowna residents stood on the patio with phone in hand reporting what it was they were seeing. The exact white beam of light sat stationary running from horizon to horizon and was extremely bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four Kimberley residents stood outside watching the beam of light, they reported standing under a street lamp and even with brightness from the street light they could clearly see the beam of light sitting in the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusions:  There is no doubt that something very unusual took place on Sunday, July 28, 2003 in the wee hours that morning. What folks saw in all these communities seems to be a mystery. But I have tried to come up with some reasonable answers for all the questions everyone had for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what I know:  157 witnesses watched an amazing event unfold on July 28, 2003  (early morning). Some observed the object and others observed the beam of light. (Exact numbers are broken down for how many saw the object or beam of light below. What I didn&#39;t say is how many saw both).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 31 witnesses observed a huge, bright white low flying light/object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 126 witnesses observed the reported beam of bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The International Space Station passed over Kimberley, B.C., at 00:24 hrs. on July 27, 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Fire Ball was observed flying in a southeasterly direction over the West Coast of Canada and the U.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the witnesses reported the light/object and beam of light running from the northwest to the southeast There would have been a lot of air traffic in some of these areas due to the fire fighting efforts to control the devastating forest fires which raged through some of these areas in the summer of 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our hearts go out to the people who were effected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, the questions that need an be answered are.... What was the strange, large, glowing bright object? Did the object cause the beam of light which sat stationary in the night sky for approximately an hour as the object traveled through the areas?  As for the object, this is certainly a mystery. After a lot of time speaking with witnesses, looking at data on astronomical events, checking on the flight paths, seeing if there were aircraft in these areas flying at the time of the sighting...... I have come up against a brick wall. I have not found any rational explanation for what people saw that night. Fireballs for example as far as I know do not make 90 degree turns to another direction. Also seeing that the object was so low, traveling rather slow in many of the reports and not making a sound. This again is certainly strange. Something else I found rather interesting, was the fact that reported sightings had dropped from my area here in the pacific northwest of British Columbia and reports of unusual crafts of every kind were now being seen and reported  by many people residing in the areas from Kamloops, the Okanagan straight through into the Kootenays. Almost every different shape, color and size have been reported to HBCC UFO Research. Did the over 800 forest fires attract visitors from above? I am sure we will never really know the answer to that question..... ?  The beam of white light ended up still being as baffling as the object. When reports started coming in I was sure what everyone was seeing was nothing more than the northern lights. But as the list of witnesses grew, and hearing their comments, I started wondering if there was a connection to these unknowns and the beam of white light. Out of the 126+ witnesses who observed the ray of light running across the night sky from horizon to horizon, only one report was filed saying they believed it to be nothing more than the northern lights. (which I report on below). Everyone else said they have never witnessed anything like in their lives. All said they have watched the northern lights on many occasions, and in their words &#34;this was not the northern lights&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A radio station host put a question on air to the people in the area, asking &#34;has anyone seen strange lights in the night sky?&#34; I was told reports flooded in over this beam of light, and how everyone was left not knowing what it was they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be fair to all sides, I placed below an email I received from a person who did have some knowledge in astronomy, weather phenomena and the northern lights. One thing I would like to point out, is that what the gentleman viewed was not on the day of this major event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The email came from a gentleman who, on the evening of July 26, 2003 and morning of July 27, 2003, stated that a sailing regatta was held by the Kelowna Yacht Club. Although the event discussed in the report above took place in the early morning hours of July 28, 2003, I thought the  report below was important due to how close all of the events were to one another. Plus I want to give both sides on this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Brian Vike Director HBCC UFO Research  Dear Mr. Vike,  Re: July 27, 2003  On the evening of July 26, 2003 and morning of July 27, a sailing regatta was held by the Kelowna Yacht Club.  It was an overnight race north up Okanagan Lake centered on 50 degrees N. Latitude and 121.5 degrees west.  The race commenced near the yacht club and the course was to be north up Okanagan Lake to Whisky Island and then returning to the Kelowna Yacht Club.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The race was attended by perhaps 100 members of the KYC both as participants and safety patrol boats.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was one of the participants in this race in the 25 ft sailboat (name deleted by HBCC UFO Research) along with 2 other crew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The race continued for the entire night of the 26th and almost all of the boats were back into the Kelowna Yacht Club by 10 am of the morning of the 27 of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky conditions for the night was perfectly clear and very calm without interference from the light of the moon or city lights.  After dusk a typical number of earth-orbiting satellites were observed.  Around 11:30 pm the first appearances of typical shifty northern lights were visible to the north and north-west and continued to be visible on and off until early morning light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the peak of the night&#39;s darkness, a stable and continuous band of light was present overhead from horizon to horizon in the East/West direction. I  estimate the apparent width of the band of light to be about 10 degrees at the azimuth. No indication of colour was observed in this band, nor did I observe any detail or shadowing effects. This band of light was, however, unusual in it&#39;s stability of form and linearity of line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this long and slow sailing event, some of the participants commented to me on the display of northern lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing that I observed that evening could be attributed to paranormal activity.   The display of light was interesting but certainly not out of the ordinary compared to many other displays that I have observed in my interest of amateur astronomy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note, one of my duties was a weather observer/recorder in the Canadian arctic while on station on the Distant Early Warning Line in 1967 and 1968 and was privileged to observe many spectacular light shows at that time.  I am convinced that we observed nothing more or less than the Aurora Borealis and a few earth-bound satellites that night and I hope that my observations might shed some light on the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind regards, (Senders name and boat name deleted by HBCC UFO Research).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What folks saw in the early morning hours on July 28, 2003 has left myself and a lot of other people in the UFO field without any solid answers to all of the questions. The one thing I know is that there was an event which took place that left so many residents and myself baffled. It would be nice to be able to supply answers for these mysteries, but all I am left with at this point is another unexplained case!  Also keep in mind that three days later two woman had a missing time experience in Kelowna, British Columbia and the green lights seen on this night were witnessed by others at different locations which backed up their incredible story. Their story can be read at: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/kelowna_missing_time.htm And please .. if you have any similar story to report.... regarding any missing time experience you may have encountered... I&#39;d love to hear from you.  Relevant contact numbers and information can be found at the end of this page.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to thank everyone who took the time to write or pick up the telephone to make a call reporting what it was they saw. All of this data is very helpful. I also would like to express my many thanks to the newspapers who ran an article on this event. The information provided readers with the relevant phone number, email address, fax number  etc.. and toll free number so that more of you hopefully will also make a report on anything strange you may have witnessed happening in the skies above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the day, there are more questions and answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time allows, I will be posting all of the reports I received over this case to my website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take good care.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

It seemed to skirt the horizon above me, but also seemed to hang low...however, it was hard to distinguish the distance/height of it, it was just so big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kind of shook my head and squinted my eyes to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things, because it was completely out of place/abnormal. I thought at first it was a cloud, illuminated by the moon, but there was no moon visible, and it was not a typical, random cloud-shape. My second thought was northern lights, but it clearly wasn&#39;t them, either, as it did not move, change shape, or have any colour to it, aside from a while glow, which seemed to actually give off a good amount of light, similar to a full moon. It was shaped like a tube, perfectly smooth and round with well defined edges, but no real substance (I briefly wondered if it was some sort of UFO, but the lack of substance to it convinced me it was not).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps, I can&#39;t think of anything more to add, but will update you if I do.

The trees in the garden restrict the observable altitudes to about 70 degrees. The sky was clear. Just when the ISS emerged from the west over the trees, we spotted a very bright white light moving in from the south at about the same speed as the ISS but with slightly higher magnitude. It looked as if it was cruising very high in the sky and there was no sound. This second “satellite” moved steadily for about 10 seconds along its path perpendicular to that of the ISS, and then suddenly started to fade. Within a few seconds its magnitude fell (in an orderly fashion) from brighter than the ISS to zero without changing direction. It had vanished before its path crossed that of the ISS, which remained visible until disappearing in eastern direction behind the trees at the other side of the garden. According to the “heavens-above” website there were no other satellite passes or iridium flares that could have explained this observation, neither was it an aeroplane. In view of the light intensity involved and provided that the respective heights match, the ISS crew may have observed the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have inquired of the witness whether he thinks the second light might have been a tumbling rocket shell (&#34;ullage&#34;) in orbit.  We are awaiting a response.  PD))<n>

I said no, as I had not received anything at this time. The fellow who made the report is very credible and also is a good friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman was sitting outside on his porch last night at 11:30 p.m. (July 27, 2003), he said there was not a cloud in the sky, no moon and a sky filled with stars. He told me he looked towards the east and then looked towards the west scanning the night sky. As he looked straight down his driveway, which he is then facing west, 10 degrees above the tree-line the witness spotted a great big bright white light moving very slowly in a northerly direction and was observed for approx: 3 seconds. He said the light was at least 3 times brighter than the planet Venus. He also said it looked as if the light just faded out, just as if you were watching a light bulb slowly going off. As the witness noted, it wasn&#39;t a star or planet. No tail was observed coming off the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing this report with NUFORC.

At about 22:50(Polish Time), my sister saw a light on West and told me that. It was really strange, red light.There weren`t much stars on the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was lower than stars. It was moving very slowly (slower than planes) to the South-West direction and stopped sometimes. Suddenly it dissapeared and turn up back, but now it was very weak yellow light.In 20 seconds it changed to very strong and quite yellow circle light. After about 1 hour I called my friend.He saw the same light from his house. Suddenly near that light flight very,very fast other circle light (similar to comet) but turning 3 times.It was very strange.It made shape on the sky like thunder but it wasn`t thunder for sure.It was yellow light moving very fast.After that we saw 2 others red lights. They were smaller and red. They were moving very fast around themselves, and made shape similar to number &#34;8&#34;. Sometimes they were moving away but returned after a few seconds.We obesrved that objects for about 5 hours( 3 hours non stop).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There aren`t any military buildings and objects nearby. In our opinion it couldn`t have been plane(to strong light and moving too slowly),comet,or ballon.

Only one is sure it was very exciting<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain about the town in Poland in which the alleged sighting occurred.

The passenger planes are Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific. Suddenly a saucer type of flying object appear in the sky and seems following the path of two airplane. I observed the flying object for 30 sec using my binacular in the direction to the north. My estimate the altitude of the obeject is the same height of the airplane before landing about 7500 ft.

7/27/03 11:00|Richland (Tri-Cities)|WA|Circle|20 min|Twenty minute observation of a silver and black disk performing "hawk-like" maneuvers.|8/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30470.html|67|ndxe200307| Twenty minute observation of a silver and black disk performing &#34;hawk-like&#34; maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THIS IS AN UPDATE TO CORRECT SPELLING...<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a spectator at the annual hydroplane races, several &#34;airshow&#34; performances were offered for Saturday and Sunday, July 27th and 28th.  On Sunday the 28th, at 11am a pair of &#34;trainer&#34; jets had just finished their demonstration and flew off to the West up-river and over Richland, WA.  I followed them with my binoculars (Pentax 8x42s) thinking that they may turn and make another &#34;run&#34; for the spectators.  They didn&#39;t.  Instead they turned &#34;south&#34; as if heading toward Oregon.  They were in level flight and apparently taking a direct route to wherever their destination was.  As I followed them in my binocs, a black shape passed through my field of view from south to north.  For a moment I thought it was a large bird, so I stopped tracking the jets and turned back to the object.  It couldn&#39;t have taken more than one or two seconds, at most, to find the object.  However, it had turned from black to a silver color, no black was visible.  The object maneuvered in a manner I have described as a &#34;hawk&#34; scanning a field looking for prey.  The hawk will glide and turn, tipping its wings such that the observer can see the back (topside) of the hawk for a moment, then turn the other way and expose the underside of the bird.  This was very similiar to the movements of this flying machine.  As I steadied my binocs as much as possible, I could make out more and more detail.  The object was a very distinct disk.  There were no &#34;bat-wing&#34;, &#34;delta-wing&#34; contours.  In fact it appeared to be a &#34;classic&#34; flying saucer shape.  That notwithstanding, I continued to observe.  When the bottom side was turned towards me, I could see that the disk was perfectly round and perfectly black with a very thin ring of silver or white around the edge of the disk.  The blackness of the bottom obscured whatever details might have been present (other than the &#34;ring&#34;).  When the disk turned on edge I could see the craft had some thickness.  And as it continued to rotate to the topside I could see a distinct transition from the edge to a raised ! middle section and a &#34;cockpit&#34; in the center of the disk.  The cockpit appeared to be of a &#34;teardrop&#34; shape - not symmetrically round as the rest of the craft appeared to be.  The &#34;pointed&#34; portion of the cockpit appeared to be the &#34;front&#34;, but that was more of an impression than anything else.  As the craft continued to maneuver, with the view transitioning from black to silver and back again, it generally drifted in an easterly direction.  When I first spotted the craft, I estimated it at about 240 degrees azimuth and maybe 25-30 degrees elevation.  By the time I lost sight of it, it was probably at about 210-220 degrees and maybe 30-35 degrees elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first spotted the craft, I immediately thought that it was part of the airshow and was &#34;waiting&#34; off in the distance for its turn for a demonstration.  The pilot of the craft looked as though he was having &#34;fun&#34;.  Lazily sliding and gliding up and down an imaginary slope of some kind just enjoying the ride.  But as time wore on, I began to think it might have been some kind of super-secret military prototype that the pilot was putting through its paces - sort of just practicing.  Further, since I had no frame of reference from which to judge the crafts dimension, I could not absolutely determine its distance from my observation point.  The two other witnesses sitting near me looked at the craft both with the naked eye and with my binocs.  It was difficult to see the craft with the naked eye because of what appeared to be its great distance.  One witness after looking through the binocs and then observing directly commented - &#34;...man, that thing is really up there...&#34;.  Oserving with the naked eye was difficult.  The observer had to know &#34;where-to-look&#34;, but when we looked at the right spot, the black disk was easily discernable and the silver side would flash brightly when the sun hit it at the right angle.  It was an altogether amazing experience, and an amazing object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, after observing for so long, I began to feel fatigued, and put my binocs down to see if I could arrange a more comfortable and steady rest from which to observe.  I may have spent 5 minutes re-arranging things and when I returned to observe, the object was gone.  As I thought about what I had seen I tried to imagine the possibilities.  First, it could have been a UFO, I guess - whatever that actually means.  Secondly, I think the most likely explanation is a secret military plane of some kind.  And finally, I have to admit that it could have been some kind of a &#34;model&#34; or ballon - perhaps a hovercraft of some kind that could maneuver as it did.  The only thing that makes me hesitate to believe this possibility is that it appeared to be incredibly high for a model and it stayed in position for a very long time.  Also from my position and given the size of the Columbia river, the model would have to have been at least three miles away.  That seems very far to have been able to see what might be a 2-3 foot diameter model disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptional witness.  He was very objective about the sighting he reports above, and he has considerable training and experience as an engineer.  He was totally flabbergasted by the sighting, he reported to us.  We have encouraged him to try to locate other witnesses in the area.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness later corrected the date to July 27th.  We have amended the date above.  PD))<n>

We had just passed the Nebraska/Kansas line and were a mile or two north of Marysville Kansas. (1/2 mile north of a railroad crossing). I was driving the car and everyone was awake. My wife was in the front passenger seat. My three kids were in the back seat. One of my kids said, &#34;What is that?&#34; I had seen the object but it had not registered in my mind as anything but an airport beacon. Every one in the car became aware of the object and saw it pass the car. The first thing we saw was a very bright blue/white flash south south east of the car (We were traveling south at about 65 miles per hour). In an incomprehensibly short amount of time (1-3 seconds, I would lean toward 1 second) it passed the car flashing 3-4 times. The object disapeared north north east of the car behind us. The first flash seemed to be the brightest and the last the dimmest. I had to snap my head over my left shoulder to see the 3rd of the 3 flashes that I saw. I thought it was an airport beacon but I realized that it passed way too fast for it to be a stationary object. We watched road reflectors pass the car and estimated that the object passed the car at least 5 times as fast as one of those and they are only on the edge of the road. This happened so fast that we could not tell how far away the object was. It was above the horizon but when we went back through the same area a week later we figured it must have been just above the tree line (perhaps 35-40 degrees above level ground). This still does not indicate the actual distance to the object. It has occured to me that the object could be one of those lights associated with earthquake activety but beyond that it was quite beyond my explaination. Fort Riley is just south of Marysville but a military aircraft would have had to be very close to pass us that fast and we did not hear anything. I am a teacher and I practice guarded skepticism abo! ut this matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  It is interesting to compare this report with that from<n>

I was about 4 miles from the Gulf of Mexico in the center of Pinellas County.  I saw it fall at a high rate and slowing towards the ground.  It turned from a bright white color to a blue then greenish color before disappearing on the horizon.  I thought it was a meteor which landed in a sub-division about a 1/2 mile ahead since it was so large (as it appeared to the eye).  After driving in the subdivision for 10 minutes, I decided to call a friend who drives a taxi on the beach and see if he heard or saw anything.  Sure enough, he saw the same thing.  We were both kind of embarrased to call anyone since it would of course sound like we were on drugs or something so when I called him and told him that I saw something he would not believe, he told me what he saw... it was the same thing!  He was less than 1000&#39; from the gulf coastline and saw it over the water so I knew it was larger and landed or went much further west than I thought.  I met up with him and we went to a local pier (Reddington Pier) and asked the gentleman who was tending if he saw anything.  He told us he was fishing and saw the same exact thing and pointed to the general direction it went.  There were also 2 boats there and he said they were not there prior to the incident.  The boats had pretty bright lights on board and were at least a few miles out.  The gentleman had stated that he, like us, had lived in the area for his entire life and never saw anything like it.  I then got a call from a friend who was with me about an hour prior and told him what I was doing, and coincidentally he saw the exact same thing.  He was at least 7-10 miles northeast of my location when I saw the object.  There is no doubt in my mind something landed in the water or fell/flew very fast towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Follow-up correspondence from a person in Florida who read this report.

No sir, you are not nuts, and I guess I&#39;m not either, should this be the only consideration. Aproximately 9 years ago, my wife and I were driving on Coquina Key  late at night when I saw, seemingly just beyond the skyway bridge, to the SW, a very bright green &#34;meteor&#34; head apparently into the gulf. I remember thinking it might be a flare, due to the odd colour and the startling brightness,... but I considered the speed, (meteoric), the size, even if it was nearer than I suspected which is unlikely, and concluded that it was indeed some extraordinary low atmosphere event. It happened so quickly that my wife missed it, much to my consternation.&#34;<n>

7/27/03 03:30|Mission Viejo|CA|||Extremely fast moving craft lights up as it shoots over Southern CA coastline|8/1/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30383.html|73|ndxe200307| Extremely fast moving craft lights up as it shoots over Southern CA coastline<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend ((name deleted)) and I decided to go to Strands beach last night(this morning) around 3:30am.  Knowing the location and the time of night we were probably the only people on the beach for many miles in either direction.  My friend and I were sitting on rocks smoking a cigar that lit up our position on the black stretch of beach, watching the sky, and talking.  No more than 5-10 minutes after we got to the beach did we start seeing stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is probably important to mention when we pulled up to the parking lot behind the beach the radio station we were listening to, 93.1... a very large Southern California radio station with a powerfull signal located close to where I live and really never prone to static or disturbance, cut out completely making very strange non-static disturbance sounds that resembled strange and loud medium pitched humming for about 5 seconds two seperate times as we were driving through the parking lot.  The radio station hadnt cut out once the entire time until we got there and the extended and very strange sounding 5 second periods where the radio cut out COMPLETELY and abruptly stuck in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I would like to mention less than 1 minute before we actually saw craft shooting across the sky something happened to me, physically. Im standing up enjoying the ambience of the waves and the night when I exhaled and attempted to inhale .. all of a sudden out of the blue I couldn&#39;t breath or inhale a single breath. It was like somebody disabled the use of my lungs or shrunk them to 1/10th the size for 5-6 seconds, a truly frightening and startling experience ive never had once in my life.  I have no asthma nor any in my family and I&#39;ve never had even the slightest shortness of breath or problem breathing, let alone the complete inablilty to expand my lungs and breath for atleast 5 seconds.  During the 5 seconds i just stood there trying very hard to breath thinking both my lungs have somehow collapsed and contemplating how long i should wait to tell my friends im sufficating.  I&#39;ve been reading alot of ufo reports since trying to find somebody else who had a similair experience and so far haven&#39;t found anything so I dont know if it really does have anything to do with what we saw but it&#39;s timing was VERY strange... not to mention I have never had anything REMOTELY like that happen once in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than a minute after i had my strange chest episode my friend and I both spotted the craft simultaneously as it streaked southward across the sky, stopped in front of us, and back.   It came in what seemed like 200-300 yards off the coastline at medium-low altitude from the North at speeds that made the fastest shooting stars we saw that night seemed half as slow.  It traversed half the sky in a small fraction of the second and stopped INSTANTLY directly in front of where were on the coast a few hundred yards out.  The most incredible thing to me was the speed, what seemed like 10,000mph... much faster than most video cameras would even be able capture.  It hung around for maybe a second then shot back North up the coast in what seemed like the exact trajectory it came in on, parrallel to the horizon, not to mention it accelerated instantly from where it had stopped and shot accross half the sky in a small fraction of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 15 minutes we see what we figure is the same craft making guest appearances in other parts of the sky North of us, where it first came from, flying horizontally here and there back and forth up the coast line to the right of us.  I might mention that the craft we saw had no lights on it and was black against the sky when it briefly stopped out in front of us and we would never have been able to point it out stopped in the sky if we hadn&#39;t seen its trajectory coming from the North. In fact aside from stopping out in front of us we only were able to see it when it shot across the sky at mindblowing speed and lit up.   The second it would stop the light around it would disapear and unless you had it outlined against a lighter part of the dark sky that night you never would of seen it stopped.  It seemed to move so incredibly fast it was making the air around it glow giving the entire object a dull glow slightly brighter than the stars around it and easy to spot if you&#39;re watching the sky the fraction of a second it takes for it to shoot across it.  We stuck around for about 30 minutes afterwards watching the sky and saw the craft two more times to the North of us light up as it shot around making brief one directional and less dramatic appearances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My radio was perfectly fine on the way home at about 4:35am and I haven&#39;t heard that kind of disturbance before or since.  When i am able to i am actually planning on going back to the beach with a friend and a camcorder in the early hours of the morning again to see if i can capture what we saw last time.<n>

She went on to say that her and her family had drove to Cranbrook, B.C. to attend a family members wedding on July 26, 2003. While they were in Cranbrook they stayed at a friends home which was approx; 15 kilometers west of Cranbrook. The next day after the wedding a group of people were in the back yard talking, etc.. and one person pointed out something kind of strange. They all looked off into the distance and saw something very bright and silver/white in color. The witness told me the area where the object was spotted is covered in trees and the light was sitting amongst the mountains. She also told me it was west of the friends home and it was sitting very low, actually the light was sitting in a depression on one of the local mountains. Everyone who watched the light commented on how strange it looked and it wasn&#39;t long afterwards that the light disappeared. The witness guessed it may have been stationary for only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

She went on to say she had a very strange experience and saw something she could not explain. They have a large deck which faces south. Due to her having some trouble sleeping the lady awoke and around 2:00 a.m. and wondered around her deck looking up at the starry night sky. As she faced the south and looked up over a valley just west of town she spotted something very large. From her advantage point it looked about cup size. The witness said the object looked like a disc, or wheel shaped standing on it&#39;s edge. She also added it looked as if the object was cut into six section. Just like as if you were to cut 6 or 8 pieces of pie (6 or 8 triangular shaped pieces).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lights running around the object, all white in color. The lady also said there were a good number of lights on it, but was not sure just how many there were. She also believes the lights were moving around the object. There was no sound heard coming from the unknown and her thoughts were whatever it was, was not all that far away from their property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object sat stationary, it did not move. Using some of the structures on their deck to keep track of the object,  she eventually said it started moving but very slowly, but faster than any of the nighttime stars, etc.. After a period of time, the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

The witness reported to me that she was in bed, and couldn&#39;t sleep due to the warm temperatures outside. Her bedroom blinds were up and the window fully open and then she gave out a cry, &#34;holy cow&#34;. Their home is up on a large hill which gives them a very good view of the surrounding area. The witness suddenly noticed, what she thought was a bright star or maybe an airplane coming in with it&#39;s landing lights on because it was moving at this point. The lady mentioned that it was extremely large in size and flying very low. Actually the witness just laid their waiting to see a green and red light, thinking it was certainly an aircraft coming down the St. Mary&#39;s Valley heading in to land at the near-by airport. She told me that the airplanes take the route down the St. Mary&#39;s Valley when heading to Vancouver and back to Kimberly B.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady still laying there and watching the bright white light moving faster as it grew closer. All of a sudden it started maneuvering in a zig zag pattern. At this point in the sighting, where she could not see it anymore she jumped out of bed and headed toward her bedroom door, opened it and ran through her cottage styled home until she reached her front door of her home. The time she unlocked her front door and stepped outside the light was gone. I mentioned to this witness after taking her report about the 8 witnesses who saw a ray of light over the Jaffray, B.C. area which I reported on. She told me the light/object was traveling southeast from Kimberly, B.C. and would have flown straight over Jaffray, B.C. (HBCC UFO Note: What makes this interesting is that we are finding more witnesses to the sighting which was originally reported to Peter Davenport at the NUFORC. Plus other people who witnessed the ray of light and the object itself. From what I am gathering is that the light/object may have caused the ray of light. But of course this is a guess on my behalf. I was also contacted by a very kind person today who read my report and told me of another witness who had made a posting at a UFO forum board and explained to everyone about this ray of light, same location, different witness. This lady also took pictures of the light ray and I am now trying to track her down so I can give her a phone call to gather more information on this whole event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to this witness for her report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for following up on the events in the Kimberly area.

It did not leave any trail but was moving at a very high speed.  The bright light then suddenly disappeared but did so before getting anywhere near the earth.  There were no clouds near the object in the sky so the light was clearly visible.

I noticed a bright light in the sky almost directly over head.  It seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern, sometimes drifting in a circular fashion and other times it would jump from one place to another.  The light changed color several times and at one point looked as though it split in two.  Also, at one point we all observed a bright green flash next to but not coming directly from the light. There were stars visible though the clouds behind the light and they stayed still as this object danced around. We watched it for about a half an hour and finally went back into the house.  I went out sometime later but by then a thin layer of clouds had moved in and I could not find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the first possibility to be ruled out would be a celestial body, either a star or planet.  However, we are not aware of any exceptionally bright star in the July night sky, that would be directly overhead at that hour.  We will try to check a star chart.  PD))<n>

He was looking out the window over the sink.  For a moment we got quiet and I noticed my husband was in sort of a gaze.  The next second he said he had just seen a UFO.  I was critical and asked him what exactly he meant by that remark.  He had said he saw a light the size of a softball about hundred feet over the top of the neighbors house, hovering.  He then said it came towards our house in (specifically near our daughters deck which is on the third floor), stopped and then shot up in the sky and disappeared.  I asked him why he didn&#39;t say anything at the time and he replied because it was so beautiful he couldn&#39;t say anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier in the week, we were driving down the street we live on and he said I nearly ran over a deep purple light hovering on the road in front of us.

On Saturday night, July 26th, at approximately 10:55 PM, I was sitting on the outdoor patio of the 4th floor of the Crescent Hotel. It was a beautiful, clear night and I was looking up at the stars. I noticed a barely discernible white light moving in a northwesterly direction at a speed and altitude that seemed consistent with commercial air traffic at cruising altitude (30,000 to 40,000 ft). The light was fairly close to being directly overhead, at about 85 degrees above the horizon. I watched this light fly a straight line course for about five to ten seconds when, to my surprise, it suddenly increased in size and brightness. It went from being a pinpoint of light to being about the size of a match head held at arm&#39;s length. It also went from being a very faint light to being the brightest thing in the sky. The light became so brilliant that it almost looked silvery. It reminded me of a brilliant diamond. At about this time the object slowed to almost a standstill and rapidly faded from view. The impression I got was that it had shot off into space at a steep angle and at a high rate of speed. This would account for its apparent decrease in forward motion and the rapidity at which it faded from view. The total duration of the sighting was about 15 seconds. I am very knowledgeable in regards to aviation and astronomy and can not think of any prosaic explanation that would account for this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this former SSD/MUFON for sharing the report with NUFORC.

It transversed the horizon in about app. 2-1/2 minutes. Time enough for me to run into my apartment and grab my binoculars. It proceeded in a west to east trajectory very smoothly.

At first I thought it was a hot air balloon that was just dark in color and we couldn&#39;t see the balloon because of the night sky.  But the &#34;flame&#34; didn&#39;t flicker like a flame at all, and was a bright brilliant gold color.  Further diminishing the hot air balloon theory ... the object went from moving rather slowly, it started to seemingly gather a lot of speed and altitude.  Not fast, slower than say a jet aircraft -- but certainly what seemed too fast for any type of ballon depending on wind. And the altitude was certainly way too high for a balloon.  Eventually it continued on it is &#34;up-and-out&#34; pattern and eventually became too small to see.  This event was witnessed by probably 12 people-- all of which were at a loss to explain what it was.  By the time someone got binoculars it was too high and/or far to make out any detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were out early heading for a day on the beach, it was clear and I was just looking out the window at the stars. I noticed what at first glance I took to be just a commercial airliner at normal cruising altitude, not paying much attention to it. On giving it a second look there were no strobes and no navigation lights (red or green), what I observed was an irregular oval cluster of six white lights with one white light somewhat trailing the rest and off to one side. The cluster was moving to the west more or less as could be seen as it passed by known stars. The lights were not overly bright, about the same as what one would observe on a comercial airliner at normal cruising altitude from the ground. I watched for perhaps 30 seconds and one by one the lights went out all most at the same time. I don&#39;t have a clue as to what I saw , but I have lived in the country all my life and see aircraft at night on a regular basis(We live on the approaches to Dulles and BWI airports and are not far from the outer markers). Never saw anything like this before. Unfortunately my wife was not able to see as she was driving and this was on my side of the vehicle to the south of us. I wouldn&#39;t have even noticed this had I been driving or not just looking up at the time I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He&#39;s 11 and I&#39;m 20.  He likes to come out at our house, sit on our deck, and stargaze and watch the bats we have in the area.  I like to do the same things, so I always go out there with him.  My mom got up early since she was off of work that night.  She joined us out there for a while, but decided to go in and brush her teeth, so she never saw it.  It was between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. CST when this occurred.  We had seen aircraft flying overhead that night and saw lights that we always dismissed as satellites.  About a minute, or two after my mom went inside I was looking westward in the sky and saw a bright blue light that looked just like a star, but it was moving.  I thought it was just another satellite at the time, but I noticed right away that it looked brighter than the normal satellites we see in the sky.  Most are usually hard to see, but this was clearly visible.  It was going north to south.  I told my nephew to look at it, so we both were watching it.  Then about 10-15 seconds after I first saw it, it turned from blue to a very bright yellow.  That&#39;s when I had my first real doubts about it being just a satellite.  In about 5 seconds period it slowly turned a very bright yellow and then dimmed back down to blue and then continued out of sight past some pine trees.  I say slowly since it was like a dimmer switch being turned on and not like an explosion, or something that happens suddenly.  It flashed a little bit when it turned yellow.  It also doubled in size, or got brighter.  It never stopped on its path, slowed down, or sped up, it just continued on the same path, going to same speed.  It wasn&#39;t going extremely fast, about normal for a satellite, or plane.  It didn’t appear to be a meteor, since it didn&#39;t streak across the sky, leave a trail, or break up.  The light just changed color and got brighter.  There were planes in the area, but it&#39;s normal for this area, but this didn&#39;t act like the lights on a plane.  It ! also made no sound.  My nephew went back in side to get my mom, but it was already gone by the time she got there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a tumbling rocket booster would be the first possibility to be ruled out.  When then catch the light from the Sun just right, they reflect it so that an observer on the ground sees a flare of light as the rocket continues on its way in orbit.  PD))<n>

I thought it may have been a police helecopter at first, but there was no sound and it was static for far too long.  Looking through binoculars, it occasionally hovered from side to side. I could also see what appeared to be a light shining out from each side, but were not as bright as the single light at the front. It did not start to move until lighting up time at approx. 4.48 hours. Even the the sky was lighting up, I could still not detemine the shape - which I thought unusual. It seemed to ascend higher into the sky once the planes started to take off from the local airport. I thought to myself, surely the pilots of the planes must have noticed something or that it would have been picked up on radar. I was particularly intrigued to watch it this time for as long as I could because I witnessed the same thing about a week earlier and dismissed it as being a police helicopter in the distance, even though I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a celestial body may have been the cause of the sighitng.

Two friends were outside sitting around enjoying the night and a cold drink. Both men told me they saw what they thought was a very bright star stationary in the sky. They never gave it a thought so they just sat chatting and scanned the stars. When one of them looked over towards where they spotted the star, it was moving very quickly in their direction. At this point of the sighting, both sat up and took notice and watched as this bright white light got bigger the closer it got to them. A guess by the witness would have placed the light/object approx: 1/4 mile away when it suddenly turned to the south and flew off at an incredible rate of speed. (HBCC UFO Note: When the light/object changed direction the color of it changed from bright white to a dull orange).The men said they may have watched it for approx: 45 seconds at the most. Now looking back at the event, they wishes they had of kept their eyes on it when it was first spotted. But then they did not think much of it at the time. No sound was heard, and like both of them said. If it had of been an aircraft they certainly would have heard it as it being so close, and so low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

But she did yell to her husband and said, look, look, look ! She mentioned the light was approx: the size of her thumb nail as it flew over top a steeple on the building and over top a local mountain. She reports the light as being colored and round in shape. The light was witnessed for approx: 5 seconds falling through the night sky on a slight angle. No sound was heard due to them being in their home, plus HBCC UFO estimates the light was at a great distance away from the witnesses. No aircraft were visible around the area at the time of the sighting. No tail was seen traveling behind the light.

My husband (names deleted by HBCC UFO) and I saw a bright white light in the sky at night, this took place on July 26, 2003 about 12:30 a.m. moving southeast from where it moved from St Mary Lake. That night the couple who saw it when they camped at the lake and reported it, well we saw it too.  It was such a warm night so we went out and had iced tea standing on the deck. We loved to look at the stars at night, about 15 or 20 mins later I first saw it moving. I called (names deleted by HBCC UFO) to look at it. We looked at it to make sure it wasn&#39;t a plane. So we watched it moving southeast until it disappeared. It moved at low altitude, not moving so fast. So we wondered what it was. We watched it for about a minute and a half.

Bynum is a small rural residential road, only about 1 mile long.  We noticed what at first looked like a semi truck facing us on the road near the intersection of Bynum and First Street.  My friend&#39;s house sits about 500 feet from the intersection, left of North Bynum.  Just before we arrived, my friend in the front leaned up and asked, &#34;What is that!?&#34; We all looked and saw at least 4 bright circular lights, which faced South. The object looked like it had a shape like a greyhound bus. The lights had a yellowish tint and were about 20 feet off the ground. I pulled into the yard, our line of sight with the object was obstructed for just moments by a large  line of bushes which sit along the bank of the ditch.  We all walked to the street to see it up close, but the object was gone.  Neither of us heard any sounds. If were the lights were at was in! deed the front, then it would have had to turn around.  The object never passed behind us. In the yard you can see Bynum, first, second, and mattocks streets.  No vehicle traveled down either street. We still talk about that today.  I have always been hesitant to report it, but after watching a few documentaries about the topic, I was compelled.  I often wonder if we were abducted and placed back in the car or yard..<n>

At around 11pm I was talking to her and looking up at the sky when I noticed an orange &#34;blur&#34; racing across the sky. As I fixed my eyes on it, I saw 5 dull orange lights, all spaced the same distance apart, in a line, moving across the sky at an INCREDIBLE speed. I yelled out to my girlfriend, who also managed to see them (describing them to me afterwards). They were all the way across the sky in a matter of seconds. In comparison to planes we hade watched heading over to and from Albany International, these lights seemed to be not too high up.There was no sound. The speed was incredible. If you did not happen to fix your eyes on them, I&#39;m sure you would not even notice them.I ESTIMATE the direction was east, following the line of Route 7 and other roads that head over to the Latham (North of Albany) area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Puget Sound)on my boat. I was star gazing. Saw one good Meteor and one Satellite. Night before, I was sitting with friends on the west shore of the inlet and we saw 12 satellites in about 90 minutes. Have seen many over the years, but the object I saw at 10:41 PM was much brighter than any satellite I have ever seen. It was brighter than any of the stars visible to me (perhaps 3X). It was traveling in a straight NE direction. There were a few high clouds, and the object (light) was higher than the clouds, but either it was the intensity of the light or it just wasn&#39;t as high as what I would expect a satellite to be which really makes me wonder what it was. I first saw the object about half way across the sky. It was ahead of me about, and 65 degrees above the NW horizon. What made this different than an ordinary satellite was its brightness and the speed of its traverse (faster 2X), but also that I was able to view as it went well towards the NE horizon (15 degrees) with little change in the intensity of the light. There might have been a slight tail to the object when I first spotted it, but it was passing behind the high clouds, but was still visible, hence that might have given me the impression it had a short tail. The event lasted long enough for me to look at my cell phone to check the time and ponder who I could call to see if they could see it. I would say close to 2 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear. Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> RE: Shelton siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your reply. After reviewing the ISS tracking plots I am left doubting that what I saw was the ISS. The reason for this is that the track of the object was towards the NE and not the SE as would be indicated by the web site you sent the link for. The other issue was the fact the object remained lighted (reflecting?) well towards the horizon to the NE. The ISS website indicates that the ISS would not be lighted as it passed that far to the NE at the time of night (infact it indicates that the ISS would not be lit as it passed over the coast line of N. America. Perhaps you might get another inquiry about this. Just wanted to let you know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are still exploring the possibility that the sighting might have been caused by the ISS.

It was sort of a football shape - it seemed to be glowing a kind of whitish yellow.  It had blinking white lights on the top and one on each side.  The bottom had a blinking red light.  It looked to have a row of black shapes (or windows) circling toward the top just under what appeared to be a dome.  The object seemed to be changing shape as it moved back and forth.  The witnesses were me,  my mother, and an older husband and wife whose names I neglected to write down. They were curious and intrigued with what I was video taping (and proceeded to tell me of their own UFO sighting.)  An official looking woman came over - asked me what I was doing in a authoritative manner and then told me I wasn&#39;t allowed to video tape on the dock. I kept filming.  Incidently, we were attending a summer band concert at Sunset Park in Port Washington, Long Island.  I want to mention when I first saw the object it was nothing but a faint glow in the distance.

She gave out a yell and pointed into the sky. This is when a total of 6 people saw the unusual object. But by the time everyone else was observing the it, it had already broke (separated) into two sections. Both section after the break up were the exact same size. (I asked if there was any type of explosion which may have caused the object to break into the two section, and the witness said no. The single object basically spit into two parts).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it broke up, the folks said the &#34;objects&#34; went in separate directions, one heading north and the other south. The fellow I chatted with said the craft was sitting at approx: 30,000 to 40,000 feet at his best guess. Also they noted after the craft separated, and holding their hand up to get a rough idea how close the two section were to one another at the height they were at, they guessed them to be approx: one inch a part. The witness also noted that the two parts did not pass one another (stayed close to one another), but did slowly drift a part going in different directions until they lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He mentioned that it was like looking at the chrome bumper of a car with the sun reflecting off it. The brightness to the objects were extremely bright. There was no sound detected, no contrail from any of the them. He also gave a approx: size each of the objects may have been. He estimated they might have been 1/4 inch in length, this using your finger nail at arms length. (Note: If the estimated size is even close, the objects must have been enormous in size).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting lasted for approx: 4 to 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still hoping the other witnesses will call.

I dont know what I saw! at first I thought it was a baloon but it changed postions between flashes and ballons cant do that!!! I do not wish to be contacted. I only hope others saw what I saw<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  In cases of flashing or strobing lights, we first suspect tumbling rocket bodies, orbiting in space.  However, they do not reverse their course.  We do no know what the witness observed.  PD))<n>

My husband was working nightshift.  I was alone.  Mars was close so I turned out the lights and pulled my shades open.  At first I thought I saw a plane.  I live in the cascades area of Renton and this plane, oddly was hovering over the Fairwood area of Renton for about twenty minutes.  I realized this was way too big and too low to be a plane, or helicopter.  It looked how a streetlight would but about 5,000 times bigger.  Streetlights aren&#39;t that high.  Planes aren&#39;t this low.  Helicopters hover, it was too big to be a helicopter.  So, I watched it for twenty minutes.  My jaw was open, mezmerized.  Realized I had no clue what was gong on.  I put the covers over my head.  I was really scared all of a sudden.  I called my husband.  The phone conversation lasted five minutes.  I got off the phone, peeked my head out of the covers and it was totally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noted it was shimmering like streetlights can shimmer.  This &#34;U.F.O.&#34; looked like it was over the big road Petrovitsky, in Renton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object would have been in the direction of Maple Valley.  I have never seen anything so big in the sky and hovering at the same time.  I also feel someone else must have seen it.  This &#34;Thing&#34; was not hiding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object did not seem to be interested in the planes but did stop a short distance from the flight paths and remained stationary for a mintute....then staying in the same stopped position began to get smaller and smaller and smaller until it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We at first suspected a possible overflight of the ISS, but it was not visible from Florida on this date.

Upon returning to bed I was facing towards our bedroom window and noticed something that was very dark against a dark sky.  There were no lights on it at all.  I thought it was a cloud but when I laid down in bed, I noticed it had a triangular shape and was moving towards the west.  I watched it go and then looked at the clock to see the numbers turn to 3:33.  Weird coincidence, I thought, looked back out the window and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I&#39;m not really sure if it was triangular because we have a dormer window with a triangular section above the rectangular window.  It could have been the window&#39;s shape influencing my perception and/or mind.

We live alongside the Skeena River which runs through Terrace, British Columbia. Our home is located high up on Mount (deleted by HBCC UFO), from here we have an excellent view of the surrounding area. We sometimes turn the lights off and just sit around with a coffee looking at what is going on below us. As we watched the traffic traveling along highway #16, entering the town of Terrace. (Terrace/Kitimat Junction), we saw a large glowing/oblong shaped object moving slowly along side highway #16 heading north. We thought at first it may have been a aircraft as the object paced some of the vehicles on the road. But then realized that whatever it was had to be way to low for any plane to fly at night in this area. Eventually the object made a sudden move, or jerked across the highway to the opposite side and came to a stop. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked the witness what he meant by the object jerked. He told me it looked as if it would either stop for a split second, then start moving again, or as it moved a head it would side back just a bit from where it was coming from and then travel a head).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the witnesses watched it sitting in a stationary position on the west side of the highway, he said it looked like it gained a little altitude and then short off towards the west at an incredible rate of speed. Matter of fact the fellow who watched this take place said, &#34;if you were watching close when it sped off, you would have missed it due to how fast it was traveling&#34;. The witness guessed the two of them watched the object for approx: a minute before losing sight of it completely. He went on to tell me that this was not the first time he had saw something rather strange over the Terrace area. Last year (2002) his children dropped by for a visit, and one of the kids grown and now married, gave out a yell and all of them watched a huge glowing/golden colored &#34;thing&#34; moving over the town of Terrace. He said it moved fairly quick, but again stressed that whatever it was, was enormous. He had read articles on myself (HBCC UFO) in the Terrace Standard newspaper last year, but felt funny about coming forward to tell the story. But this year he said, I had to talk to someone over what we both saw, as it was just so strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Witness personal information deleted by HBCC UFO).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing this report with NUFORC.

The husband and wife had just got back from their son&#39;s ball game, his son had caught a ride home with his friends. When the couple arrived home and were going about their business, they noticed none of the telephones were working in the house. The fellow wanted to contact the phone company, but of course couldn&#39;t. He wondered if the phone in the barn might be working so he headed outside and was on his way to the barn, looking up through the Pine trees and across the highway when he saw an extremely bright white light. The witness said it was so bright that he could not even look at it without placing his hand up in front of him. At the point where he first noticed it, the light was approx: a kilometer away coming from the west and his neighbors farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness mentioned to me that after he first spotted it the first thing that popped into his head was &#34;camera&#34;. Although due to being fascinated with the object he soon forgot about the camera. He ran back up from the barn area and banged on his home&#39;s door to catch his wife&#39;s attention. When she ask what was going on, he said to her, &#39;you have to come out and see this&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He explained that he is not a man who gets rattled very easy, but what he had witnessed did shake it up a lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object came up close to his property it was not traveling very fast at all and had four bright white lights at the front of it and one red light in the middle, or center of the craft. He also said as bright as the lights were, they did not illuminate any of the surrounding area. He and his wife both thought it looked like a boomerang in shape. Also the fellow said it looked as if something was sticking out of the front of it. As the object left their property moving into the distance they lost sighting of the bright lights, but they did say the lights which were at the front of the craft were still lighting up the front end of it. (HBCC UFO Note: The witness said when he first saw it he thought it was landing lights on a large jet aircraft. He also wondered if it was going to crash due to it being at such a low altitude and no airport close by). There was also sound heard coming from the object. A very low rumbling sound to it, like a throbbing sound. As he pointed out, that if it was a normal aircraft and being as low as it was. The sound would have knocked his socks off due to it being very loud. But it wasn&#39;t like this at all. The object itself was dark or blackish in color. The fellow gave a &#34;guess&#34; at what the size may have been, using his home as reference of 74 feet long. He figured the distance between the first light to the second may have been roughly 70 feet in distance. So between the first light and the last the approx: distance would have been just over 200 feet. This would have been how wide the object was, or appeared to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully the other witnesses across the lake will talk with me over what they saw, which was the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light, thru the binoculars which appeared to be a pin prick, turned around so a red light of sorts showed, then it just faded &#39;off&#39;.  There are/were no clouds over the mtn, and from our view point, it hovered, without moving for some time, up over the towers. It periodically faded out then would reappear not too far from the last spote we saw it.  It climbed higher and just to the right of where we saw it.  It appears perfectly round in our binoculars then a red light will spin every so often. It also appears to have something (light) come out of the top and/or bottom or both at the same time.  I tried to take some pictures and don&#39;t know if it will come out. But it just hovered and would get brighter then fade out for approximately 7 minutes at the longest before disappearing completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a celestial body would be the first possibility to be ruled out, but that is only a guess.

I had stopped to watch a black bear at a rail crossing after sitting for while i noticed a silver object over the tree tops about 2km down the rail line. At first i passed it off as a star and continued to look for any more wildlife that may come out on the tracks in a different direction. I looked back in the direction where i saw the object but this time it was in a different place so i decided to pay attention to it. As i watched it it was moving back and forth across the sky and zig-zagging up and down while changing from white to red. It appeared to be getting closer to where i was sitting at the rail crossing. At this point i got a real uneasy feeling and got out of the area as fast as i could. One other thing about the night prior to the sighting was there was alot of wildlife thrasing around in the bush. I have stopped to watch moose and bears there before but that night it was unusually noisy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Chasing a jetliner across the sky from south to north<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside looking at the stars. I saw jets flying over. One jet heading due north. Directly behind it was a very dim light. I would say 2 or 3 miles trailing the jet. If I held both arms up. It was about the distance between my hands. Usually I would right off lights in the sky as satalites or space foder. But This paced the jet perfectly in speed. What ever it was , It was able to block out stars. So it was definately larger than the light that was affixed to the object. I went inside for a while and returned an hour later. I saw another jet fly over. The jet got directly over head and then a streak of light shot in front of it. The jet made no course correction. So, This object was apparently above its position. Or just out or Visual range of the pilots. This jet was also heading north. I will watch the stars tonight. I believe activity is going to increase.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a warm summer night and as we were driving we saw a low light in the sky about 5 miles in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer we kept asking what is that?  It was moving slowly in the direct path of the expressway.  We had the sunroof open on the jeep and looked up as we passed directly under the object.  It was probably 100ft above my vehicle.  It did not make a sound, and was triangular shaped.  We both thought it was probably a stealth but couldn&#39;t imagine it flying that low, or that slow, and why it would be in the area. Growing up in Olean I never saw a single military craft .<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/24/03 21:15|Milton (north of) (Canada)|ON|Unknown|7 minutes|Super bright light moving from west to east, not too high and not too fast.|1/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86773.html|117|ndxe200307| Super bright light moving from west to east, not too high and not too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in a crop formation north of Milton, when all of a sudden I looked up and noticed a super bright light to the north west of my position. The light was circular and moving slowly from west to east. It was difficult to determine distance, height and speed, but it wasn’t really close or too high. I’d guess that it was at least a mile away, probably more, and that the altitude was somewhere around 3,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not distinguish a shape to anything that the light was connected to, nor could I hear any unusual noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was very strange, in that it did not project very far from whatever it was attached to. The only thing that comes to mind is consider the shape of a hockey puck. Stand the puck on its end so that the flat sides are going left to right. Then turn the black rubber into intense white light. This was the shape of the light moving forward. The relationship of the width of the circle to the depth that the light projected was about the same as that of a hockey puck standing on its edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the light was almost due north of my position, it overtook what was obviously a small plane. The small plane had normal lights, and my guess is that it was heading to Brampton Airport. I could be wrong about this, but from my position, that was the direction it was heading in. I would guess the small plane was flying at approx 2000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright light was half again as high as the small plane. This is why I estimate it to be around 3,000 feet.  If the small plane was cruising at 150MPH, the I would estimate that the bright light was doing maybe 160 or 170mph. It wasn’t screaming through the sky, it was taking it’s time. It overtook the small plane and kept on going. The bright light never deviated on its altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the bright light moved more to the east at a certain point I could no longer see the light itself... it was just a glow continuing to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the light was at the far eastern horizon, it was very feint.  It was on a path that took it  north of Pearson International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total length of time the bright light was in view was between 7 and 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is another NUFORC report for this same evening from Kingston, Ontario.  A couple reported a bright light attached to a triangle shaped craft, and there was a strange rumbling sound heard.  Their report was at 11:10pm. Kingston is a 2.5 hour drive from Milton.  I believe that these two reports are talking about the same unusual light and craft, from 2 different vantage points, and 2 different times.<n>

I watched the light move erratically in this way for about three minutes. Occasionally the light would suddenly disappear and then reappear a little further north. Eventually it just disappeared from view.

7/23/03 22:35|Cottage Grove|MN|Changing|approximately 10 minutes|I saw a strange light show over suburban Minnesota|8/1/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30323.html|123|ndxe200307| I saw a strange light show over suburban Minnesota<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside watching the stars, lying on the hood of my dad’s car in the driveway.  I was talking to my friend on the phone at the time.  I saw a satillite traveling Northward across the sky.  Later, I thought I was another satellite.  This observation was reached by the luminousity of the object and it rate and direction of it’s travel.  The object appeared as one bright, white/yellow ball of light.  Having lived under busy commercial air routes for my entire life, and being an amateur aircraft expert, I readily identified the object as not being commercial air traffic.  The object was traveling in an Eastern direction, coming from the West.  Suddenly the object stopped.  It started to move again, but on a different course.  The object was soon almost directly overhead.   As the object was overhead, it rapidly flew in circles, zig-zag patterns, and hovered.  I noticed there was a sort of hazy halo around the light, and that it left a slight hazt trail as it moved.  After a few minutes of said displays, the object started moving rapidly North.  Suddenly reversing directions, the object began traveling Southward.  It was at this time that I noticed the object was not one white light, but three distinct lights composing one object, or very tight formation.  The lights were colored green, red, and white.  These are the colors used on commercial aircraft, but the did not appear in the correct configuration to be such an aircraft.  As the object sped Southward toward the horizen, it stopped briefly.  At this time, the object split into three different white lights in a triangle formation.  As soon as the object had completed this transformation, it disappeared at incredible speed to the Southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A MONTH AGO. MY HUSBAND AND I WERE OUSIDE OF OUR HOME, HE HAPPENED TO LOOK UP AT THE SKY THEN HE SAID TO ME &#34;LOOK AT THAT STAR MOVING.&#34; I LOOKED UP AND SAW THIS THING THAT LOOKED LIKE A STAR WAY WAY UP IN THE SKY. IT WAS TRAVELING TOO FAST AND HIGH TO BE A PLANE. WE DECIDED TO STAY OUT AND WATCH FOR A WHILE. SURE ENOUGH HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE. WE COULDN&#39;T FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WERE AT FIRST THINKING THEY ARE FALLING STARS BUT THE WAY THEY WERE MOVING IMPOSSIBLE. WE THEN SAW A BLUE LIGHT STREAK ACROSS THE SKY AT LIGHTNING SPEED. THEN THE OBJECT IN THE SKY WAS GONE. THEY MOVE SO FAST AND IN ALL DIRECTIONS. WE NOTICED THAT THEY WILL MOVE AROUND AND CHANGE DIRECTIONS. WE HAVE SEEN THEM SWERVE AROUND THE STARS, STOP AND HOVER IN ONE SPOT FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEN MOVE LIGHTNING SPEEDS. ONE NIGHT I WAS WATHCING THE SKY AND SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A STAR, THEN I SAW THIS BRIGHT FLASH THAT FLASHED AT LEAST 5 TIMES THEN THE OBJECT TOOK OFF SO FAST AND DISAPPEARED. WE STARTED TELLING OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHAT WE SEE, AT FIRST THEY THOUGHT WE WERE NUTS. A COUPLE OF WEEKENDS AGO, WE WENT CAMPING IN AN OREGON CAMPGROUND. WE WENT INTO THE CLEARING (SEVEN OF US) AND SAW AT LEAST 5 OR 6 OF THESE THINGS. ALL SEVEN HAD SEEN THEM. THEY NOW ARE CONFUSED AS WE ARE. WE HAVE ALSO TOLD OUR NEIGHBORS AND THEY HAVE HAVE SEEN THEM ALSO. WE HAVE SEEN FALLING STARS BUT, THEY ARE DIFFERENT. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE ACUALLY SEEING IN THE SKY AT NIGHT OVER OREGON. IF THEY COULD BE UFO&#39;S PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I DON&#39;T KNOW ANY CRAFT THAT OUR GOVERMENT HAS THAT CAN MOVE THAT FAST AND AROUND OBJECTS LIKE THESE THING CAN. REMEMBER WE CAN SEE THEM EVERY NIGHT BETWEEN 22:00- 23:00 ONLY IF THE SKY IS CLEAR.<n>

I have been a private pilot for nearly 40 years and have flown over most of the western half of the United States.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 16 year old son was my sole passenger in the right front seat.  We had stopped in Mankato, MN to refuel and have a snack.  Departing Mankato airport approximately 2:15 pm on a heading of 100 degrees, we climbed through a layer of widely scattered cumulus clouds with bases at about 3,500 feet and tops between 4,500 and 5,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We leveled off at 7,500 feet with good visibility and the scattered clouds below us.  About twenty minutes into the flight we were passing through the area north of Austin, MN and south of Rochester, heading toward La Crosse, WI.  Suddenly the my son blurted out &#34;What the hell is that?&#39; as he looked out the window to his right toward the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said &#34;Where?&#34; and he pointed off to the south and somewhat below our altitude.  I spotted an object slightly higher than the level of the cloud bases and 3 to 4 miles off our right wing.  Because of our speed at 170 knots (~195mph) and the intervening scattered clouds I only had a glimpse of 5 seconds or so after I spotted it before it began to be hidden by the passing clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was I was looking at the back end of a blimp or a WWII barrage balloon.  The object was a medium dark grey, oval shaped but a vertical oval.  There were no vertical or horizontal stabilizing fins on it, however it did have two areas on the lower sides of the oval that were slightly bulbous and colored bright orange.  There was no apparent movement, however with our speed it could have been moving slowly and not obvious to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very puzzling since the area is very rural farming country and we were not near any cities or towns.  I thought at first it was a blimp, however a blimp would probably not be traveling within the clouds at nearly 4,000 feet since there was plenty of clear air below.  My next thought was that the object might be an Aerostat balloon the Customs Service uses along the Mexican border to spot incoming drug running aircraft, but this is not near the border and I believe those are typically tethered 10,000 feet above the ground.  The only other thought was a large balloon to provide a high antenna for a radio or TV signal, but here again it was out in the middle of nowhere and was not marked on the flight chart. Since we were trying to get to Oshkosh by 3:30 pm to in order to land prior a flight of over 100 incoming Beech Bonanzas, I did not deviate to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with almost all aircraft and have seen the Goodyear blimp and other advertising blimps many times both from the ground and in the air and this did not appear to be one of those.  On every flight I have to watch for other aircraft and am used to spotting and identifying them as traffic, yet to this day I have no idea what it was my son and I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As you can imagine, the damage done to the city was severe and extensive. At this writing, over a quarter-million homes and businesses are still without power, and there is much wreckage and many damaged buildings throught the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When our power went out, I switched on our battery-operated radio and listened to one of the few stations on the air, a sports-talk call-in show. Of course, no one was talking about sports. People were calling in to tell which streets and highways were blocked by debris, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened for a while then became preoccupied with completing my morning routine without benefit of electricity when I became aware of a caller who was reporting &#34;something strange,&#34; that he&#39;d seen. The caller sounded like a mature man, with a rural accent. He seemed very concerned that no one would believe him. The only description that I caught was that he had spotted one of &#34;them circle-crop things&#34; up in the air,  and he never believed in them before, but he swore he saw it, etc. He sounded completely sincere, and I must add, he was met with a stoney silence by the show&#39;s host, who offered no comment at all. The host and co-host merely chuckled and went on to the next caller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this for a couple of reasons. First of all, Peter has mentioned that sightings are often associated with storms. Secondly, I wonder if anyone else heard this man&#39;s report and could offer more details about what the man said. (It may seem absurd to refer to a UFO as a &#34;circle-crop thing,&#34; but he sounded excited and perhaps even a bit upset by what he&#39;d seen.)  If anyone else heard the report or saw something UFO-related before, during, or after the Memphis storm, I hope they will report it on this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the good work you do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like this *without the periods*  .o o ..o .....o   they were the same orange lights, very distinctive, and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was really orange this time, made no noise whatsoever, and moved STRAIGHT west/north this time, it came from the same direction as the other light, although this one like i said, didnt move other than in a straight line...

Could not see a shape because it was too dark, but it had three bright lights in a triangular shape with red and green smaller strobing lights adjacent to the white lights which would flash about every five seconds. The object dissapeared into the tree line.  I pulled into my driveway and rolled the windows down to hear a motor to see if it was a helicopter, an airplane, or possibly the Goodyear blimp which was in Everett very recently.There was no noise. I pulled in front of my garage and shut the motor off. There was still no noise. The object must have been at low altitude and was moving at slow speed like a blimp or helicoper would. If the object was further away it would have to be very large and the lights very bright. Again no silouete of an object could be seen because of the dark sky and bright lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am now home for the summer and when I got home from work one night I saw three objects in the sky. They had kind of a red glow and they seemed to be moving in a coordinated pattern, kind of like they were looking for something. They made no noise that i could hear and were flying pretty low to the ground. They were too far away to discern what the shape of the objects were. They were moving pretty fast and all three of them were kind of zig zagging as they went along.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(I live in the middle of Washington, D.C., and this is restricted airspace. Passenger jets never fly over this building.) I raced to the window and pulled out the screen in order to get a better view.

However, I meant what I wrote about it looking like a giant boomerang: The wing tips and nose were all fairly rounded, not pointed, and the craft was relatively flat. (For an example of the type of boomerang I mean, see the &#34;Turning Point Ash Natural Elbow Doublers&#34; at this Web site:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.flight-toys.com/boomerang/hardwood.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> .)<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lights in various places on the wings--some lights blinking, some lights rotating, others doing neither.

I told my mother what I was seeing and got off the phone to pay attention. I saw a very bright light in the sky, that was alternating white to gold, with a bit of red and then mostly white light, that I thought was a planet, and I looked again and saw it was an aircraft of some sort.  The location was directly above Paine Field, the Boeing plant in Everett Washington.  There was a LOT of aircraft activity in the sky, some very fast moving jets were flying around.  It was easy for me to tell after a few moments, that this object was hovering and it was not a regular plane or coptor. All of a sudden, out of the blue, another one appeared.  This one was in a direct line to the right and made a perfect angle.  They both sat there glowing for about 3-5 mins. I called the local television station and told them what I was seeing.  As I continued to look, the top object, the larger brighter one moved in a dirct line up then moved to the right, the lights dimmed and I was able to see a shape.  As best as I can describe it, it was like a cylinder, and it had a metallic look like nothing I have ever seen before.  Then it completely disappeared.  It kind of like, dimmed, and then it was absolutely gone!  Then the other one did the same thing, and I turned my back for an instant, looked back and there was absolutely no sign of it.  I called Paine Field to try to get someone on the phone, but there was only an answering machine and I told them what I saw, but no one has called me back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just bought a new digital camera and was trying it out on my tripod. I live on a lake and we had just experienced a severe thunderstorm which had abated and the cloud formations were beautiful. I was simply filming the clouds with the sun glowing vaguely behind the darkened clouds. The camera was on auto and all I was doing was pressing the shutter button every three seconds. I was not viewing the scene through the camera. I was simply watching the clouds roll with my eyes and pressing the shutter on the camera which was on the tripod at my side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw nothing odd or unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After shooting eight or ten pictures, I took the camera upstairs to the computer and downloaded the pictures for editing or deleting. To my amazement, there were several photos depicting a bright light beginning at the top of one of the photos and falling through a pine tree quite rapidly through several of the photos. It was not in the shape of a saucer or any other shape, but it was quite clearly a light which was moving through a three second sequence of photographs. Then it split into two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not frightened by that sequence until I viewed the next photograph. It depicted a smokey trail that wove around not only the tree but also snaked around a light pole and through the atmosphere. I had seen that phenomenon before on television shows on cable channels which reviewed videos and photographs taken by others who had witnessed the same sorts of events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reviewed the sequence of photographs for over two hours and concluded I was not a nutcase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an attorney and quite sane. It continues to astound me that I captured this occurence in less than one minute, but I have the evidence. I have a sequence of eight photographs! I cannot say that I truly wish to have this in my possession.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request copies of the photos, and may post them to the NUFORC site, with the photographer&#39;s permission.

It was a regular airliner jet, blue in color with silver or gray wings, fairly low in the sky, about 15,000 feet? Flying an east to west flight path. Moments later, another passenger jetliner, red with white wings, intersected the path of the first jet but at a lower altitude of 9,000 feet, at a South to North Path. I was fascinated they did not hit each other, it could be considered a near miss. Suddenly after the two jets safely started making their way from what appeared to be  over lapping each other,  I saw a glowing white outline of a sharp peaked triangle fly inbetween these two jetliners with a slightly Northwest to Southeast flight path Going the same speed as the 2 jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom portion of the triangle did not appear to be there, there wasnt an outline like the two sides, which formed directly into the steep nose to the craft as if it did not need wings,  and the middle of the triangle appeared to just be plain blue sky. The glow of the outline did not appear to be a form of light, just a hazey opaque white that gave the illusion it was glowing. Kind of what a piece of frosted glass looks like,  If I were to estimate, it would be a 30-40 degree angle in the triangles shape makeup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not cloudy in the portion of the sky, directly above my head where all the sightings took place. Altough there were High, white puffy storm clouds on the eastern horizon. Not at all distorting any view of the events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I instinctively ran in the house to grab a camera after an adrenaline rush from fascination, and came out to be disappointed with awe, as I could not find the flying white triangle any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 pilots of the jetliners HAD to have seen this craft, Visually, AND on radar. So I am counting them as witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the white, triangular object might have been a delta-winged, turboprop pusher, e.g. a LearStar, or a similar aircraft with swept wings.  Just a guess.  It is very difficult for an observer on the ground to determine an accurate range to a object of even known size.  PD))<n>

The bottom was black and the top (which was exposed as it turned slowly like a plate balanced on a stick) reflected the sun with a bright metallic sheen.  As I watched, it slowly moved higher and farther away towards the southeast.  It seemed to be no more than 1 or 2 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry to say that I&#39;m the only witness I&#39;m aware of.  I was watching the object from the side of Camino Pablo (the road which runs under the BART station) about 1500 feet from the station.  While I gave some thought to stopping a car driving by and asking them to take a look, I did not do so, since they were going about 45 mph.  Unfortunately, at 11 AM there aren&#39;t many people waiting on the BART platform, and I think that the overhang might have shielded them from seeing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next time (assuming it isn&#39;t 48 more years until I see one again) I will definitely bring my digital camera !<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical background.<n>

The witness reported seeing an extremely bright flash of light in the southwestern part of the sky. The fellow then saw a bright white light traveling to the northeast coming from where he saw the bright flash. He mentioned that the light took approx: 5 minutes, traveling to the northeast from where he first caught sight of it in the southwestern part of the sky.  It finally just disappeared. The witness also said the light was very high up, but mentioned it was twice as bright than any satellite. Still another light, not as bright was noted coming from the exact position the flash was observed, but this second light was traveling to the north. No sudden moments were noticed. No sounds was heard, mainly due to the lights being so far away. So what we have is a extremely bright flash of light witnessed in southwestern part of the sky, and two other lights coming from the area the flash was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting the report.

I thought they were birds flying overhead but when I stood up to take a better look they were two triangle shaped flying objects with what looked like orange tips on each corner.  I couldn&#39;t really see the object perfectly clear because of the city lights.  As they disappeared behind a tree on the west side of my house I ran west to the street to follow them as they flew without a sound in a northwest direction but couldn&#39;t see nothing after that.  As I stood there gazing up at the sky I noticed a bright star which probably was the Space station moving in an eastern direction.

It was moving at a constant rate of speed, just like a satellite. I told my friend to take a look at the unusally bright satellite. (I constantly observe satellites and the ISS, and constantly tell my friends to look up and watch with me as they pass.) Then as it passed over head it made an unusally abrupt right turn and headed east. This object moved with a constant rate of speed and a constant rate of magnitude of bright light. Usually satellites fade as they move away. This object was twice as bright as venus would be and it made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just by chance I noticed a bright object, traveling slowly across the sky on the Victor 23 flight path heading north.  It was traveling slower than a small plane and I saw it disappear over the trees.  I then told my mom about it and went back into the room five minutes later...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then, in the distance, I saw a blinking red light emerging closer from the southeastern sky and flight path.  It crossed over and headed into the northwest sky.  I thought is was a star at first.  As it came closer, over the house, I could see it was not a star or a plane.  It was a hazy looking triangle-like-craft with a blinking red strobe light in the bottom center.  Around the craft it seemed to sparkel and shift like a glittery transformation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mother into the room and had her see what I was seeing... she cleary saw it without her glasses on and told me she saw a blinking red light and a strange metallic haze surrounding the craft.

It was triangular with rounded edges and it had really dim lights going around it, maybe 10 to 15 of them. They weren&#39;t blinking or changing at all.

I tried to transfer my video of the event from my camra, but Ill have to find another way to do it.  Thr first plane,(possibly an F-16), came from the South.

I began filming this because he was making a pink trail behind him in the sun-set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing where I could still see to the south from our yard.  I vodeo-taped the second air craft, heading from the South to the North, crossing the Straights into Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched through my view finder.  I saw something fly towards this, (possibly a militare plane, or a passenger), from the East to the West.  Just before this round object hit the belly of this jet.  The lights on both wings and the tail flashed on together.  The round object went under the facing wing.  And out the back.  What looks like spray can be seen on the tape.  But the round object can again be seen leaving the tail of the air craft and continuing West.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One night, while not able to sleep, I was drawn to the window by the sound of a nearby fire alarm sounding.  While at the window, my attention was caught by a bright light in the sky.  At first I had thought that it was just a plane, but noticed that there were no blinking lights of any sort, and that it was a single white light, much too bright to be an airplane.  I watched the light move slowly across the sky in a slight wavy pattern, and then, just east of the big-dipper, increase speed, and dissapear back into space.  I was a bit confused by it and tried to figure out what this object could be.  My only thought was a low-orbit satellite.  But why would a low orbit satellite move in that pattern?  And would it be as bright as what I saw? The next day I spoke whith a few neighbors about it, and told them about what I had seen.  They all too passed it off as a satellite.  Well, the second night, I was in the window again, hoping maybe to see somthing again.  To my surprise, The same light appeared in the sky.  Same type of pattern, but a bit more north.  The only real difference was that it appeared exactly one hour prior to the time it had the day before.  At this point, noticing the time of the appearances, I thought it must be a satellite.  The next day, I again told my neighbors of it, and we arranged to all meet outside that night so that I could show them what I was seeing.  So when meeting, just as expected, it showed up in the sky, a bit more north and exactly an hour earlier.  After my neighbors had seen it, they all agreed against me that this couldn&#39;t in fact be a satellite.  The pattern, the amount of light it projected, none of it reflected a satellite.  Well, the days continued, and it moved a bit north everyday, and was exactly an hour earlier everyday.  Although, the last day it was seen, there was a change.  The first sighting was at 2:30 am, this last sighting was at 8:30 pm, on sunday the 27th of July.  I wasn&#39;t the person to see it, but my neighbor said that while she was outside, she noticed it.  This time it was still daylight, and it seemed to appear on the same path, but this time it had moved south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> almost as if it was back-tracking.  She also said that directly behind it was a jet.  I still would like to think that this was merely a low-orbit satellite, but my neighbors disagree.  We don&#39;t know where to look for answers on the subject.  I was hoping that a web-site such as this one might be able to give us some clues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS overflight at 03:20 hrs. on this date.

When I looked through my binoculars at it appeared to be 3 lights travelling in formation but as they passed the area between the lights revealed the starfield behind them.  These lights were steady and formed an obtuse triangle. It was some time after moonset. I heard no noise from them. My binoculars are Nikon 10x. The triangle took up a large portion on the field-of-view when observed through the binoculars. Due to forest cover I had them in view for about 90 degrees of the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought it was an airplane flying until both faint lights began to move in opposite directions.  Then I noticed a new cluster of them slightly north of the original 2 lights.  There were at least a dozen of these very faint reddish orange &amp;quot;stars&amp;quot; of which some were staying still, and 2 of them moving closer towards the city, stopping, and then travelling in reverse back to the formation.

Nothing but a ufo, then a minute later another one came from exactly the same way as the first one did and went the same place and the back of the mountain light up so I am sure they  landed there.  That iis all I have seen,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Utah state University emitts a strange very thin looking beam that bends, I wonder if that could attract them?  Latter that summer I saw some strange lights on the front side of that mountain  It was as though they were looking for something.

The lights and I can&#39;t remenber what their shape was but I do know that they were close together moving around the mountain.  Nothing I have ever seen could move around a mountain so fast and so slow as that.  It would go straight up and over, then down, I went and got my friend to witness what I saw and he just said whoa, I dont know what the is.  Neither do I but something they want is or was there in the North Logan Mountain.  If anyone is interested in the exact place I saw things I will be happy to point it out.  I wanted to go up there but never seemed to get the time, and still wondering what they wanted, as I am sure it was a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I could see stars between the clouds.  Looking west at (on clear days we can see the ocean--not lately tho&#39;) I saw a flashing light &amp; watched it to see if it was an approaching airplane.  It seemed to not move, then seemed to come closer &amp; too bright &amp; big for even a large plane.  I am 5&#39; 2&#34; tall &amp; holding my fist at arms length it was about 20 deg. above my level, and about 30 deg. south of west.  At its closest at arm&#39;s length it was about 3/16&#34; diam. (at least).  I could see no form except the horizontal flashing including a green on the south side.  It flashed about every second then in an instant (less of course) it moved right a fist (extended) length &amp; then appeared below about 1/2 a fist.  Then back to the original position.  It did this a few times with out my seeing it move.  Just appeared.

7/20/03 01:30|Newcastle upon Tyne (UK/England)||Light|1 minute|we were sitting in the back garden at approximately 1.30am looking at the stars.

We saw a bright white light travelling across the sky at extremely high altitude.  It was travelling too fast to be an aeroplane and there was no engine sound.  The first sighting took approximately 1 minute to travel across the sky to the base of the big dipper. The light was not steady, as it would if it had been an aeroplane.  The light appeared unsteady, i.e. &#39;wobbly&#39; in appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting took place at approximately 1.45am (UK time), the light was slightly duller in appearance and lower in the sky although there was no sound.  I am confident that this also was not an aeroplane as there was no wing lights/sound.  This travelled in the opposite direction to the other light and took approximately 1 minute unti lwe lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would appreciate if you might be able to explain this to me, my email address is ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the object might have been the ISS, although we cannot confirm that at this moment, since the www.heavens-above.com site is not operational.

About 2 minutes later we looked back and it was coming up over the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at it and it stopped and hoovered of our house may 10 feet above it.  We could almost see it in perfect detail.  It was triagular and had a rounded feature that reminded you somewhat of the &#34;millinum falcon&#34; from &#34;Star Wars&#34;.  It Didn&#39;t make any noise what so ever.  I hoovered there the whole time we were in the pool. It freaked us out and we jumped out of the pool and ran in the house. We went to get another person to see it and by the time we got back outside (no longer than 2 minutes) It was clear across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We saw a line of 4 lights moving very quickly through the night sky, heading north. Beside them, but with certainly enough distance so as to not be attached to these four lights, another cluster of three lights, possibly in a triangle formation. They simply headed north and out of our view. Writing this now, I realize that it could easily sound like a plane. But having lived in a major city for 20 years, watching planes fly over constantly, I can only say that this was not a plane. It moved much faster than a plane. It was a series of all white lights, and it was accompanied by another series of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were about 13 other people there watching the lights that appear ing the Piney River valley below. We all looked up and saw a low flying light that we thought was an airplane. It got really bright and was moving slowly in a straight line. Then it started getting dimmer and dimmer and disappeared (all in a fairly short distance.) We saw this two more times over the span of about 15 or 20 minutes, doing exactly the same thing over about the same part of the sky. It was pretty strange. Never have seen anything like that when I go to watch the earth lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found her to be quite credible.  PD))<n>

They were around 80 degrees up in the sky to the south and they disappeared around 40 to 50 degrees in the southeast. They speeded seemed to stay the same, it moved little faster than usual satalites I&#39;ve confirmed with a normal satelite that this was about the height where they went into the shadow of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing which disturbed me most was that there were 6 objects near each other (farest in between was 2 thumbsthick at armlength) and really looked if they were flying in formation with some little shifting back and forward as you see in formation flight in flightshows.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was always a UFO believer. But what happned to me a few days ago just go me interested even more. My friends and I were sitting outside our houses looking into the sky. It was a clear night where you can see many stars, not  cloud in the sky. it was about 9:36 pm when i saw it. i say this light moving really fast. at first i thought it was a shooting star, but than all of a sudden it went out like someone fliped a switch and turned it off. The object we saw kept fadeing in and out, until it finally dissapeared. Now at this point I really wanted to keep searching the sky to try to find another.And sure enough I did. i was about 2 min after the 1 i saw earlier flew away. I was like &#34;holy shit look at that&#34; the light we saw was realy brite and moveing pretty fast. i told my friend to get out his telescope so we can get a closer look. And when he got it, I set it up, aimed it at the object. I thought i would of saw like the metal of the spacecraft, but all i saw was the light. i know it wasnt a plane because planes hav those lights so you can see the wings. fnally at about 9:48 it zoomed off, it was traceling from west to the east. I have no idea what it is,could be a military plane (because of 9/11) but didnt seem like it. I would like to know if anyone else saw what i saw, if they did please tell me<n>

It ascended slowly and without sound, maintaining constant ascent and flight path towards the center of  Manhattan , changing shape and color several times  before it  disappeared behind the clouds. The object was a whitish/grey matte finish with a trace of red color. Perhaps due to the setting sun, its redness  seemed to intensify as it climbed higher. No light emissions. The object was relatively big,  half a thumbnail size at arm&#39;s full extension when it was first sighted. Estimated altitude range at 10,000 ft. - 35,000 ft. based on various commercial aircraft and helicopters (approx. 7) that crossed the sky during the event.  The cylinder maintained its amazing  upright posture throughout its flight.  We were not under the influence of any intoxicants or alcohol. Unfortunately, we were too mesmerized to grab a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a blimp would be the first possibility to be ruled out, although we suspect the witness probably considered such a possibility during his sighting.

Ford City is approximately 40 miles northeast of Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River. At first, I thought it was nothing more than a plastic bag, or balloon caught in a stream of wind. However, as I kept looking I noticed the object was moving much too fast of a pace to be a balloon, or a plastic bag. Also, the object moved in a consistent, smooth, straight line. To the best of my knowledge, plastic bags and balloons wouldn&#39;t behave in such a manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t determine how high the object was, but I know that I had to strain my eyes to see it, suggesting that it was pretty high. Also, I wasn&#39;t able to determine its size. I saw no beams or lights being emitted from the object. The object was very light, whitish in color. I tried to make out the shape, but it seemed to shift in shape, from box-shaped, to triangular, hence I thought it may be a plastic bag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting, the weather is absolutely perfect. Crystal-clear, blue skies, with very few clouds and low humidity. There was no sound or contrail, so I know it wasn&#39;t any kind of jet or helicopter. Furthermore, the object covered about 130 degrees of sky in about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d be very interested in knowing if anyone else in either Allegheny, Armstrong, Westmoreland, or Indiana counties observed this event as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I prefer not to be contacted by phone, but I wouldn&#39;t mind being contacted by e-mail, so please do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was small and round, remained a constant height, had a whitish to silver tone but did not reflect light.  Its movement was characterized by being rather fast while the clouds above and below it were stationary. It moved northerly while also erratically moving left and right along its flight path while pausing in one spot on several occaisions.  My first inclination was a weather balloon but due to the stationary clouds above and below the object as well as the object&#39;s intermittent pauses in flight and seemingly random movements left and right I decided to file this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;ve lived here two years and have spent lots of time viewing the stars from my patio on the top floor of a four story apartment building.  My apartment is in the Jardin Oceanico neighborhood (front) of Barra, one block from the beach, facing the Pedra de Gavea mountain.  I do not know what I saw and venture no theories, however, when surfing the net this morning to see if others saw it, I came across the report of another similar sighting in Barra that occured appx a week ago and decided only then to go on record.  I have never seen or reported any weird occurrences in the past, nor do I have any strong opinion as to whether the aliens that must surely be out there in the vast universe, spend there time buzzing the earth trying to freak us out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night around 12:45a.m. after a bath and reading (ate at home, drank no booze or imbibed any other mind-influincing substances), I was getting ready to go to bed when I noticed it was unusually bright outside. The moon was about half full and coming up on the right side of the mountain. It is winter here and the night was beautiful with a clear view of the mountain, so I went outside to enjoy.  I immediately noticed an area about the size of a helicopter with lots of white blinking lights (strobe-like with no real pattern)and some non-blinking red colors mixed in that seemed to be fairly close, right above the mountain.  There are a lot of helicopters flying here all the time (the police patrol use large search lights to scan the ground and condos), so I assumed that&#39;s what it was and looked toward the beach enjoying the view.  When I  looked back,  the lights seemed to be coming closer as they were getting larger. I was thinking it was just a helicopter flying erratically, although I heard no noise.  All of a sudden a bunch of , perhaps six or so of them.  It looked like some sort of fireworks display.  They floated down slowly leaving straight trails of white light. (just like fireworks do)  My husband was sleeping and my 16 year old daughter was IM&#39;ing friends back home.  I ran to my daughter&#39;s room and finally got her off the computer long enough to come look, and when we got back outside, the leading edge of some of the rows were still visibly and very bright white as they went out of sight behind some condos in front of the mountain. (looked like maybe some small pieces of wreckage, very hot, white coming to earth and not burning out before hitting the ground) However, the flashing lights were still in the sky, in the same spot but not as bright.  There are fireworks here all the time and at any time of the night and my daughter was like &#39;big deal, more fireworks&#39; and headed back to her computer.  I sat down and watched the flashing lights, and they seemed to get farther away and not as bright fairly quickly. Then they started to get bright again. That&#39;s when I finally realized it wasn&#39;t a helicopter and got excited.  Should I wake my husband? Should I not? When the lights got brighter and seemed to be right above the mountain where the other display occured, the flashing started to alternate between a very bright white strobe and lesser bright white strobe still with no identifiable pattern, I ran inside for my husband. I ran back outside screaming for him to hurry up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, the lights were very bright white and seemed close with some red and now green. (The red and green never seemed to be actual lights but more like the light that would be given off by red and green lights)  Appx. five or six separate bright, same sized, green with some white lights broke off in a sort of bow shape and maintaining that shape, started very slowly floating down to earth (except the original light which was whiteish green and not as bright, but in the same place). Unlike the first occurrence, the green lights started to fade sooner as they went down.  By the time my husband got outside, there were 2 or 3 green light trails floating down and the original in the same place.  The green light trails faded before hitting ground and the original, blinking more bright white again with a faint reddish seemed to get farther away but remained in the sky for about ten more minutes getting progressively fainter until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was outside for an additional 10 - 15 minutes after he saw the 2 - 3 green lights falling and also observed the odd strobe-like flashing, the odd way it seemed to sit in the same place for long periods of time and the gradual disappearance (fading) into the sky.(at points, it looked like a large, medium, small red star) At times it seemed to be coming back and the stobe effect would be visible again and then it would fade. As it seemed to get further away and mostly invisible, my husband and I thought we saw something very dark and faint falling behind the mountain. (like a large piece or several tightly packed smaller pieces of debris) However, this could easily have been a shadow of something as there are lots of street light, cars, planes, helicopters (although I didn&#39;t see any flying during the event), etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept checking back every 15 minutes for about 3 hours to see if would reappear and it never did.  Never during this entire episode did I feel scared, threatened, nervous or as if I were being singled out in any way.  This was all happening for anyone to see.  I only felt excited and puzzled as to what it was.  I am still expecting to find some logical explanation on the internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ***While writing this, I use &#39;bright&#39; and &#39;close&#39;, &#39;faint&#39; and &#39;farther&#39; away interchangably.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was only a strip of sky exposed due to tree crown cover in place on his property. When I looked up I did see one high altitude object of white-grayish color traveling from the southwest to the northeast. I would say at least 10 Km up. The sky was clear and no cloud was around. I told (name deleted by HBCC UFO), who had his own UFO experiences The second object was following the visible one across the sky in a short distance..but remained invisible throughout the whole time means 50+ seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly enough, the area of sky visible was very limited due to the tree crowns and it almost seems to me that &#34; they &#34; choose this direction to be seen like the one I saw months ago which came closer within a small break in the tree cover on my property to the east. This flight path is actually situated roughly 40 Km&#39;s to the southwest. The two objects were followed by a third one which flew in the same direction 2 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: Possible satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Brian Vike for the report.

While talking to two others, I noticed a real tiny, object heading North East across the sky. We all saw it and watched as it disappeared out of sight....Needless to say we continued to stare into the sky and soon enough, about 5 minutes later, another, very bright circular object appeared and slowly headed across the sky, not making a noise. I quickly ran to my van and grabbed my sony digital camera and filmed it as it continued it&#39;s trek heading due north. (I can possibly send an email of this particular film out of many ufo videos to you soon.) I noticed that others on your site seemed to have viewed the exact thing that I filmed. For the next half hour we viewed four more tiny objects high in the sky. They were so tiny and dim that I could not zoom in on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ...Then on Sunday we saw more ufo&#39;s and also filmed them....I wish everyone would just look up, then we could actually get to the point where we can finially say that these objects are indeed Alien! Just email me back and tell me where to send still images from the video then the video. It was filmed on mini DV tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects appeared as a shadow in the sky and perhaps the size of a small plane but did have some allumination but not brightly lit. They seemed to be rectangular in shape but hard to say for sure because of the darkness. It appeared that we were looking at the underbelly of the craft as they headed in a north westerly direction. There was no sound of any kind. The most unusual observation was the manner in which they moved. They zig-zaged and criss-crossed in a way we had never seen any aircraft manover before. As they  moved further away into the distance they appeared as a bright light, continued to zig-zag then disappeared in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a small business owner and resident of Vancouver Wa. for 20 years and ((deleted--second witness)) is an ex navy man  also long time Vancouver resident. We are both 50 years old and feel like what we saw was out of the ordinary and unexplainable.<n>

I turned to my right and saw a green flashing orb of what looked to be a half mile away.  Actually there were 2 or 3 of them.  They were moving away from me but thinking maybe the local airport had some type of runway approach lights I didn&#39;t think too much about it.  A few minutes later I was coming back on the same road and I saw them again.  This time they were on the other side of the road from before and coming towards me.  They passed to the right of me about 150 yards away.  They were about 20 to 30 feet above the ground and were green in color and flashing like a strobe about one flash every two seconds or so.  They looked to be traveling at about 75 to 100 mph.   I stopped to get some gas while keeping an eye on them.  One stopped about a half mile away.  It was hovering and flashing.  After I filled up I went toward it and it started moving again but was gone by the time I got into position.  I called the 911 center to inquire if anyone else had reported seeing these things.  The dispatcher told me no one had called that night but about a week earlier a policeman reported seeing the lights and just as he was about to point them out of a fireman the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This occurred in a field northeast at Neilson and Ellesmere Rd., near Westhill.  After finishing work, I arrived at the same spot to see anyodd signs of a presence in the sky.  I rotated around 360 degrees checking out the skies for anything odd blocking the sun to the west.  After about ten minutes in skywatching. To the west at about one and half miles away.  Location would be over Scarborough Golf Club Road to Markham Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed a silver flat rectanglar object moving across the sky at a few thousand feet. There were some clouds in the mix of the blue sky.  It looked very thin across,yet too large to be natural.As it moved across the sky from south to north.  I observed a bright white flash coming from it.. Similar like the sun hitting a mirror in a intense reflection signature.  While watching this,I noticed a large black bird ? circling around this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m watching this thing moving across for near two minutes, as it moved slower that a Cessna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had then lost site of it, as it went into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, I was in complete shock of what I just witnessed again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another sighting in SAME location I had witnessed back August 4,1977.  Could this be a sign of contact?  I even wonder today if that bird was a bird.  Just another strange sighing to report to you.<n>

I glanced over to the western horizon and saw a very bright light. At first I thought it was a planet and was going to go get my binocculars to look at it, but it seemed even to bright for a planet. As I watched it for about 30 seconds it began to moved to the Northwest and very quickly became smaller and smaller until it was not seen anymore. It was gone in about 10 seconds. Why I do not think it was an airplane is simple. It was too bright of a light, non flashing, It was stationary for about 30 seconds and moved very, very fast until it disappeared and in a very short frame. It wasnt just that I lost sight in the horizon. It was a very clear night, no clouds. I am reporting this in hopes that I may not have been the only one to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/18/03 02:00|Dupont|WA|Triangle|apx 30 min|Three hanging orange lights spaced at intervals, emmitting a saucer-shaped glow, slowly chaning into a triangle shaped pattern.|7/23/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29793.html|191|ndxe200307| Three hanging orange lights spaced at intervals, emmitting a saucer-shaped glow, slowly chaning into a triangle shaped pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just finished watching a DVD around 2 am this morning.  I was really tired so I decided to go to bed. When I went into my room, I looked out my window to see the stars. This is something I do every single night. The thing immeadietly caught my attention because I had never noticed it there before. From the angle I was looking at it from my window, I saw 3 orange lights spaced at consistent intervals. From what I could tell, the object(s) were quite high in the sky. I became very excited and ran out back to get a better view. When I opened the back door, my mom heard this and woke up. She was amazed at it as well. She figured it was something to do with Ft.Lewis (the gigantic forested army base within 1 mile from our neighborhood, Northwest Landing). I made no reservations as to what it was. The shape changed, rather, the angle changed as I went out back to get a better look. From then on, it just looked like a blob of vaguely 3 orange lights in a triangle pattern. Within about 15 minutes, it had moved somewhat to my right. I noticed this because when I went back to my room, it had become obscured by the roofline of the house, meaning that it moved to the right. Another interesting thing is that the orangeness emmitted a glow. Together, the 3 oranges formed a saucer shaped halo in the sky. It looked so much like a street lamp just sitting there. That is what mostly caught my attention, the aura of it. I knew it was not a star or a satellite or a helicopter or an airplane. It was completely unique. I will watch out for it every single night from now on. I really hope that somebody else saw it, besides my mother. I bet someone did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had gone outside of the tent and sat down to stare at the stars and the mountain, it was approximately 23:30.  Then all of a sudden we saw a very bright light that started out small and just got bigger, the light lasted for about 8 seconds.  It was above the horizon and was due west from where we were camping.  It was so bright that my friend saw it because it was reflecting off of my face.  The thing about the light was that it was a very clean, white almost clear light, and was amazingly bright.  Since the moon had not risen yet it was very dark, this light illuminated the ground and lasted for 8 seconds.  Right before the light vanished it moved up slightly and disappeared.  About 10 minutes after that we saw two more lights that were under the horizon also due west of our position, they looked to be a little ways out from the base of the Tetons.  They were small but bright and were moving rapidly from south to north.  Then all of a sudden the lights started to move towards us from west to east, they were moving very rapidly then disappeared.  About 2 minutes later we saw them again moving south to north, then again they turned and came straight at us again.  By this time the lights had made it to the base of the hill that we were staying on.  The lights vanished again for another 2 minutes then reappeared.  They were hovering and moving in a figure 8 type movement, just back and forth behind the trees.  They vanished again for another 2 minutes and then reapeared.  Altogether we saw these two smaller lights 4 times.  It was very strange and somewhat scarry.  When they got closer our skin was crawling, it was like we could feel the presence of another being.  After the 4th time we saw these lights I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore and got inside the tent, I was to scarred to stay outside.  Just for your information there was an Indian gathering down the hill from us, it was a big pow wow that this tribe p! uts on every year.  the Indians were camping to the south of us about .5 miles away.  We do have 3 other witnesses for the first big bright light, but no other witnesses other than my friend and I on the two smaller lights.  If you need any more information or need me to be more specific in any way please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be quite logical about his sighting, and very credible.  The first light the witness observed was not the ISS or the flare from an Iridium satellite.  The latter would not illuminate the ground noticably, and it would not illuminate the face of the witness, such that another person could detect the illumination on the observer&#39;s face, as apparently happened in this case.  The lights seen later could not have been satellites, if they were below the observer&#39;s (effective) horizon.  In addition, aircraft generally are not allowed to fly over national parks.  PD))<n>

Couldn&#39;t figure out what it was, so I asked my friend what it is. In this very moment the light started to come towards us in a speed I have never seen bevor, the light became about the size of a volleyball, it didn&#39;t look like an electrical light, it was very solid and bright. My friend and I were frozen to the ground and all we could think was: &#34;Go away!!!!!!!&#34;. It was so scary because it was completly silent, no wind at all and just so different than anything else we have ever seen. After the light had become the size of a volleyball it started to move away from us to about a size of a prune and from one second to the other it vanished. We ran back to the hotel and asked the locals, if they know anything about strange lights at night. Nobody knew about this light.

I ran into the house and grabbed my ziess binocs and viewed these objects for several minutes before one broke away at tremendous speed from the other two and disappeared in a matter of seconds. The other two seemed to circle each other until they appeared to be one object (could have been an elevation issue) and then the two were clearly present again as two objects. The spheres were at a very high altitude behind a very bright blue sky with a setting sun. The objects were above what I consider cirrus or cirrus stratus clouds. Those skinny almost transluscent clouds. Other than those clouds, the sky was totally clear and blue. The two remaining spheres simply disappeared while watching them. We did not get the impression that they sped away or climbed to an altitude that would prohibit our sight because of distance. I own my own business, my father is a retired Brigadier General USAF. I know the difference between ballons and aircraft. I know what wind can do and how fast conventional aircraft maneuver across the horizon. I dont know what we saw, but it was not ballons nor conventional aircraft and certainly not atmospheric phenomenon (these objects reflected sunlight).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

From what we could see it was silver and also reflected the sun back towards us.

His words were something like  take a look at that! That aint no @#$# plane. We looked up into a clear blue sky to see a stationary object at about a 55° angle, south southwest from our location. The object appeared to give off a &#34;silvery&#34; reflective light. The object looked like it was undulating or rotating in an irregular fashion because of the variations in light emissions. My first thought was that it was a typical small helium balloon that had been let go and was rotating and reflecting light as it climbed. But as we watched this thing it became apparent to us that it was not. This thing appeared to be very high. Its really difficult to say without any references, but I would take a guess at 50,00 ft. A lot of planes are coming and going at PDX and they all appeared to be way below this thing and it didn’t seem to be moving. It was breezy on the ground and I suppose it would be windy up there also, but this thing seem to stay in place with no apparent movement from wind, (as with a balloon) or slow movement by rotation (as with a planet or star) We finally had to move on, as we had golfers behind us. I watched the object in between golf shots as we played for a little while. About an hour and fifteen minutes later as we neared the last hole, Chris again brought the object to our attention, It appeared to be in the same area of the sky, but was even smaller (or higher) than before. I took my eyes off of it for a second, when Chris said it just saw it move to the right about eight inches (at arms length) and is now quickly climbing away. He tried to point to its location in the sky as it climbed, but it was too small for me to pick up. I would have loved to have some binoculars right then. This thing was very puzzling. Could it have been a weather balloon or an atmospherically distorted viewing of a! planet? Many other people had to observe this object as it was CLEARLY visible for at least an hour and fifteen minutes.<n>

We didn&#39;t think anything of it for at least an hour. It just seemed something cool to look at while we passed the time away. I stood there staring at it for a few moments and then told my friends (at this moment, the group comprised of myself and four others) &#34;It&#39;s moving.&#34; They, at first, didn&#39;t believe me. We then ran in to retrieve my girlfriend&#39;s telescope and I quickly got it centered on the object. It appeared perfectly circular (which is to be expected from viewing something through a home telescope at such great distance), orbiting the moon at what I thumbed out to be at least 500 miles (I was always good at math and spatial orientation). When it first was brought to our attention, it was in the 7 o&#39;clock position in relation to the moon. What made us realize that this was no planet, star, or earth orbiting craft was because of these reasons: 1- it stayed approximately equidistant from the moon at all times in an orbital path(it is at about the 2 o&#39;clock position as I type this. when we first saw it it was in the 7 o&#39;clock position as stated above.) 2- any star that close to the moon when it was full but 4 days ago would be occluded by the sun&#39;s light refracting off of it. I know this to be fact. 3- I know of no moon orbital sattelites posessed by any nation at this time(of course, there could be some that I am not aware of!) 4- no planet or star could maintain such a perfect relation to the moon. The object in question exhibited a yellowish tinge and produced coronal light discharge that completely differed from any heavenly body I have yet encountered. To me it somewhat of a mystery, but I have no doubt that what I saw was very doubtfully made by human hands and exhibited behavior clearly indicative of an orbi! tal path around the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object may have been the planet, Mars.

I looked around to see if there was anybody else seeing this but there was no one in the area. Even if it was a clear nigh I could not see any stars around the moon. Except for this very bright white light. I stood there starring at it for a few minutes before I noticed it seemed to be moving very slowly and was changing color from a white pulsating light to a bright orange then back to white. I ran back into my apartment to get my camcorder and digital camera... I took nine pictures but you can&#39;t really make out anything except a small white dots. But I managed to take about 40 minutes of video before my battery died. I had a hard time zooming in on it because of the moon being so close and so much brighter my auto focus kept zeroing in on it. After my battery died I stayed out there for awhile to see if anything else would happened. It just kept doing the same thing over and over. I then went back to my place to view the tape. I could clearly see on the tape the white light change to a bigger brighter orange light that seemed to pulsate for a few minutes then it went back to the white light and started the whole thing all over again.…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Mars.

This long, narrow road has a unobstructed view of the night sky, almost like being atop a huge tower.  After many disappointing vists to this area, myself and three of my close friends saw something absolutly mind boggling.  It was approx. 12:30 AM when we first noticed a strange orange and red light sitting still above the tree line in the southeastern sky.  It was much larger and brighter than any of the planes or stars that we saw.  It did not move from that location, so we really didn&#39;t think much of it.  Approx. five minutes later, the exact same light we saw above the tree line, had moved to the eastern skyline.  We didn&#39;t take our eyes off of it from that point on.  The light began moving from the northeastern skyline to the southeast and then back again for approx. 10-15 minutes.  It seemed to have no pattern whatsoever to it&#39;s direction of flight.  We could tell that it was getting closer to us, and then very far at a tremendous rate of speed.  The most amazing thing happened after it had dimmed away for minute or so; We suddenly witnessed it very close again, mostly orange in color, but sometimes red, blue and white.  It was close enough that we certainly would have been able to hear if it was jet or prop powered, but there was dead silence.  It got even closer, staying just above the tree line.  It was moving from south to north when we ran down the road to catch a glimpse of it between two large trees.  We saw a classic &#34;movie made&#34; disk hovering at a 45 degree angle.  We could see 4 or 5 bright white round lights either on the top or bottom perimeter of the disk spinning on axis at a reletivly slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We witnessed this actual disk for only 10 or 15 seconds.  The object changed from a spinning disk, to a white ball of light and took off at an amazing rate of speed (again, no sound) making almost a horseshoe loop in the sky, and then it was gone.  I&#39;ve been back there many times since we saw the unexplainable, and have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The planet, Mars, would have been in the southeastern, or southern, sky on this date, and at the time indicated.  However, it would not have moved across the sky ask quickly as the witness describes.  We do not know what they observed.  PD))<n>

As I looked up at the moon, I noticed a small bright light over the left hand side of the moon. I didn&#39;t think much of it at first as it could be anything. Five minutes later I looked up to see if the object was still there and surely it was. I was still on the phone at this point but from then on I kept my eyes on the object. 20 minutes into the call the object was still in the exact spot as before. Throughout the timeframe I was outside, I was under the impression the object was moving slighty-much like hovering. Once I was off the phone, about 23 minutes later, I went inside, got my digital camera, and took some photos. At the time my cameras settings were locked so I could not zoom in to magnify the photograph. As I revised the images I noticed the dot of light was not visible unless you zoomed into the image. It then blended in with the moon&#39;s light halo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Mars, but that planet should have been to the right of the Moon by July 16th, we believe.

I decided to grab a camcorder, a digital camera, two walky talkies and a friend and return to the same spot that I had seen the craft the night before. At about 20:25 we began walking towards the area that I had seen the craft. We were in a large open field and I began looking towards the sky. There were no stars out, and the sun was going down. Soon I saw a small white dot far off in the distance. I showed it to my friend, and we sat and watched if it would move, thinking it might be a craft. It was moving slightly and soon blended into the sky. Then I noticed another odd thing in the sky, close to where the first craft had been. This one was much larger, possible closer than the first and it resembled a cloud or as if it was reflecting the sun&#39;s color. It was orange and did not move. We became aware it was not a cloud for the fact that it disappered. Now something was definitely strange about this part of the sky. We were still a bit hesitant to if we had seen anything out of the normal. Another white dot much resembling the first appeared under another cloud than the others, it soon disappered. So we knew something paranormal was happening and I started to search the sky for more objects. When suddenly, I looked directly above where me and my friend were sitting, it had a triangle shape on it, and a circlish-ovalish part on it. It was hovering and wasn&#39;t too far in the sky, definitely no star, which not one was in the sky. It started moving slowly away so I pulled the camcorder out of my backpack and recorded what I could of it before it completely disappeared. We packed our camera up and started heading back towards my friend&#39;s house where I had seen a craft the night before. I then noticed a rocket had appeared in the sky, it was probably military craft. I decided it was important to record this. Then, out of nowhere ANOTHER ROCKET appeared, this one had much stranger activity. I recorded them both. They were heading toward! s the same direction, where the first white dots were in the sky. The second craft either stopped, changed direction or was going really slow, because it was suspended in midair. Soon, it went behind a cloud. The only thing I recorded was the UFO that was hovering above us, and the two military rockets that were pursuing them or that just happened to be passing the area. From this second incident, I have decided to do more and more UFO hunting. I will report here if I see anything else during my huntings. If someone wants to see the footage I have please contact me at ((e-address deleted)) and I will be happy to show you it. If any private investigators need to contact me I would be much more comfortable to show them person to person, instead of telling the story again on the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness, a student, to forward some still images of the object, and may request permission to post them.

We were almost back home, walking up the road when we looked up and saw the figure of a man, dressed in what looked like black overalls, descending as if by parachute. He was coming down about fifty yards away behind the last house in the row. I thought he was going to land in the meadow beyond. But when he was only about 15 feet off the ground he levelled out and began to slowly accelerate, climbing very gently and heading off in a northerly direction. We watched as he crossed the valley and disappeared into the distance. But there was no parachute, or any means of propulsion. Nothing visibly attached to his back, no noise, nothing. All of this was on a summer&#39;s evening, blue sky, excellent visibility, and no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from the same source of the same sighting.

As i tracked it over a few minutes it appeared to move across the sky in a westerly direction eventually going out of sight, as i watched it another much dimmer object seemed to sail past it in the other direction travelling much faster at about the smae height it diappeared after maybe 20 seconds. one other person saw both objects while a 3rd person saw only the bright object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so - anyway i was explaining to two friends what i had seen and was pointing in the sky to indicate where i had seen the object and the path it had taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was by contrast 2-3am - or thereabouts and a dark cloudless sky. it was very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as i moved my finger away we all noticed a very bright object where my finger had been it was like an aircraft light and very bright - it seemed to be at between 5-10,000 feet maybe higer - it was strange as the fact that no sound accompanied its travel made us all stop and watch more closely. it passed overhead travelling quite slowly and as it passed in front of us you could clearly see that it was long like an aircraft with green tail lights.  as it passed us it continued its way east and  as it passed us its path began to change - not like a normal aircraft would by bsnking - it seemed to maked stepping stone movements in a zig zag pattern - quite subtle but very obvious- it seemed like an optical illusion as it seemed to hop from one place to the other like a skimming stone - it continued in this way until it dimmed and disappeared out view. it was a very neutral ufo sighting and one that i have always wanted to see, perhaps a bit closer would be nice next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was my birthday :)<n>

I was getting ready for bed and just turned off the airconditioner and opened up the windows for fresh air. My husband was in the kitchen getting some mid-night snack. My 2 boys age 19 and 10 and their two friends age 12 and 14 had headed up to the grocery store on their skateboards to get some sodas. My last words to them was to be quiet when they get back. I looked at my clock and it was 12:30, I laid down and then it started, The wind picked up and was very strong, my blinds on the windows are very heavy and they where banging around as if a storm was moving in, I remember yelling out to my husbans., Boy feel that nice breeze coming in. Well anyways I closed my eyes and must have dosed off lightly, The next thing I remember is that my eyes opened and I looked over toward the window, and  I heard this Whum Whum Whum then a loud like explosion or something Then the power went out. I jumped out of bed and tried to find some shorts to put on as I was talking to my husband in the other room yelling: Did you see that Did you feel that Something is not right here something is not right here, I went out into the dining area to light a candle and the power went back on, My husband seen the lights from the livingroom and could feel the electric pressure on him.  No sooner as I was getting ready to go out side I heard the Boys running down the stairs to come in Yelling and just pumped up with energy : Did you see that, What was that , Mom we could&#39;nt move it went right through us I have never seen my boys so scared, They said the hair on them stood up .They could&#39;nt move.  I told them to stay in because something just is&#39;nt right That my husband and I are going to go outside and see whats going on. So we walked out to the back of the Apts looked around and then Heard chopper coming from the otherside of the building so we went to the front of the Apts and saw 2 large helipcopters flying toward us going North and they were very low and VERY FAST I looked c! losley and did not see any white stripe on them which tells me they were NOT Medi flight More Like Goverment DARK (maybe Black) copters. So we went back in the house to get keys to the car and told boys to stay in the house, that we were going to see whats going on. We got in the car and realized we had no gas so we headed toward gas station on Ols US 23 and Lee road, got out of the car and the lady that was working yelled out to us our pumps are not working power went out and on and we don&#39;t know how to reset them. One lady that was there said her battery went dead and I asked them what they seen and they said BRIGHT LIGHTS BLUISH IN COLOR. They seemed to my abit stunned. So we went to the station across the street and I went in to see if there pumps where working and they went sure so we tried to get gas and no luck. So we headed back home. Went in the house and the boys where still all pumped up and talking. They decided to go back outside and I told them not to be to loud it&#39;s late and don&#39;t wake up the neighbors. My husband and I finally went to bed and no sooner did we fall asleep the boys came tearing into the house and yelling Mom you got to see this,Mom you got to see this, So they brought me a small piece of branch from a tree and the leaves were dead and curled and I am thinking to myself (so it&#39;s a dead branch so what, and then my 19 year old said to me : Mom I cut through the wall everyday to go to work and move this out of my way AND IT WAS NOT LIKE THIS WHEN I GOT HOME TONIGHT. he was scared. I took the branch and told them to go wash their hands from what appears to be a white residue on it and I placed it in a plastic bag and put it in the hallway. I do have the branch now in a safe place incase anyone wants to study it.. I told the boys to write down their thoughts and how they felt because We needed our sleep and I know they would have stayed up all night talking about it and would have kept my husband and I up. Slept all night and went to work the next day and approx 9:15 a.m next mor! ning at work, The phone rang and it was the assistant manager from the apts asking me:  What the Hell was that last night? She also was woken up because her Cat jumped on her in bed and was just as how she put it VIBERATING. The cat never has done that before, she usally hides when there is a storm but no storm insight but something scared the hell out of my cat.  Well later in the week I asked many people in the area and some say nothing and some remember the power going out and 1 remembers his cat freaking out while he was tring to play video games and he knows power went out too. Meanwhile now we hear they found a crop circle in Howell that weeks time frame. So I guess my question is : Who can contact us to help ease the mind alittle of the events that happen around us.  My son and I have started a little file on the weird and bizzare pheomenons in our Hometown. Thanks for reading and hope one day we all can share stories together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the event occurred on Wednesday morning, July 16, 2003.

These pictures were taken on July 16, 2003 ((deleted)) in the Southwest United States. He estimates the size at 35 feet across.  It looked like two aluminum pie plates together. The top one turned over.  The hatch was open and all you could see was black inside.  There was no hatch cover rather it looked like the door had recessed into the craft.  There were markings on the top and in the center that looked like a white knob.  It was silver, white and darker metal.  It almost looked like barnacles on the outside.  Rough or like paint had been chipped off.  But it was totally intact.  There was a skid mark in front of it and two wheel tracks from the back through the desert.  Either the tracks led to or from the craft.  It is not easily accessable ((deleted)).  He has offered to ((deleted--drive investigators to the site.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> They have been back since the photo shoot and it was still there.

The street I was on was very dark, almost pitch black, my friend&#39;s house up the street was dimly lit. I noticed lights above his house but thought it was a plane, and thought nothing of it. Soon I came to realize that it could not be a plane, it was flying too slowly and too low to the ground for that. The object had lights on it, I did not count them but I am pretty sure that there were 2 red lights and 4 white lights. The object was about 250 ((corrected by witness)) feet from me, and 75-80 feet ((corrected by witness)) in the air. It&#39;s shape was the combination of a disk and a diamond, it could have just looked that way from the angle I was at. I thought of going to get my friend to get another witness but thought that if I did that when I came back with him it would be gone. I was unusually calm for such an encounter. My mouth was open and I was watching and studying the craft in awe. After I dismissed the idea of the object to be a plane I considered it could be a blimp, but it couldn&#39;t have been, it was much too small and oddly shaped. Also, it did not have one sheet of metal over the entire object, it had rectangular silver plates on it. The object flew by me and over the trees across the street from my friends house, I could still see it and it was still fairly close. One thing I noticed what how the craft would go fairly slow, then come to a stop, and hovered there for a while. This was the eeriest thing about the object, on account of how unnatural this looked from any other type of flying machine. Later on I would consider it to be a helicopter, but it did not have a tail or blades, nor did it make loud noises. It did make a noise however, a quiet stealthy humming, as if an engine were in it. After the craft passed over the first set of trees it came to a house across the street from my friends house. It hovered over the house, and suddenly a white light came out of the bottom, the bottom was like a hatch, the light wasn&#39;t like a beam, more like an airplane light. I became frightened for a moment, thinking that the UFO had spotted me just then, but then the light disappeared and the hatch closed. The craft continued on from the house, it was starting to get far away, soon it stopped behind a tree and kept moving. When I lost sight of it, I started to run to the other side of the street so I could see it going over the trees from the right, but I was at my friends house so I decided to go in and get him real quick. I told him to follow me and that I had seen a UFO and he had to be quick, so him and his girlfriend ran outside after me, they both looked very reluctant to really look for the UFO, like they didn&#39;t believe me. I wanted to show I wasn&#39;t lieing about the whole thing by acting completely serious, so they could see I wasn&#39;t really kidding around. We ran down the trail by the house the object had hovered and set it&#39;s light from the hatch out over to see if it was still behind the trees. It was gone, so I went back inside with my friends. No one really believed me and I really regret on not having a second witness with me. My background description is that I&#39;m ((personal data deleted)) intelligent, and very interested in music.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote my report a little less than a day ago, it was posted 7/16/2003 and the location is Rolla, MO.

It didn&#39;t move in a straight line like a plane would, but in a sort of smooth zigzag formation. In the darkness I could just barely make out it&#39;s rounded disk shape. I got up and looked out the window to get a closer look, but it had already gone/flown away. Then, however, I looked up at another point in the sky...it was a little red/white light that looked like a star, and i thought it was. But then I realized it was moving. It took awhile for me to realize it wasn&#39;t a star it was moving so slowly, and almost as soon as I realized it wasn&#39;t, it sped up dramatically and dissapeared over my house where I could no longer see it. I&#39;m not sure if the two were connected, or maybe it was the same craft, or two different crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But this was different from any satellite we had seen. It went across the sky but every 30 seconds it would go from very dim in to really bright. Neither one of us had ever seen a satellite flash like that. It seemed as if it was spinning slowly with one light on one side. It also seemed to be moving at a very high rate of speed, moving higher in the sky as it seemed to encircle half of the salt lake valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw the normal traffic of airliners passing by. I then looked, and saw what I thought was an other airliner. I looked away, thinking it nothing, I then looked again, it was stationary, hovering in mid air. I was thinking that it was just that it was coming towards me. I stood outside for an other 2 or 3 minutes, still, it remained in place. The thing just stayed there in place. I was beginning to wonder what it really was. I watched it for an other I don&#39;t know, 2 or 3 minutes, then it just went up. It just went straight up, and disappeared. I got this odd feeling about it. Like something wasn&#39;t right or something. Maybe it was just a shooting star that I mixed up with a airliner or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Me and two of my friends were on our way to my sisters house in my car on route seven going past Lums pond state park going north words Wilmington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were passing the main entrance five lights in a row came up from behind my car. We had the sunroof open. It came directly above my car (about thirty feet) it looked like a string of five lights in a perfect row. When I saw it I thought it was a helicopter I had heard no noise but that may have been because we had the music going. It seemed to follow us directly above us for about thirty seconds. My friends said it could have been a r\c airplane because there is a r\c flying field near us. I thought it was way too big it was about thirty feet long. I remember thinking that it was one object but after the first thirty seconds the lights began to move in a almost slithering motion like a sidewinder .Then it had moved (still slithering) to the left of my car. And kept going left of my car slowly until it had gone out of view into the park the whole time keeping the same speed we were going. The five lights were white and almost reminded me of the lights on a helicopter. I apologize for my lack of writing skills. I just wanted to add my sighting to the sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

More modern than anything that I can think of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were on a 3 day vacation from work heading southbound to visit our mother in Fountain Valley, CA.  Starting our journey from Hayward, CA.  Accompanying us in the rental minivan were two other females. My brother and the other female sat in the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 2 hrs. north of Fountain Valley, CA (140 miles), on Interstate 5, I noticed a &#34;small airplane&#34; - with bright, but not blinding lights wobbling closely above the power line poles. My first thought was &#34;Just my luck, an airplane is about to land on me, or on the freeway ahead -- during my vacation...&#34; this lasted for less than one minute, within the next 10 seconds the &#34;airplane&#34; was on my left side (northbound of I-5) traveling steadily with the speed of my vehicle (70-75mph), in my direction, then the word &#34;ufo&#34; came to my mind, yet still skeptical,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out to my brother, of whom I thought was sleeping, he replied &#34;I see it&#34; At this point my thought was: &#34;I must eliminate all other! possibilities&#34;.  I then rolled my window down to hear for any motor/engine noises, but only wind from my traveling vehicle was what I heard, then the craft at least doubled my speed, veered left, at least tripled my speed-that&#39;s when I clearly saw 3 white balls of lights in perfect linear formation, but for less than one second during its highest acceleration the middle &#34;ball of light&#34; became orangish, then white again during deceleration,then it made a fast and perfect u-turn and landed on a road of some sort.  Lights dimmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to get back to driving, so I turned my head towards front of my van again.  This all happened within 3-5 minutes.  I asked my brother, &#34;What was that?&#34; he didn&#39;t answer. I asked &#34;Was that a ufo?&#34;, he replied &#34;What else could it be?&#34;.<n>

It was not distant, but very close and large!  Triangular in shape with flash in the rear, greater on the outer edges than center.  The entire shape seemed to be lit.   It may have been white flame shooting from the back of the object and I am certain there was a flash of blue in the center.  There was no tail to speak of so I am fairly certain it was not a comet, afterall.  Maybe a military vehicle?  So peculiar.  I do wish I&#39;d had my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live 3 1/2 miles south of Spencer on Pottersville Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is there anything you know about this that you might share with me?  No sound.  So strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it pass with amazement and wonder.  Because we are surrounded by tree lines on all sides the viewing area was limited.  After it passed beyond the treeline, there was some distant flashes in the sky but this could have been heat lightening, although I did not notice them prior to the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking about it all night makes me certain it was not a comet at all (my initial thought) because there was definite structure to the object.  Were I to associate it with something familiar, that something would be a stealth because of form and light that would resemble fuel flash feathering from the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As well, I did see what appeared to be a comet after turning away from this sighting, shooting off in a different direction, from a different direction..  if the two sightings occurred simultaneously, they would have made an X over my front yard!  The second sighting did seem to be a comet, lower than most I have witnessed, but definitely the shape, oval, with a short tail, white, without any deviating signs of being otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What a night!  I hope you will reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They hovered like helicopters, but no sound, and moved in various paths, none of them straight, and whatever the one craft did, the other stayed close, while each performed its own manoever.

The lights inside were like misty, foggy, like flouresent lighting turned low. But no one was in there that we could see.  We continued on under it and it came down on the rd. behind us.I was scared it was going to land on top of us.I lost sight of it as we went under it. We were absolutely horrified. My husband said to turn around and look to see if it was really there, we could both see it in the rear view mirrors, and it lit up with several colors of lights. I couldnt move, finally he yelled at me again and I turned around and looked and yes it was there in the road behind us.We raced away 90 miles an hour. I yelled at him and said he was going to kill us if he didnt slow down. We thought it was following us, but it was out of sight as we turned the curve. We got to Fowlers Bluff and turned off, down toward the boat ramp area. Then we came back out the circle rd. back to 347 stopped and looked north toward where it had been and saw a truck flying toward us. He went past and we pulled out to follow him to Cedar Key so we wouldnt be alone out there, But my husband couldnt even catch him , He had to be doing 100 miles an hour, and I think he saw what we saw and was scared, too. I finally remembered I had my cell ph. and I called my son in IN. I had trouble hearing the answering machine come on , there was alot of growling static, and some beeps like sos type. I had a feeling something or someone was interfering and listening to me, then it went dead. It was the most scary thing that I have ever experienced. But I guess if they were going to hurt us they would have because it is a very desolated area there between Chiefland and Cedar Key, with lots of swamps and the Lower Swanee Scrub Refuge. So, yes they are real.I watch the sky now and look up info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

No trails No sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was geting outdoor to sit  down and take fresh air. I sit down and begin to watch the sky and i saw a bright light in front of me on a blue sky but far away. At first i thought that it was the sun reflecting on a plane like a mirror. The altitude was just above the thin cloud at my left and was going in relatively the same speed (maybe faster). It was going in my direction but a litlle on the left. I noticed no trails and all other plane was doing trail this day. No sound too. I was thinking: this plane look realy like a ufo! After a little wile the object was passing under the very thin clouds at my left and I still saw it . It was brigther and i never saw  wings on that thing, just a brilliant form lengthened. Suddenly, that  vanished like we put off a light. I did not see it any more. But a few seconds later it reappeared like it was vanishing few second ago! For  disapaing again a few second later and leaving the sky empty.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I walked outside the home i was living in at the time and looked up into the sky as i always do for anything out of the ordinary,and this time i did see something extraordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was in the middle of summer it didnt get dark until around 10oclock.This took place between 8-9pm, most preferably around 9:30pm.It was a 95% clear blue sky day with a few patches of clouds here and there.  Once i walked outside the house and a few feet into the yard i looked up and saw a huge airplane roughly only a couple miles high into the sky heading slightly towards the columbus area.  Thing is i&#39;ve seen many airplanes in this area time after time, but never seen one so slow to the ground before,not in this area.If i wanted to i could have counted all the windows one by one on left side of that plane,but didn&#39;t.Time after time i&#39;ve heard the roaring sounds of plane engines soaring by even though they&#39;re 5-7 miles high in the sky,night or day,yet I didnt hear any noise at all from this plane,and it was the lowest to the ground i&#39;ve ever seen from any airplane! 	As the plane was flying on by,making its way just above the pine trees I noticed a small whitish dot few feet away from the plane,but far away at the same time.Within a few seconds that small whitish dot was right up on that plane,making it up at least 1/4 size of the plane,and the airplane alone was huge.Instead of being a small whitish dot,it was a huge 3 gray layered oval shaped glowing ball of light.The center was dark gray,the middle was a more lightish gray and the outer layer was a light gray.I stood there and watched this object,which was probably 50-60 feet away from the right side of the plane the whole time,move along side of the plane heading not towards columbus this time,but straight south,for 5 mins until i could no longer see either the plane or the object any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i said before it was a pretty clear blue sky that evening with a few clouds here and there.This wasn&#39;t a cloud simply because the clouds were nowhere near either the plane or object.Plus this object was perfectly oval shaped and no cloud has been perfectly oval shaped and moved in a fashion such as they had.Not to mention clouds are white,not gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone as i witnessed this incident.After i could no longer see both the airplane or the object,my first words out of my mouth were &#34;that was a ufo&#34;.I walked straight into the house right after that explaining to a few relatives i had just witnessed a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> two relatives of mine reported seeing unusual flight patterns from an object with colorful lights at night in 2011off of the very same property i experienced my ufo encounter,but their incident happened facing north roughly a few miles out,couple miles into the night sky.Both people claimed object moved very,very fast and made sudden stops with angle turns that no flying object could do from what they know of.<n>

As we were engaged in conversation, I saw something up in the sky that caught my attention.   It was a perfect day with a clear blue sky, so I know I wasn&#39;t mistaken about seeing this object.  I notioned to my wife who looked up just as bewildered as myself.   In a short distance from us, we could see a cigar shaped silvery looking object that was motionless in the sky.  It clearly wasn&#39;t a plane or some other object that could rationally be described, as it was truly unique to anything we have ever seen.   As we stared at it for a minute or two, it suddenly moved in a darting motion to it&#39;s left, then it darted again quickly to it&#39;s right, and it moved irradically for a another minute or two after that.  Again after a moment, it remained motionless in the sky without any apparent moment.  It was at this moment that after the rush of excitemnt had passed, I decided to get my camera to get a picture of this thing.   However, as fate would have it, it disappeared within the time I had rushed to go into the house.  My wife said that the object left at lightening speed directly upwards into the sky.   I would have wrote about this sooner; however, I was unaware that this site existed.  This is not some fabricated story made up to get attention or publicity; as I simply want to tell those interested that we are obviously not alone.   I also want to say for the record, that this is mt third sighting of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a nice day, and I casually looked up at the cloudless sky as I was at my car, and noticed a weird craft a few hundred feet in the air.  I initially thought it may have been a rod. But from what I have heard, rods are extremely fast, and this thing was just slowly coasting through the sky.  I could cleary see the shape, and it was cylindrical, with what appeared to be two small fins at the very end.  There was absolutely no sound, and definitely a complete absence of what could be wings. It was white in color and I saw no lights. But in the daytime I probably wouldn&#39;t be able to see them anyway. I watched this object as it approached me, flew directly overhead, and gradually veered off making a slight curve until I could no longer see it.  It took about five minutes from the time I initially saw this thing before it faded out of view.  A plane could never move that slow. But don&#39;t get me wrong, there is no doubt in my mind that this thing was not a plane. As I stated before, there were no wings. I do not want to speculate about what it may have been, so I figured I would report it to you, and you can compare it to other reports you may have received.  Also, as I walked back into the mall a few minutes after I could no longer see the object, I noticed a helicopter flying in the same general dircetion as the object I saw.  I could clearly see every aspect of the helicopter, and hear the sound of its engines and rotors. It may have been unrelated, but was interesting nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was loading my work truck with tools with my dad.  I happened to look up at the sky and saw a commercial airliner.  I kept watching it because it was so clear I could make out the colors on the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed a small shiny orblike thing flying right under the tail of the jet.  The shiny orb was very small compared to the jet.  I called my dad over to show him and to make sure I was seeing it right.  He was amazed by this also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 seconds later it moved from under the tail of the jet to side of the jet; still beside the tail.  Then it moved back under the tail; and to the other side of the tail; out of sight for a couple seconds; and then back under the tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved unlike any type of jet I&#39;ve ever seen.  It was very fast and precise.  I told some people about the sighting but most say it was probably a fighter jet refueling.  I really don&#39;t think this because of the size comparison to the airliner and the precision of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it dropped further under the tail than usual and sped off from under the jet at an incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my father agree what I saw was not a refueling jet.  I followed ufology pretty much all my life; and I take it quite serious; none of this is exagerated.  I&#39;m thinking it could be linked to the &#34;foo-fighter&#34; sightings made by many pilots.  My dad has also has had many incredible sightings in the past.  I will have him report his soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

I watched it for a minute and decided it was not a balloon, it was dull black,looked like metal and It was shaped like a telescope lense. The object made slow tight circles and slowly drifted west. I watched it drift for about 30 min. I would say it was about 500/800 ft up maybe more I couldent tell how big it was but it drifted higher untill it was out of sight. The thing did act like a balloon but i am pretty sure it was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up to where he pointed. I saw what looked like three shiny round pellets suspended in the air somewhat perpendicular to each other giving the appearance that they were right on top of each other. There was a fourth object that was shaped like a cone pointed downward. This cone object was just below the three shiny round objects. This gave the overall visual image like that of holding a tripple snow cone up in the air. Near the bottom pointed end of the cone object there was a constant flash of light like that of a kodak camera when taking a snap shot. This would flash every 3 seconds. There was also the impression that the cone was spinning because of shadows and reflections that could be seen. The four objects came descending rapidly from high altitude. They were at first shiny specs in the sky and then within less than a minute I could see the details of the object getting more and more clearer as they descended. They were about the size of buck shot at half arms length. An airliner passed below the objects. After the plane passed below the objects, they began to quickly ascend and soon dissappeared in the morning sky. There was no sound other than the airliner that took off from the nearby airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I woke up my husband and took out the video camera. I do not know what other explanation there could be, at 5 am, I can see no stars, the sky is getting bright, and here is this large bright light near the moon. The first time I saw it it was not near the moon, and in a totally different area of the sky. I can see it with my naked eye as I do not own a telescope, it has a yellowish color to it compared to the moon, and I got it on video for about 10 minutes. I am open to suggestion as to what it may be, and what I should do from here. I live in Hungry Horse Montana if that will help you determine the location of what I was viewing and that is at 5 am Mountain time. It was to the right of the moon about 2 inches (visually with my fingers) so whatever distance that would be maybe you know. This was on July 15th 2003. Please contact me, and give me some idea who I would need to talk to if you are not the right person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Mars in conjunction with the Moon.  PD))<n>

I was travelling home with three of my friends who all like in the same town.  Were coming from another friend&#39;s house in Coventry, RI.  We were travelling in two cars, I was in the passenger seat of my friend Joe&#39;s &#39;85 Firebird.  My friends John and Domenic were right behind us in Domenic&#39;s &#39;72 Nova (so no slouch cars, they come up later).  We merged onto Route 95 North from exit 6 in Rhode Island.  We travelled about a mile and a half when I saw to the East Southeast something flying North and the exact same speed as we were travelling.  The craft was just above the tree line, it had sort of a bulky saucer shape and it had six yellow lights that were extremely dim and barely visible.  It looked very large, but I couldn&#39;t tell how far it was from us yet.  We called our friends travelling next to us in the lane to our left.  We coordinated between the two cars (using cellphones) to slow down and speed up together, and the craft sped up and slowed down with us with virtually no delay, it was moving with us.  I knew there was no was this was a plane, there was no sound, it was flying too low, even though we were only several miles from the state airport in Warwick.  So we continued travelling North, and we coordinated a maneuver to see how the craft would react.  When the highway split to 295 North and 95 North, Domenic and John in the Nova swerved behind us and sped up 95 while Joe and I in the Firebird sped up Route 295, as soon as Domenic and John were just out of our sight in the other car, the craft took a 90 Degree turn towards the East and shot so fast out of sight that if you blinked you would have missed it.  This thing took off faster than the supersonic jets at the air show, I&#39;ve never seen any plane do anything like this before, it was amazing.  It was at that last moment that I finally got an idea how far away it was because the tree line had started to clear and a hotel that I know was about 1/2-3/4 miles away was i! n the foreground just before the craft shot out of sight.  So most likely it was no more than a mile away.  It seemed to be moving up a little bit as it took off, but it happened so quickly I really could not tell.  The most amazing part of the whole encounter was that the craft made no noise and it changed speeds as we did with no delays or jerky movements, it was all very fluid in terms of movement.  I really wish I had a camera because I got some great looks at this thing, it was a clear night, relatively quiet and the moon was fairly bright.  I might be off on the date, I don&#39;t remember the exact date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I then looked directly at a green glowing cylinder object that was moving Northwest over the Puget Sound appearing to descend at a constant rate of speed. The objects leading edge was at about a 15 degree dive the whole 8 seconds that I was able to view the object before it totally disappeared into the tree line. There was a high layer of clouds in the sky and this object was below the layer. I dialed 911 and was told that I was the fifth person to report the unexplained flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports about this incident.

Three couples have reported seeing green lights in the area where the ladies had the missing time. Although this sighting report is a bit earlier in July, we still may have a connection to the whole case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw in mid- July may have left evidence of some sort if you would like to look into it further.  Sometime in the middle of July 2003 before I went to bed I smoked a cigarette on my back balcony facing I think SW looking towards the mountains behind my house. It was around midnight and I seen this bright neon green light lighting up the base of the mountain moving slowly along. There is rolling hills directly behind my house. Behind those hills a draw with ponds up those hills complete grass until it reaches a mountain same parallel as Black Mountain that is the ridge I am talking about but behind black mountain towards the back country in the direction of Ellison  more it is hard to explain. Anyways this bright green light moved around level with where the trees would about be.  This light I saw was not too high in the sky. I kept watching it didn&#39;t know what it was figure a UFO again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weird thing  at 2 am that morning sirens woke me up and I was very disturbed so I went outside for a cigarette and it looked like a huge forest fire coming towards my house, flames in the air and I couldn&#39;t tell how far away the fire was so I woke up my boyfriend and we started running around wetting everything down.  Later that morning my hubby went to work, no sleep sadly, and he drove down Lahka Rd to see how far fire was away. About 5 acres away we estimated. Strangely enough these fires started way back away from the roads, way up the hill pass the houses in the middle of a grass field up towards the mountain.(the night I saw that green Light!)  I  have kept wondering how the fire could have started because it really was an odd spot to start. There was no lightening that night either. Clear sky. Never heard about this huge grass fire on the news! (dumpster fires make the news) My neighbors didn&#39;t even know the fire happened! I know the previous week to this fire that someone through a carelessly discarded cigarette into a ditch off Mackenzie rd not far from here but I was thinking that maybe you might want to just take a walk up to those fields that were burnt and have a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Or ask the fire dept if they know the cause of  that  fire. Interesting. Fire was basically on Lakha Rd or Latta Rd (Lakha turns in Latta after a little ways)but way way up the hill where there is no road. You can see the 2 large burnt patches if you are driving down Hwy 97 towards Kelowna just a little ways past airport look at the hills on left hand side before you reach the Old Vernon Rd set of lights.Or turn up Old Vernon Rd and look straight. Well I thought I would share this with you in case someone else may have witnessed that green light and then big grass fire the same night.   oh, that light by the way was not a plane. I see planes all the time because I live quite close to airport.  This did not move like a plane and it was not a helicopter( too dark for a chopper and it would not be out at 12 am) I would have heard it for sure because sound carries well out where I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

I went to pick them up and took them to bingo.  They said to come back at 10:30 to pick them up.  I arrived before 10:30 and just waited in the van.  I got out a couple of times to have a cigarette and walked around, but it was when I got back in the van and was just waiting that I saw something real different.  I was looking out the window at some trees across the street and pretty far away.  There was a space shaped like a &#34;U&#39; between two treetops, and I saw a red sphere cross this open space between the trees.  I kept looking all over to see it some more, but couldn&#39;t or didn&#39;t.  Now it was unlike anything man made in that it slipped so effortlessly through the sky, and there was no sound.  Planes would be real sluggish compaired to this effortless slipping through the sky of this red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/14/03 15:33|Beaverton|OR|Oval|21 min|White-pink oval object seen & photo'd while rising up thru high cloud.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32410.html|264|ndxe200307| White-pink oval object seen &amp; photo&#39;d while rising up thru high cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking along Canyon Road facing east, I sighted a pink-white oval canted down at left, up at right.  It seemed to be 2000 to 3000 feet above ground level, moving slowly toward me at elevation, and then began rising slowly.  I had a digital camera with me and proceeded to snap some photos, and one movie mode clip, on two separate memory cards.  The object seemed to color shift from more white to more pink, then darker pink, as it rose up into some cloud cover.  I had observed the clouds being formed earlier.  They were a combination of jet contrails/chemtrails that had fanned out into cloud, and some fast forming &#39;popcorn&#39; clouds which seemed to come out of nowhere to become thicker, more dense cloud along with the jet trails.  The object changed its attitude from low at left side, to low at the right side and high at the left, in other words it became pitched in the opposite direction.  it also seemed to change size and clarity, not with respect to rising and becoming smaller, but as it entered the cloud cover it became smaller and more like a bright point of light than an oval shape.  This is also the point at which its attitude pitched over the other way, as described above.  As it rose up into the cloud cover it changed to a double oval shape, still pitched, with the lower oval magenta in color, the upper one pale yellow with a green luminous fringe, and the two ovals were separated by about half their thickness by two or three balls of dark blue color.  Size of the object was small, perhaps 1/10 of my thumb width held out at arm&#39;s length.  I had paused to take the photos, but as I had filled both camera memory cards, I put away the gear and continued walking east on Canyon Road.  The object had risen above the cloud cover, reaching a height over 30,000 feet, and became lost.  It never really stood completely still, and rose vertically and moved horizontally mostly to the west and south, but in no regular pattern, only that of its own apparent making.  It made no sound.  One aircraft! was seen flying near the object near the end of the sighting, but I had already filled the memory cards.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then saw it move upwards over some trees, then it moved back down below them, then up over the trees again.

We also saw 2 dots revolving around each other and flashing brightly. At that time, as we were looking at the dots, two commercial airliner almost collided! It was very bizzare and all 7 of us agreed that this sighting was something from a different planet. What made it even more bizzare was the amount of military aircraft that followed.

Between two clouds of a mostly clear sky looking due east at a 45 degree angle, I saw a large object at about 5000 ft(based upon cloud height I received from Weather Bureau) I initially thought was a balloon. Then I noticed two dots moving below the object and thought they were skydivers, However, the dots did not descend but moved independently around the large object,made no sound and emitted a bright light. I asked my three friends, what&#39;s that? All the objects were moving *very* slowly from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One friend counted nine point objects, then saw one of them disappear as it moved toward the large object, I counted eight point objects. One friend brought out some 10x30 binoculars. Viewed through the binoculars the large object had some shadows, was deltoid or teardrop shaped with the smaller end pointed down,silver grey color, some portions emitting light. The smaller objects remained points of light and meandered independently in groups of 2, 3 or 4 around the large object as if they were taking in the view of the nearby Delaware Water Gap.

The view from the back of the parks department building is beautiful and peaceful. Plus the view is clear to the horizon, which is very rare in Brroklyn.  While I was looking out over the Marsh, I saw a flash of light from the sky.  I looked up and saw the usual planes comming and going because I live close to JFK and La Guarida Airports. But there was an object comming up from the south and heading in a Northerly direction that did look like or act like a jet.  This object which I watched for 15 minutes was spherical in shape and had a light gray metalic color to it.  It was high above the clouds which made it impossible to see any other features on this craft.  I did not see any flashing lights on it either. At first the craft was comming up from the south in a straight line.  What made it different from the jets is that is was wobbling as it was moving and it wasn&#39;t on the same path as all the other jets were. The weather this day was clear with a few fair weather clouds in the sky.  I know that it was high up because a cloud passed in front of it and I lost sight of it for a moment, while all the jets in the area were flying below the clouds.  After watching for several minutes, the craft went off its course and started following one of the jets that was heading in an easterly direction. What bothered me it that the craft descended a bit while doing this and I thought for a moment it was going to crash into the jet. As this was happening a cloud was passing by and I noticed that the craft went behind the cloud and the jet was in front of it which means there must of still been some height distance between the two. Then the unidentified craft switched directions and start heading away from the jet in a westerly direction.  It did that for a couple of minutes, then turned into a northerly direction.  The craft was getting closer to me, not straight above me but still ! on an angle when a large cloud came by.  It took a couple of minutes for the cloud to pass.  When it did the craft was gone.  As a said earlier I watched this craft for 15 minutes before it went behind the large cloud.  It was not moving fast at all, more like a slow meandering pace.  I am somewhat interested in UFO&#39;s and have visited this site in the pass to see what&#39;s going on in the tri-state area.  I probably  would not have filed this report if I hadn&#39;t seen two other reports from my area on the same day.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this in the 43 years I&#39;ve been alive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

After pointing it out to others around him on the beach I eventually located one myself. At first I could not see what the others were able to see, then it came into focus. The one that I was able to view was of a different shape. The day was a perfect beach day, the sky was blue with puffy white clouds. The object that I saw along with the others appeared to be very high up. It&#39;s color could have been white or silver and long in shape. We live near JFK and Laguardia airports and are very familiar whith the various types of aircraft flying overhead. Whether it be a large jet, sometimes the the Concord, or small private planes flying along the coastline this object in no way resembled anything we have ever seen before. I am a World Trade Center survivor by only minutes and live less than a 1000 feet from the plane crash in Belle Harbor. While I was still looking at this object in the sky I called 911 and reported what I saw. I was thinking more along the lines of some terrorist controlled satellite than a spaceship of some sort. I am the kind of person who would sleep better if this could be explained logically. I have never seen anything like this before and when I mentioned it to a relative that wasn&#39;t there she said she heard of places where people can report such sightings and that is how I wound up here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. I drew a quick sketch for a co-worker only  later to find it resembled a photo that a women took in Seattle WA that appears on your website.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were visible for only a second or two, would fade out, and reappear in roughly the same location in the sky, but had moved in relation to one another.  I watched this for three minutes or so, ran to get my camera, and tried to get some shots.  After a few more minutes the lights disappeared.  My camera was on auto focus and I don&#39;t think my pictures will turn out.  I&#39;ll be ready if they come again this week.  I&#39;m a huge skeptic but these lights truly have me confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in the front passenger seat of the car. It was sunny, and there were clear skies, except for a few clouds. I was just observing outside and I kind of slouched in my seat a bit. Then I looked forward, out the windshield and saw a dark grayish object moving very slowly to the right. What got my attention was how slow it was moving. It didn&#39;t look like a plane at all. It was long and thin like a cylinder, but for all I know it could have been round and I was just seeing it from the side. It was in front of the clouds, and it reflected sunlight at each end of it, like a metal object would. I watched it for about a minute, then reached down for my binoculars which were at my feet to get a closer look. When I looked back up, the object was gone. I thought it might have just disappeared behind the cloud for a moment, so I kept my eyes on the cloud for a good 5 minutes, but it never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Incident is reported to have occurred at 16:00 hrs.

It travelled from right to left across highway approximately at the horizon, just above the treeline.  The left-most side of the object was slanted downwards and the right-most side was slanted upwards.  The angle was about 15-20 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remarked to my wife (sitting next to me) what I saw and if she saw it too.  She did not see it.  I lost sight of it as it continued on it&#39;s course behind the trees.  I did not see it again, but continued to look for it.  I&#39;m not sure how far down the road it was from our car but it had to be at least 10km (about 6 miles).  It did not look like a plane, balloon or anything else I have seen in the sky.  It had to be quite large.  I say this because I watched it cross the road in clear view and from my position and it&#39;s entire length was visible between the trees on either side of the road!  Someone else must have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this turns out to be something easily dismissed, then I&#39;m sorry I wasted your time, but I cannot reconcile what I saw.  If someone can explain it, I would be interested in knowing what it is that I did see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/13/03 09:00|Sacramento|CA|Unknown|1-2 minutes|The UFO was an unusually bright white light moving slowly in a north to southward direction.|7/23/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29850.html|280|ndxe200307| The UFO was an unusually bright white light moving slowly in a north to southward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:00 am Sunday morning on July 13th, 2003 while leaving a local store I noticed a very &#34;bright white light&#34; in the sky. It was already warming up that morning as we had been experiencing over 100º days, and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky. The object caught my eye because of its intensity. I thought it odd that a light could be so bright during the daylight hours. As I pulled out to exit the store parking lot and get on the street I lost sight of the object momentarily as there was a building in the way. Once on the street and proceeding in a westward direction I again was able to see the object that appeared to be heading in a north to southard direction. The speed reminded me of a helicopter that is very common to the area whether they be a news helicopter of sheriff&#39;s traffic helicopter, i.e., it was moving slowly. I wouldn&#39;t guess the altitude, but it was lower then the commercial jets seen coming and going from the Sacramento Airport. Once seeing the object again when I entered the street I immediately pulled over to watch it. I watched it for under a minute and it just seemed to disappear. That is to say that light just &#34;blinked off&#34; and I couldn&#39;t see any craft  in it&#39;s place. I couldn&#39;t discern any type of shape as it just seemed to be a &#34;light in the sky.&#34; Being an investigator/researcher of anomalous aerial phenomenon since the 70&#39;s, I pay a good deal of attention to what flies  overhead. Although, I can&#39;t say what the object was, I can say with certainty it wasn&#39;t a plane or a helicopter. During the event the object/light never changed colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to the used book store to see if they had set aside any books of UFOs or Abductions for me. They told me of a person having been in the day before talking about having seen a UFO. I asked them to have him contact me if they remembered who it was. I was contacted and this is the info I was given. I have asked if I could interview this person, but consent has not been given as of yet. I do have permission to report it in case anyone else saw something on this date or near here. &#34;I was sitting outside for an early morning smoke. Saw a bright light dead stop to &#34;warp&#34; speed started off in the north in a straight line then went to 35-30% stopped. Did this 4 or 5 times then took off to the East a &#34;warp&#34; speed.

I went out to smoke a cigarette in my front yard and as I was looking up at the sky became aware of an unusual object flying extremely fast, high in the sky directly over my house.The color was a dull orange (similar to the street lights) and the best way to describe the shape was a rectangular crescent. The middle of the object projected slightly ahead of the sides.I do not know how to estimate altitude I only know the object seemed very high up.The size was about as wide as my index fingernail and half as thick.   The light was steady, no blinking. I realized it would soon be blocked from sight by my roofline so I ran thru my house out the back door telling my 15 year old son as I went that &#34;there is something in the sky&#34;.When I got back outside it had vanished. At the rate of speed it was going when I last saw it, it should have been still visible. Though I believe there are UFO&#39;s in our skies I tend to be highly skeptical and my husband told me I had probably seen the space station or satellite so I didn&#39;t report it yesterday. Today I went online and find out the space station looks like a star, definitely not what I saw and it was definitely not an airplane, blimp, etc. so what was it???!!!<n>

Then it suddenly got a lot closer moving in short bursts towards me, then disappearing only to appear in another location and continuing its movements.  After a couple of minutes it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was getting too late for the boys 9 and 12) to be out so we started packing up the telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of nowhere it seems(though I believe it flew from the north) this giant, swirling mass of light appeared in the sky. It was no particular shape, but was more like an egg in a frying pan, or an amoeba.  It changed its shape, and its size as well. It appeared to go farther away, then closer, then farther, this could explain the apparent size change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it pulsing there for at least 30 minutes, my wife wanted to call the police but I assured her that it would not help. All of a sudden, the white, bright thing began to change colors, first to a reddish brown, then to a dark cobalt blue, and finally it culminated(and stayed) at a dark steel gray color, that was still as visible as the original object(for it shined so).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This color transformation took perhaps 10 minutes. Then the craft began an ascent, higher and higher it went as it spiraled around, and then at the end of our time watching it, it came down, very, very quickly. It came so close to our house and the trees around us that the trees actually shook, and the grass waved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My kids were scared and I admit, I was also, my wife ran inside, and you could feel the heat from the thing. Then there was a sudden coolness, calmness, and just a general feeling of peace about the place as we watched it inch towards us. It took on a more readily noticeable shape, something like a circle, and shot into the sky, disappearing on its way up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never told anyone about this and told the wife and kids to not tell anyone, either. But we all saw it, and we are all either crazy or it was really there.<n>

Note: about four minutes later we were on an adjacent road and viewed a jet, clearly visible against the moon, heading southwest, the opposite of the craft. the jet picked up speed and we have agreed that it had to have been going at least mock 1, because of the jetstream and the length of time it took to clear our view(at least a four mile radious, we stopped by a field) we contiued to watch the sky for a moment and about 1 to 2 minutes later two more jets were visibly seen goin! g northeast toward the craft. they too were flying exeptionally fast. one came from the southwest, the other from the west. getting closer to each other, then they left our line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Constant speed and direct slow path across the sky at a very high altitude. The thing that stumped me was to see it clearly appear and grow brighter while remaining absolutely stationary relative to the other stars visible and then a grow dimmer and THEN start to move in the drifting like unchanging arc across the sky like you see with Sattelites. It was clearly stationary first. Almost as if something entering orbit?

I observed a elongated egg shaped object , glowing white in color . It looked like a shimmering sidways flame . The nose ( nose cone/ front ) of this object wavered like it was emitting heat . This object was seen in the southeastern night sky from my location and went from west to east direction . Its flight was very fast with a straight path and jerky movements . It made no sound what so ever . The object was above tree top level and above the power lines . At arms length it was larger than my fist . Actually , the object was almost in my back yard .Timing of sighting was less than five seconds and awe inspiring . Hoping someone else saw this .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting in a south direction.  The window was quite large and I was enjoying looking out the window in a southeast direction towards the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 6 and 6:30 pm, I noticed in the distance, in this same southeast direction, over the lake a hot-air-balloon-type object or a blimp-shaped object.  Sometimes, it even looked eye-shaped or oval-shaped.  It didn&#39;t look a plane.  It caught my attention because it seemed to stay stationary for a number of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my wife what she thought and she agreed that it didn&#39;t look like an airplane.  I was keeping an eye on it during our dinner conversation.  I noticed that it moved slowly eastward and out of view due to a southeast building a couple of times, then back into view.  Again it appeared to stay fairly stationary for a few more minutes.  Eventually, it moved westward out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent an email to the Toronto Island Airport this evening to find out if maybe there had been a slow-moving object over the lake towards the Etobicoke area of Toronto around this time, but I haven&#39;t received a reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark black to silver colour against the clouds on the horizon.  It didn&#39;t appear to be a cloud because it was staying somewhat stationary.  The wind was gusty at the time. I could see the upper tree branches moving around Dundas Street West along with the clouds (they appeared to be moving south).  I&#39;m not sure what it was, but it made the dinner conversation more interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The apartent complex has a clear view of some of the foothills in california&#39;s inland empire, real close to them also. i noticed something come from over the mountains to the west of the peak. it was raising in altitude. it had an oval shape, i kept looking at it to see if it would turn and i would be able to tell if it be a plane or helicopter. no it wouldnt it had a dull silver color to it. it went pretty high up and proceeded to move east over the mountains, near the end of the mountains it started going , away from them to the east of us. as if it was making a giant circle around the valley. we kept an eye on it so one of us could go find something to zoom in on it, couldnt . my friend lost visual with it but i still had it for a while. then i lost it, it made no noise whatsoever which is why i started being suspicious of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked up and saw a very bright light.  I stared at the light and it seemed to know I was watching it.  As I was staring at the light, I suddenly realized that I was lying on the porch that I was recently smoking on.  I jumped to my feet, and the light was still there as it was before.  As I looked at the light like I was mesmerized, it began to get smaller and smaller until it seemed to be sucked into another dimension or something.  As it disappeared for my vision, there was a loud &#34;boom&#34; sound that was loud enough to wake my wife up.  She heard the boom, but she did not see the light.  A lot of strange things happened after this incidence, but I will not go into that because it really creeped me and my wife out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked to be over maybe Islip Terrace or so....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made the next exit onto a side street to see the helicopter, but it was blocked out by trees.  Instead, going northwest towards Brentwood and Commack, I saw a pair of red lights side by side.  They looked pretty far apart, so if they were on airplane wingtips, either the plane was very large, or flying very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gotten out of my vehicle by this point and heard nothing.  I also saw no other lights between them to suggest any kind of airplane I&#39;ve ever seen (like a tail light or something).  It kept moving away from me at a pretty fast pace and faded from view in the northwest sky.<n>

I was just enjoying the evening light as it was fading in the mountains and scanning the horizon.  To the Northwest at 8:50pm I saw 3 lights in a triangular formation just above the mountains: the brightness was unlike a street light that has the appearance of shards radiating from it...these lights were brilliant, clear bluishwhite and were perfectly round.  The distance would not allow me to tell if there was one object or three.  I could not believe what I was seeing, just sitting there in the distance, because I had always wanted to see a UFO.   But there was no doubt in my mind, I was fixated.  I stared at them, the lights,  for about a 2 minutes and they winked out... just gone...even though I could see nothing but 3 lights I wanted to look some more.....all of a sudden, about 2-3 minutes later there were bursts of rapid firing light (similar to anti-aircraft fire, but they had no arc to them) from the ground (they were rectangular shaped and there was about 10 - 12 of them one behind the other). I could see nothing in the direction the lights were traveling but about the time the last light reached a certain height (approximately 2 inches to the right of my original sighting if you hold a ruler at arms length) there were several objects that streaked off in about a 30-45 degree angle from where I saw the AAA lights.   It was very much like watching ships in star trek going into warp,,,,it was amazing....I called to a mechanic in the room behind me to come out,  we saw nothing but there was a jet that appeared to be of stealth origins flying low over the mountains without lights heading in the general direction of my sighting the mechanic then left. I returned to work at 9:10pm. (well, I was a little late going back)<n>

I have become very interested in seeing if I could possibly see any of these &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; for myself that so many people report seeing. This evening was my preverbial paydirt for my diligent efforts in looking to to the sky above. I was looking in a North Westerly direction close to were the Sun was getting ready to set and saw the object. The object must have been fairly good size one because I could see it very clearly. But, I also know that this object was some distance away from me. The object was Elliptical or Oval shaped with a whitish silvery appearance. I really could see a very defined white-silver oval shaped object. The object appeared to be stationary for a few moments and then all of a sudden it shot straight up and to the left then it stopped for a brief second or two and then shot down to the right at a very high rate of speed and again it stopped.The object then flew off very fast toward the horizon. I lost track of it and assumed that it accelerated so fast that it just vanished. I still can&#39;t believe that I really saw this object but I truly did! It shook me up a little, kind of felt tingly feeling all over after seeing it. I am a Manager at a Logistics Center here in Spring Hill and I am of sound mind. I definately know what I saw and it wasn&#39;t an airplane, hot air balloon, swamp gas, chem-trails or anything else. I however, do not know if this was possibly a military craft because I did see 2 blackhawk helicopters and a Stealth Fighter flying around not to long after seeing this object.It may be worthy to note that they were flying in the direction of where I saw the object. My only regret after seeing this object was that I didn&#39;t have my camera with me. I will keep looking overhead and see if I can spot this thing again, but this time I think I&#39;ll have my camera handy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the first seconds, I thought perhaps it was a white helium balloon drifting overhead, but it seemed too steady and deliberate to be a balloon. I ran outside as it flew right over; my best guess is that it was about a mile up.  The sun was in my eyes but I caught sight of the object again as it continued on, apparently heading directly east.  The ground level winds were variably, but mostly coming from the N/NE.  I watched the clouds, which were primarily over the mountains to the west, and, noted that they were drifting primarily in a southerly direction (and probably easterly as well).  Whatever this was, it seemed to move by its own volition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I&#39;ve noticed and reported similar objects outside my office here in Littleton.

I thought I saw a starr moving, I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks on me. I squinted a couple times and focused more intently, there were three. They wwere the exact same magnitude, size and appeared to be distant stars, a constellation like that of Pisces. But, they glided slowly across the sky from south to north, never breaking formation.

I do believe that we are not alone in this universe. To many events in the world&#39;s history as well as sightings around the world point to this fact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Envent: (Don&#39;t know if it is UFO)  Place: In Southeastern Oklahoma Approxiately 30 Miles north of the Texas border and 20 miles west of Durant Oklahoma, United States of America, I observed the following events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actual Event Description: On a whim I went outside my house and looked to the eastern sky. A bright light &#34;Not Bright White - more like cream in color&#34; was stationary in the ski. It was 10 - 20 times the size of a bright star. Compared with the width of my index finger held 1 foot from my face, the light was approximately 1/8&#34; wide.  It was not moving from what I could tell as I continued to watch this light for some 15 minutes. The intensitive of the light stayed constant. My best unqaulified guess of altitude of this light was 3,000 - 5,000 feet based on aircraft flying at an altitude of 15,000 feet in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the observation of this stationary light in the ski, I said to myself, if you are an alien ship you are asked to land on my farm land, your are welcomed. I did not chuckle as I was serious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 1 hour later and just after falling asleep in my bed, I was awakened by a quick jerk of my head to the right and some type of pressure was pushing down on my head with just enough force to cause me some panic and then the pressure rolled accrossed the right side of my head toward the top of my skull. It felt like a long loaf of bread was being dragged accross my head but with pressure against my head. This occurred over a very short period of time. What I estimate to be some 2 - 3 seconds and it felt real as if someone or something else was in the room with me. But, I was alone in my room. Shaking and chilled all over, I went back outside and there were clouds throughout the ski and I could not locate the light I had seen an hour earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this event occurred I did not have any unusual stressers in my life. I do not drink or take any drugs of any kind. Nothing. I do work at night as I sleep during the hot days of oklahoma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will look at the ski ever night from now to see if the light re-appears and will forward any other events of this type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever seen a stationary light in the sky as such and never any spirit or ghostly occurances in my house. Although, this house was moved to this farm about 7 months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me know if anyone else has ever reported any similar event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) Madill, OK<n>

I closed my eyes &amp; opened them again &amp; saw the light again &amp; said humm it must be a start. Then I said that is to low to be a start I then got out pulled back my curtain &amp; looked at it. I saw that there was not flashing lights like a plane &amp; that it looked like it was trying to keep it&#39;s balance. It was in the same basic spot moving side to side just a bit like I said maybe to keep it&#39;s balance is the only way to put it. I then called my son in the room to come &amp; look at it we watched it for a couple of hours. At one point the light fadded out to a pin point &amp; then became bright again. We watched it move around &amp; it looked like a red color would appear on the UFO like in the middle of it not a dot of red like it was a red smear forming in front of our eyes. This was not a plane this was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The airport is largely disused now, althought the military do have a presence there. We saw a light, too bright to be a planet, approx. 25-30 degrees above the horizon, over the local town of Ramsgate. As we came closer to the airport on the local highway, which was deserted, the craft moved over the adjacent runway. It then began to hover, with only a single, constant white light. Soon after, two red lights appeared and the white one dissappeared. It looked as though they were on the original object. once we had passed the object we saw 3-4 airport emergency vehicles with flashing orange lights racing down the runway towards the still hovering object/s. Looking back, the red lights were flashing, and between flashes they would violently, but in tandem, change altitude and orientation. As we came into Ramsgate, with nothing behind us but fields and an airport with the lights overhead, two police cars passed us heading to the airport at approx. 90-100 mph, with lights on but no sirens. we observed the object from home for approximately 40 minutes before it simply disappeared vertically upwards above cloud cover, but remaining the same orientation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However when magnified 40x using the camcorder, it seemed to be a linear, closer to a rectangle.  When the craft moved it turned colors...4-5 bars or light...it appeared to turn several colors:  yellow, orange, blue, purple and back to yellow.  It seem to be heading towars the moon.  The batteries on the camcorder died at around 2:15p.  However when my brother check on it again...it was being over shadowed by the light of the moon, and disappeared into it.<n>

Coming through the cloud at regular quick bursts, were bright lights in the shape of a stationary isocelese triangle.  It&#39;s hard to judge the size due to the cloud, but it was around 40 ft?  On the hypotenuse.  There was no noise, and no breeze that night.  My brother woke his wife up to see it.  It spooked her, so they went back inside.  I stayed outside for 20 minutes watching the lights, until the cloud dissipated.  It did not drift so much as dissipate.  I could still see faint lights as the cloud moved away, with the lights seeming to be on their side.  The neighborhood was asleep, there were no streetlights, no cellphone towers around, nothing.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but have ruled out streetlights,cellphone towers, and helipcopters, harriers etc as these make noise.  I wish that I had had a camera, or that I&#39;d thought to call the police to see if anyone else had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Film footage of object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This witness read my article which was in the August 15th edition of the Capital News of the Okanagan, &#34;Seeking Witnesses to UFO.&#34; The fellow went on to tell me a pretty interesting story, plus he has video footage to back up his claim, which he is going to get to me very soon. He wanted to mention that he had never been a big believer in UFOs, but after July 10, 2003 his thinking may have changed a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness was sitting on his front steps in Winfield, British Columbia and looking to his west into the starry night. He spotted the Big Dipper, the handle of it when he saw what looked like a satellite moving horizontally towards the Big Dipper and across it. The fellow said to himself, &#34;this is really moving fast&#34;, what is this? The object was flying still horizontally through the sky, when it passed by the Big Dipper it changed direction on a dime and shot back and up. But as he watched the object traveling in an upwards motion, it came to a complete stop. The gentleman had a Sony camera with him at the time and happened to capture approx: 2 minutes of footage which he is getting to me soon. But he said he was able to follow the object around as it performed these strange maneuvers. He tells me the footage is rather good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

As the object continue to descend at a angle of about 135 degrees it grew brighter and brighter( about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length) until it just flared out before it went behind the mountains. We, my wife and I both pyschologically prepared ourselves to what we expected to be a loud explosion as it disappeared in the mountain range to the east of the interstate, but there was no impact. The interstate was pretty  busy and no one could have missed this display. Funny it hasn&#39;t been previously reported. Most classic display of what we think was a meteorite entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the witness&#39;s observation that there are no other reports in our database for this apparently dramatic aerial event.

I noticed it too and since we were at a concert I had a monocular.  I used it to look closer and saw a totally black triangular object that appeared to be at least a thousand feet or more above ground.  My daughter, her sister and my wife each eventually looked at the object through the monocular.  My wife who is a pilot insists that it was not like any flying object she has ever seen. Each of us took turns the next day drawing a picture of what we saw. Without any help from each other we all drew the same item. There were no lights (on the object) and no reflection from the sun.  The object eventually became impossible to see as the sun went down. It made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife and I were at home in Spokane, listening to our Police scanner when we suddenly heard frantic reports of a large orange colored light hovering over fairchild Airforce Base. Many Deputy Sheriffs on patrol observed the &#34;sphere of light&#34; and were discussing it on the police radio. From where we live, we could hear jets being put in the air with the unmistakable sound of after burners propelling them. Not long after the radio traffic concerning this light began, a deputy reported that the craft was moving off in a south easterly direction and soon afterwards, the shift supervisor for dispatch ordered talk of this incident silenced and they must have switched over to a tac frequency as we heard nothing more about it on the scanner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We fully expected this incident to be on the local news or in the local paper, but found no report had been made public,at least to our knowledge! I am not certain of the year, it may have been earlier or later by a year or two. I would love to find out what went on with this thing! By the way, when I was a kid living in Harrington, my older brother and some friends attempted to explore the old missle base, but too much water in the tunnel leading down stopped us at the corner where the strategic air command symbol was displayed on the wall!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Man made planes were in the area. But the planes came and went. Like the object was not even there. I have observed these objects for a whole month. I have counted three or more at a time. They are here still but in different areas. Our weather has been shoty the last two days so our star gazing night skys have been coverd in clouds but, you can still see the objects. If anyone lives in the collingsworth area wait for complete darkness and look for a colored star remember where you saw it and where it ended up at. My sister aswell sees them in california.

Approximately at midnight a star-like object appears to rise in the sky from the Southeast and then travels toward Mt. Rose and Mount Slide near Reno, Nevada. For a time it will stop there, and then travels Southwest until it arrives where it is vertically visable from my bedroom. It remains there until about 4:30 A.M. and then begins to move South again. It is brighter than the North Star. I can&#39;t really call this a UFO because it looks like a star, but I have never seen stars traverse the heavens in this manner before. Fallon Air Base is near here, but this had no characteristics of an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  All stars appear to &#34;rotate&#34; around &#34;Polaris,&#34; the north star, because the Earth is rotating on its axis.

7/9/03 23:30|Barra do Tejuco (Rio de Janeiro) (Brazil)||Unknown|5-7 minutes|Huge shapeless cluster of red and blue green lights with sporadic white stobe-like flashes floating over Barra, Rio de Janeiro.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29762.html|322|ndxe200307| Huge shapeless cluster of red and blue green lights with sporadic white stobe-like flashes floating over Barra, Rio de Janeiro.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me begin this by saying that I am filing this because I ALMOST DIDN&#39;T, and wondered how often THAT happens. It occurred 1 week ago, and at the time, my companion and I were so freaked out that we just drove around and talked about it, making phone calls to anyone we could think of to see if anyone else had seen it. As I was on vacation in Brazil, it was very difficult as an American citizen to figure out who the hell to call in the first place. My friend, a Brazilian, had no idea either. We searched the web the next day but found nothing. I vowed to return to the States and make sure that anyone else looking to see if someone else saw this particular &#39;whatever&#39; could at least have a chance of finding me/this account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to further predicate this report by making the all too common declarations of &#34;I&#39;m not crazy, and this isn&#39;t b-s&#34;. I am a licensed attorney in Florida. My friend is a genius and was admitted to both MIT and Harvard. In short, we are sober, sane, intelligent people not given to mistaking blimps, planes, helicopters, weather balloons, the aurora borealis or gases from deep within the bowels of the earth for what we saw for about 6 or 7 minutes last Wednesday, the 9th of July, 2003 at approximately 11:30 p.m. I hope that someone contacts me to get a better account, clue me in to other reports of this incident,  or to give me a lie detector to find out that we saw something, and I seriously doubt that it was &#39;one of ours&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, it is not as spectacular as being a description with photos or a definate shape. We actually started racing back to the hotel to get the digital camera when we lost it, ore rather it lost us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know is what follows: My frind and I had just dropped off his brother at a restaurant in the City of Barra (do Tejuco) about 10 minutes south of Copa Cobana in Rio de Janeiro. We were driving north towards Copa and were about 4 miles south of the tunnel that takes you under a mountain separateing Barra and the Ipanema, Le Blon, and Copa area. It was somewhat overcast, I beleive, at least it was hazy, you could see a pinkish orange haze in the sky reflecting the electric lights of the area below. I was in the passenger seet, and was looking at my friend in mid sentence when I saw whatever it was in the sky behind his head. I&#39;m pretty sure my exact words were &#34;what is that thing, dude?&#34; to which he responded &#34;the mount---&#34; as he turned to look, assuming I was looking at one of the numerous mountains in the area. He never finished the word mountian, instead switching immediately to a decidedly excited &#34;what the f is THAT???&#34;. We immediatley pulled over to the side of the road, in front of a guard gate with a private security guard who started toward us to investigate us as we were hopping out of the car. We immediatley started pointing at the &#39;thing&#39; and he joined us in trying to figure out what we were looking at. More accurately, I was making sure of what I wasn&#39;t looking at, that I was indeed seeing something worth reporting here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hanging in the sky to our west, in plane sight, was a huge cluster of lights. I apologize for the banality of the description, but as much as we strained to focus on it, we couldn&#39;t see any dark shape upon which these lights would be affixed. It therefore made it very difficult to determine how far away it was, or how big it was. My best guess was that it was about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away, probably about 500 feet in the air. It seemed to be totally silent, but the traffic noise or the direction of the wind could have masked sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t even say that it was 1 of 100 things, although it seemed to be one object or cluster moving together. It was covered in red and greenish blue lights that pulsed and flickered. Some would get really bright. while others would disappear completely only to seem to grow bright out of complete darkness in almost but not exactly the same place as before. This was a lot of the reason why we couldn&#39;t figure out what we were looking at or if there was more that one. I&#39;d say that there was 40 to 50 of these red lights and blue-green lights in a kind of sideways L shape. The at times seemed totally disjointed, and at other times they seemed to pair up. All around this cluster were another 30 or 40 pure white flashing strobe-like lights. They weren&#39;t flashing in any kind of pattern, it looked more like machine gun muzzle flashes in the dark, only pure white and 500 feet in the air. It was moving slowly north and we watched it dumbfounded for about 5 minutes, when we stupidly figured we could make it the 3 miles back to my friends condo and grab his digital camera. I wish I had sat where I was and watched it more carefully, but it didn&#39;t seem to be in any hurry to leave, or very concerned about being seen. You could see other people along the sidewalk looking at it and pointing to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hopped in the car and started racing back to get the camera, all the while watching this cluster in the sky. My friend, driving, was watching too, which had me a little distracted because he is a lunatic behind the wheel when he&#39;s watching the road and not racing to get a camera to capture evidence of something we know was not supposed to be there. We weere in the car for about 45 seconds and nearing the U-turn to go back when the lights started popping off. Some would flicker and fade, then come back, then go altogether. The red and green/blues seemed to come together and then go. Less and less of the white flashes were visible. We were coming into a more ligthed area, so I thought for a second that that was the problem. However, as we got into a little bit of a darker area (between us and the cluster) we could see that there were definatley less lights, and withing another 10 seconds we were down to one final white light that was no longer flashing, but pulsed out one final time and then there was notheing but the orange-pink haze and the outling of a nearby mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SO,,, am I crazy, is there another explanation, because we are not making this up, and I&#39;ve seen enough of our own manmade stuff to know that this wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate, even though the event had occurred less than a week earlier.

They were very high up and moving quite slowly. At first We thought that it might be satalites but, they were moving much too slow and too perfectly aligned. The lights never changed in intensity, color or distance from each other. There was 1 in front and the other 2 were behind and to the sides. We could see stars pass through the formation as it moved, so I&#39;m sure it was not a solid structure/craft with marker lights. We watched the formation until it went completely out of view to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been witness to the U. S.

The lights took the shape of a triangle and moved from west to the east directly above me. No sound was heard. The lights were extremely high in the air. At first looked like a satellite until I notice the other two light forming the triangle. The light held the triangle shape and moved in unison. The lights were white with an orange outer rim in color. They did not blink, just moved silently across the sky. Too high for airplanes, moved a little slower than a fast moving satellite. I was able to follow it from directly above me, across the sky, until it disappeared in the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Wasn&#39;t sure whether or not it would burn itself out or smash into the ground.  Burned out after 3-5 seconds.  Never seen anything that dramatic and that size fall out of the sky.  Initially thought it was someone shooting fireworks but quickly realized it was much too large to be shot out of someone&#39;s backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were behind this friend&#39;s house (on the outskirts of town) in a large open field with a mostly clear night (no clouds visible until 11:00pm or so). Around 9:00pm EST (when it began to get dark) we began firing off things with bright and beautiful explosions, such as artillery shells. At approximately 9:30pm we stopped shooting fireworks for a few moments when we noticed a bright red-orange light moving at about a jet&#39;s pace across the skyline. We thought it looked sort of odd, but shrugged it off and went back to shooting fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more minutes, say 9:40pm, we looked back up and noticed that the craft was moving back in the opposite direction. We decided to watch it for a few moments to try and determine what the strange light was. After staring up at the sky for a while, we noticed the craft suddenly slant itself (to where it was oriented diagonally instead of horizontally, or I assume so -- it was difficult to make out anything but the actual light itself, which seemed to cover the majority of the craft, if not all of it). After this change in orientation, it suddenly turned around and headed back towards its first direction without actually turning around or losing speed. It was just going one direction fairly quickly and suddenly decided to go the other way. About this time we also noticed that there was no smoke or contrails behind the craft, as well as no noise. The sky at this time was still perfectly clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft went back and forth (between North and East) 2-3 times, we lost interest again and went back to shooting fireworks. We continued to see the craft while shooting fireworks, and eventually my friend&#39;s little brother came up to look at the red-orange light as well, dismissing it as an airplane. How many of our aircrafts are composed of just one giant red-orange light, though?  By 10:30pm we all had made the realization that the UFO was not just moving back and forth on one side, but was actually circling our field. It was always within 1.0miles away, but never came much closer than approximately 0.5 miles. The light object would not just go in a complete circle around our field, though. Mostly I saw it move from (1) N to E to N and then under a high treeline continuing N-to-NW, (2) NW to W to NW and back under the treeline, (3) and W to SE and back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe around 10:50pm (at which point we were still shooting fireworks), we noticed the craft was staying in one position to our South, perhaps 0.75 miles away. We stopped shooting fireworks yet again so we could see what the light was doing. When we stopped shooting fireworks, the craft appeared to begin moving straight toward us rather slowly (the light was growing larger, and no trees were below it to determine its exact distance). Perhaps after reaching 0.5 miles from our spot, it stopped for a brief moment and then began heading West again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time the strange light was back to our West, I noticed an aircraft (most likely a passenger plane), SW of us which was moving West. It did not appear to be pursuing the light or to be near the UFO&#39;s actual path (the plane was much further away from us than the light). One of the witnesses to the event began shooting bottle rockets in the direction of the light around this time, which seemed to make the light linger in that one area a little longer (West of us, close to the start of the NW side of the treeline). We yelled at the guy to stop firing bottle rockets at the UFO, which he did. After he stopped, the light continued toward the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light went back under the N/NW treeline. It appeared again above the treeline, at which point a second ship came up from below the treeline to &#34;meet&#34; with it. The two ships moved somewhat close together (perhaps 10-15 yards from each other) and remained there one or two minutes (moving around some, but staying in that one area), and then both of them moved their seperate ways and quickly went under the cover of the treeline again. A moment later one of the UFO&#39;s came back out from the trees and moved W to SW and back perhaps two times, and then went behind the treeline again. This was the last sign of the ship that we saw, and was around 11:05pm or 11:10pm. Oddly enough, it went away only a few moments after we ran out of fireworks. Heh, perhaps it was watching the show...<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 11:15pm we were cleaning up the little mess we had made in the field (firework debris and containers). Around 11:20pm we began heading from the field to our friend&#39;s house (where all of our cars were parked), and had left his house by 11:45pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I forgot to mention was that there were several times during the UFO&#39;s flight that it would seem to orient itself diagonally and continue on its apparently set course with no noticeable change in speed. This, and its ability to suddenly go in opposite directions without turning around or changing speed, made me believe that the craft was nothing made by man. The UFO appeared to just be composed of that one giant red-orange light, which seemed somewhat solid. However, the light did seem to slowly pulsate a lot of the time. I&#39;d like to say again that there was absolutely no noise, smoke, etc. to accompany the light. There were no wings or propellors, and I could only make out some sort of round-ish shape (perhaps an ellipse, maybe disc-like). We attempted to record the light with a camcorder, but the girl who recorded it said she hadn&#39;t looked at the tape (as of July 13, 2003), and I doubt that it picked the object up anyway (camcorders aren&#39;t the greatest). If it did, however, show up I will submit the video and some stills from the video to try and give a better image of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would roughly estimate that the length of the ship is around thirty feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did look for some similar sightings on Google after I came home, and found some ships that look like what we witnessed...<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.iwasabducted.com/UFOPictures/ufo9.jpg http://www.iwasabducted.com/raulgarza/anniversary041499b.htm http://www.abduct.com/contact/_contpix/c21.jpg<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, NUFORC: If you would like to contact me, you can email me at the address I submitted.

It was traveling from East to West and almost appeared straight over head.  It was very high up in the atmosphere.  It was teardrop shape with the fat part flying first.  The thing was white in color.  No wings, tail, or markings.  It had a line of smoke behind it like the Columbia did when it was burning up.  It definately was not a contrail.  As it flew west, it was seen behind extremely high level fair weather clouds.  It was clearly coming in towards the Earth at an angle.  Even my young child who watches aircraft every day even asked me what that strange thing was.  It came in to the atmosphere quite quickly, but definately not as fast as a meteor.  It took minutes to cross the sky, but was faster than any jet I&#39;ve seen.  Also, 10 minutes before I saw this, a fighter plane at higher altitudes flew east to west, but not the same exact trajectory.  It had its afterburners on.  This object was still faster than that.That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard of a craft re-entering on a east to west path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  We suspect that the first possibility to be ruled out would be a short contrail behind a jet aircraft, although the witness is self-described as an experienced observer of aircraft.  The object could not have been a meteor or space debris.  Both of those categories of objects move too rapidly across the sky to be visible for 2 minutes.  PD))<n>

We do not know what it was they saw.  PD))<n>

I was facing west when I was looking at the clouds and noticed what appeared to be a cigar shaped white object, with flattened/straight ends, slowly flying westward. I first noticed the object when it was over head and about the 1:00 position. I watched it for about 2 minutes against the blue sky before it disappeared in a cloud. I did not see it come out of the cloud as my viewing was blocked by buildings. I do not know if indeed it did go into the cloud or not as the clouds where white and the object was white so with the white background I could not see it anymore. Specially since the object was flying away from me and was much smaller. About the size of a bright evening star. As to it&#39;s size, if I were looking at a airline plane, that I would assume to be flying about the same altitude, I would say it was about half a plane longer. I could not see any wings or tail wing on the object and didn&#39;t hear any sound. If I held a dime at arms length when I first saw the object, the object would be about the same diameter. The object did not leave a contrail(?) behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We hear that on occasion in our area.  Then I heard something different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I heard was a distinct and momentary whooshing noise.  The tone of the sound was in such a low frequency range that I &#34;felt it&#34; as well as heard it.  Indeed, I thought that maybe one of the aircraft was in a flat-spin and was plummeting toward the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember thinking, I wouldn’t be surprised if the aircraft wasn’t going to crash.  Indeed, I was anticipating an explosion.  I paused for an instant after getting out of the car and wondered if it was headed for the ground how any one could get out of the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lower frequency sound stopped.  I began walking toward the main entrance of the Credit Union but could still hear jet engines.  So I stopped to look up.  Most of the time when you hear jets maneuvering in the day you can’t see them but I looked up because of odd initial sound I had heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw first was a disk-like object suspended just between a high cumulus cloud structure but above the mountain ridge.  I estimate the altitude of the object to have been at about 600 feet.  The object was at least ¾’s of a mile away (SSW) from where I was standing.  The profile of the object’s shape reminded me of an aluminum garbage can lid.  It was a dull aluminum color rather than bright and shiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Momentarily the aircraft, I believe it was an F-14 with its wings extended, appeared out of the bottom of cloud cover in a relatively tight nose-down turn.  Within a second after F-14 came out of the cloud cover the disk-like object vacillated or vibrated from side-to-side for an instant and then flipped on its side.  There was a brief flash of light that came from the disk when it flipped to its side (like the sun’s reflection bouncing off of glass).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the F-14 straightened up from its nose-down attitude, I had a brief instant’s view of the aircraft’s profile and a clear view of under-belly of the disk (it appeared as a circle).  The disk suddenly disappeared and appeared in another location (about 15 to 20 degrees to the left of where it was – but at the same relative altitude) but the disk had shrunk at least half in size.  The re-sized object looked darker and more cylindrical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t actually see the disk travel to its new location although I was looking right at it.  The entire change in location and size occurred in a time frame that was less than the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The F-14 leveled out and vectored toward the disk.  The object, as if in response, simply shrunk further in size and vanished.  I saw motion whatsoever.  The object neither moved up, down, right or left.  The object simply disappeared as if a rheostat was “turned down” on the image.  Shortly thereafter I heard the sound of the engines of the aircraft that had been throttled up in pursuit.  I also heard the throttle down – as there was nothing left to pursue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what the disk-like object was.  However, I’m 100% certain it wasn’t operating under the same rules of gravity under which we operate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I heard the aircraft for more than 20 seconds but only physically observed them for 10 seconds or less)  I went into the Credit Union, stunned.  I told the lady behind the counter what I had seen.  One of the ladies next to her said, interrupted and said, “What did you see?”  I told her.  She said, “I heard it over the speakers”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will NEVER look at the sky again in the same way.  Everything that I knew about physics and aviation went right out of the window with what I observed today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m now forced to reassess all that I knew to be real.<n>

We were inside the tent, and we saw a light above us.  I got out, and saw a huge triangular craft.  It was gunmetal in color, and had bright white lights on each tip of it, with one also in the middle.  It was lighting up the yard, the lights were so bright.  It hovered over us for 10 to 12 minutes, before slowly moving off to the north. My family members who were inside at the time, heard the noise this craft was making, sort of a loud white noise sound, but didn&#39;t think to come out and check it.  The sound was pretty loud, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Im not a UFO expert but I knew this was one for sure. And so I pointed it out to my friend and we both watched this thing and then it slowly shrunk into nothing at all. After that we left and each went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Like many nights I like to float on my back and stare at the sky.  Tonight was a very clear sky no clouds at all in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden a very bright white light almost had blue around it came out of the sky like if it shot out of different dimension and i saw it pass by for 2 seconds and it looked like it went into another demension there was no sound at all i was very surprise that something could just disappear so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the reason why i don&#39;t think it was a shooting star because in the middle of this oval object was a very bright white ball of light,and it had a ring around the light that was also white. I almost looked like the planet Saturn. The bright ball of light was the planet and the ring around the planet was like a halo. I thought it was coming towards me but it all of the sudden disappeared. I wonder if i was the only one to see this i would love to find out what it was i saw i hope it was a UFO. I hope that there is others out there too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am a hobby digital photographer, so I stopped my vehicle to photograph the object. I attempted to shoot a photo, but I could not obtain focus and it was unnoticable except for a half moon glow on the forward surface in the picture. This also occured on the second. I switched the camera to a 3 shot burst mode and at that time the object began to move at a high rate of speed. With the object in the viewfinder I traversed at least 85-95 degrees in less that a second following its path. Two of the 3 photos in the burst show evidence of the craft; the second clearly shows the disclike shape. This is my first sighting of a UFO. Five friends and I may have witnessed one in 96 or 97 that was being apprehended by an aircraft that could not bank hard enough to keep up with it&#39;s 90 degree turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/8/03 20:31|Gaithersburg|MD|Oval|6 minutes|Bright object at edge of moon sat still, then moved slowly away from moon.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29613.html|339|ndxe200307| Bright object at edge of moon sat still, then moved slowly away from moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer. My wife spotted an object she thought was a planet very close to the moon. I walked outside and she asked me to look at the planet next to the moon. It was early twilight. I looked and saw what appeared to be a star or planet just at the edge of the moon. It was apparently just at the edge of the moon on the dark side of a 3/4 full moon. I watched it for maybe 30 seconds and during this time it did not move at all in relation to the moon. I was going through my mind to try and figure what planet it might be, but none came to mind that would be in that part of the sky. All of a sudden the object started moving in a direction which from my perspective was toward 2 O&#39;clock in relation to the moon. It moved much to slowly to be a satellite. It was not possible to tell if it moved in front of or behind the moon as it passed the top 1/5 of the moon. In 5 minutes it moved a little more than the width of a hand at arms length. The whole time the brightness of the object was about what the star Sirius would appear like at that time of day and it did not waver. My wife went in and got a pair of 12x50 binoculars about 2 minutes into this sighting, in the binoculars the object was no more visible than it was without them. Then as we were talking about it the object at some point disappeared, but no one actually saw it when it did finally disappeared. I did manage one digital photograph of the object with my Olympus 5 megapixel C-5050, I am sending it to you although it does not look like much. The photo shows both the object and the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can only figure it was one of two things. A balloon which very coincidentally did an apparent hover right at the point that it was resting on the very edge of the moon on the dark side and then proceeded to apparently move on and finally dissapear. The other is that it was a huge spacecraft near the moon which decided to leave while we were looking. It was certainly not a star, planet, or satellite, and it was not an airplane or jet or space shuttle. If this was a spacecraft near the moon you most certainly will have other reports of it, as it was difficult to miss.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching the developement of the storm cloud moving in under the calm clouds above when i noticed a dark spot on the edge of the storm cloud. It caught my eye because it was moving side to side in the cloud. After about twenty seconds of watching this odd dark spot it came to the surface of the cloud and i could make it out to be a huge disc angled at about 45 degrees to the ground. i hollered to my girlfriend to come outside and look. At this time it had retreated back into the cloud and was just a dark spot again.she noticed it right away. As we watched it moving up and down and side to side with no aparent disturbance from the quickly moving storm cloud it became completely visable again. I have no idea how big this was. I know it must have been at least one hundred feet in diameter, most likely bigger. We were completely amazed at what we were seeing and could see it well enough to know it was not a weather balloon or anything else for that matter. It was a huge disc shaped grey colored object theat remained between 45 and vertical and moved distinctly throughout this storm cloud untill it went overhead and over our building out of our sight. this stormcloud developed just east of us into a major lighting storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On this particular day, I was travelling eastbound on Walnut St. in moderate traffic when I just so happened to see a glint in the sky that caught my attention.  What I saw, at first, looked like a plane but it seemed to be luminous or was a white color.  I would have dismissed it as a plane had it not rolled a couple of times and sped up as I watched it disappear into a big cloud.  When it rolled, I could tell there were not any wings or identification on it and it was about the size of an almond held at an arms length.  The time that it traversed over the sky, after it sped up, before it went into the cloud was approximately 10-15 seconds, before it sped up, I had noticed it for approximately 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After going into the cloud, I had enough time to park but it never came back out of the cloud.  I wrote down this experience and called my brother and told him right after it had happened but I hesistated to tell anyone else.

I thought the plane might just be pulling something as a joke, but then I asked myself how could it spin and have lights? I was sure of what I saw after a person fishing saw it and yelled &#34;Look a UFO!&#34; About 15 minutes after I saw it, a orange light shot up behind a mountian in the same area (lasted less than 3 seconds). About 2-3 hours later, I witnessed an object falling and buringing up in a blue flame. I could feel the heat from it and was far away. Today (7-10-03) I heard that it was on the news and lots of people saw it. I Tried to find a copy of the Arizona for 7-9-03 in which the article was supposedly in.

I always thought it was some sort of fit or spasm but it is as if something was holding me down i couldnt even breathe. this even happened to me one night when i woke to a feeling of a prescence in my room. I have a small room and it i easy to tell f there is someone in it. I heard a noise so i got out of bed to turn on my lamp. I flicked the switch and nothing worked  then i tried the mains switch which was on, still no joy. Then i jumped out of bed to turn on the main light which was not working either. so i lept to the window and opened it. as soon as the sash window lifted i woke up in my bed. Still feeling scared i kept trying the light the sequence reoccurred several times with me keep waking up in my bed. I personally never remember dreams and i could feel everything including how heavy the window is to open so i truly believe that i was awake. can you help me please?  i am 20 years old and i promise i am not mad, i have plenty of friends and could really do with some help in finding out what has been happenning to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> many thanks<n>
7/7/03 22:30|Verdun (Canada)|PQ|Other|5 to 6 seconds|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  I received a telephone call on the UFO Hotline this morning from a gentleman who resides in Verdun, Quebec.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29655.html|353|ndxe200307| I received a telephone call on the UFO Hotline this morning from a gentleman who resides in Verdun, Quebec. Before he went on to tell me his story of what he witnessed, he first wanted to make it clear by telling me that he is a well grounded fellow. On the odd occasion when with a group of friends someone might bring up the idea of UFO, or that they may have observed one. The witness told me he would walk away and talk to some else, not believing there are unusual flying crafts out there. In other words very skeptical about the whole issue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man now explains to me that he has been re-thinking the whole idea after what he saw, which was very strange indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 7, 2003 at 10:30 p.m. the witness took his dog out for a walk last Monday evening. He reached the corner of the street he resides on, heading towards the park which is across the street. Running diagonally from the witness, just above the streetlight poles at approximately 40 to 50 feet high the witness described seeing a Smokey gray colored object traveling slow over top of one of the homes in the area. He went on to say he had a good look at it due to it traveling slowly. The fellow described it as being approximately 25 feet in length with the head of it being wider than the tail and traveling maybe 10 miles per hour. The fellow also mentioned that it was not a bird, because he had such a good view of it as the sighting lasted for approximately 5 to 7 seconds. The witness said if he could sense anything about the object was that it had a slight whirling sound coming from it. (HBCC UFO Note: When I heard about the sound in which I object was making, I then asked if his dog took any notice of it, he said no). He went on to say he couldn&#39;t be 100 per cent sure the sound was coming from it due to the sound being so faint, but he was pretty sure. This sighting, he said stopped him dead in his tracks. The fellow mentioned that normally on his street folks sit out late when it is really nice out, but this evening of the sighting he said it was oddly quiet. The witness said, what I saw &#34;I could not explain&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to thank the witness for reporting their sighting to HBCC UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing the report with NUFORC.

We were following my father whom was driving ahead with my 2 sons and nephew in his pick up truck.  My 2 sons were in the back of his pick up,(they were wet from swimming).  As we were driving my daughter whom was age 4 at the time say hey dad, look at the sun.  I was driving to the west and the sun was still high.  I looked and she was pointing North.  I looked to see what she was pointing at and saw a white/organge sphere which was very bright and all I can compare it to is the Sun.  It was the size of the moon at midnight, which was impressive to me because is alitude was below 5000 ft and no more than a 1/2 mile away over a large Cattle pasture. I stared at this for a good 15 seconds. I had to remind my self I was driving.  I told my daughter to keep her eye on it for me (it appeard motionless) while I pulled over.  She said ok, and as I was finding a spot to pull over, my daughter says &#34;its gone&#34;. I quickly looked and it was.  I asked her where did it go.  She goes up. I asked her to point and she pointed straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at our home and as I got out of the car my boys whom were in the back of my dad&#39;s truck says, dad did you see that bright light in the sky (boys ages are 6, 12).  I said yea, describe it to me, and they repeated the same as my daughter and I saw and also confirmed it went up when it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad was unbuckling my nephew (age 4) from his car seat, while the boys were telling me what they saw.  I walk over and asked him if he seen anything curious on the way home.  He and my nephew at the same time started talking about it as well.  They described the same as everyone else, my dad used the term sun because my nephew refered to it as the sun like my daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was totaly amazed at what we saw.  I was even more amazed how there was 6 of us who saw it, 2 in the cab of truck, 2 in back of truck, and 2 in seperate car, whom all seen and described the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The photos are being sent in a separate email file.  They appear to show a transluscent object that approaches us in the course of the two pictures, and appears to &#34;touch&#34; my daughters with transluscent, ropelike appendages extending from beneath it.

It was very high in the sky as I could not identify aircraft wings and could barely discern the faint sound of jet engines.  The aircraft caught my eye because it was shining brightly (probably due to the reflection of sunlight at sunset) and I found it odd that there was no vapor trail from the jet engines.  The speed of the aircraft was constant (not unusually fast or slow).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very strange aspect of this sighting was that the aircraft did a very quick and very sharp U-turn.

Bahia De Los Angeles Baja California Norte<n> <n><n> <n><n> object was from three to four miles due east of Camp Geck, an area known as Rincon. Because of knowing the area well, the elevation was approx. 2,500 ft.and we were 3 1/2 miles west of object in question. the object had a glow that was between blue and green somewhat the same as chemical light sticks that can bought for camping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> all of the object glowed and the size was many times larger than a house because at the distance we saw it, a house is only a small dot but this must have been as large as two football fields, maybe larger. It went through the gap in the mountain Known as Sierra Rojo and then disapeared. This all happened just before dark, which I must estimate as being from 8:30 - 9:00 pm and I did not check for the exact time. The one thing that struck both me and my wife was that while aeeing it, we both were like we were in a daze. There was one other person there but it was as if whatever we saw prevented us in some way from saying anything to the other while it was in veiw. compaired to other things that we have seen in the night sky, we were able to watch it for a much longer time maybe 5 minutes but no longer than 10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I am able to find out from some of the Mexican fishermen is that durring the warmer months.June,July,Aug.and September these lights seem to appear about once a month a little south of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be a commercial airliner with 2 engines located at the rear of the fuselage.  It was flying in a SW direction at a high altitude, probably too high for it to have just taken off from nearby Logan airport (approx 10 miles away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was lazily sitting in the hammock while grilling dinner, I looked up at the plane and saw a smaller object flying directly behind it at close range.  My first instinct was that it was a fighter--it had the same general shape and was proportionatly sized compared to the airliner but from that distance, it was impossible to tell.  My instinct was that it was escorting the airliner due to some sort of hijacking incident.  I watched as the two craft disapeared from view (trees and houses block out most of the sky from the yard) and either the unidentified craft drew closer to the airliner or it appeared to due to perspective.  I went inside to check the news for any sort of breaking report on a hijack but nothing.  Now, 3 hours later, I&#39;m still baffled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous, and provides no contact data.  PD))<n>

I looked immediately to see if I had captured the object in the digital image and I had. I am a professional consultant, and while I have some interest in UFO phenomenon, had not previously had any other experience of this type. I did some adjustments of the photo&#39;s to better view the object, but that&#39;s about it. I did submit this for posting at the Coast to Coast AM site, and it was published, but I forgot about it. Was recently at your site, and at the same time came across the pictures again, and decided to submit it, unfortunately 2 years after the fact. I just checked and interestingly, there is another report from Illinois of a disk shaped object at 15:50 that day. Did not check to see distance betwen Morrison and Elwood.

Object appeared to be spinning in a counter clockwise fashion. What was interesting, was that when I observed the object I thought it was a plane moving for a landing in DFW however,  as the objected was decending it stoped and reversed itself then shot off in a opposit diagnal angle. I was apprehensive about telling anyone but I thought maybe this might be of use to you for record keeping purposes. From where I was realtive to where I observed the obeject I suspect it must have been at least as large as a 747.

No noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello and thank you for your services.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is 3am on Sunday the 6th of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At between 12:03am and 12:05am the 6th of July, i was sitting on my balcony of my appartment and looking up at the night sky. The sky is quite clear tonight and there are a dozen stars visable.  I noticed a pale colored object moving slowly due south across the sky above me.  I stood and squinted(ive lost my glasses)and noticed it was not lit with strobes or anything that most aircraft are required to have.  Then i ran in and grabbed my binoculars and came out for a better look. At the same time i yelled at my girl friend to come look, because she has better vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not completely alarmed when i first saw it, because i thought it was much higher and possibly a sattelite.  When i put the bino&#39;s on it, i then freaked out, because what i saw was definately not a known aircraft.  My heart was racing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to be a &#34;V&#34; shaped thing, or a &#34;boomerang&#34; shape.  It was tilted roughly 45-65 degrees from the horizon and from my perspective seemed to be between 1500-3000 ft altitude.  It was a pale color, possibly white, and seemed to only be lit by the city lights. I was a bit shakey with the bino&#39;s at first but could make out some rough details.  It had some kind of dark/black trim work, but i dont believe it was a silver colored object, because there was not glean or glint from the city lights off of the surface.  Its rotation was counter clockwise and probably no more than 1 revolution per second, but its spin changed slightly from half of that, more or less during its path.  Its path was steady, and in a south direction.   I live just north of the capitol building in Salem, and this craft was just north of being above that building.  Just further south is our airport, and it looked as though the craft got to the vicinity of being above the airport and then it stopped its flight path and hovered, while still spinning.  I climbed my railing for a better look because it was just about to go behind some trees in my line of sight.  When i got up the railing 2 seconds later, and put the bino&#39;s on it again it was simply gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called 911 and reported it, if nothing else, there&#39;s a record of it if you call them i believe.  I asked if they had any other reports and he said no. I asked if he had a number for the airport. I wanted to contact someone at the radar station, but he said Salems airport(traffic control) was closed at this time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had about 25-30 seconds of nice veiwing of the craft through my binoculars and have made detailed sketches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft made no noise. It filled my view in the binoculars.  It was roughly 1/2 to 3/4 the size of a full moon from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If i were to make an amature guess, i would say it was possibly close to the size of a chinook helicopter.  It seemed to be traveling at the rate of a helocoptor moving at a fairly slow cruise. But it certainly wasnt any kind of craft ive seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Temperature 65-68 F Clear skys, some slight haze.  Some light polution No other oddities to report, expept a strange encounter with a homeless fellow in a near by park by me and my girl friend 3 hours earlier. (some odd coincidences)  There was one other small plane in the vicinity, but to the south west about 1-2 miles. It was just cruising around. And it DID have the proper lights and strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 11:30 he points out a dim light moving across the sky.  It was not blinking, therefore not an airplane.  However, my first conclusion was a satallite.  After watching it move forward (from the position we were watching it) it grouped up with 2 other dim lights and changed direction, heading right (from our point of view).  We watched them as they formated into a perfect triangle and moved over a certain amount of sky.  They eventually traveled forward and, due to ambient light, we lost the sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 23:15 on July 5, 2003 four observers noted three faint white lights towards the North traveling from West to East in a triangle formation.  The point of the isoceles triangle was in the lead and the two remaining lights, making up the base, were evenly spaced and followed the first point of light. They were closely spaced and traveling at the same speed.  The speed was similar to the speed of other satellites we had observed.  With arm extended they were less than a half of a thumb in seperation.  When they were about 30 degrees East (0 degrees being directly above) the white lights faded out together.  I checked the Heavens Above web site and did not find anything listed for 23:15 - 23:20 that was even close to what was observed.  Based on the time of night the objects had to be at least 400 miles above ground elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> A black triangle was seen flying over Sedona, AZ the evening of July 5, 2003 by six eyewitnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:15pm on July 5, 2003, I and five of my coworkers were chatting on the balcony of a house our company is renting. I, being a stargazer and a former member of Arizona MUFON, was watching the sky when I saw a tiny orange-ish light moving in a southeasterly direction.  I called my colleagues&#39; attention to it, thinking it was a satellite.  A female member of our group brought my attention to two more lights following the one I saw.  All were identically small and illuminated.  There were no conventional anti-collision lights strobing, only a faint but steady light from each.  I thought initially that it could not possibly be three satellites in a parallel formation moving at identical velocities.  Then the realization that we were having a bona fide UFO sighting occurred to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape the lights formed were an elongated isoceles triangle - I would guess the three angles of the object were 30 degrees at the bow and 75 degrees for the two rear angles.  The object occluded the stars as it passed, leading me to believe it was a solid triangle, not a &#34;boomerang&#34;-shape.  There was no sound from it.  I would guess the object may have been moving at an altitude of at least 100,000 ft. and would have been over 1/2-mile in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran upstairs to get my binoculars.  This took less than 30 seconds.  When I&#39;d returned, the object was gone.  The manner in which it vanished, according to one of my fellow eyewitnesses, was it seemed to &#34;fish-tail&#34; like a car upon hitting a slick surface. The &#34;bow&#34; light then disappeared, followed by the other two lights.  It was described to me as it had gone through a rift or gateway in the sky. This is quite different than those objects that appear to suddenly vanish in a supposed &#34;hyper-jump.&#34; The object moved silently at what must have been supersonic speed to cover the distance it did in only a couple of minutes at great altitude, from initial sighting at almost 90 degrees directly overhead to 50 degrees to the southeast within two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the witnesses, myself included, are in the performing arts, working with a Shakespeare company in Sedona.  Our ages range from 17 to 42. Four of the witnesses were male, two female. Myself and only one other witness in our group have any background or interest in such phenomena.  All in our group acknowledged, however, that the object was not a formation of airplanes, nor satellites.<n>

I was going to mention it to my friends but there were a few people there hanging out that i never met before and i didn&#39;t want to sound like a paranoid freak.  Then the light went up and down maybe three times, then took off really fast in a circular motion.  And it was gone within seconds.  I never actually saw a craft just the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I didnt think much of it since my street is usually full of cars but just as i walked past it to get into bed I saw it. It was much like a tear. Blue lights circled the bottom of it and a yellow one at the top. I stood there in disbelief watching it. It didnt move. It just hovered maybe 5 feet above my yard. I didnt want to look away for fear i might loose it. In what seemed like hours it finally shot straight up into the sky in a streak of blue light. But i knew something had been there because i could see me trees leaves part as it shot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friends car has a sunroof, so i was leaning back in the passenger side seat, looking up at the stars. This triangle shaped constellation caught my eye, because the magnitude of it was dimmer then the surrounding stars. Then i noticed something else. It started moving. One point of the triangle was pointing East, and that was the direction that this thing was moving. I was so excited that i told my friend to stop the car. She did and we got out of the car and i pointed to where the object was. It finally caught her eye and we both had chills running up our spines. My girlfriend was with us but she said that she could not see it. We were frantically trying to get her to see it, but eventually it faded as it moved further east. Whatever this thing was, it had to be huge, because based on the magnitude of the light, and the distance it would have had to have been above us, i am guessing it was in the Earths orbit (not inside the atmosphere). Seeing things like that sure makes one truly wonder.....we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It sounded like serveral jets flying around the area. I got annoyed after a short time and went outside to look. I got outside and looked skyward, seeing about 5-7 aircraft (planes) circling and chasing one circular orb. They attempted to fly along side, but could not manage. After about 35 minutes, the planes left, and the craft stood still in the air for a time, shot straight up (presumably, got smaller and smaller) and before disappearing dispersed some sort of red haze. My brother and neighbor came home 5 minutes later, and related the exact story to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/5/03 18:00|Rend Lake|IL|Oval|2-3 minutes|MUFON/Illinois Report:  2 bright white objects seen over Rend Lake, IL during airshow|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31125.html|382|ndxe200307| 2 bright white objects seen over Rend Lake, IL during airshow<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO sighting occurred between 6pm and 7pm CST on July 5th, 2003. The sighting occurred at Rend Lake State Park located south of Mt. Vernon, IL. The sighting involved 3 adult witnesses and one child. The principal adult witness offered testimony to MUFON investigators regarding the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to the witness, he and his wife and daughter along with their friend were attending July 4th festivities at Rend Lake State Park. They were located at the southern end of the North Marcum Recreation Area when they had their sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the witnesses were looking up into the sky in the direction of the lake dam to the South. The witnesses along with an estimated 200+ other people were anticipating the final skydive jump for the day, which was to soon take place. As their attention was focused on the approaching plane used by the skydivers, the witnesses noticed two luminous white objects in the same general portion of the sky. The two objects seemed to be traveling together. They were described as being round to elliptical in shape. The apparent size was estimated to be similar to a golf ball at arm’s length. Actual size was estimated to be 11-30 feet. The objects reportedly moved in a straight line from the South/Southwest to the North/Northwest (and directly overhead) at a constant rate of speed that was estimated to be 500mph. The altitude of the objects was estimated to be 10,000 feet. However, the witnesses were not sure of this fact. No sound was heard and the objects left no trails. The witnesses all agreed that the objects were radiating a bright white light rather than simply reflecting sunlight. The color was described as &#34;intense white.&#34; They watched the objects until they disappeared behind the trees on the Northern horizon. The witnesses thought they seemed to be flying in the direction of Mt. Vernon, IL where the witnesses reside. Sighting duration was estimated to be 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite all the other people that were present, the witnesses stated that no one else seemed to notice these objects. The witnesses even asked others if they had seen them after they flew out of sight. No one seemed to have seen the objects, since the witnesses said they received strange looks from those immediately around them when they asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions included clear sunny skies and wind speed averaging 9.5 mph out of the Southwest. This roughly corresponds with the direction of the mystery objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon completing an interview with the principal witness, investigators drove to the Jefferson County and Franklin County Sheriffs’ offices, since Rend Lake is in both of these counties. Inquiries were made to see if any calls were received by their offices concerning UFO sightings at that designated time and location. Both offices stated that no such calls were received. A trip was then made to Rend Lake to see if some of the Park Rangers had known of any other UFO sightings on that day. After circling the entire lake including every campsite for more than two hours, a single Park Ranger was never found. This search was abandoned and an attempt was later made to email the Rend Lake Recreational Office to see if it would be possible to contact the skydiving group that made the jump that day. No reference was made to UFOs in the email. It was hoped that perhaps the skydivers or the pilot might have witnessed the event as well. Unfortunately, the email never received a reply. Therefore, the report must stand on the sole testimony of the witness and his family.

It looked like a cross meaning it had wings with two sections on each wings with a body consisting of three sections. The object moved in circle consistenly, it was extremely bright in the sky.  When I looked at it with a binacular I was only able to make out a large flat object that was zooming all over the sky. A small plan was flying towards the object when the object was sitting low in the sky. My binacular was not in the best shape but I was able to see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At approximately 10:30 that morning, I returned to our camp after doing some early morning fishing when I noticed a silvery object in the sky at 10 o&#39;clock high just SE of the lake  The distance was 4-5 miles away and was traveling slowly towards the west. I immediately grab my 8 power hunting binoculars and looked at the object. I noticed that the object was metallic, silver and shaped like a cigar. The object passed behind a ponderosa tree and I stepped out to the other side of the tree. I could not find the object afterwards. The sighting was less than a minute, maybe 30 thirty seconds. That day, it was a nice clear blue sky. My friend didn&#39;t see it due to the fact she was making a late breakfast and she heard me say to her &#34;what is that?&#34;  This object still puzzles me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Now, don&#39;t take this the wrong way, I had a liitle to drink earlier in day at my dad&#39;s bbq, but by this time I was solber with a bit of a head ache.  We lit a few fire workers, my head started to really hurt, kinda like a sinus head-ache, it just keep intensifing. Well, I just thought it might be the humidity or the load popping noise from the fire works. So, I sat in the car for a bit to regroup, then I saw it, it was at a distance approx. 2 miles at first I thought it may be a helicopter, or a plane. then the object split into 3 different lights, one was a teal green, the other a purplish blue, and a flash light color(really bright) just like a helicopter spot light. It was coming up on us like a roaring semi-truck, at a height of about 150 yds above the ground. I really thought it was a Sheriff helicopter. Within 1/2 mile distance my friends, who were still funning and carring-on, stop and took notice. Then all of a sudden, it was as quiet as a whisper, nothing.....then a boom the lights split into 6 different lighted objects, the size was breath taking. We stood in ah, no one said anything, just with dum expressions. The light just hovered there for 5-6 minutes and POW the took-off in 7 different directions. One of them came right at us, passing overhead, I ((was frightened.))  I have never been that scared before in my life. So, we hopped into the car and speed out back into town. I haven&#39;t sleep in two days. My dad and I went back out there today and investigated, all we found was our tire marks and a half of mile in front of where we parked was a 4 foot diameter burn mark.<n>

It was 8:30pm when we arrived.At that time the visibilty in the fog was about a half mile as I could just barely see the white light on the light tower.By 10:00 pm the visibility went down to zero.We were the only boat around as the other 3 left because of the fog.We were planning on fishing all night so it didn`t matter to us.About 1:00 am,my partner went to the front of the boat to lay down.I stayed in the back in my chair,still fishing.About 10 minutes went by and I happend to look up towards the sky and saw a green flashing light.My first thought was the fog was just thick at low-level and I could see up some,and I could see an airplane so I began to look for stars or clouds,but could see nothing else but this green flashing light.After about 10 seconds this flashing light began to zip from left to right,with each zig-zag a little higher or lower than the previous.That began to freek me out because I`ve never seen anything move like that or that fast in the air before.I called for my partner who was up immediatly.He saw it and we watched it as It headed straight down towards the water, again, very fast.I thought it was going into the water,but it stopped at water level and the light was stationary as to be in a *hover*.At that time it was in front of us,just to our left.After a few seconds of the hover it began to move slowly by us on our left,still at water level.After it went by and was off the back of the boat we saw it go straight up,only about 3 blinks of the light,then it was gone.He said to me WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT! I have no explanation as the way and the speed at which it darted and being the visibility, it had to be within 100 yards of me,and neither of us heard a sound,and it was dead calm out there. I am now a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally serious-minded and credible.  PD))<n>

I was in a truck and another guy was loading sand bags onto the back. I looked up and saw an object moving through the base of the clouds from southwest to the northeast at a very slow speed, about 1000 yards from me. At first I thought it was a lower cloud drifting along in the wind, then I thought it might be lights from an airplane reflecting in the clouds. But the more I looked at it the more detail I started to see. It was a saucer shape and appeared to be a dull grey color. It reflected the flightline light barely. It did not have any lights or windows or anything, just a smooth surface. I was looking at the side of the object since it was flying only about 100 ft over the tops of the trees. It was about as wide as a bus is long. It moved very slow with no noise to the northeast and then just dissapeared in the clouds over the East Runway. After the guy who was loading sandbags was done he asked me what I was looking at and I said I think I saw a UFO. There was about 75 people out cleaning up at this time. I didnt ask anyone if they had seen it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several seemingly credible reports from the same individual, who describes himself as being a member of the U.

I was glancing at the stars when I notice one of them began to move.  At first I thought it was a satalite, so I motioned to my girlfriend to get her attention, then I look back up and two other lights of the same brightness (which was a little brighter than the surrounding stars) were behind the first star I saw in the shape on an acute triangle.  Perfect in balance.  The only lights on the craft were the three lights, one in the front with the two in the rear at each corner.  If this was one solid craft, not three in a formation, it was huge.  At least the size of a football field. The craft moved at a slow constant speed overhead us.  The height seemed less than a normal commercial plane.  There was no noise at all.  The reason I think it was a solid craft is because how all three of the lights moved.  All of them stayed at all times and equal distance apart from each other.  The craft was in no hurry and I could see it for at least three minutes.  The way it disappeared blew our minds.  The craft moved across the sky to reach a point to where it simply disappear.  When I say point in the sky, that is what I mean.  I watch the lead light disappear at this point while the back two continued on the same path to this point and disappeared as well.  There were no traces of the lights past that point and have not seen it since.  I live on the outskirts of town.  A simple description of what I saw is three lights in the sky in the shape of a perfect acute triangle, and because of the darkness I could see any detail between the lights, cruise slowly across the sky and go into some &#34;wormhole&#34; and disapper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the sighting is consistent with the three satellites, thought to be launched periodically by the U. S. Navy as part of their &#34;NOSS&#34; satellite system.  The manner in which the lights were seen to fade is consistent with satellites when they fly into the Earth&#39;s shadow.  PD))<n>

The driveway is a long driveway, about halfway down we saw two lights coming down this driveway. We both saw these lights, I thought it was a car coming down this driveway.I was fixing to say something about this car coming down at a pretty good speed. This car should have stopped to let us pass. As we went pass the end of the driveway my husband and myself looked up the driveway and saw nothing, no car or truck, it had not turned to right or left and nothing was blocking our view. My husband asked what happen to that car. As I have thought about this and asked the person who lives at this address if anyone was leaving at that time of night, they said no. These lights did not put out beams of light like a car light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/4/03 22:15|Port St. Lucie|FL|Fireball|1 minute|Red Orb type ball crashing or descending|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44064.html|400|ndxe200307| Red Orb type ball crashing or descending<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of July 4th 2003, as our city fireworks display had just completed for about ten minutes,my stepson,wife and myself watched for approximately on minute a red glowing ball moving at an estimated speed of about 400-500 mph approching from about 5 miles or more directly to the south of our location, moving in a 5 to 10 degree decline, starting from 4000 to 5000 feet at first notice, finishing at 400 to 500 feet high,in a straight northerly direction,no more than 1/4 mile away and in direct lineup with Us highway #1. As this ball passed, it displayed a dimming and brightening quality,somewhat like a slow pulsing, and also had a slightly visible &#34;vapor trail&#34; following behind it, just as normally seen on the edges of fast moving jets. My stepson started to become concerned as i was about to explain to myself and him that it was most likely a falling star, and not a firework, as I have never seen a firework to originate from above and fall down at such kind of a trajectory.Although it did seem at first to look much like a fireball falling in from space, we never heard any noise whatsoever, and just before it passed to our north and continued descending below the visible line of our site,a smaller red ball suddenly, and very quickly,seemed to fly straight down,at no angle whatsoever from the larger ball and disappeared to the east and upwards within seconds.At this point physical laws and simple logical thought has to completely dismiss the possibility of any firework or falling star possibility.  I feel the real possibility that we have witnessed a disabled craft of some sort just before crashing, and never have seen any report to that effect, although many had to witness this event as it was on a very busy night of people outside during this event, and over top of a very busy highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my boyfriend were looking up at the stars and I noticed what looked like a star in the sky.  It was moving at very high speeds and sporadically. I pointed what I saw with my dad and boyfriend.  None of us had any clue what is was there were no blinking lights like a jet and it looked like it was to fast to be anykind of plane that we knew of.  After about 30 or so seconds of whatching it, the object grew or produced a very big blue light around it.  The bright light went away after a couple of seconds.  After the bright light we saw another light.  It was traveling the exact oppisite direction as the other craft we first mentioned.  We watched both of these lights until we couldn&#39;t see them anymore about 1-2 minutes total time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: this incedint happened before any fire works went off in the sky.  This was not a firework for the fourth of july, nor any human made aircraft that we know about.  I am sure it was not a shooting star, the duration of the light and sparadic movement of the crafts prove this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/4/03 22:00|Seattle|WA|Triangle|15 minutes|Triangular Ships Sighted in 4th of July skies over Seattle, WA.|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30674.html|402|ndxe200307| Triangular Ships Sighted in 4th of July skies over Seattle, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occured during the fireworks launched over the city of Seattle. I was staying at the Best Bestern (sic--Best Western/University Towers) Hotel in the University District of Seattle, WA. I was looking out of my hotel room enjoying the 4th of July Fireworks. My girlfriend had a room just above me on the next floor. I called her up to tell her what a great view we had of the fireworks. As I looked out the hotel window enjoying the multitude of shows (there were about 3 different ones going on) I looked on another part of the skyline where there were no fireworks but rather 4 triangular ships that seemed to be doing an acrobatic maneuver. First they simultaneously shot out in directions: North, East, South, and West and then they returned back to the original positions. They were not behaving like fireworks, I never saw fireworks act like this. Rather than think they were UFO&#39;s, I originally reasoned that they were miniature models of UFO&#39;s that someone had rigged up a radio control mechanism to. I called up my girlfriend that night to see if she could see them. Unfortunately she could not. I now believe that these objects were the same type that were viewed in Phoenix, Arizona on March 13, 1997 documented in Chuck Missler/Mark Eastman&#39;s book, Alien Encounters. I bought this book because of the sightings I had observed this July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed aircraft, which perform aerobatic displays just prior to the fireworks display over downtown Seattle and Lake Union.  In past years, a MIG-19 with pyrotechnic pods underneath its wings has flown over the waterfront, leaving streams of spark-filled trails behind it.  PD))<n>

My mom and Dad were in my friends boat.  I was in my boat with my friend ((name deleted)), and we were looking at the sky when we saw a light in the form of a disk.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a a satillite, because it didn&#39;t have flashing lights.  I was scared because I might have seen the unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I went over to my mom and told her what I had saw, I told her to look up and it was gone.  It must have been going 10000 MPH.  It was weaving aroud and between the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to believe in the unknown a little, but now I really believed it.<n>

To our astonishment we saw six glowing orange orbs hovering about 1,000 feet above the middle of the river, with the mountains as a backdrop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stared at this for the twenty minutes; this loose, uneven hanging string formation staying there.  They were hovering, not falling like flares.  They stayed at the same altitude, some of them moving left to right slightly.  The one at the bottom actually winked out, and came back a few moments later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights became clearer as it got darker.  We wished we had a video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two next door neighbors saw the lights, exclaiming &#34;What are those lights!?&#34;, and running back inside.  We continued to watch from inside our house, when suddenly, after 20 or so minutes in the same spot, they suddenly all winked out, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen this again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please excuse the late reporting of this.

I then thought to look at the moon(visible 24 hours a day). And I noticed a small object moving across my line of sight. When I first saw it I figured it was a weather baloon or, one released by a child. But then upon further examination it appeared to be mettalic and was slowly climbing. I told my dad, he didn&#39;t quite believe me(skeptic). And I continued to watch the object and then after I had only been watching it for a few more seconds, it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/4/03 19:45|Renton|WA|Egg|5 min.|Dark oval object over Seattle|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29654.html|406|ndxe200307| Dark oval object over Seattle<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport, I am providing this information because the likeness shown on your website of the dark oval object with copper colored swirls seen in New York is eerily similar to what I observed over the Seattle area July 4th . The time of the event is approximate - it may have been an hour or more later. I spotted the object to the northwest of my Renton location in the direction of downtown Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression of the dark object was that it was perhaps a dirigible in place to observe fireworks displays, but if it was something the size of a dirigible it would have to be at an altitude at which dirigibles are not normally seen.  My curiosity piqued, I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look. What I observed for the next five minutes or so was simply puzzling. The shape was similar to a blimp but rounded on each end - an egg shape that is elongated somewhat on its horizontal axis. The color was dark , there were no appendages. I wondered what I was seeing as the thing drifted slowly to the south , apparently wind born. Only once did the thing seem as if it could possibly be under some control when the larger end turned into the wind, but that motion would be consistent with the action of the wind on its shape. I took particular notice of an odd coloration on the smaller end a couple of minutes into the observation when it was about due west. Might this have been a reflection of the sunset?  At any rate I lost the object when I moved to the front of my building. It was then to the southwest. My impression was that the object was three to eight feet in length.   I didn&#39;t call the sighting in because it seemed to be some very odd type of balloon.  It turned in the wind as a balloon would. The similarity in appearance of the object to that shown on your website was so great that that I deemed it noteworthy, especially if there were other observers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the left of the contrails as they  turned to the the north there was a round shiny object just sitting there. Told all my friends about it and they saw it to. we all said maybe it&#39;s a bright star. I was watching it and it didn&#39;t move at all. I said, well i guess it may be a star. What i realy thought, was , this looks kinda funny. Then i figured, well it&#39;s starting to get alittle dark out It should still be there if it was a star. Min. later, I looked up, (on a clear night) and it was&#39;nt there. MMM pritty stange to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was underneath a thunderstorm cloud so it showed up very clearly.  It was not high enough to be a jet and it made no noise.  I am an instrument rated private pilot and am very familiar with common aircraft.  This was not a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft and was moving too fast to have been a ballon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was standing on the trail, waiting for my husband.  Looking to the southeast, I saw what appeared to be an oval object, placed at an angle, and appearing to leave a short trail behind it.  However, it was not moving at all.  It is possible that there was no trail, but rather that the object was larger than I thought at first.  The object was an odd color - sort of a dirty brown.  It occurred to me that it could be reflecting the landscape below it.  I watched the object for nearly a minute, and it seemed odd to me that it was not moving.  But I had the impression it was fairly distant.  I glanced away only for an instant, and when I looked back, it was gone - no trail, nothing.  I told my husband about it while I was watching it, but by the time he turned around to look it had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the second strange sighting for me in three days.  And I have never reported a UFO sighting in my life.  Possibly because the objects had certain similarities, yet were sighted in two quite far-flung spots in California, I felt compelled to report them.  Both objects were sighted in daylight, hung over mountain ridges, and seemed to be reflective.  I would be very interested in whether anyone has reported similar objects during this timeframe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the northern sky, a copper disk with a black spot in the center covering about 1/2 the entire area on top.  It was disk shaped &amp; one end of the disk was about twice the diameter with a wedge cut out at the larger end.  The wedge appeared to be about 1/16th of the entire circumference.  It appeared to be about 3000 feet above sea level.  We needed binoculars to see them clearly.  At first there was only one.  The 2nd appeared &amp; about a minute later they both disappeared.  I only saw one, but one person saw two.  I only know that one was moving in a clockwise small circle &amp; was tipping up on end as it went in the circle. It tipped forward all the way &amp; then backward all of the way.  It did not turn upside down, but just showed the top &amp; bottom as it turned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

We were running late, so we were looking north as I drove, in the direction of the fireworks, (approximately 2 mi. away), to see if they had already started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We soon noticed a triangular pattern of lights, ( I think 5), traveling very slowly from east to west. It seemed like it started at the fireworks location, which is approximately 159th St,. and LaGrange Road. It was hard to determine what size the thing was, but seemed very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was meeting my brothers at their office building where we usually sat on their roof to view the fireworks,(very close to them). I tried numerous times to contact them by cell phone, but to no avail.

I am a cook at a local nursing home so my day starts very early.  Entrance to the building for staff is at the side in the back but we park way out front so we have to walk about 30  yards along the side. I was about half way to the entrance and was looking up at what I asume to be Mars?  I was facing south-southeast and Mars was at its apex in the night sky.  I suddenly noticed an equally bright golden colored light approaching from the west(my right), crossed in front of Mars and headed due east with no changing of course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared as a bright, golden colored light with a steady glow. Although the stars all had a slight flicker to them this morning, the object did not.  I got the impression of it being at a high altitude.  This all took place about an hour before sunrise.  The object came out of the west as a bright object but as it traversed the sky it dimmed in brightness which I found odd as it was approaching the sunrise.  I got the impression that this was a controlled atmospheric reentry.  I have witnessed the shuttle reentry before in the past and this reminded me of it.

As i ws sitting in the lounge chair outside i looked in the sky and saw what i thought to be a star that was very &#34;twinkly&#34; so i moved to get a better perspective onyl to realize that the object was not a star. As i examined it further, i noticed that it appeared to be in the lower atmosphere. about 15-20 thousand feet in the sky at a distance of about 3-5 miles away, also, the object appeared to be stationary during the whole time i observed it. The object also had 5 distince colors of; 2 reds which was in the middle and did not flash. Yellow which was at the bottom and flashed and appeared to be spinning beneath the reds. Green which spinning on top of the reds and also flashing. Blue which flashed very quickly and often to the right of the red. Although after 15 minutes of my break i had to go in the next crew on break came out and also saw the object and described the same thing.

7/3/03 02:30|Pocatello|ID|Circle|20 minutes|I was outside on the front porch of my house at about 2:30 am MST basically just cooling off since it was quite warm inside the house.|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29605.html|423|ndxe200307| I was outside on the front porch of my house at about 2:30 am MST basically just cooling off since it was quite warm inside the house. I was looking up at the sky for falling stars and I noticed the planet Venus (at least I think it was Venus) to my right (South). Then as I turned to look in front of me (East) I noticed a very brilliant scintillating round, kind of almost diamond shaped looking object. It was very bright (like lights through a crystal) and colorful red, blue, yellow, purple and green. I stared at this object for a little while and I noticed it began to move rather slowly then stop( it moved a distance of about 24 inches if I measured the distance an arms length in front of my eyes) it also would get brighter then dimmer. I thought it was a weird sort of star at first until it moved, what really freaked me out however was what I saw next, something caught my eye to the right (South) not to far away from the position of the planet Venus. This was a small bright pure whitish blue light which was moving toward me and at a low altitude almost to the top of a tall tree in my neighbors yard. This light was round, about 6&#39; in diameter and very bright. It was able to start and stop at incredible speed it was moving side to side sometimes in a circular motion starting and stopping like it was looking for something? It stopped almost over where I was at I was scared somewhat by this time because I thought I was losing my mind and I did not know what this thing was and it was coming toward me! The light stopped almost over my position for about 1 minute maybe a minute and a half. Then it began to move East in the same type of start/stop motion I described this is where it got weirder it moved right into the big scintillating thing and came out like twice moving around the larger object. Then it went back into it and the larger object then slowly moved off to the Southeast until it was out of sight. I have not told any of my friends except one because I thought they would think I was! a nut or something! The friend I did tell knows I am not crazy and I think she accepts the possibility of life elsewhere. She is more open minded than I or was I don&#39;t know what to think about what I saw but it really shook me up. By the way I have a highly technical occupation am a college graduate and have gone to many an airshow. I have logged quite a few hours flying and have seen aircraft, satellites, balloons and falling stars on many an occasion both day and night, these things were not like anything I have ever seen fly before. I wonder if a human pilot would have even been able to endure the acceleration/deceleration and turns the smaller object made? The G&#39;s would have been pretty scary from what I saw! Anyhow that is my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ignace,MI  camping and my sister and myself were coming back from the showers at midnight. I happened to look up over the camper and noticed a V shaped object with lights all along both edges of the object, the lights were round and luminous. There was no sound and it seemed to be decending on an angle the shape looked like a stelth plane. In a matter of  two min. it vanished. We both could not believe it and a woman near us said she wondered what that was as well. The next day our husbands talked to other people in the camp ground and told them what we saw and some other people reported seeing the same thing as well. This object was fairly large and the night was very clear and the stars were visible. We never saw it agian.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Distance was about 1/2 mile heading north at a high rate of speed. I see commercial jets flying over every day and it was moving alot faster than I have ever seen anything else move except for military aircraft. The light was very large which made me think it was close. I could hear sounds of of crickets outside but this object emmitted no noise, NONE!!!! I told my wife to look and she commented on how fast it was moving. She thought it was probably a military jet. I said it&#39;s not making any noise? I used to be an aircraft mechanic and my wifes father is an aircraft mechanic. We both have spent our lives around airports and aircraft. Neither of us could explain this as something we recognized. I just wonder if anyone else saw this?<n>

Was outside by barn while husband was just inside. Saw yellow-orange colored ball/light, this object was grapefruit sized compared to stars. Seemed to be stationary above town of California, quite high.  I kept telling my husband to come out of the barn and see this thing.  After several minutes, no more than 3-5, the object instantly shrank from what grapefruit size (my perspective) to grape size, and then appeared to be a white lighted object with red and blue lights blinking.  It moved toward the north until I could no longer see it.  My husband did not come out of the barn in time to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On same farm, in Moniteau County: 2st Incident: July 18th 2003, app 8:00 to 8:30pm. I had been watching the sky since first incident and this evening (still daylight) there were a lot of scattered dark clouds.  I saw a large silver tube, it was in my clear line of vision - from my perspective I would say it was the size of a fat hot dog, no wings, no lights, no difference in front or back that I could see. From what I could tell, there was not rounding at &#34;nose&#34; or &#34;tail&#34;.  This tube came from behind one dark cloud and &#34;flew&#34; into another (west to south). I saw it clearly for about 2 minutes. There was no noise, no jet flume, and no shine.  I kept watching for it to come out of the cloud - at any direction. About 5 minutes later, an orange ball/light (much smaller) came from the same direction and &#34;followed&#34;? the tube.  Although I never saw the tube again, I did see the orange ball/light come out of the cloud and travel west to south into another cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no explanation for what I have seen. This is  exactly what happened and I can&#39;t stop wondering what is going on. The silver tube thing really spooked me because it was big enough or low enough to be clearly seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun was low on the horizon, casting very bright light. Just above the top ridge line of the mountains to the north of us I saw what appeared to be a very large bright light, stationery in sky, but hanging low over the ridgeline.  I joked to my husband, &#34;there&#39;s a UFO.&#34;  He immediately saw it, too.  As we drove, we discussed what it might be, as it was so large and did not appear to move at all.  As we got closer, we could see that it appeared to be less a light, and more an oval-shaped object that was reflecting the sun&#39;s rays.  It was very bright, but also had color to it, as though it was reflecting not only the sun&#39;s rays, but the colors of the landscape below.  My husband was driving, so he was not watching it as consistently as I was.  As we were continuing to talk about it and my eyes were on it, it suddenly appeared to grow smaller, as though it were receding rapidly. In just an instant it appeared to be a white cigar-shape, then it was gone.  It did not reappear, to our knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The population is about 3,000. I have acres of land in Timmonsville and trees are everywhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one particular evening, as I drove my old car to the driveway, I observed a series of light just above tree level or some 50-100 feet in the air. It was suspended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed also, the shape of an oval object as large as my car which is quite big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my car and stared up at it. It was motionless, with no sound to be heard. It must have been about 8:30ishPm. I live in a trailer with no houses around me for quite a distance. As I&#39;ve stated, I own land out here and only occassionally do I hear a car pass by this desolate area. Certainly no aeroplanes or helicopters frequent this area...Please note that I was 79 years old at the time of this observation. I am now 82 years old and have confided this account only to my son-in-law to be. I prayed on it and was not afraid of it. I merely walked inside the trailer and closed the door and locked it securely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw one object and one object only. The only possible background were the trees on my land, some are short and some are quite tall. But this object was plainly visible to me. I am certain that it was not a conventional aircraft as it stayed in the one spot with pulsating lights along the perimeter. That is all I can say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The color on the craft turned from orange to a red, and then I suppose to make itself unnoticed turned of the lights on the craft however I could still see the gray body of the ship and it was continuing moving NE.

(It was a very clear night, not tipical of California Central Coast weather)  We walked down to the sand and met up with a young man who calls himslef a Pismo Beach Local, he was homeless and had a dog with him.  We all sat in a cirlce indian style and talked about life, existence, God ect...We then brought up UFO&#39;s and aliens and were talking about them as I often did with my fiance.  Then my fiance lifted his head up and looked in the sky and said aloud, &#34;That would be awsome if we saw a UFO RIGHT NOW,  Oh my God you guys look!&#34;  Then I looked up and saw one cloud of marine layer over my right sholder and out of the midst came a traingular object with a bright white light on the front corner. The object appeared right over head, about the height of a two story house roof top, the object then lowered itself like a triangle shelf coming out of the sky, heading north, and was completeley visible overhead.  The object was a triangle shape with white type lights on the corner edges of the triangle and some kind of movement or activity in the middle but I can not remember what exactly?  None of us could remember in detail, to this very date, what was in the very middle of the object...but we(me, my fiance, and our friend) have agreed that there was some sort of activity going on in the middle, and I can not elaborate futher upon that.  I felt an awsome aura come over ME in an instant and stood up with my arms in the air and I felt: That it was beutifull and &#34;From The Almighty!&#34; which came out of my mouth aloud.  There was absolutely no sounds except for the surf of the beach.  The object then lifted up just the same way it lowered itself pointing North, heading North.  The were no other clouds or obstructions in the clear sky and the triangle still seemed to enfold in some kind of unseen slot in the open sky.  We all saw the UFO and were so accepting it was like we had been expe! cting it The homeless man was surprised that my fiance &#34;knew&#34; it was comeing and was confused as to why we were so happy.  I told the homeless man that I knew it was Gods Millennial Cherubim from my childhood knowledge and we are suppose to be accepting.  We must recognize Him in all shapes and forms.  This experience had given ME knowledge of some sort.  I would not know how to describe to someone that was not there what happened for me mentally.  But I can Faithfully say that I SAW God&#39;s Creation from beyond the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

My family and I we stayed at the Sonesta Key hotel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After, dinner one night, my family took a walk around the hotel and we came to a part of the hotel known as &#34;Honeymooner&#39;s Point&#34;.  This is a point that is right along the water.  My father and sister got tired and they decided to go back to the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and my mom decided we would just hang around for little while longer since it was so nice outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then questioned her about the &#34;North Star&#34;. We were looking around for it and I spotted this bright light in the sky.  I thought that it was the &#34;North Star&#34; because they say that it is the brightest star or whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as I watched it, it didn&#39;t &#34;twinkle&#34; like all the other stars seem to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As both my mom and I watched this bright light it began to move. Now it didn&#39;t move fast like most UFO sightings claim and it wasn&#39;t an odd shape it looked like a very bright star.  But it started to move very very slowly back and forth.  It moved left to right in kind of a dipping motion. Then it started to increase in size and brightness as if it were getting closer. I started to get a little nervous and started to back away but my mom was fascinated and remained there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then very slowly the light got very small and became very dull, barely visible. Then after a while it got larger and brighter again. Then all of a sudden it decreased in size very very quickly and it disappeared. It was as if it shot out of the galaxy. This is the strangest thing to this day that either I or my mom have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before this event my mom didn&#39;t believe in extra-terrestrial life or UFOs, but i was always interested in alien life and UFOs. But it wasn&#39;t like other encounters where it was moving fast across the sky and had an odd shape. It looked like a very bright slowly moving star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was above a thin cloud cover and the moon shown on the underside from the reflected light as it was also observed by moonlight of the sides and also backlighted as well. This craft was estimated to be traveling at 4000MPH and was a chunky &#34;V&#34; shape with a discernible thickness approx. equal to the width of the body legs. It was silent even though it passed directly overhead. The angle of the legs to each other was approx. 45 degrees with blunt ends to the legs. The apparent thickness of the legs-body was  substantially more than our B2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were moving north seemingly looking for something, about five of these around the area, this repeated around the the 3rd of July. When I called another family member to observe, it turned into a fireball, the other object hovered over trees, and one fixed into a position in the direction of the stars for over one hour and disappeared.  If follows with an event,not to be mentioned, occuring with other life experiences pertaining to this matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw motion out of the corner of my eye, looked and saw something like a very large star, but it kept growing, and was very blue, it got to be the size to a nickle at arms length, and as I snapped out of a daze starring at it and called to my friend, it faded away rather quickly and before he turned it was gone. Never seen nothing like it before...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Silent, no noise.  I could not distinguish a body to the craft, although I also could not say for certain there was not one.  It was difficult to tell, as it only lasted maybe less than 2 or 3 seconds.  Maybe less so. It was traveling away from me in the same direction I was looking.  As it disappeared (and not into the horizon, it just faded into nothing all of a sudden)  Where I had seen the lights, for an ever shorter duration there was the translucent distortion you would see when looking at hot asphalt from a distance or the after burner of a jet, etc...  Very strange. I would like to see it again.  Also, the lights were white, with a hint of yellow.  More of the yellow hint as they faded into the clear translucent-type effect I described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was july 1st, 2003. my brother was over his friend&#39;s house. he said he noticed a &#34;red oval object&#34; followed him ever since he noticed it floating over the dark sky. when he arrived home, he was filled with excitement, he yelled &#34;UFO, i saw a red ufo in the sky&#34; Then he told us to go outside to see it. We were in our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There it was, the object looked like a &#34;Red fire ball&#34; floating in the cloudless dark sky. it didn&#39;t made any sounds. thus it floated in a circular rotation. it did this for about 10 minutes. we walked toward a bit. the object seemed to move towards us, that&#39;s when we paniked. we went back inside the house. we were just watching it from our windows. The object didn&#39;t look like a &#34;red fire ball&#34; anymore. it looks rather more like a space ship. the object now looked like a flat pancake, but it looked as two flat bowls were on top on one another.it had many different lights. and different colors. the top lights were yellow, the spinned in a revolutionary way(circular motions)  the bottom lights were blinding yellow and white. the didn&#39;t blink or anything, they just were blinding all the time. Me, my brother and sister were amazed as we watched the craft hover a bit closer to our house. we NEVER saw anything like this. it couldn&#39;t be a plane or helicopter; planes do not hover around in circular motions for quite an amount of time, and helicopters tend to make sound.  anyway, the object was there; a flat pancake looking craft with a bunch of lights. the color of the craft was also metallic. As the craft got closer, we began to panic even more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me,my sister, and brother were nervous because it was floating closer and closer above our house. so we rushed and closed the windows fast, i was the one who closed the last window and i saw IT very very close above the house. it had so many lights from the bottom area of the craft. i stood still, then after i closed the last window, a Very LOUD humming sound was heard, the whole house shook for about 5 seconds, we froze , not moving, just looking at eachother&#39;s eyes. the whole house vibrating.. and a loud humming sound was heard, even our dog was still when this happened. objects also fell from the counter tops. After those 5 seconds, i looked outside the window and the UFO was gone. We never had this odd experience before. Me, my sister and brother questioned eachother with confusion. we asked eachother &#34;what the hell just happened? did you hear and feel that?&#34; i asked both of them &#34;did you hear that humming sound! you guys didn&#39;t move&#34;  we couldn&#39;t sleep that night, we kept all the lights on in case that weird Object returned, we were freaked out. we were just thinking of it. but this affected me more than it did to them..<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few days after that Ufo incident, i began having weird dreams. i had these &#34;episode-like dreams&#34;  everytime i would go to bed after this incident happened, i would be afraid of sleeping with the lights off, or even having the window of the bathroom open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, 3 nights after i saw the Ufo, i had this weird dream:  i layed in bed, after i fell asleep, i was blinded with a realy bright white light. i was laying on the surface. i woke up(in my dream) then i walked for white a long time, i felt fatigue and tired. the light was also foggy. then i noticed something pulled me into corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, after that happened, i woke up from my sleep. then i thought &#34;what the hell was that all about&#34;?  the next time,  i had another dream, but the weird thing about this was that, it continued. Ok this is what happened after i fell asleep the next night:  i was pulled into a corridor, i just felt something grabbing my arm, but couldn&#39;t see who it was. The corridor was rather foggy, the temperature felt warm, too. after that, something pushed me to the floor. the floor was warm and moist(something liked a jungle floor) i looked around the area, the area was steamy, foggy.. it had a bunch of wiring around. also it had many many lights and different corridors or tunnels. the area i was in was rather circular and large.  ( i assumed i was in some type of room) after this happened i woke up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, this was getting a bit disturbing, i told my mom about this.. but then again, most people dislike to believe in these things. so i didn&#39;t told anyone else because they wouldn&#39;t listen.. the next night, i didn&#39;t wanted to fall asleep, but i did.. this was the most frightful nightmare i ever had..the dream was the continuation of my dream i said above.. it resulted this:  i opened my eyes, in the same room, but i was laying on top of a surface. i couldn&#39;t move, my legs, arms were weakened. all i saw was a foggy place.. the top ceiling was wiring and lights. this was the same big circular room. All of the sudden, i felt a hand touching my arm. i began noticing sounds around me. then i saw these creatures, About 4 of them.. They were tall, thin, they had slanted blueish eyes(asian looking). they were purplish transparent, No hair or facial features, just a slit for a mouth and two small dots that made out their nose. but since it was foggy, i couldn&#39;t make them up more what they looked like. Ok, this is going to be more bizarre.. the creatures were communicating by making &#34;gargling&#34; - like noises.  then i thought &#34;what the hell is going on&#34;? i was a bit dazed. after i heard their communication, i again... woke up. the last thing i saw was a hand coming close to my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> that was the last dream i had about this.. after that i kept drawing things of my dream experience. i do not know anyone with this effect. my sister and brother were also witnesses of the UFO incident that we saw in July 1st, 2003. i asked them if they had nightmare of aliens or ufos or being abducted. they replied with a &#34;No&#34; i guess i was the only one affected. Also, i never met anyone who has gone through this. however, i did see people on television with this same experiences ; &#34;Seeing a UFO, then having ufo nightmares of being abducted in their dreams&#34; after seeing this in television i was shocked.. the t.v. program was called &#34;unexplained mysteries&#34;  that is all i can remember for now. please i would like to keep my self annonymous. I did NOT make this up, i didn&#39;t type all this for the &#34;hell of it&#34; and spent my time in it for nothing.. ALL that was typed above was my personal experience..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not have any fotographs of the craft i saw.. i just have sketches and drawings of the craft i saw in july 1st 2003 and sketches/drawings of the creatures i saw in my dreams.. thank you for reading and listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as i said above.. i want to keep my self Annonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were small from where I saw them and they were floating back and fourth very slowly. I kept yelling to my mother and she couldn&#39;t see them, but finally she was able to. They were very hard to keep track of from the distance they were at. I didn&#39;t have my camera with and I always carry it with me and I&#39;m still upset over it. From now on I&#39;m gonna keep the camera charged in the glove compartment. I don&#39;t know what they were, the only explainations that I can come up with is either a baloon or something not from here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

7/1/03 02:00|Yakima|WA|Oval|5 MINUTES|Butterly shaped rainbow UFO|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29591.html|448|ndxe200307| Butterly shaped rainbow UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an oval shaped object in the Northern sky around the height of the surrounding hills.  At first I thought it was coming from the Yakima Firing Center but after watching for about 30 seconds, started doubting that idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was oval in shape and pulsated rainbow colors around the oval shape.  It moved straight to the right, than straight down, back to the left, back straight up and than ro the right again.  What was unique about this was when the object moved, the rainbow colors that were pulsating around the oval shape, extended into what I can best describe as &#34;butterfly&#34; wings on both sides of the object.  It was very pretty to watch.  I could only see the rainbow colors in the &#34;butterfly&#34; wings when it moved, not when it was stationary.  I was watching my puppy who got me up and went back inside for a few minutes.  When I came back out it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I looked in the vicinity that I saw this object, wondering if one of the surrounding hills was there.  There were no hills, just blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As i went to look through my other bedroom window for a better view me and my brother both noticed it was moving up and down.It couldnt have been an airplane because it was hovering in place slightly moving in up and down directions and also sideways.It could also not be a helicopter because i would have herd some sort of noise from it because i live in a canyon and i could practically hear a car comming from miles away.It was making absalutely no sound what so ever. It also got very bright at points to were it was alomost white and the went back to its redish orange color and also while we were viewing the ufo i also seen what was a flash of light probably about a quarter mile down the road from were i live, it was like a flash of light like a strike of lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear still night so the light had my total attention. I watched it for about 1-2 minutes still driving when at a very high rate of speed suddently shot down at an angle to the ground and out of my view. I could still see the glow of the light still blinking in the horizen but not the object itself. I was in disbelief of what I had just seen when a jet flew right over my me from behind, I never saw him coming! The jet was so low it shook my truck and the flames from the afterburners were so clear! The jet turned off in the direction where the object had came down. I drove straight through Pecos and tried to find the jet or light again but could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

(under 18 at time no alcohol or nothing was present) One night we saw things that appeared to be shooting stars. There had been a meteor shower earlier that summer so we thought nothing of it, but when we started paying attention we noticed that then would not be going in straight lines. It could have easily been one UFO flying back and forth, but literally for hours we sat and watched it(them) we didn&#39;t think of getting a telescope or camra, because they moved fast and irratically in a zig zag pattern. And left a trail for 3 to maybe 5 seconds. At one point there had to be at least 3 of them at once, and we&#39;d see one easly every minute or 2. And come to think of it when I read you check list down there, its weird there were no planes around, considering I live in Moses Lake where there are military and Japanese passenger planes flying constantly thats quite odd even after dark especially in the summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
