I lived in an apartment house in New York City&#39;s Lower East Side.  A number of friends in the building had dropped in, and it seemed that a casual party was taking place.  It was a tiny apartment, and quickly filled up with cigarette smoke.  I suggested that we all go up to the roof to chat, where there was more oxygen available.  We all grabbed our drinks and smokes and paraded up three flights to the roof.  Everyone was talking at once, having a good time.  I noticed that the sky had a very dark, high overcast, and there were no stars visible at all.  In a few minutes, I saw that the moon had risen, and was near the horizon behind a little storm cloud with lightning going on in it, which was odd since no other clouds were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember nothing else until I became aware of the fact that all of the people I was with were silent, staring blankly at the rooftop, and I was the only one who seemed conscious. Then, all at once everyone began talking as if there had been no break in the conversation at all.  I saw that the moon was much higher, and on the opposite side of the sky, but that it still had the little storm around it, with lightning.  Suddenly everyone had to get to bed, even though we&#39;d only been there for a few minutes.  It was two AM when I got back to my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I recalled the odd appearance of the moon, so I checked a calendar with the Moon&#39;s phases, and it had been a New Moon, with no visible Moon at all.  Needless to say, the event left my eyebrows raised for quite some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again for your work at keeping this magnificent repository available for the sharing of all our strange sightings.  Reading about others&#39; experiences makes the strangeness seem a bit less frightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My brother came home from a date and laid out beside me and began to help me star gaze,after about half an hour he said what is that pointing north(we were laying heads to the east feet west)l looked and saw a flashing light moving across the sky about the speed of the space station, when the light was directly over us it stopped,flashed several times then traveled directly west then stopped and again sat there and flashed on and off a few times, then the light moved directly east crossed its own path and moved the same distance as it did west,east, the light stopped again flashed on and off,then moved back to its original path,sat and flashed then starting back on its path south at the same speed then began to speed up within seconds was going so fast it turned into a solid light and was gone.  l have never and will probably never see something go so fast!!!  l think about it quite often because l cant explain it maybe you can?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

WHEN IT GOT UP CLOSE I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING BUT A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT AND WHEN THE POWER WENT OUT THE LIGHT JUST SEEMED TO JUST HOVER STATIONERY FOR ABOUT A MINUTE.  IT THEN TOOK OFF FASTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN MOVE TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST.  THE GENERATOR OPERATOR&#39;S IMMEDIATELY RESTARTED THE GENERATORS AND I WENT INTO THE COMMAND CENTER AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO HOMESTEAD AIR FORCE BASE.

I do recall the event very clearly, but it is something that my family and I have never spoken of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, a couple of years ago I did ask my mother some things about that night, but she has no memory of it. There is really not a lot to tell about the actual sighting but I will do my best to explain my encounter. I will also mention facts I do remember to help substantiate my gaps in memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 6:30 pm when my family and I were going into Quincy,Il. We were coming from Fowler, N.E. of Quincy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove west down U.S. 24 to Neikamps corner where we turned South. We traveled south to Ellington Road where we turned and headed west again. We traveled about 200 feet west when the encounter began.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were going into Quincy to go to church, we were going to a revival meeting. This being said, helps me to establish the time and approximate date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The revival meetings  started at 7:00pm and the location of the encounter is about a 15 minute drive to the church. We were always early to the meetings as my dad was an usher and had duties before services would begin. This also helps me get a rough idea  of the year. I actively attended church with my family from about 1968 to 1972. I want to say the encounter was in 1970 but I can&#39;t jog my memory enough to state that as a fact.I do know we were riding in a  white 1964 Chevy station wagon. Since my father has died no one remembers when we owned that car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were heading west, just in front of the WGEM radio towers.  I was setting behind the driver looking south out the window.  The sky began to become very bright.  It was very dark out at 6:30 in the evening so it must have been late fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the sky brightened I became very afraid, I thought it was the end of the world.  I remember looking to the sky to see something but there was nothing to see.  I then turned and looked north towards the radio tower and saw the brightest blue white light I have ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I can remember we were headed south on Columbus road, just coming up to the KHQA radio tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one said a word about anything, we just kept going towards Quincy.  We arrived at 16th and Locust in Quincy, without ever talking about the light.  Everything looked normal at church when we arrived.  I could see the people shaking hands and greeting each other as they always do.  We got out of the car and went in and began to socialise as usual when we found out we were late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The services were over and everyone was going home. This would make the time be around 9:30 or 10:00, services always lasted that long, or even later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked for a bit and then returned home. We missed the whole church service, went back home and never said one word to one another about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have often wondered over the past 38 years or so what happened. Roughly 3 hours of time are gone and not one of us has said anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have mentioned it to friends and family a few times, but I have never offered an explanation. I have no idea what happened in the 3 hours but I do know I takes less than 5 minutes to drive from the WGEM towers to the KHQA tower. These towers may be gone now I haven&#39;t lived in Illinois for about 20 years now.<n>

The curauins were pulled because it was dark out and all the lights were on inside the house.   While we were all inside the kitchen we felt and heard a low sounding rumble as if there were a train moving past the house at a slow steady speed. when we looked towards our windows there appeared to be a bright light that was illuminating thru all the windows almost like sunshine during the day. we moved outside thru the front door and when we got outside there was no noise, no vibration from the rumbling we were hearing inside.  Everything outside seemed extremely calm and still and we looked above our heads and there was a bright white light that was above us approximitly 20 to 30 feet.  Couldnt tell the shape of UfO because it was so big we counldnt see the edges of it. It seemed to be there for about 5 minutes then took off with no sound and was so quick it was li! ke it was just there and gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

At some point I recall they decended and acended very quickly. The morning was overcast, so when the blue sky appeared the UFO&#39;s moved quickly.

A set of lights with 3 on one side and two on the other in a chevron and with no sound. Exactly the same as the Pheonix sighting that I saw on TV here in england 2 nights ago. At last I thought the same as i saw. We were told a day after that it was a sattelite re entering i dont think so a formation and no tails.

West Texas. Sheep country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a Air Force Top Secret Crypto (very high) security clearance at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A fellow male trainee and I along with my wife exited an apartment in San Angelo and were walking toward my car to go out to dinner. Goodfellow AFB is not too far from the apartment complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark, starry night. Big Texas sky, flat horizon country. No clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were walking to the car, we all three looked over our shoulder at the same time and saw up in the sky near the high cloud level (no clouds), three bright white plasma craft in formation (the size of .5 inch each) moving rapidly across the sky. They stopped allowed us to gaze on them and then shot perpendicular straight up in the sky in a split second (extremely high rate of speed) and disappeared in the atomosphere. We all looked at each other and our thoughts were &#34;What was that?&#34;  In addition, what I remember the most was the objects had a kind of intelligence. Thought intelligence. As if they wanted us to turn around and see them. Then, when we did they took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Goodfellow AFB is not an aircraft base. It is a NSA (and military intelligence) training center. So, there were no Air Force jet aircraft in the vicinity no matter what time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other airman I was with became a Baptist Minister and to this day denies he ever saw anything (against his religion). My wife (ex-wife) married again and lives in Washinton State.

St. Mary’s of the lake in Lake County, IL.  We would take drives during the fall to look at the flowers &amp; foliage of this beautiful place that had scenic drives over brick bridges surrounded by large trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out the side window from the backseat of the automobile.  I was a very observant young person (I still am today) as I loved nature and would spend hours gazing and looking for any and all signs of wildlife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly above the tree line to my right I saw an object rise up from the trees.  It was disk shaped and eggshell color with what appeared to be small windows running circular on the upper portion of the saucer.  So there was an upper small section as well as the larger disk on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my eye and will remain with me is the way this object moved.  It sort of floated up at a 45-degree angle and hovered for a second or two before descending back to earth at the same degree and speed.  I had never before seen or have since seen anything move the way this saucer moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my parents and they believed me and we actually went looking for it.  However, it was difficult to gauge exactly where this was in proportion to where we were at the time.  Years later I saw this same saucer shape depicted in a small-scale model at the store that was built based upon a description from a lieutenant in the U.S. armed forces.  I wish I had purchased that model.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was September 7, 1970. 11:10 p.m. I was about to start my senior year in high school.  We lived on a main highway just up from a very bad intersection where there were always accidents.  (Seven miles south of Pittsburgh, PA.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:10 p.m. that night I was leaving one upstairs room to go into the bathroom when I noticed a light somewhat flickering on the sheer draperies.  I assumed it was another accident and the lights of a tow truck.  I walked to the window to look down at the intersection and saw nothing.  I realized the light was coming from above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a huge circular metal craft with lights on the bottom.  It silently was hovering over my side yard at a slight angle so that I could only see the bottom of it.  It was just above the poplar tree tops along the border of our property.  I got a very close up look at it.  The bottom was slightly convex and a matte colored dark metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were what looked like semi opaque tempered glass panels on the bottom.  Similar to a bathroom window.  You can see light but glass is not transparent.  Those panels are where the amber lights emanated.  They were on constantly but yet had a slight pulsating flicker to them.  For some reason, although I don&#39;t know why, I thought it was due to the power source of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it for approximately 15 seconds as it hovered silently.  Then, faster than I could blink my eyes, it took off at a 45 degree angle to the west.  I was so terrified and will never forget what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending a drawing explaining what it looked like to the email listed on your website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you call me I can give you exact locations and any other info you might want.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it has any relevance I don&#39;t know, but I am was not very far from Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory.<n>

I saw a shiny, saucer-shaped object sitting in the sky. Then, a few seconds later, two more of these objects came cruising slowly to where the first one was apparently waiting because a few seconds later, the first one suddenly shot away northward in a zigzagging motion that took two or three really quick direction changes. Then it would come to a dead, sudden stop, and just sit there while the two following came slowly over to where it was, but in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them do this about 4 times, moving north across Southern California, toward and past Pasadena. I watched approximately 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
